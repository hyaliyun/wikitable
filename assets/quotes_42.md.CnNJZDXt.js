The company started trading in November 2014 and has its offices in London. History Unbolted was set up by Ashwin Parmeswaran and Rito Haldar with an aim to make short-term borrowing transparent, affordable and convenient for consumers and small business owners, by using their high-value personal assets to access low-cost loans. It raised seed funding in July 2014 prior to its public launch in November 2014. Unbolted offers short-term loans of various types: * 'Buy now, pay later' loans which allow auction participants at various partner sites (such as Forum Auctions) to bid on items without having the upfront cash. * Sale advance loans, which allow vendors to receive up to half of their auction reserve before the auction takes place. * Personal asset bridge loans and working capital loans offered to watch dealers. Unbolted previously offered 'Gold Trust' loans, which helped to protect lenders from gold price volatility. When issuing these loans, Unbolted used to purchase exchange-traded derivatives (ETF put options) that paid off in the event that gold prices fell. When new FCA regulations came into place in December 2019, Unbolted ended Gold Trust protection for any new gold/precious metal loans.

A Polish Jew, she emigrated to Denmark in 1969. In 1991, she published her first collection of poems Min mors datter (My Mother's Daughter). Biography Katz was born into a Jewish family in Krakow in 1939. Most of her relatives died in concentration camps but she was smuggled out of a Polish workers camp to live with a Polish couple she called her \\"war parents\\" who brought her up as a Catholic. After the war, she lived with her mother who had survived imprisonment in various concentration camps. After studying sociology and literature at Krakow University, Katz worked as a literary critic in the 1960s. In 1969, she emigrated to Denmark with her mother during the period of antisemitism after the Six-Day War in 1967 when the Soviet Union sided with the Arabs. For the next 13 years, she worked at the Royal Danish Library as a translator from Polish. She was 52 when she published Min moders datter (1991), her first poetry collection. Written in Danish, the work expressed her guilt at being one of her family's few survivors as well as the difficult relationship she had with her mother, abandoning her country and her mother tongue. In 1993, she published her biographical novel Mit liv som barbar (My Life as a Barbarian), describing her life until her mother's death in 1987. It concludes with the words: \\"Life is a story. But only the luckiest of us are able to write it up.\\" In 2006, she published another poetry collection Min spaltede tunge (My Split Tongue, 2006) and in 2009 the novel L√¶ngsel pa bestilling (Longing to Order), a romance about a Jewish girl from Denmark who meets Sammy on a trip to Israel. In 2008, she wrote another collection of poems, this time in Polish: Pisane po polsku. She translated it into Danish herself as Skrevet p√• polsk (Written in Polish). It contains reflections on her childhood in Poland during the holocaust, many of them sorrowfully negative: \\"Hvor lang er ikke denne liste/ af uindbudne g√¶ster/ til mit ikke- bryllup?\\" (How long is then this list/ of uninvited guests/ to my non- wedding?) All in all, her works combine sadness with humour. In particular, her short story collection Den glade j√∏dinde og andre historier (The Merry Jewess and Other Stories, 1998) contrasts Jewish melancholy with surreal magic realism and the grotesque. Awards In 1998, she received the Beatrice Award for her oeuvre from the Danish Academy.

The episode aired on March 2, 2015, on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. Plot Two police officers arrive at Chuck's house after his neighbor calls 911 to report the stolen newspaper. Chuck refuses to open the door because of his electromagnetic hypersensitivity. One officer walks around to the basement door, where he finds that the electric lines to the circuit breaker panel have been cut, and there are several empty camping fuel cans from Chuck's lanterns and cook stove laying about. Combining this with Chuck's ramblings about probable cause case law, the two officers mistakenly conclude that Chuck is producing methamphetamine, kick down his front door, and taser him. Tycoon Big Ricky Sipes offers Jimmy $1 million in cash to help him secede from the United States. Jimmy's excitement at the windfall quickly dissipates when the wealthy eccentric reveals he plans to pay him using his custom printed currency. He visits another prospective client, Roland Jaycocks, who asks him to help patent an invention called \\"Tony the Toilet Buddy\\", a training toilet that plays recordings of what are supposed to be encouraging phrases to children as they use it. All the phrases are sexual innuendos and when Jimmy points this out, an incensed Roland chases him out of the house. Finally, Jimmy visits Mrs. Strauss, an elderly woman who collects porcelain Hummel figurines, one of which is a rare and valuable alpine shepherd boy. He assists her with estate planning, which consists mostly of allocating her Hummels to various friends and relatives. Mrs. Strauss finds Jimmy's personality charming, and he offers to take half his fee in advance and half after the will is completed, but she pays the full amount upfront in cash. That evening, Jimmy entertains Kim with tales of his eventful day. With two wills and a living trust to his credit, she suggests a career in elder law. Jimmy considers, but is interrupted when Kim takes a call from Howard, who tells her Chuck is in the hospital. In Chuck's hospital room, Jimmy and Kim explain Chuck's condition to a skeptical doctor. She proves Chuck's electromagnetic hypersensitivity is not genuine by turning on the bed's control panel without Chuck noticing. She recommends Chuck be committed to a mental institution, but Chuck wants to go home. Jimmy initially decides to comply with Chuck's wishes, but Howard arrives and tells Jimmy he convinced the DA to make sure Chuck is not committed. Jimmy believes Howard is putting the firm's needs ahead of Chuck's, knowing that if Chuck is committed, Jimmy will become his guardian and have authority to accept HHM's severance offer on Chuck's behalf. Although he scares Howard by threatening to commit Chuck, severing Howard's connection to his \\"cash cow\\", Jimmy tells Kim he is not really going to do it, only saying so to irritate Howard. Jimmy leaves the hospital with Chuck and brings him home. At Chuck's house, Jimmy discovers that Chuck has learned of his billboard rescue. Jimmy promises Chuck that he will play by the rules going forward, but Chuck is skeptical. After mimicking Andy Griffith's clothing and mannerisms from Matlock, Jimmy promotes his new specialty at a nursing home by printing a slogan on the bottom of Jell-O containers: \\"Need a will? Call McGill.\\" Exiting the courthouse parking lot, Jimmy gives Mike a business card that has the same slogan printed on it. After his shift, Mike parks outside a woman's house. She comes out of the house, gets in her car, and stares at Mike uncomfortably for several moments before they each drive away in opposite directions. At his home, Mike is visited by several police officers.

Construction began in 1807, during a period of extensive redevelopment in the town, driven by the Market House Society and the Member of Parliament Sir Benjamin Hammet. Lined on the eastern side by a Georgian terrace, the street follows a shallow crescent shape, broken in the middle by Crescent Way and a bit further south by St George's Place. It links Upper High Street, at its southern end, with Park Street and Tower Street to the north. On the western side, Somerset County Council have their offices in the County Hall, erected in 1935, and extended in the 1960s. The Georgian terrace, the Masonic Hall, and the County Hall are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as listed buildings. History During the 17th and 18th centuries Taunton suffered, first due to the Civil War (1642‚Äì1651), during which two thirds of the town was burnt down, and then the decline of the cloth industry upon which the town's economy relied. In the late 18th century, the Taunton Market House Society formed with the aim of improving Taunton town centre, most notably the Market House. Benjamin Hammet, a prominent member of the society, was elected as a Member of Parliament for Taunton in 1782, and tried to start clearing the slums in the town centre. In 1770, the old Market House was knocked down and replaced, and less than ten years later, Hammet Street was built, to connect the Market square with the Church of St Mary Magdalene. The Crescent formed part of Hammet's plan for Taunton. It was built to the north of Upper High Street, in what was known at the time as Paul's Field. It follows a shallow crescent shape, which Nikolaus Pevsner notes is \\"hardly noticeable\\". Although Hammet died in 1800, the foundation stone was placed in 1807 by William Kinglake, as part of a ceremony that was attended by \\"an immense number of persons.\\" The Monthly Magazine noted that the street was intended to add to the \\"ornament, respectability, and advantage\\" of Taunton, while the Taunton Courier reported that the houses were intended for \\"genteel families\\". When the street was built, each end featured a cottage with high iron gates which limited traffic to residents and their visitors. The footpaths were less restricted, but featured \\"three or four posts between which a corpulent person had difficulty in squeezing.\\" These gates and posts have since been removed. The Crescent comprised a terrace of houses along the street's eastern side; the other side was not built on and was eventually converted into parkland. In 1822, a Catholic chapel, known as St George's Chapel was built at the southern-end of the terrace, the first Catholic church built in Taunton since the Reformation. The Catholic congregation moved out to a larger church in 1878 and the chapel was bought by the Freemasons, who converted it into a Masonic Lodge. In 1935, County Hall was built on the open side of The Crescent, providing Somerset County Council with more space than their previous offices at Shire Hall. Early plans for further buildings at the site did not come to fruition, but County Hall was extended in the 1960s to cover most of the open land in front of The Crescent. Despite the work done by Hammet, the area between The Crescent and the High Street was still considered a slum until it was redeveloped around the Second World War. During this period, the General Post Office (GPO) built \\"Telephone House\\", a telephone exchange and office building, replacing the houses in the middle of the terrace. Architecture The Masonic Hall, which was originally built as a Catholic chapel On the eastern side of The Crescent, a Georgian terrace was erected in 1807. Built of \\"pinkish-brown\\" brick, each house is of three- storeys plus a basement, and is two windows across. The houses are split by plain pilasters and topped with hipped slate roofs. While the first and second storey windows are rectangular, those on the ground floor are round-headed, as are the doorways. The first floor windows have small, circular segmental balconies. A variety of six- and eight-panel doors are reached by climbing a small flight of steps, and the entire terrace is fronted with railings. This terrace forms two separate listed building designations from Historic England; numbers 1‚Äì11 and 15‚Äì20, both of which are Grade II* listed. The terrace was later split, and is intersected by Crescent Way, which leads to the Crescent car park. On the southern side of Crescent Way, the northern end of the terrace formed by numbers 15‚Äì20, is Exchange House, the former GPO Telephone House. According to Pevsner, this building breaks the modesty of the street, with \\"its thick-set Tuscan porch\\". At the southern end of the same terrace is the Masonic Hall, another Grade II* listed building, which forms the end of the terrace, and features a series of prominent Ionic pilasters along the front and southern end. A further terrace to the south of the Masonic Hall is split from the hall by St George's Place. It is formed of numbers 21 to 23 The Crescent, and number 42 Upper High Street. The terrace forms two listed building designations, both Grade II. Numbers 21 and 22 The Crescent are two- storey roughcast houses, each spanning three windows. The doorways are round- headed, and are flanked by ground floor bay windows. Number 23 forms the back of 42 Upper High Street, and is a two-storey red brick building. On the western side, the first part of the County Hall was built in 1935, and is known as \\"A Block\\". It was designed by Vincent Harris, and is Neo-Georgian. It is a three storey, built out of red and buff-coloured bricks forming an English bond, with Portland stone dressings. The central section is curved, with wings at 45 degrees to the formed main entrance. The ground-floor is fronted with ashlar, and has three round arches, the middle one of which forms a doorway. The doorway is topped by an engraved coat of arms in the tympanum. The central block spans nine windows, while each wing has a prominent window at the end, framed by an aedicule. The first and second floors of the wings feature eleven sash windows. An extension was made to the south of the building in the 1960s. The original \\"A Block\\" is designated as a Grade II listed building.

The Nazis seized nearly 3,500 items from the Vienna Rothschilds, many intended for Adolf Hitler's planned F√ºhrermuseum that would have been located in the Austrian city of Linz had it been built. The looted items were stored in the Austrian salt mines of Altaussee where they were discovered by the Allies after the war. In order to export the bulk of the collection to the United States, where Clarice de Rothschild then lived, she was required to donate around 250 items to the Austrian government. These items were not recovered by the family until a change in Austrian law in 1999, long after Alphonse and Clarice de Rothschild had died. Many of the recovered items were then sold at auction in London in a sale that realised a record at that time of over ¬£57m. The items donated to the Boston museum come mainly from the items recovered in 1999 that were not sold because they had particular family meaning. The jewellery included in the donation was never in Nazi hands because Clarice de Rothschild and her husband had been in London at the time of the Anschluss and she had had the jewellery with her.\\"Nazi-looted Rothschild art goes to MFA.\\" Malcolm Gay, The Boston Globe, 23 February 2015.

Sir Cahir O'Doherty was a traditional supporter of the Crown whose treatment at the hands of local officials had led him to launch a rebellion in which he had seized the garrison town of Derry, killing his enemy George Paulet. O'Doherty raised local forces and possibly hoped to negotiate an agreement with the government as had been common with leaders of previous rebellions.McCavitt p.135-42 Newgate, Dublin. 1608. Displaying the heads of Irish rebels Cahir O'Doherty (right) and his foster father Felim Riabhach McDavitt (left). However, the Viceroy in Dublin, Arthur Chichester, responded quickly and despatched reinforcements to the area under Richard Wingfield. They were a mixture of professional soldiers of the Royal Irish Army and Gaelic warriors allied to the government. They met the rebels at Kilmacrennan and O'Doherty was a killed by a musket shot to the head. His troops' morale collapsed and they fled the field. A ¬£500 bounty had been placed on O'Doherty and, while a number of outlandish legends exist about the fate of his severed head, a reward was given to an infantry soldier John Trendor by the Dublin government.McCavitt p.146 With O'Doherty's death, the rebellion quickly collapsed, the final forces retreating to Tory Island, where they were successfully besieged.

It was co-founded by Kenny Eng and originally set up as the sales arm of Nyee Phoe Flower Garden. The three divisions under the NPG are Nyee Phoe Flower Garden, Petals & Leaves and Gardenasia. History In 2001, Gardenasia was co-founded by Kenny Eng under their parent company, Nyee Phoe Group (NPG). In its initial years, NPG started out with Nyee Phoe Flower Garden, when Eng's great-grandfather, Eng Hock Lai, left China for Singapore in 1911. Eng Hock Lai started a nursery in Singapore as he had a horticulture background back in his hometown. Under the leadership of Kenny Eng's father and uncle, Nyee Phoe Flower Garden expanded to provide landscaping services in 1968. They also diversified to provide a line of gardening products in the 1970s to 1980s. In 1980, NPG further diversified their business by launching their creative floral services division, Petal & Leaves. In 1997, Nyee Phoe Flower Garden‚Äôs government leases were not renewed and they were removed from their sites in Jalan Kayu and Bukit Panjang. Subsequently, they moved to a 2 hectare plot of land along Neo Tiew Crescent. At its new site, the business faced financial difficulties because of its remote location. Kenny Eng and his family kept Nyee Phoe Flower Garden afloat by staging roadshows and worked on landscaping projects recommended by clients. The company eventually diversified to include Gardenasia as the ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù division of NPG. Company Profile Gardenasia provides services which include farmstays, an on-site bistro, events management and educational programs. It provides eco-themed workshops and team-building activities. Gardenasia also added corporate team-building workshops in 2009. Gardenasiakids provides ‚ÄúEdutainment‚Äù programmes designed for children and youths to educate them about the environment. The ‚ÄúEdutainment‚Äù programmes under Gardenasiakids are targeted at pre-schoolers, primary and secondary school students. Gardenasiakids is represented by two characters‚Äì Morchoo and Titoy. Notable Projects Gardenasia has collaborated with various parties to organise social responsibility projects: * The Living! Project: iLight Marina Bay, Singapore (2010 and 2014) The Living! Project was initiated by Gardenasia‚Äôs founder Kenny Eng, Allan Lim, and sculptor Sun Yu-Li. For iLight Marina Bay 2010, they conceived the idea for a 5.8m tall stainless steel sculpture called ‚Äú'In Celebration.‚Äù In collaboration with People's Association Singapore, trainers and volunteers created plastic art pieces using plastic bottles and cups to build the sculpture. The sculpture was awarded ‚ÄúMost Popular Artwork‚Äù at this event. The sculpture was the first Asian artwork to be showcased at the F√™te des Lumi√®res(Festival of Lights) in Lyon, France. In 2014, The Living! Project contributed again at iLight Marina Bay with their installation called ‚ÄúThe Wishing! Tree.‚Äù *ComArt (Community Art) at Changi City Point In collaboration with Frasers Centrepoint Ltd, Ascendas Ltd and Christian Outreach to the Handicapped, local students created a 12m long chandelier made up of recycled bottles.

It was released on 10 July 2015, and features the team and driver line-ups from the 2015 season, including the Aut√≥dromo Hermanos Rodr√≠guez. It also features all the drivers, cars and circuits from the 2014 season (i.e. Caterham F1, and the Hockenheimring, which was removed from the calendar). It is the last game from Codemasters branded under the Codemasters Racing label and first title in the F1 series released for eighth generation consoles. Gameplay The game runs on an all-new version of the EGO game engine, providing a large number of improvements to the game's physics models. It features an all-new \\"Pro Season\\" mode that is more challenging than the normal gameplay because there is no HUD and no assist, which includes traction, ABS, and transmission, with the hardest level possible. The game is also compatible with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One's voice recognition software, allowing players to talk to their race engineers during the race and ask for race information, weather updates, and tyre status, and even request a change of tyres or wing. The game was also noted for the fact that the AI would often wreck or make mistakes. This drew both praise and criticism from game critics. Development and release Unlike previous Codemasters F1 games, which have been released in September-October, F1 2015 was released in July 2015. The previous game F1 2014 was regarded as more of a \\"filler\\" game until the 2015 game was released. This game is made almost completely from scratch after Codemasters decided to base this version on an entirely new game engine, said to dramatically improve both the screen quality and the AI's abilities. On 15 February 2015, screenshots of internal letters regarding the development of the video game were leaked onto the Internet via Facebook. Codemasters later confirmed they were indeed legitimate screenshots and had been leaked from a \\"confidential internal development email.\\" On May 22, 2015, Codemasters released a teaser trailer, pushing back the release date from June 12, 2015 to July 10, 2015 for Europe and Australia, July 21 for North America, and July 24 for Brazil. Despite this, the PC version was released on July 9 worldwide through the Steam platform. Reception The final product received a mixed reception with the PlayStation 4 version scoring 65 out of 100 on the review aggregator site Metacritic and 65.02% on GameRankings. IGN praised the graphics and control system, but criticised the game modes, and AI. Metro liked the weather effects, and said the game held its own in the genre. The version released for PC received more mixed reception after release, scoring 61 of 100 from critics according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviews on GameRankings yielded a rating of 58.17%. The game got to number one in the Chart-Track sales chart.

It is an adaptation of the 1868 novel In Search of the Castaways by Jules Verne. The film was popular on its release, and was followed in 1941 by another Verne adaptation Mysterious Island.Dobrenko & Balina p.242-243 In the 1860s, two Scottish children go on a global search for their missing father, the sailor Captain Grant. Plot The crew of the Duncan yacht belonging to Lord Glenarvan, catches a shark in the waters of Scotland. When cutting the carcass, a bottle is found inside the fish, in which a request for assistance is written in three languages from a victim of a shipwreck. The documents have been strongly spoiled by water, however they manage to decipher that Captain Grant's ship has crashed on the 37th degree south latitude. It is not possible to determine the longitude of the crash site. Glenarvan goes to London to organize a rescue mission, but the government denies him, citing the vagueness and inadequacy of information. The implicit cause of the rejection was Captain Grant being a Scottish patriot who dreamed of independence for Scotland. Moreover, the main purpose of his voyage was to establish Nova Scotia. During the absence of the Lord, Captain Grant's children, son and daughter came to the boat in the hope to learn something about their father. When Glenarvan returns home, his wife persuades him to go in search of the captain on the Duncan. The travelers move by land and sea, cross Patagonia by the 37th parallel, visit the islands of Tristan da Cunha, and Amsterdam, pass by the south-eastern Australia and New Zealand. Having experienced many dangerous adventures, they find Captain Grant on the small island of Tabor, which is also located at the 37¬∞ south latitude.

It is one of the ten categories of causation listed by Vasubandhu in his MadhyƒÅnta-VibhƒÅga-BhƒÅ≈õya. In the Sanskrit texts, it is used in the PrƒÅti≈õƒÅkhyas that introduce phonic substitutions by mentioning the substituted unit in the nominative ending and the substitute in the accusative ending. According to the SadvidyƒÅ (the science of being) of UddƒÅlaka ƒÄruni, dualistically all things that exist are differentiations, vikƒÅras (transformations) of sat, the primordial being, who is the universal substrate; all things can be identified on account of nƒÅmar≈´pa (distinct name and form). Purusha (Brahman) created all these multi-folds of Nature by transforming himself. This is the same as the Samkhya theory of causation, Satkaryavada, which is based on the premise that the effect is existent in the cause, and the original cause is Prak·πõti composed of three gunas which are tendencies and modes of operation. Prakrti is closely associated with the concept of Maya within Vedic scripture. The world is seen to be ever-evolving because vikƒÅra (modification) is its svabhƒÅva (nature); origination and dissolution are two vikƒÅras, and causal efficiency is the power to initiate change. A change (vikƒÅra) can take place only when there is action. Vivartavada of Advaita Vedanta involves apparent vikƒÅra or modification, a mere illusion. In Ayurveda, diseases produced by one dosha are known as nanatmaja-vikƒÅra, those produced by more than one dosha are known as samanyaja-vikƒÅra; these are not vyƒÅdhi-rogas but distinct and treatable disorders. KƒÅma (lust), Krodha (anger), Lobha (greed), Moha (deep emotional attachment, stupidity), MƒÅtsarya (envy) and MadƒÅ (pride, wantonness) are the vikƒÅras of the mind mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita.

He was one of the first British artists to use Tachist or action painting techniques.Frank Avray Wilson biography. Early life Wilson was born in Vacoas, Mauritius, in 1914, the son of Albert James Wilson, a sugar manufacturer, by his marriage to Anna Avray. He was educated at Brighton College and St John's College, Cambridge, where he took a degree in biology, before studying art in Paris and Norway.\\"WILSON, Frank (Avray)\\" in Contemporary Authors (1975), p. 679 Career Inspired by both American Abstract Expressionism and French Tachisme, Avray Wilson produced amongst the most dynamic abstracts during the post-war period in Britain. His work ranged from spiky linear compositions, through others more spare and geometric towards a mature style that comprised images both disciplined and energetic. Critic Peter Davies described this contrast as ‚Äòa meaningful, if tense, dichotomy between structure on the one hand and what Avray Wilson termed \\"Vitalist\\" or impulsive free form on the other‚Äô, whilst Cathy Courtney characterised Avray Wilson‚Äôs paintings as ‚Äòarticulating something sensed but not fully seen‚Äô. Seeking to 'create a synthetic vitality, more living than life, the means of supplying our anti-vital, anti-human society with intense symbols', Avray Wilson's scientific background was of key importance in understanding his approach to painting, which he expounded in several books. The first London showing of his work was in 1951 at The Redfern Gallery's Summer Exhibition. In 1953, Wilson met Denis Bowen and they formed the New Vision Group then, in 1956, the New Vision Centre Gallery, a showplace for abstract and other modern art near Marble Arch in central London.Tate Gallery websiteCentre for the Aesthtic revolution website Avray Wilson had his first solo show at the Obelisk Gallery in 1954, before being included in the British Council's influential La Peinture Anglaise Contemporain, which toured in France and Switzerland. He also took part in the New York Foundation's New Trends in British Painting in Rome in 1957 and was shortlisted for the John Moore's prize exhibition in Liverpool in 1959. He later showed at Leicester Galleries, the Royal Academy of Arts and Austin/Desmond Fine Art amongst others. He was represented for many years by the Redfern Gallery and gained a reputation in Europe, notably in Belgium and in France where he also exhibited. Major retrospectives were held by the Paisnel Gallery in 2011 and by the Whitford Fine Art Gallery in 2016 and 2018. Avray Wilson‚Äôs work is held in the United States by the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburg and Cleveland Museum of Art in Ohio among others. His work can also be found in Australia in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Public collections in the UK include the Arts Council, the British Museum and galleries in Durham, Leeds, Leicester, Swansea and Wakefield. Private life Avray Wilson married Higford Eckbo, a Norwegian, on 28 April 1936, and they had four children: Wendy-Ann, Raymond, Jason, and Norman. His daughter Wendy-Ann went on to marry an American architect, Thomas J. Holzbog, and is the mother of Arabella Holzbog.HOLZBOG, THOMAS JERALD, in The New York Times dated 28 September 2008.

The last of her novels drawing directly on her personal experiences, it focuses on an august but shabby London stage school for children, The Temple. Fitzgerald had herself been a general studies teacher at the Italia Conti stage school. The school in the novel is known as Freddie's after its elderly principal Freddie Wentworth, a character partly based on that of the impresario Lilian Baylis. The book received mixed reviews on its first UK publication, and on its 1985 appearance in the US. Plot The novel is set in Central London, in 1963. The Temple stage school (often known as Freddie‚Äôs) has been owned and run on traditional lines by its principal Freddie Wentworth for 40 years. An august but shabby institution, it offers training in Shakespearean and other stage drama to child actors, deliberately eschewing more profitable types of work such as TV, film and modelling. In spite of pressure to modernise from her solicitor brother, and from Joey Blatt, an intending investor, Freddie prefers to beg or borrow anything she needs from the local theatre community, relying on her reputation and charm. She spends as little as she possibly can on staff, engaging just two temporary general studies teachers for the students: Hannah Graves and Pierce Carroll. Hannah comes from a Catholic Northern Ireland background, and has taken the role as an entree into her much-loved theatre world. Carroll, about 10 years older, is from a repressive Protestant background; he has no interest in the theatre, and has taken the post merely because he can get no other. The teachers see a lot of each other during their long working hours, and Caroll becomes attracted to Hannah. Realising his incompetence at teaching, as in everything else, Carroll's attraction turns into unhealthy infatuation and after Hannah out of pity offers him sex she finds him assuming that marriage will follow. Hannah, however, has taken up with ‚ÄòBoney‚Äô Lewis, an older professional actor who is appearing in a West End production of Shakespeare's King John. Freddie‚Äôs is to provide two child actors who will play the young Prince Arthur in King John. Mattie Stewart will take the part at the start of the run, handing over to Jonathan Kemp later. Although a competent actor, Mattie struggles in the role, and his fear of heights makes it particularly difficult for him to be convincing in the scene in which he has to jump from the castle battlements to his death. Jonathan is the more naturally talented actor, and realises that if the scene is to be realistic he will have to practise the jump repeatedly. In the novel's climax, Jonathan practises his jumps alone in the snowy darkness from a high wall that surrounds the school‚Äôs brick-paved back yard, after he has been accidentally locked into it after-hours. At the same time, Freddie has gone out to dine for the first time in many years, having at last decided to accept Joey Blatt‚Äôs offer to invest. She informs him of her intended decision, but when he confides how personally moving he finds Mattie's acting she angrily attacks him for having no taste. The investment remains unresolved. Meanwhile, Jonathan‚Äôs fate is also left unclear, the novel ending as he continues to climb and jump ‚Äúagain and again and again into the darkness‚Äù. Principal characters * Frieda (‚ÄòFreddie‚Äô) Wentworth: aged 73, principal and owner of The Temple stage school in Central London * Hilary (‚ÄòThe Bluebell‚Äô) Blewett: Freddie's assistant * Unwin: Freddie's accountant * Hannah Graves: aged 20, general studies teacher; from a Catholic Northern Ireland family * Pierce Carroll: aged about 30, general studies teacher; from a Protestant Northern Ireland family * Matthew (‚ÄòMattie‚Äô) Stewart: 11-year-old student * Jonathan Kemp: 9-year-old student; a naturally gifted actor * James Wentworth: Freddie's brother, a solicitor * Joey Blatt: business acquaintance of Mattie's father * ‚ÄòBoney‚Äô Lewis: actor, aged 43 * Ed Voysey: director of King John.  Background  Fitzgerald centred the book on the experiences of her first teaching job, at the Italia Conti stage school in Clapham, London, where she taught general subjects to aspiring child actors. The school was at the time located in a large shabby Edwardian house, with the \\"academic department\\" being squeezed into four tiny offices on the top floor. Fitzgerald often went out to theatres with her books to provide backstage tutoring for those children who were in work. Fitzgerald‚Äôs biographer Hermione Lee called the character of Freddie \\"partly just a huge joke, a female Falstaff, a vast, shambolic, sedentary creature frowsting in her smelly, shabby, crimson lair\\". One of her inspiration was Lilian Baylis, perhaps from Violet May's Tribute to a Lady of 1975. At Freddie's was the last of Fitzgerald's novels to draw closely on her own personal experiences, before she embarked on her so-called 'historical novels'.  Critical reception  Critical reception was mixed. Writing in The Times, Flora Casement held At Freddie's to be \\"compelling and enjoyable\\" due to its original style and satisfactorily unpredictable ending. For The Sunday Times, Nicholas Shrimpton considered the book, when taken as a novel, to be a mere pot-pourri of nostalgic anecdote. But when taken as a historical document he thought it \\"a wonderful direct statement of the mixture of fascination and loathing with which the British continue to approach their theatre\\". Reviewing the first US publication in 1985 for The New York Times Book Review, Roxanna Robinson called the novel \\"well mannered, well written and instantly forgettable\\". And in The Washington Post, Anne Tyler said that the book, like a Hirschfeld caricature, aims solely to delineate, to depict. But it does that admirably well. Peter Wolfe in 2004 called the book \\"a novel whose dizzying moral ironies, smart pace, and deft set pieces give it a real grace\\". In her 2013 biography, Hermione Lee noted that the Theatre-Land of 1960s London is invoked with brio, with every small character part invoking the time between post-war and modern London. Asked in interviews about the book‚Äôs conclusion, Fitzgerald stated that she had meant Jonathan to die, or for readers to think that he would do so. Lee notes, however, that the novel does not tell us: comedy hovers on the edge of tragedy, with the balance kept perfectly unresolved.  Adaptations  It was announced in 2015 that David Nicholls had been commissioned to write a stage version for The Old Vic in London, but the play never appeared. In 2016, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast a dramatization, with Margaret Tyzack as Freddie.

Early life Phyu was born in Yangon, Myanmar on 5 August 1976 of Kachin mother and Burmese father. She is the eldest daughter of four siblings. She married to Patrick Kum Ja Lee and the couple has three children - two daughters and a son.Personal interview with May Sabai Phyu on September 29th, 2017, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA Career Phyu has a Bachelor of Science (Mathematics) degree from the University of Distance Education, Yangon, and a master's degree in Gender and Development Studies from Thailand's Asian Institute of Technology, where her thesis explored the gendered health impacts of the widely opposed Myitsone Dam construction in Kachin State, Myanmar. She has worked with UNDP as a Health Education Specialist, and with MSF-Holland in a variety of roles, including as a Health Education Supervisor and as Team Leader of the Counseling Program of HIV/AIDS Care and Support for the people living with HIV/AIDS. In 2008, she was instrumental in the forming the inter-agency Women's Protection Technical Working Group during the Cyclone Nargis response. The group was formed to alleviate hardships caused by the storm. Immediately, the storm changed household composition, leaving 14 out of every 100 households headed by women, the majority of these being widows. In addition, there was a sharp rise in the number of women engaging in sex for money, food or favors. As these households were vulnerable, both in terms of poverty and safety, the group immediately focused on methods to provide satisfactory housing, sex education, job training and support networks. Due to the group's efforts, eighteen months after the cyclone, conditions for these vulnerable women appeared to have returned to normalcy. After the disaster relief situation stabilized, the Working Group evolved into the Gender Equality Network, with May Sabai Phyu as Senior Coordinator. In 2012, this group assisted the government in the drafting of the National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women. The organization actively works for gender equality and the development of strategies to mitigate and prevent violence against women and girls. As Director of the https://www.facebook.com/genmyanmar/?ref=bookmarks Gender Equality Network, May Sabe Phyu carries out broad and high level advocacy on women's rights and gender equality issues, and oversees the implementation of the network's strategic initiatives to promote equitable national policy. She has played a major role in taking the network to a new stage of high-impact, evidence-based advocacy through the production of actionable research. Phyu has been instrumental in the network's development of two groundbreaking research projects: a qualitative research study on violence against women; and analysis of gender-based social practices and cultural norms within the Myanmar context. The completion of Behind the Silence: Violence Against Women and their Resilience marks a major step in advancing awareness of and action towards ending violence against women in Myanmar; this study is one of the first to systematically examine incidents of violence against women in the general population and to provide analysis on the different types of violence, its consequences, causes, and women's coping strategies. A second pioneering study on social and cultural practices and their impact on gender equality, examines historical narratives and contemporary cultural and religious views of women and men in Myanmar, including cultural changes and ways in which norms influence attitudes and behaviour. The study called Raising the Curtain: Cultural Norms, Social Practices and Gender Equality in Myanmar describes stereotypes and perceptions of women in the economy, education, sport, health, and the media. The report suggests ways in which specific sectors and broader movements can identify and shift pervasive cultural discourse and practices that pose barriers to women's empowerment. Through the network, May Sabe Phyu is currently co-coordinating a law reform process with various stakeholders to draft the country's first law on the prevention of violence against women by creating new criminal offenses for a variety of types of violence, civil remedies, and a regime for implementation of the law - including education and training programs, and new justice system and dispute resolution procedures. The proposed new law covers a number of issues not currently addressed, such as marital rape, incest, stalking, technology-related violence against women and the establishment of protection orders. Phyu has also played a leading role in opposing the highly controversial draft Protection of Race and Religion Bills, which was approved in 2015, and has major implications for women's rights in Myanmar. The proposed bill infringes freedom of religion and specifically targets minority groups. During her campaign against the bill, she was the victim of targeted hate phone calls to her personal phone, which was often up to 100 threatening and abusive calls a night.Wade. F. 2017. Myanmar's Enemy Within. Zed Books. p172  Hazards of engaging in activism in Myanmar  After hostilities between the Kachin Independence Organization and the Myanmar army resumed in 2012, May Sabe Phyu co-founded the Kachin Peace Network and Kachin Women Peace Network to raise awareness of the situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs). She advocates for inter-ethnic trust- building and women's involvement in the peace process to resolve this civil conflict. As the co-coordinator of both organizations, she organized the first public event to raise IDP issues in the mainstream media and has conducted media exposure trips to IDP camps. Following a peaceful demonstration calling for an end to civil war in Yangon, where freedom of association is still restricted, May Sabe Phyu was charged along with a co-organizer. Over the next 14 months, they made 120 appearances in six courts, ultimately paying 20,000 kyat (approximately US$20) fines in two courts, with charges dismissed under a presidential amnesty. On October 14, 2015, when she was abroad on an advocacy trip, Burmese Special Branch police arrested her husband Patrick Kum Jaa Lee at their home. He was sent to the country's notorious prison Insein without warrant. The authority accused him for mocking the country's commander-in- chief of the armed forces, Min Aung Hlaing, on Facebook. Unlike her, Patrick Kum Jaa Lee was a humanitarian worker who has no background of outspoken against Myanmar government and military campaigns or joining any types of activism. On January 22, 2016, the Court found him guilty of ‚Äúonline defamation‚Äù and sentenced him to six months in prison. It was an example of pressure and intimidation against activists who speak out against rising anti- Muslim and ultra-nationalist Buddhist movements in the country. As May Sabe Phyu is one of the most prominent Burmese civil society activists who have criticized the passage of four so-called \\"race and religion protection laws\\" passed by Parliament in 2015, and championed by the Buddhist monk-led Association for Protection of Race and Religion, or in Burmese, Ma Ba Tha, she and many other activists have been subject to death threats and being branded ‚Äòtraitors‚Äô by senior monks and their supporters. Her work to build peace among ethnic and religious minorities requires her to speak out against injustice, but her family is paying the price. She has spoken at various human rights workshops in Myanmar advocating for the rights of people with disabilities and the promotion and protection of human rights.  Awards  For her leadership in advocating for the full and equal rights of women and ethnic and religious minorities in Myanmar, May Sabe Phyu was honored with an International Women of Courage Award by the State Department of the United States of America in 2015. After Zin Mar Aung, she is the second woman from Burma to receive this award. Later, she was listed as one of the inspiring women leaders in changing Myanmar's society by many local and international news media. She has been also recognized as distinguished alumni by the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) Alumni Association (AITAA), Thailand in September 2015, where she attained her first master's degree in Gender and Development Studies. In 2018, she studied at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University (also known as Harvard Kennedy School and HKS) for a one-year Mid-Career Public Administration program as one of the Mason fellows.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global- opinions/wp/2018/06/05/burma-continues-to-brutalize-minorities-with-impunity References Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century Burmese women Category:21st-century Burmese women Category:Burmese people of Kachin descent Category:Asian Institute of Technology alumni Category:John F.

This was the 6th collaboration after De Mai tinh (2010), Long Ruoi (2011), Cuoi ngay keo lo (2012), Bui doi Cho Lon (2013) and Teo Em (2013). At the end of March 2014, the crew was still being in pre-production before starting to film, including set design and costume for the cast, beside, the cast had already had a meet up and rehearsed together. The movie started filming at the beginning of April and the process only took within 6 weeks. The crew had a wrap party on May 22. Until November, despite full edited movie, they still decided to film more scenes in order to make a better ending. Thai Hoa claimed these final days of filming and changing the script in hurry caused him \\"depression\\", that he didn't even dare to watch the premiere. Charlie chose actress Diem My for the character Thu Le, after 3 rounds of casting. He stated that this role \\"was supposedly portrayed by another actress whose figure is bigger\\" which caused him spending 3 days casting. However, Charlie claimed that she (Diem My) \\"is smart to absorb the character's personality\\" also \\"being creative in littlest details\\". As for Diem My, De Mai tinh is one of her favorite movies, she really admires Charlie Nguyen but \\"nervous and stressful\\" when she was filming with Thai Hoa. Actress Thu Trang said that the scene where she took off her clothes to seduce Thai Hoa's character shocked her husband - actor Tien Luat, he also appeared during the filming of that scene and felt \\"annoyed\\" as he had witnessed that scene himself. The official soundtrack of De Mai tinh is \\"Nhu mot loi hua\\" (Like A Promise) by singer Thao Trang, who had also performed \\"Angel In Me\\" - the OST of De Mai tinh. The song was released as online digital single on December 13, 2014 along with English version \\"Like A Promise\\". Both versions were composed by Phan Cong Thanh. The Vietnamese version was performed by Thao Trang in Toi toa sang show in December 20. Ngoc Lee from YAN News complimented the song \\"like a breeze in the movie\\" due to its soft melody. Release The initial release date was supposed to be in November, 2014 however the official release date was December 12, 2014. The premiere was 2 days before the official release at box office in Ho Chi Minh City. At the start of October 2014, first poster was revealed along with other promotions. The old title \\"De Hoi tinh\\" with the poster portraying the character Hoi in new style with pink dyed hair, a shade and a mustache. A source said before release, the movie title was switched from De Hoi tinh to De Mai tinh 2 for commercial purpose maybe. Actor Thai Hoa had predicted that the movie was unable to get 100 billion Vietnam Dong profit, \\"but let's see\\", he said. With new title, De Mai tinh 2 attracted 71,766 audiences and earned 5,7 billion Vietnam Dong in first day, defeated Teo Em's record with 4 billion Vietnam Dong 4 years ago. Two days later, the movie continuously earned 7,5 billion Vietnam Dong and 8 billion Vietnam Dong with 200,000 audiences in total, which made De Mai tinh 2 be the second highest grossing after The Vengeful Heart in 2014. In first week release, the movie eared 45 billion Vietnam Dong, until the second week marked in December 26, the total grossing was 70 billion Vietnam Dong. Early 2015, the movie broke all the records applying for both Vietnam movies and foreign movies since it earned 90 billion Vietnam Dong. Later, this record defeated by Fast and Furious 7. CGV stated that the success of the movie came from entertainment purpose targeting with simple plot that anyone can understand. Reception = The press = At the movie premiere night of De Mai Tinh 2, actor Thai Hoa was so nervous to watch the movie with the press, whom he claimed that \\"trying to search for the tiniest flaws which pressure the screw\\", he decided to skip the movie premiere and had a coffee with Miss Vietnam 2010 runner up Vu Thi Hoang My - who was late to the premiere - in order to release his stress. Unfortunately, since the release, the movie received mixed reviews from the press. Ngoc Phuong from The Labor wrote as De Mai tinh 2 \\"failed completely\\" regarding artistic perspective when inserting many ungraceful details along with other \\"funny moments\\". She also criticized Thai Hoa's acting in De Mai tinh 2 was as same as his acting in Long Ruoi, Cuoi ngay keo lo and Teo Em. Another negative review from Phan Cao Tung from The Youth paper, he stated this movie was \\"one step back\\" after \\"not-so- surprising\\" Teo Em also by Charlie Nguyen, criticized Thai Hoa's acting was repeated over and over again.

Built c. 1824, it is one of the finest Federal style brick houses in the region, and was probably the first brick building erected in Bucksport and its surrounding towns. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Heywood House is set facing south on the north side of Maine Street, overlooking the Penobscot River. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a side gable roof, four end chimneys, and a dressed granite foundation. The main facade is five bays wide, its windows featuring splayed sills and lintels. The main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by fanlight window. Both sides of the roof feature a monitor-style dormer. A wood frame addition extends to the rear of the main block. The main block's brick is laid in Flemish bond on the front, and English bond on the sides. The front facade's brick is of uniformly high quality. The construction date of the house was given in an early history of Bucksport as 1824, an approximate date supported by its construction style. It was built by a local harness-maker, and remained in the Heywood family until the mid-20th century. The house is the finest Federal style brick house in the lower Penobscot River valley, exceeding in decoration examples in Bangor, Castine, and another house in Bucksport.

Set in Moscow in 1913, it tells the story of a Moscow-born English-educated print shop owner whose English wife has suddenly abandoned him and their three children. The novel was shortlisted for the 1988 Booker Prize.  Plot  In March 1913 Frank Reid, a Russian-born Englishman running a printing shop in Moscow, is left by his wife, Nellie. She returns to England without warning or explanation and he needs to find someone to look after his three children, Dolly, Ben and Annie (Annushka). The Kuriatins, the family of a business partner, prove unsuitable: a first visit ends in disaster when a bear cub gifted as a birthday present to the son of the family is encouraged to become drunk, wreaks havoc in the dining room, and has to be shot. Frank next visits Mrs Graham, wife of the Anglican chaplain, who introduces him to the dowdy Muriel Kinsman, an English governess who has for reasons that are unclear recently been dismissed from her post. He considers her also to be unsuitable. Frank's chief accountant Selwyn Crane is an idealistic follower of Tolstoy who spends much of his spare time seeking out those he considers to be oppressed; he is also a poet and author of Birch Tree Thoughts. Selwyn introduces Frank to Lisa Ivanovna, a young shop-girl found weeping at the men's handkerchief department of the local store. She is said to be the daughter of a country joiner. Frank employs her, and finds himself attracted by her beauty and serene presence. The children quickly become attached to her. One night, Frank is called out to his printing works after hours where he surprises a student, Volodya Vasilych, who fires two shots. The intruder says he is there to print revolutionary pamphlets, but later confesses his true motivation: he is jealous of Frank, whom he suspects of courting Lisa. Lisa says that she does not know the student well but that he was one of those who used to hang about the men's handkerchief department. Frank has been writing regularly to Nellie in England, but has received no reply and is unsure if his letters are reaching her. Her brother Charlie, who lives in Norbury, decides to visit. Frank hopes for news of Nellie but is disappointed, as Charlie does not know where she is living. At the end of his stay, Charlie surprises Frank by suggesting that he should take Lisa and the children back to England with him. Charlie has become attracted to Lisa, and Frank is unsure whether that may be Charlie's true motivation. In any event, the children prefer to stay in Moscow, and Frank declines. Frank's feelings for Lisa can no longer be denied; he makes advances, and she reciprocates. Lisa takes the children to stay at the family's dacha in the country. When Dolly catches Lisa leaving the dacha at night, Lisa says that she should come with her. In a clearing in the wood they see many mysterious and silent figures ‚Äì unexplained within the novel ‚Äì standing separately, who press themselves each to their own birch tree. Lisa comments that if Dolly remembers this, \\"she'll understand in time what she's seen\\". They return to the dacha, the potent smell of birch sap following Dolly to her bed. Meanwhile, Selwyn admits his part in Nellie's sudden departure. He tells Frank that Nellie had started to 'turn toward the spiritual' and that the two of them had resolved to run away to some natural place, perhaps in the forest, but that his last-minute scruples had prevented it. He informs Frank that Nellie has been living in a Tolstoyan settlement in England, the same settlement that he had recommended to Muriel Kinsman. Muriel has been writing regularly, and has told him that Nellie recently left as she did not care for the communal life. Frank receives a call telling him to pick up his children from the railway station, where they have arrived unattended. Dolly explains that Lisa had put them on a train to Moscow and had herself caught a train to Berlin. Frank understands that Lisa was not the innocent joiner's daughter that she had pretended, and that she has taken the opportunity to escape from Russia illegally. Spring has finally arrived, and Frank's servants have just completed the annual spring cleaning and ritual of opening the windows. The novel ends with Nellie walking back into the house.

She visited Moscow and environs in 1975, which included a visit to Tolstoy's house and a dacha in a birch forest. In the early 1970s, as part of her research on Edward Burne-Jones, Fitzgerald became friends with a Swiss art curator, Mary Chamot, who had been brought up in pre- revolution Russia. Chamot's family had had a greenhouse business in Moscow since the mid-1800s, and they had stayed on for a few years after the revolution. The original title of the novel was to be The Greenhouse. Later, Fitzgerald considered Nellie and Lisa, but her editor did not approve and suggested The Coming of Spring instead, an idea that the author modified for the published title.  Themes  Fitzgerald's historical novel is set in Moscow in 1913, when Russia was on the verge of the cataclysmic changes of the bolshevik revolution. But it conveys also the ambivalence of the 1980s period of perestroika in which it was written. The scene is set within an anthropomorphized city of Moscow with corrupt bureaucracy, dilapidated buildings, and a climate that is cold and grey throughout the better part of the year. But there is also charm in the ramshackle wooden houses and their overgrown gardens; the city is filled with testaments to a glorious past, and the population meets the banality of everyday life with humour and passion. Just like Moscow, Fitzgerald's characters are full of contradictions - rebellious, yet submissive, lecherous yet ascetic, corrupt yet profoundly moral. The main characters of the novel are English, and we see things through their eyes creating a sense of otherness that is central to the story: Fitzgerald has a gift for creating a completely known, yet strange, world that is both intensely compressed and seemingly spacious. She liked creating a feeling of strangeness in a world of images, fragments, moments, and of things not said ‚Äì a characteristic that her biographer Hermione Lee compared with Turgenev. Via the character of Selwyn, the background presence of Tolstoy is strongly felt within the novel, along with his spiritual epic Resurrection and its opening outburst of spring. One of the Fitzgerald's preoccupations, in this as in her other late novels, is with belief and the soul. The plot is set during Lent and reaches its climax at Easter. Religious symbols and rituals are pervasive, the author projecting her own feeling for religion onto the rituals of the Russian Holy Year and the traditional local beliefs. The scene in the birch woods, forming part of the oddness and the beauty of the novel, is not explained within the text and seems intentionally ambiguous. The episode is seen through a drowsy child's eyes, and appears ghostly and dreamlike. Fitzgerald leaves it unclear whether the figures are real people, perhaps doukhobors, or are to be interpreted as a dream, or figuratively like The Listeners of Walter de la Mare's poem. Fitzgerald's biographer, however, has stated that her working notes make it clear that the girl was not dreaming but has witnessed a gathering of revolutionary conspirators. Christopher Knight has noted that Lisa's washing of Dolly's feet with her shawl after the meeting in the wood parallels Jesus's washing of the apostles‚Äô feet at the Last Supper. Lisa's words (‚ÄúIf she remembers it, she‚Äôll understand what she has seen‚Äù) echo Jesus‚Äôs words to Peter (\\"What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter\\" in John 13, 7). Fitzgerald withholds immediate resolution of her secrets and requires faith in a deeper meaning that will reveal itself in time. In this respect, Fitzgerald's writing has been compared with that of the bible, with the reader's interest being driven by the dramatic gaps in narrative and detail.  Critical reception  The Beginning of Spring received glowing press reviews. Writing for the New York Times Book Review, Robert Plunket compared Fitzgerald to EM Forster and considered the book to be a very good, and very modern, comedy of manners, a work \\"whose greatest virtue is perhaps the most old-fashioned of all. It is a lovely novel\\". Anita Brookner was impressed by the author's \\"calm confidence behind the apparent simplicity of utterance\\", called her \\"the mistress of the hint of the sublime\\" and praised the astonishing virtuosity with which she \\"mastered a city, a landscape, and a vanished time\\". The Daily Telegraph considered the work \\"marvellous, intelligent and beautifully crafted\\", The Times Literary Supplement \\"one of the outstanding novels of the year\\", The Guardian \\"a complete success\\", and the London Review of Books \\"a tour de force\\". For The Independent, Jan Morris asked \\"How is it done?\\" \\"How could she know so much about the minutiae of dacha housekeeping or the rituals of hand-printing craft, or the habits of Moscow nightwatchmen, or the nature of the entertainment at the Merchants‚Äô Club?\\" The novel was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1988. In 2015, it was chosen by Robert McCrum for his List of the 100 best English Novels, assembled for The Guardian.  Adaptation  BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast a radio adaptation of the novel in 2015.

The B5302 is a B road which runs for approximately twelve-and-a- quarter miles between the towns of Silloth-on-Solway and Wigton in Cumbria, United Kingdom. From west to east, it passes through the villages of Causewayhead, Calvo, Abbeytown, Wheyrigg, and Waverbridge, and also passes near to Blackdyke and Blencogo. At its eastern end, it comes very close to the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and passes by Silloth Airfield, left over from the Second World War. Several of the villages that the road passes through were formerly served by trains on the single-track Carlisle and Silloth Bay Railway, which closed with the Beeching axe in the 1960s. It is the main road connecting Silloth-on-Solway and surrounding settlements with the A596, and by extension, the city of Carlisle. The route =Silloth-on-Solway to Calvo= The B5302's western terminus is in the coastal town of Silloth-on-Solway, at the junction with the B5300 coast road (which runs south to Mawbray, Allonby, and Maryport). As it winds through Silloth, first heading west, then north as Criffel Street, then east as Wigton Road, it is constructed from cobblestones, unchanged from the Victorian era. As Criffel Street, the B5302 passes by many of Silloth's shops and the town's green. Side-roads lead to Silloth docks, the seafront and lifeboat station, and the former site of Silloth railway station. A Blackburn Botha at RAF Silloth, WWII. As the cobbles give way to tarmac, the road begins heading in an easterly direction out of Silloth-on-Solway. On the outskirts of town it reaches Barracks Bridge, and a quarter-of-a-mile thereafter, Silloth Airfield. This airfield was constructed during the Second World War by RAF Coastal Command, and served primarily as a training base. It was closed in 1960 and today is used for a weekly market and car boot sale. Half-a-mile past the airfield and the B5302 bends sharply to the left in the small hamlet of Causewayhead, in the civil parish of Holme Low. Two side-roads in quick succession lead south-west to a junction with the B5301 and south-east in the direction of Blackdyke. Also in Causewayhead is Tanglewood Caravan Park, which the B5302 passes on its way through the settlement. The B5302 is now heading in a north-easterly direction as it reaches the hamlet of Calvo, approximately one mile from Causewayhead. Upon entering the hamlet, the road turns sharply once again, heading in a south-easterly direction as it leaves the hamlet towards Abbeytown. =Kingside Hill to Wheyrigg= The B5302 at Kingside Hill. One-and-a-half miles from Calvo, past the side-road that leads to Blackdyke, is Kingside Hill, named for the local legend that King Edward I encamped there during one of the early wars between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland. The B5302 climbs the hill, then bends to the left toward Abbeytown, passing the side-road which leads to Highlaws, Pelutho, and Mawbray. Entering Abbeytown the speed limit is reduced, and the B5302 passes Abbeytown School and the village's two shops. Bending sharply to the right part-way through the village, another side-road here leads to the council estate Friars' Garth, as well as Holmcultram Abbey, which was converted into a parish church following the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s. The Abbey's 900-year-old roof was destroyed in an arson attack in 2006, but has since been restored thanks to donations from the local community. On its way out of Abbeytown, the B5302 passes over an old railway bridge, and comes close to the site of the former Abbeytown railway station. After leaving Abbeytown, the road heads in a vaguely south-easterly direction, passing mostly fields with the occasional farmhouse, eventually reaching Wheyrigg after one-and-three-quarter miles. One side-road along this stretch leads to the hamlet of Kelsick. =Waverbridge to the Wigton bypass= River Waver at Waverbridge. After another mile-and-a-half of scattered farmhouses and fields, the B5302 arrives in Waverbridge, where it descends to cross over the River Waver. A side-road just beyond Waverbridge takes a different route into Wigton, passing Wigton cemetery and arriving at Station Hill. The B5302's route, however, continues through the fields for just over a mile. As it approaches the junction with the A596, the road's previous route (before the Wigton bypass was constructed) into Wigton is still visible, though no longer used. As it approaches Wigton, there is a staggered crossroads which means that the two sections of the B5302 don't join up with one another. =Through Wigton town centre= Having crossed over the A596 at the staggered crossroads, the B5302 enters Wigton, crossing over the Cumbria Coast Line in the process. It passes the Greenacres council estate and then the Innovia factory, the town's largest employer. The road then narrows considerably as it enters Wigton town centre. The difficulty in navigating this part of Wigton was one of the main reasons for the construction of the Wigton bypass in the early 1990s. Eastern terminus of the B5302. In the centre of Wigton is the town's monument, built in 1872 and now a listed monument. Turning right at the monument leads to the Nelson Thomlinson School after a quarter-of-a-mile, and eventually out of Wigton on the B5304 bound for Red Dial and the A595. Turning left just past the monument leads to Wigton railway station. The B5302, now called King Street, continues in an easterly direction out of the town centre, running almost parallel with the Cumbria Coast Line. It crosses over the railway line approximately one mile after leaving the town centre, and this marks the eastern terminus of the road at the junction with the A596. King Street, now without the B5302 designation, continues in an easterly direction for another two-and-a-quarter miles, terminating at the A595 at Woodcock Wood. Incidents The B5302 has seen numerous incidents and accidents, including some fatalities. In 2004, a man was killed in an accident involving a car and a coal lorry on the road between Abbeytown and Waverbridge. In 2013, a quad bike rider was left with serious injuries in an accident on the road near Causewayhead, and was airlifted to Newcastle hospital by the Great North Air Ambulance. In November 2018, the road was briefly closed between Abbeytown and Silloth after a lorry collided with a bridge. Public transportation Stagecoach Cumbria and North Lancashire run a bus (the number 400) along the B5302 from Silloth-on-Solway to Carlisle. Services are approximately once every two hours in either direction, and there are bus stops in all the villages and hamlets along the route. From Silloth- on-Solway, a connecting bus service (the number 60) runs south down the B5300 coast road to Blitterlees, Beckfoot, Mawbray, Allonby, and ultimately Maryport. From Wigton, connecting trains on the Cumbria Coast Line run approximately once an hour north to Carlisle and south to Whitehaven, and occasionally Barrow-in-Furness and Lancaster.

In the absence of a separate descant part, this is normally the highest-pitched part, and otherwise the second highest. The term is most often used today within the context of choral music in reference to youthful singers. The American Choral Directors Association defines a treble as \\"a singer, both male and female, ages eight to sixteen\\". While the term treble is gender neutral, the term is widely used in place of the term boy soprano within the United Kingdom. The term became widely used by English composers of polyphonic choral music during the English pre-Reformation and Reformation eras. At this time choral music written for the Church of England was often voiced in five parts with TrMATB (Treble, Meane, Alto, Tenor, Bass) being one of the most common voicings utilized by Thomas Tallis and his contemporaries. In the Baroque era the term treble was used differently than it is today. The term was used in operas, cantatas, choral works, and other compositions to refer to three different kinds of singers: adult women, boy sopranos, and castrati. The term is still used by opera composers today when a role requires a child vocalist.

Munster The traditional hurling-football divide in Munster runs along a line from Tubber in north County Clare through Corofin to Labasheeda. Across the Shannon in County Limerick the line divides the footballing territory in the hilly west Limerick from the hurling territory in the lush lowlands of east and central Limerick. In County Cork the line also divides east from west, starting at Mallow and extending south towards Cork city and on to the coast. Further west beyond the footballing west Cork is the almost entirely footballing territory in County Kerry, with only a very small hurling region north of Tralee in Ardfert, Ballyheigue and Causeway. The entire counties of Tipperary and Waterford are considered to be traditionally hurling regions. Leinster In Leinster the traditional hurling region is located in the south west of the province. The entire County Kilkenny is considered hurling territory, with very little football activity. Most of County Wexford is in the hurling region along with Counties Carlow, Laois and Offaly. The other Leinster counties are considered footballing counties. Connacht Connacht is almost entirely Gaelic football territory, with only Galway competing in the Liam MacCarthy Cup. In County Galway the hurling-football divide follows a line from Galway City to Ballinasloe. The divide in Galway probably stands out more than in other counties.

The Fox Islands (which encompass both communities) were the subject of an intensive archaeological survey in the 1970s, in which more than 49 sites of interest were identified in North Haven. Eight of these were deemed significant enough to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places; the most significant of these, the Turner Farm Site, was a site exhibiting evidence of year-round occupation during at least three time periods in prehistory. Description Penobscot Bay is located in the mid- coast of Maine, roughly dividing the state's coastline in two. There are two major island groups in the central portion of the bay: Islesboro to the north, and the Fox Islands (politically divided between North Haven and Vinalhaven) to the south. In the 1970s the Fox Islands were studied intensively by archaeologists of the Maine State Museum to understand habitation and subsistence patterns of its prehistoric occupants. In addition to identifying more than 130 sites in both communities, this survey work was able to establish chronologies of occupation and modes of subsistence in the area. Eight significant sites were identified, and have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Turner Farm, Turner Farm II, Mullen's Cove, Joe Amesbury Place, Bortz-Lewis Site, Bull Rock Site, Cabot I Site, and Crocker Site. All of these have as a major component a shell midden, each of which yielded evidence of habitation in the Late Archaic and Ceramic phases. The Turner Farm Site was identified as the most significant of the sites located, and was subjected to extensive archaeological work. It has yielded evidence of occupation during at least three different time periods (the Moorehead, Susquehanna, and Ceramic phases) dating back to c. 5200 BCE, with different patterns of use and subsistence identified. During the Moorehead period, the site was most intensively used during the late fall and winter, with the major subsistence activity consisting of fishing, which was supplemented by hunting land-based mammals. In the Susquehanna period the occupancy period was longer, and the major food sources were land mammals such as bear, moose, and seals taken from rookeries. In the Ceramic period there was a period of year-round occupation, and food sources were diverse, a probable indication of growing human population. The site was one of the first to provide clear evidence of year-round occupation by pre-contact Native populations on the Maine coast.

Who Was WhoAlumni of Cambridge UniversityDr Herbert Durham on Flickr Early life Herbert Edward Durham was born 30 March 1866, the son of Arthur E. Durham, Senior Surgeon to Guy‚Äôs Hospital. He married Maud Lowry, daughter of Capt. Harmer of 81st Regiment. Education Durham was educated at University College School, London from 1883‚Äì84; King‚Äôs College, Cambridge from 1884; and Guy‚Äôs Hospital, London. In 1904 he was awarded a John Lucas Walker Studentship in Pathology, a scholarship given by the University of Cambridge for original pathological research. Career =Bacteriology= He was Assistant Demonstrator in Histology from 1884‚Äì89, then House Surgeon at Guy's Hospital, London from 1889-95. From 1895-96 he worked at the Hygiene Institute, Vienna where he was associated with Professor Max von Gruber in the discovery of agglutination of bacteria. In 1897 he developed an agglutination reaction for diagnosis of typhoid fever, which then was called the Grubler-Durham reaction, subsequently known as the Widal reaction; and also created \\"Durham tubes\\" for measuring the amount of gas produced in the bacterial colonies, which are still used universally in microbiology laboratories.As expedi√ß√µes da Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine e a Amaz√¥nia Brasileira. Aristoteles Guilliod Miranda, Jos√© Maria de Castro Abreu Jr., Pan-Amazonian Journal of Health; June 2011. Online From 1896-98 he was a working Member of Tsetse Fly Disease Committee of the Royal Society. In June 1900 under the auspices of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and accompanied by fellow eminent Cambridge parasitologist , Dr Walter Myers, Durham led the Yellow Fever Expedition to Brazil.The Times, 20 Feb 1901; pg. 4; Issue 36383The Wellcome Library In 1881 the Cuban epidemiologist Dr Carlos Finlay was the first to theorise that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes, but this remained unproven in the wider scientific community. While en route to Brazil they visited the U.S. Naval Hospital in Washington where they met U. S. Surgeon General George Miller Sternberg who is considered the first U.S. bacteriologist, and then proceeded to Havana where they met Dr Finlay and his co-workers on 25 July 1900, and also the U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission, led by Dr Walter Reed, which subsequently confirmed Dr Finlay‚Äôs theory. Among Reed‚Äôs team was bacteriologist Dr Jesse Lazear who died a month later on 26 September aged 34 while investigating the disease.On 24 August Durham and Myers arrived in Pari (modern day Belem) in the northern state of Par√°, Brazil, where they established a laboratory to study the transmission of the disease and were among the first to establish its transmission by mosquitoes. Durham and Myers were aware of the risks that they were taking; however, on 16 January 1901, after conducting the fourteenth autopsy on victims of yellow fever both men found they were themselves infected. They were transferred to the Domingos Freire Isolation Hospital in Pari where Durham recovered but Myers died four days later, aged 28.Obituary of Dr Walter Myers in the British Medical Journal BMJ 1901;1:310The National Archives In his subsequent report Durham deduced that they had both been infected through mosquito bites. He was subsequently in charge of an expedition to investigate beriberi in the Malay Peninsula and on Christmas Island, organised by London School of Tropical Medicine. He introduced Derris as insecticide from Malaya. =Zymology= In 1905 aged 39 he had to give up his research activities as a result of deterioration of his vision and became engaged in the study of fermentation and allied problems. He worked as a chemist and scientific adviser to cider manufacturer, H. P. Bulmer and Company. Through his isolation of wild yeast which ensured that fermentations were consistent, Durham assisted his close college friend, Fred Bulmer, in the development of commercial cider-making.  Military service Durham was 48 at the outbreak of the First World War and served as Hon. Lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps and Major in the Special List. Other interests Durham had a strong interest in photography. He was an Associate of the Royal Photographic Society where he exhibited regularlyRoyal Photographic Society Exhibitor List in 1932 and was a Medallist in 1927.

The episode aired on March 23, 2015 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. It is named after the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Plot =Opening= In a flashback, Jimmy works as a mail clerk for Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill. He receives notice that he has passed the state bar exam and reports the good news to Chuck. He hopes to be hired by the firm as an attorney, but Chuck hesitantly replies that the hiring must first be cleared by the other partners. During an office celebration, Howard tells Jimmy that the firm will not hire him immediately, and says the partners will re-examine Jimmy's application in six months. =Main story= Jimmy grows suspicious when a client mentions her nursing home, Sandpiper Crossing, controls her pension and Social Security payments by giving her a $500 monthly allowance, deducting fees, and putting the rest in savings. Upon reviewing her invoices, Jimmy's suspicions grow and he begins collecting invoices from other residents. Jimmy and Chuck analyze the documents and find evidence of Sandpiper Crossing systematically overcharging residents, making the company guilty of fraud. Chuck suggests there are grounds for a class action lawsuit, and encourages Jimmy to continue looking for evidence. Jimmy is turned away at Sandpiper Crossing's front desk, preventing him from seeing his clients or meeting with prospective new ones. He can hear that papers are being shredded in the nearby office and goes to a bathroom to hastily write a demand letter on toilet paper, which informs Sandpiper Crossing to cease document destruction. He hands the letter to a manager as he's being escorted from the premises, and later rummages through a dumpster hoping to find more evidence. He finds plastic bags containing the shredded paperwork, which Chuck and Jimmy sort through and piece together to recover an incriminating document. With a solid case against Sandpiper Crossing, Chuck decides to become Jimmy's co-counsel in the case, and Sandpiper Crossing's attorneys agree to a meeting. Mike babysits Kaylee for the day. When Stacey returns from work, she asks Mike what to do with the bribe money Matt hid in her suitcase. Mike tells her she should use it for herself and her daughter so some good can come of it. Stacey tells Mike that even if she uses it, she still doesn't have enough to cover living expenses for Kaylee and herself. Mike returns to Dr. Caldera to follow up on his previous offer of illegal work. He gives Kaylee the dog he used as cover for his visit to Caldera, and promises Stacey he'll cover the costs of keeping it. Sandpiper Crossing's attorneys deny the company is defrauding residents, but concede some were overcharged. The company offers $100,000 to compensate them, but Jimmy presents evidence that Sandpiper Crossing engages in illicit interstate commerce, which makes them eligible for a RICO case. Chuck demands Sandpiper Crossing pay $20 million to settle, which their attorneys refuse. As Chuck and Jimmy prepare to take the case to court, an exhausted Jimmy leaves some paperwork in his car. Preoccupied with his work, Chuck casually leaves his house to retrieve the documents, with none of the usual precautions he takes because of his electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Jimmy is speechless as he watches from inside the front door, then softly calls Chuck's name. Chuck is suddenly stunned to realize where he is and the box of papers falls from his hands.

Plot Jimmy and Chuck prepare for their lawsuit against Sandpiper Crossing. Chuck warns Jimmy that their attorneys will attempt to file a restraining order to keep him off their property, but Jimmy goes to the courthouse and prevents it from being approved. Upon returning to Chuck's house, he finds that Sandpiper Crossing's attorneys have resorted to a document dump, requiring Chuck and Jimmy to read through several boxes of paperwork before they can respond. Chuck does not believe that he and Jimmy can handle the case alone and suggests that they refer it to HHM. Jimmy is reluctant to involve HHM, but arranges a meeting. While Jimmy is asleep, Chuck sneaks out of the house and uses Jimmy's phone to make a call. The next morning, Howard prepares for Chuck and Jimmy's arrival at HHM by confiscating everybody's phones and shutting down the building's electricity. The entire staff greets Chuck's return with a standing ovation. Howard is confident they have a strong case against Sandpiper Crossing and offers to give Jimmy twenty percent of the final settlement or judgment, as well as an of counsel fee of $20,000. However, he makes it clear that Jimmy will not be working on the case or with HHM. This angers Jimmy, who demands to know why he has repeatedly been excluded from the firm. When Howard does not answer his questions, Jimmy decides not to give the case to HHM. Kim confronts Howard about his treatment of Jimmy. Howard resists telling her the reason for his actions, but then confides the truth. Mike receives a job offer to bodyguard Daniel \\"Pryce\\" Wormald, who wants to sell oxycodone pills stolen from his employer. Pryce initially considers Mike, Sobchak and Man Mountain for the job. Sobchak mocks Mike for carrying no weapons, only a pimento cheese sandwich for lunch. Mike defends himself against Sobchak's attack and disarms him, which prompts a frightened Man Mountain to flee. Pryce drives Mike to an abandoned factory where Mike coaches Pryce on how to act during the drug deal. Nacho arrives and hands over a large sum of cash. When Pryce notes the payment is twenty dollars short, Mike calmly demands that Nacho pay in full. Nacho attempts to intimidate Mike, but pays when he realizes Mike cannot be cowed. As they leave, Mike tells Pryce he had researched Nacho ahead of time and knows this deal was carried out without his bosses' knowledge, so Nacho wouldn't have risked a confrontation. Kim meets Jimmy and suggests he take Howard's offer for the Sandpiper Crossing case, which will enable him to start his own firm. After rejecting Kim's advice, Jimmy checks his phone and realizes Chuck used it the night before. The next day, Jimmy informs Chuck that he will accept Howard's deal, having deduced that Chuck was using Howard to keep Jimmy out of HHM. Jimmy demands to know why and Chuck tells him \\"You're not a real lawyer!\\" because Jimmy got his degree from an online law school. Chuck says he was proud when Jimmy stopped running cons and worked in the HHM mailroom, but he could never be an attorney at HHM because he hasn't changed. Feeling betrayed, Jimmy cuts his ties with Chuck. Production This episode was written and directed by Thomas Schnauz, who also wrote \\"Nacho\\" earlier in the season.

Jimmy has agreed to Chuck's demand that he move to Albuquerque to live an honest life and give up his cons, which disappoints Marco. = Main story = Jimmy gives the Sandpiper Crossing case to HHM and reveals he figured out Chuck was sabotaging his career. Howard apologizes for his involvement and gives Jimmy his $20,000 of counsel fee. Jimmy requests that Howard take over caring for Chuck, and Howard is impressed with the amount of time and effort Jimmy has devoted to Chuck's well-being. Jimmy calls bingo at the local senior center. After an improbable string of numbers beginning with \\"B\\" he fixates on words beginning with that letter which remind him of Chuck. Jimmy rants about taking revenge in Illinois against Chet, who \\"may have\\" owed him money or cheated with his wife, by defecating through the sunroof of Chet's car (the \\"Chicago Sunroof\\") without realizing Chet's children were in the back seat. Facing the possibility of registering as a sex offender if convicted, Jimmy asked Chuck for help. Chuck got the charges dropped, but Jimmy attributes his current situation to that event.

According to Gould, all the scams depicted in the episode are based on real-life cases. The fictitious Equatorial Uqbar Orbis that Jimmy mentions during a scam is a reference to the Jorge Luis Borges story Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius. During the montage of scams, Marco speaks the line, \\"Hey, kid, help me get my wife's car out of this bad neighborhood.\\" In the episode, a woman who slept with Jimmy after he tricked her into thinking he was Kevin Costner, realizes he is not.

('gomphos'=club, 'celosioides'=resembling Celosia) is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the family Amaranthaceae and a cosmopolitan pioneer plant of disturbed areas, and one of 51 species in the genus.http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Celosia This much-branched, prostrate plant is an annual or short-lived perennial, with a deep taproot and is often mat-forming. The opposite, elliptical leaves have short, hairy petioles, are pubescent and some 3‚Äì4 cm long. The flowers are in dense terminal spikes and grow on a woolly receptacle; perianth segments are papery, 4‚Äì6 mm long, shining, and whitish to pink in colour. It has 2 stigmas and 5 stamens inserted opposite the sepals and joined into a 5-toothed staminal tube. The ovary is superior, developing into a single-seeded fruit. The seed is some 1.5 mm in length, lentil-shaped, brown and glossy, and is routinely distributed by ants. Originally from the Americas where it is native to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay and Uruguay, it has become naturalised in Asia in Bhutan, China, Indonesia, Japan, New Caledonia, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, New Zealand, Christmas Island and Australia, and Hawaii in the Pacific region, while in the Africa region it is found in Botswana, Cameroon, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Madeira Islands, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, R√©union, Rwanda, Socotra, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.http://wssa.net/wp-content/uploads/Gomphrena- celosioides.pdfhttp://eol.org/pages/8717482/overviewhttp://www.hear.org/pier/species/gomphrena_celosioides.htm Phytochemicals Analysis of this species has shown the presence of various compounds, including aurantiamide,http://www.chemfaces.com/natural/Aurantiamide-CFN98984.html and aurantiamide acetate, which is a selective cathepsin inhibitor, also produced by Aspergillus penicilloides. These compounds have shown their effectiveness against microorganisms, even in very small doses. Plants from the Amaranthaceae are used in folk medicine for their nutritional qualities and for the treatment of various disorders such as gastrointestinal and respiratory problems, skin infections, as well as some infectious diseases, and as an abortifacient. Analysis has also revealed hydrocarbons, alcohols, steroids, terpenoids, ecdysteroids, flavonoids, saponins, amino acids, butacyanins, reducing sugar and ketoses. Eating the plant affects the nervous system of horses, leading to lack of co-ordination, dragging of hooves and falling. Recovery is swift following exclusion of the plant from the diet.http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Gomphrena+celosioides Gallery References http://www.biocrick.com/Aurantiamide-BCN5790.html celosioides Category:Flora of Brazil Category:Plants described in 1826 ","title":"Gomphrena celosioides"},{"id":"45565319","text":"The Robert Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role () is one of the merit awards presented by the Danish Film Academy at the annual Robert Awards ceremony.

The first part, titled The Lovers, covers the first 7 tracks, while the second part, named The Devil, covers the remaining 6 tracks. It progresses around a love story between an obsessive, romantic, emotionally unstable boy and a bitter, distant and cold girl. Halfway through the album, the roles are reversed as the boy becomes cold and distant after he realizes the girl does not love him back; and the girl realizes she made a mistake and goes on to solve it. Dennen cited as an inspiration for the album the bad relationship between his parents and bad relationships he himself has gone through.

They are former ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champions which they have held a record three times.  History  = Ring of Honor (2014‚Äì2019) =  Adam Cole‚Äôs Kingdom (2014‚Äì2016)  At Final Battle 2013, prior to the official formation, Matt Hardy helped Adam Cole retain the ROH World Championship, forming a tag team in the process. Shortly thereafter Michael Bennett and Maria Kanellis joined both Hardy and Cole involving himself in their feud with The Briscoes. At Supercard of Honor VIII both Hardy and Bennett helped Cole defeat Jay Briscoe to become the undisputed ROH World Champion, with Hardy taking possession of Briscoe‚Äôs unsanctioned ‚ÄúReal World Title‚Äù belt and renaming it the ‚ÄúROH Iconic Championship‚Äù. On June 22, 2014, at Best in the World 2014, Matt Hardy and Michael Bennett accompanied by Maria Kanellis and Nick Searcy were defeated in a no disqualification match against The Briscoes (Jay and Mark Briscoe). On July 12, 2014, The Kingdom officially made their debut as a stable in Ring of Honor when Hardy, Bennett, and Adam Cole faced War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe) along with Michael Elgin in a six-man tag team match which ended in a no contest. On November 15, 2014, at Glory By Honor XIII, Matt Taven, who had joined the stable back in September, teamed with Bennett as they unsuccessfully challenged reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly) for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. At Best in the World 2014 Cole lost the ROH World Championship to Michael Elgin. In July, Hardy opted out of his ROH contract and went back to TNA. After failing to regain the ROH World Championship from now champion Jay Briscoe at Final Battle 2014, Cole announced he had suffered a shoulder injury which would require surgery. Michael Bennett & Matt Taven displaying their ROH World Tag Team Championship, along with Maria Kanellis On March 1, 2015, at the 13th Anniversary Show, Bennett and Taven defeated The Addiction (Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian) as well as Karl Anderson (who competed on his own due to Doc Gallows suffering travel issues) in a three-way tag team match. On March 27, 2015, at Supercard of Honor IX, Bennett and Taven unsuccessfully challenged reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly) for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. Cole returned from his injury at War of the Worlds ‚Äò15, where he lost to A.J. Styles. Cole then began having tension with Bennett and Taven and even teased a reunion with former Future Shock partner Kyle O‚ÄôReilly. On September 18 at All Star Extravaganza VII, Bennett and Taven won their first-ever ROH World Tag Team Championship, when they defeated the then champions The Addiction (Frankie Kazarian and Christopher Daniels) and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Later that night Cole betrayed O‚ÄôReilly during his world championship match against Jay Lethal remaining with The Kingdom and turning heel once again. Bennett and Taven lost the title to War Machine on December 18 at Final Battle. Bennett and Kanellis left ROH after the following day's Ring of Honor Wrestling taping, after failing to come to terms on a new contract with the promotion. With Taven suffering a legitimate knee injury and subsequently turning on Cole (who would later join the Bullet Club as its U.S. side's de facto leader), The Kingdom went on hiatus.  Matt Taven‚Äôs Kingdom (2016‚Äì2019)  On the September 18th, 2016 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Taven returned and announced that The Kingdom will be competing in the tournament for the new ROH 6-Man Tag Team Championship, but wouldn't announce his partners. On a match taped on October 1, 2016 for the October 23rd, 2016 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Matt Taven revealed TK O'Ryan and Vinny Marseglia as new members of The Kingdom and defeated Bullet Club to advance to the semi-finals of the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship Tournament. On the November 19 episode of ROH TV The Kingdom defeated Team CMLL (Hechicero, Okumura and Ultimo Guerrero) to advance to the finals at the Final Battle 2016 PPV. On December 2, The Kingdom defeated Jay White, Kushida and Lio Rush in the finals to become the inaugural ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champions. On March 11, 2017, at Ring of Honor TV taping, Taven, Marseglia and Silas Young, who filled in for an injured TK O'Ryan, lost the ROH World Six- Man Tag Team Championship to Bully Ray and The Briscoes. On September 27, 2019 at ROH's Death Before Dishonor XVII pay-per-view, after Rush defeated Taven for the ROH World Championship, O'Ryan and Marseglia were shown having been attacked backstage (to explain why neither of them had interfered on Taven's behalf to prevent the defeat, which they regularly had done in the past). On ROH's TV show, Marseglia attacked Taven in the ring, signalling the start of a storyline feud between the two former allies. On December 13, 2019 at ROH's Final Battle PPV, Marseglia (who had never held a title in ROH, up to that point) scored an upset victory over Taven (who was more seasoned and had won all 4 of ROH's men's championships). After the match, Marseglia and Bateman attacked Taven, attempting to break Taven's ankles. On the December 14, 2019 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, O'Ryan announced that The Kingdom had disbanded. = New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2014‚Äì2015) = On August 10, 2014, during the G1 Climax The Kingdom, represented by Cole and Bennett and accompanied by Maria Kanellis, made their New Japan Pro-Wrestling debuts, defeating Captain New Japan and Jushin Thunder Liger. The Kingdom, now represented by Bennett and Taven, returned to New Japan in November 2014, to take part in the 2014 World Tag League. They finished third in their block with a record of four wins and three losses. Bennett and Taven returned to NJPW on April 5, 2015, at Invasion Attack 2015, where they defeated Bullet Club (Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson) to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship. On July 5 at Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall, The Kingdom lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship back to Bullet Club in their first defense. Bennett and Taven returned to NJPW in November to take part in the 2015 World Tag League, where they finished with a record of two wins and four losses, failing to advance from their block.

Adapted to the arctic sea ice environment, such sleds are still widely used in the 21st century for travel in Arctic regions.  Design  A qamutiik with napooks lashed directly to the runners The key feature of the qamutiik is that it is not built with nails or pins to hold the runners and cross pieces in place. Each piece is drilled and lashed to the next, providing a flexibility of movement that can endure the pounding of travel on open sea ice, frozen land, ice floes, and across the heavy ice of tidal zones. The cross pieces are called napooks. Each napook is notched near the ends to take a lashing which is passed through holes drilled through the runners. The first and last napooks are lashed individually to the runners, using a more secure knot using two holes in the runners. For the central napooks, there is a single hole in the runner for each napook and all of the central napooks are lashed in one continuous lashing along each side. The method of lashing forms a self-locking knot. In the early 21st century, the napooks are ideally made of hardwoods such as oak or walnut. Archival materials and the stories of elders show that the people in areas without access to wood for runners used frozen fish wrapped in skins as runners. Moss and ice were used on the bottom of the runner to reduce drag. They are called pilraaq. In the 21st century wooden runners are universal, using usually either spruce or plywood, typically with a layer of polyurethane or nylon to reduce drag. British and American diaries and accounts from the 1800 and early 1900s tell how their explorers, determined to use conventional sleds, found that the pounding of the sea-ice jolted the sleds so that nails were expelled, and the sled fell to pieces within several miles of their start point. They adopted Inuit-style sleds.  Function  floe edge, qamutiik with tarp-covered boxes. Snowmobiles in background. Qamutiik are used for diverse travel in the Arctic, from afternoon outings for families going sledding to multi-day hunting trips covering hundreds of miles of terrain. Most qamutiik have space for fuel cans, a camp stove and grub box, positioned for easy access, and to permit quick stops for tea and food. Other gear and belongings are lashed to the sled body, and passengers can either ride atop this load holding on to the lashing ropes, or, in the more modern versions, ride in the comfort of a \\"box\\" lashed to the sled, sometimes with a small windbreak or canvas cover. The packing and lashing of a sled is an art. Weight must be carried low on the sled, to reduce the risk of tipping. Ingenious structures and materials are used to protect the passengers and hunters build small sleek versions to permit fast day trips. The qamutiik were traditionally hauled by trained dog teams. They can also be pulled by humans or, since the late 20th century, by a snowmobile. Sizes vary by function and the availability of materials.

In 1591 the Bishop of Halberstadt joined the Protestant Reformation, and the church has been used by the Protestant Church since. The cathedral was severely damaged in the Second World War, but has been restored in the decades after the war. The cathedral retains much of its medieval decoration and stained glass windows. The large cathedral treasury contains over 600 objects of art, dating from the 5th to the 18th century, including a unique textiles collection. Many very valuable items are of Byzantine origin, having been brought to Halberstadt in 1205 by Bishop Konrad von Krosigk who had participated in the Fourth Crusade's sack of Constantinople.

He founded the ENSTA ParisTech Robotics Lab where he worked on developmental robotics and computational evolutionary linguistics. While at ENSTA, he designed the urbiscript programming language to control robots, which became the base technology of Gostai, a robotics startup he created in 2006, which was acquired by Aldebaran Robotics in 2012. Jean-Christophe Baillie holds a degree from the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris where he studied computer science and theoretical physics. He did his PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Universit√© Pierre & Marie Curie in co-supervision with Luc Steels at the Sony Computer Science Lab in Paris.  Robotics Laboratory at ENSTA  Jean-Christophe Baillie joined ENSTA ParisTech after his PhD in 2001. There, he founded the Cognitive Robotics LabRobotics and Computer Vision Lab, ENSTA ParisTech to focus the research activity of ENSTA on developmental robotics, using mostly Aibo robots from Sony. The core research was centered on trying to understand the dynamics that could lead robots to develop their own language, building on research originally done by Luc Steels at Sony Computer Science Lab. Particular efforts were made to ground perceptual categories into sensorimotor experiences, taking inspiration from research made by J. Kevin O'Regan. Sophisticated robots like the Aibo, integrating many degrees of freedom and sensors, needed advanced programming and there was no ready-to-use solution at the time. Robots often require parallel programming and event-based programming, which became the core features implemented in early versions of URBI (renamed later in urbiscript), a programming language developed by Baillie to answer these needs. Another aspect of Urbi, which was central to its design, was the desire to make robot programming easier, in particular for students who did not have enough time to learn C++ libraries during short projects.  Gostai  In March 2006, Jean- Christophe Baillie founded Gostai, a startup dedicated to further developing the Urbi technology. The company renamed the Urbi language into urbiscript, and Urbi became a generic robotics middleware in C++, using urbiscript as its orchestration technology. It is now open source (BSD license) and available here: https://github.com/urbiforge/urbi In 2008, Gostai released a first version of GostaiNet, a cloud-based robotics architecture designed to allow low-cost robots to benefit from significant remote computational power in order to run AI-based algorithms. Later in 2010, Gostai released the Jazz robot, dedicated to mobile telepresence. Jazz was based on Urbi and GostaiNet technologies. It started to be sold for hospitals services and museum applications, as well as an academic research platform. In 2012, Aldebaran Robotics acquired Gostai, which was combined with the main company. Jean- Christophe Baillie stayed two years at Aldebaran, where he founded the Aldebaran AI LabAldebaran AI Lab to continue his work on developmental robotics and the evolution of language.  Novaquark  Jean-Christophe Baillie had been working for several years on a project of large-scale virtual world inspired by massively multiplayer games and allowing players to create their own economy, political or territorial systems, as well as social organizations.

There are two kinds of TEAs: high unemployment areas (defined as areas having unemployment more than 150% the national average calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and rural areas (defined as areas outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area). Definition There are two kinds of TEAs recognized by the USCIS: rural areas and high unemployment areas. =Rural areas= An area can be designated as a TEA if, at the time of application, it is a rural area. This is defined as an area that is not within either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) (as designated by the Office of Management and Budget) or the outer boundary of any city or town having a population of 20,000 or more. =High unemployment areas= An area can be designated as a TEA based on high unemployment if it has experienced unemployment of at least 150% of the national average rate as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2018, this average was 3.9%, so currently, to qualify as a TEA based on high unemployment an area must have an unemployment rate of at least 5.9% (3.9 * 150%). =TEA determination= If the location of the proposed new business is not already determined to be a TEA, the investor has the option to gather the relevant publicly available state or federal statistics on their own and submit it with their petition for USCIS to have a new TEA determination made. There is no centralized list of targeted employment areas, but state agencies in various states maintain their own lists or criteria for identifying TEAs, as well as information on local unemployment rates that can be cited in applications. Various US states facilitate the process by allowing people to apply for certification for particular areas being designated as TEAs. USCIS defers to state determinations but periodically reviews the criteria used by states to confirm that they comply with its guidelines. In addition, there are privately collected information sources on unemployment by census tract, including interactive maps, that can help investors identify TEAs.https://mangomap.com/blacksl55amg/maps/15170ec6-d710-11e8-a18a-06765ea3034e/tea- map# TEA designations in various states =Hawaii= According to Hawaii's official website, the following parts of the state are TEAs: * The Island of Hawaii * The Island of Kauai * Some areas of the Island of Oahu (however, the island is a metropolitan area and does not qualify in its entirety) * Small parts of the Islands of Maui, Molokai, and Lanai (however, these islands are metropolitan statistical areas so most parts of these islands are ineligible). =California= In California, the investor may petition the state government for designating a particular subdivision of the area as an area of high unemployment (over 150% the national average). The California Department of Housing and Community Development provides a list of street ranges and census tracts for TEAs. =Florida= The state of Florida maintains a list of Targeted Employment Areas, of which there are currently 33. Rural areas included are Bradford County, Calhoun County, Citrus County, Columbia County, DeSoto County, Dixie County, Franklin County, Glades County, Gulf County, Hamilton County, Hardee County, Hendry County, Jackson County, Lafayette County, Levy County, Liberty County, Madison County, Monroe County (excluding Key West), Okeechobee County, Putnam County, Sumter County, Suwannee County, Taylor County, Union County, Walton County, and Washington County. The list of non-rural high-unemployment areas is subject to regular change based on fluctuations in unemployment rate. The list in August 2012 included Palm Coast metropolitan statistical area (Flagler County), Hernando County, City of Hialeah (in Miami-Dade County), City of Miami Gardens (in Miami-Dade County), and City of Fort Pierce (in St. Lucie County). =Texas= The city of Austin in Texas listed 31 designated TEAs and also provided an unemployment cutoff of 11.1% (150% of the national unemployment rate of 7.4%, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) for non-rural areas to qualify as TEAs. =Washington= Washington, the US state, maintains its own list of TEAs. =Minnesota= The state of Minnesota commissioned a study by the Carlson Consulting Enterprise to better understand how the state could leverage the EB-5 investor program to drive employment growth in the state, particularly in high-unemployment areas. The program has also been highlighted as a way to improve employment for black residents on North Minneapolis (a designated TEA) by matching them with EB-5 investors from Asia. Reception A 2011 article in the New York Times claimed that areas within New York had been strangely gerrymandered so that relatively upscale and wealthy locations could qualify for TEA status, and also noted pushback from locals against an EB-5-funded program for a proposed China City program in upstate New York. Similarly, EB-5-funded construction projects by Marriott, including some in Washington D.C., have met with criticism for how they have sought TEA status for wealthy and well-off regions, contradicting the original spirit of the TEA designation. The Washington City Paper cited the American Immigration Lawyers Association on the ease of having your area designated as a TEA, writing: \\"The ease of qualifying for TEAs is such an open secret that the American Immigration Lawyers Association fact sheet on EB-5 states simply, \\"Each immigrant investor must create 10 US jobs with an investment of $500,000 or more\\"‚Äîrather than the $1 million required outside of TEAs.\\" Similar skepticism about TEAs was expressed in an article in Fortune, that said: \\"One essential part of gaining USCIS approval was crafting an acceptable \\"targeted employment area,\\" or TEA. The EB-5 law requires investment in a district that is either rural or has a jobless rate that is 150% of the national average. But after years of industry pressure, it's now USCIS policy to automatically accept any state designation of a TEA, even though states routinely approve gerrymandered districts that tack on distant high-unemployment tracts to allow EB-5 endeavors in wealthy areas.\\" References  External links  * USCIS Directory of EB-5 Funds * Overview of the EB-5 Immigrant Investment Program * Senate Testimony on the EB-5 Visa Program Category:Special economic zones of the United States Category:United States immigration law ","title":"Targeted Employment Area"},{"id":"45565792","text":"Radio Impuls is a private radio station founded in the Czech Republic in 1999 when it replaced the nationwide station R√°dio Alfa, which lost its license..

C. W. Evan, was a Congregationalist minister in colonial South Australia, the first to serve at the Stow Memorial Church, Flinders Street, Adelaide. History Evan was born in Wales educated at Airedale College, Yorkshire, and graduated B.A. from London University. In 1855 he was serving as pastor for the Independent Church at Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, when he was approached by the Revs. Thomas Binney and George Smith, who had been charged by the Congregational church of Freeman Street, Adelaide, with recruiting a young minister to act as coadjutor (assistant) to the aged and ailing Rev. T. Q. Stow. He arrived on the James Baines on 27 October 1855, and preached his first sermons at the Freeman Street chapel on 4 November 1855. In 1861, responding to his deteriorating health Charles Manthorpe was brought in as co- pastor. Rev. Evan was involved in the planning and erection of the Stow Memorial Church as a replacement for the Freeman Street chapel, which began in mid-1863, and opened in April 1867. Evan and his family lived at Hagen House, East Terrace, where on 2 January 1869 his wife Ellen (n√©e Pearce) gave birth to a daughter, her eighth child, and died on 21 January 1869.

Finding Species maintained an international program in Ecuador from 2007-2012 to document and photograph the endangered flora and fauna of the rain forest. Currently, the American staff is based in Takoma Park, Maryland, and San Marcos, Texas.  History  While conducting botanical research at the Bilsa Biological Reserve in Ecuador, botanist Margot Bass realized the importance and value in scientifically photographing the rainforest. Bass continued her work in 1996 in Ecuador's Yasun√≠ National Park, where she and other botanists established Finding Species to document and conserve plant species. The construction of roads and the exploration for oil in Yasun√≠ National Park inspired Finding Species to partner with Scientists Concerned for Yasun√≠ in publishing a report on the biological value of the park. The report included over thirty signature species of wildlife found at Yasun√≠. This report, as well as the accompanying public relations campaign involving photographs and international outcry, played a crucial role in the government's decision to stop the construction of the road. Resulting from many years of working within the rainforest is Common Trees of Yasuni, a book dedicated to the trees of Yasuni National Park located in Ecuador's Orellana Province. Finding Species was formally incorporated in 2003 as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization focusing on photography, science and conservation. In 2010, Finding Species collaborated with Telfonica to release Armonia Ecuador, a coffee table book featuring photographs of various ecosystems and species throughout Ecuador. The book was released on March 3, 2011.

It was adapted from a story that appeared in the November 1951 issue of Startling Stories. Mutants At the end of Chapter One the head of the Terran Security Bureau gives David Raven a list of twelve known types of mutants based on the super-normal ability each possesses. He also lists their relative danger, I for innocuous, D for dangerous, and D+ for extremely dangerous. *1. True Telepaths (D+): Can read minds and, unlike sub-telepaths, can close their minds to any attempts to read them. *2. Levitators (D): Called floaters, they can simply defy gravity. *3. Pyrotics (D+): Can cause heat to appear at a distance and simply burn someone to death with a thought. *4. Chameleons (I): Not described, but an incident in the book implies that they can simply blend into any background. *5. Nocturnals (I): Never need to sleep. *6. Malleables (D): Have faces backed by cartilage, rather than bone, and can thus change their appearance to resemble anybody. *7. Hypnos (D+): With wide eyes that seem to glow, a hypno can compel anyone to believe or to do exactly what he commands. *8. Supersonics (I): With floppy ears, they can hear ultrasound, even at a considerable distance from its source. They can also create ultrasound and use it for bat-like sonar. *9. Mini-engineers (D+): With long, slender fingers and eyes so deformed that they can only see objects within four inches of their faces, they can build exquisitely tiny mechanisms, such as a cruise missile the size of a cigarette. *10. Radiosensitives (D): Not described. *11. Insectivocals (D+): Using high-pitched chirrups, they talk to insects, especially the toxic breeds found on Venus. Able to communicate with insects, they can also command them, with deadly results. *12. Teleports (D+): Can levitate objects but not themselves (teleport means far-carry). This is not the instantaneous transport of objects that we normally associate with the word teleport. Plot Called before the World Council, Space Captain David Raven is told that he must stop a clandestine war being waged against Terra by people seeking independence for Mars and Venus. The Council's leader, Oswald Heraty, tells him that Humanity is on the verge of interstellar flight and that there have been hints of intelligent life \\"out there\\": Heraty wants Humanity to face any potential dangers as a unified society, so he doesn't want Mars and Venus gaining independence. After leaving the Council, David goes to see Mr. Conrad, the director of the Terran Security Bureau. As true telepaths, Conrad and David speak mind to mind. Conrad gives David a list of the twelve known types of mutants and notes that the clandestine war is being waged by mutants sabotaging Terran infrastructure. David returns to the home that he shares with his companion, Leina, and shortly a team of phony police officers arrives. David switches bodies with the hypno and then with hypnotic power convinces the others on his team that David has already left. Later David reverses the switch and obtains from the shaken hypno the identity of the leader of the sabotage effort, a Venusian insectivocal named Arthur Kayder. Visiting Kayder, David obtains from Kayder's valet the information he wants on the underground base from with the saboteurs launch their attacks. He then goes to the spaceport and boards a ship bound for Venus. Just before the ship lands David jumps out an airlock and lands gently in the forest below, then he walks to Plain City, where he meets up with Charles and Mavis, his and Leina's counterparts on Venus. He tells Charles and Mavis that he has come to Venus to find the man in charge of the clandestine war and get him to stop. When Mavis objects that it's none of their business, David tells her about the impending leap into interstellar space, which will hasten Humanity's meeting with the Denebs. Horrified, Charles tells David that he needs to deal with a power-behind-the-throne guy named Thorstein and that he's going to help. With the purest insouciance, David and Charles enter Thorstein's castle, defeating every one of its security systems. They assassinate Thorstein's decoy and wait for Thorstein himself to arrive. After Thorstein arrives and quickly departs, David and Charles kidnap him from his helicopter and take him to Charles and Mavis's house. There the two men convince Thorstein to abandon his war against Terra, pointing out that he likely won't live long enough to become Emperor of Venus, that some unworthy stooge will get to enjoy that role. Having completed his mission, David steals a rocketship and returns to Terra, letting Conrad clean up the legal mess he has created. He joins Leina in catching up on news, beamed telepathically across interstellar space, regarding the movements of the Denebs. Several weeks later he and Leina are picked up and taken to meet Major Lomax of Terrestrial Intelligence. They are sealed inside a bunker alone with Lomax, who is in so much pain from an accident that he does not care whether he lives or dies. In order to walk out of the bunker alive, David and Leina must convince hidden observers that they are ordinary, if artful, telepaths and not, as has been hinted, zombies controlled by extraterrestrial beings (which, in fact, is what they are). Charles and Mavis are being subjected to an identical interrogation on Venus. The four zombies play their roles perfectly as their replacements appear on Terra and Venus, then, after the suspicions have been allayed, Lomax has an attack of intense pain. Feigning concern, David and Leina jump up as if to help and at the same time subject Lomax to a telepathic attack that makes him trigger the devices that kill all six of them. Lomax regains consciousness in a realm where all pain is gone. He learns of the Denebs, advanced creatures possessed of a collective inferiority complex that they hide under delusions of superiority so brittle that the mere thought of creatures equal to them sends them into a genocidal rage. The secret that must be kept from Humanity, lest the Denebs discover it, is that humans are the larval form of creatures vastly superior to the Denebs.

Yerkes was a marimba player, inventor, and recording manager who assembled many recording sessions in the early years of jazz. Many of the sessions organized by Yerkes used his name for the artist credit, including Yerkes' Jazarimba Orchestra and Yerkes' Marimbaphone Band on Columbia Records, which are estimated to have some of the best selling records of 1919 and 1921. Biography Yerkes began his recording career in 1906, performing on the xylophone. He founded the Yerkes Sound-Effects Company, which developed and marketed a pneumatic system to play chimes, featured in the Woolworth Building at time of construction. Yerkes joined the Betts & Betts company in 1915, and manufacture of his chime and bells mechanisms was transferred to that company. From 1917 until 1924 he was active as a recording contractor and manager for various dance bands. These groups often included his name, though he was not often an active contributor, musically. He was in charge of a group known as the Yerkes' Novelty Five (sometimes credited to \\"Novelty Five\\") which recorded for Vocalion Records. He subsequently was involved in The Happy Six, the Columbia Saxophone Sextette, who produced jazz-tinged records prolifically, both again for Columbia Records, and what is probably the musical group he is most associated with, Yerkes' S. S. Flotilla Orchestra. In 1924 he founded his own record label, Yerkes Dance Records. Other labels Yerkes' outfits appeared on include Edison, Gennett, Grey Gull, and Lyric. In 1918 he became an executive at Columbia Records, first as a \\"field manager\\", which duties corresponded roughly to that of a talent scout, and then as assistant to Columbia vice-president H. L. Wilson. He resigned this post in 1925. His final recordings as a solo artist were made in 1923. Style and influence Most of Yerkes' recordings have limited, if any, jazz content in the modern sense. Some of the performances of Yerkes' groups may be better classified as light classical, but many performances are an important link between ragtime and early, \\"rudimentary\\" jazz. However, he was among the early proponents of jazz as a serious form of art. He was also a proponent of blues music, and was a key figure in producing a concert at Aeolian Hall which debuted a symphony by Albert Chiaffarelli which incorporated themes by W. C. Handy. Although this was not the first attempt to present Handy's music in a concert setting, it was the first which pleased Handy. Yerkes often mixed classical musicians with jazz artists in his sessions, and as such he could be considered an originator of the \\"jazz fusion\\" concept. He played an important role in bringing Ted Lewis to Columbia.

G. Wells (1866‚Äì1946) was a prolific English writer in many genres, including the novel, history, politics, and social commentary, and textbooks and rules for war games. Wells called his political views socialist. The Fabian Society Wells was for a time a member of the socialist Fabian Society, but broke with them as his creative political imagination, matching the originality shown in his fiction, outran theirs. He later grew staunchly critical of them as having a poor understanding of economics and educational reform. He ran as a Labour Party candidate for London University in the 1922 and 1923 general elections after the death of his friend W. H. R. Rivers, but at that point his faith in the party was weak or uncertain. Class Social class was a theme in Wells's The Time Machine in which the Time Traveller speaks of the future world, with its two races, as having evolved from > the gradual widening of the present (19th century) merely temporary and > social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer ... Even now, does > not an East-end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to > be cut off from the natural surface of the earth? Again, the exclusive > tendency of richer people ... is already leading to the closing, in their > interest, of considerable portions of the surface of the land. About London, > for instance, perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against > intrusion. Wells has this very same Time Traveller, reflecting his own socialist leanings, refer in a tongue-in-cheek manner to an imagined world of stark class division as \\"perfect\\" and with no social problem unsolved. His Time Traveller thus highlights how strict class division leads to the eventual downfall of the human race: > Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich > had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life > and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed > problem, no social question left unsolved. In his book The Way the World is Going, Wells called for a non-Marxist form of socialism to be set up, that would avoid both class war and conflict between nations.H. G. Wells, The Way the World is Going. London, Ernest Benn, 1928, (p. 49). =Democracy= Fred Siegel of the center-right Manhattan Institute wrote of Wells's unflattering take on American democracy: \\"Wells was appalled by the decentralised nature of America's locally oriented party and country- courthouse politics. He was aghast at the flamboyantly corrupt political machines of the big cities, unchecked by a gentry that might uphold civilised standards. He thought American democracy went too far in providing leeway to the poltroons who ran the political machines and the 'fools' who supported them.\\" Siegel goes on to note Wells's dislike of America's not allowing African Americans to vote.Siegel, Fred (2013). The Revolt Against the Masses. New York: Encounter Books, pp. 6‚Äì7. World government His most consistent political ideal was the World State. He stated in his autobiography that from 1900 onward he considered a World State inevitable. He envisioned the state to be a planned society that would advance science, end nationalism, and allow people to progress by merit rather than birth. Wells's 1928 book The Open Conspiracy argued that groups of campaigners should begin advocating for a \\"world commonwealth\\", governed by a scientific elite, that would work to eliminate problems such as poverty and warfare.Wells, H. G. The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Doran, 1928), (pp. 28, 44, 196). In 1932, he told Young Liberals at the University of Oxford that progressive leaders must become liberal fascists or enlightened Nazis who would \\"compete in their enthusiasm and self- sacrifice\\" against the advocates of dictatorship.Mazower, Mark, Dark Continent:Europe's Twentieth Century. New York : A.A. Knopf, 1998. (p. 21‚Äì22). In 1940, Wells published a book called The New World Order that outlined his plan as to how a World Government would be set up. In The New World Order, Wells admitted that the establishment of such a government could take a long time, and be created in a piecemeal fashion.Partington, John S. Building Cosmopolis: The Political Thought of H. G. Wells. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003. , (p. 16). Eugenics Some of Wells's early science fiction works reflect his thoughts about the degeneration of humanity. Wells doubted whether human knowledge had advanced sufficiently for eugenics to be successful. In 1904 he discussed a survey paper by Francis Galton, co-founder of eugenics, saying, \\"I believe that now and always the conscious selection of the best for reproduction will be impossible; that to propose it is to display a fundamental misunderstanding of what individuality implies... It is in the sterilisation of failure, and not in the selection of successes for breeding, that the possibility of an improvement of the human stock lies\\". In his 1940 book The Rights of Man: Or What are we fighting for? Wells included among the human rights he believed should be available to all people, \\"a prohibition on mutilation, sterilization, torture, and any bodily punishment\\".Andrew Clapham, Human Rights:A Very Short Introduction. Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2007. (pp. 29-31). Race In 1901 Wells wrote Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought, which included the following extreme views: > And how will the new republic treat the inferior races? How will it deal > with the black? how will it deal with the yellow man? how will it tackle > that alleged termite in the civilized woodwork, the Jew? Certainly not as > races at all. It will aim to establish, and it will at last, though probably > only after a second century has passed, establish a world state with a > common language and a common rule. All over the world its roads, its > standards, its laws, and its apparatus of control will run.

Wells's 1906 book The Future in America, contains a chapter, \\"The Tragedy of Colour\\", which discusses the problems facing black Americans.H. G. Wells, The Future in America (New York and London: Harper and Brothers, 1906), p. 201 (Chs.11 & 12,). While writing the book, Wells met with Booker T. Washington, who provided him with much of his information for \\"The Tragedy of Colour\\".Virginia L. Denton, Booker T. Washington and the Adult Education Movement. University Press of Florida, 1993. . (p. 150, 231) Wells praised the \\"heroic\\" resolve of black Americans, stating he doubted if the US could: > show any thing finer than the quality of the resolve, the steadfast effort > hundreds of black and coloured men are making to-day to live blamelessly, > honourably, and patiently, getting for themselves what scraps of refinement, > learning, and beauty they may, keeping their hold on a civilization they are > grudged and denied. In his 1916 book What is Coming? Wells states, \\"I hate and despise a shrewish suspicion of foreigners and foreign ways; a man who can look me in the face, laugh with me, speak truth and deal fairly, is my brother, though his skin is as black as ink or as yellow as an evening primrose\\".What is Coming? A Forecast of things after the war, London, Cassell, 1916 (p. 256). In The Outline of History, Wells argued against the idea of \\"racial purity\\", stating: \\"Mankind from the point of view of a biologist is an animal species in a state of arrested differentiation and possible admixture . . . [A]ll races are more or less mixed.\\".H. G. Wells, The Outline of History, 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 110 (Ch. XII, ¬ß¬ß1‚Äì2). In 1931 Wells was one of several signatories to a letter in Britain (along with 33 British MPs) protesting against the death sentence passed upon the African-American Scottsboro Boys.Susan D. Pennybacker, From Scottsboro to Munich: race and political culture in 1930s Britain Princeton University Press, 2009. , (p. 29). In 1943 Wells wrote an article for the Evening Standard, \\"What A Zulu thinks of the English\\", prompted by receiving a letter from a Zulu soldier, Lance Coporal Aaron Hlope.\\"What a Zulu Thinks of the English\\" was reprinted as \\"The Rights of Man in South Africa\\" i '42 to '44: A Contemporary Memoir (London, Secker and Warburg, 1944) (p. 68‚Äì74).Robert Crossley, \\"Wells's Common Readers\\" in Patrick Parrinder and Christopher Rolfe, H. G. Wells Under Revision: Proceedings of the International Hg Wells Symposium London July 1986. Associated University Press, 1990. , (p. 247).John Huntington, Critical essays on H. G. Wells. G. K. Hall, 1991. (p. 176,177, 179) \\"What a Zulu thinks of the English\\" was a strong attack on anti-black discrimination in South Africa. Wells claimed he had \\"the utmost contempt and indignation for the unfairness of the handicaps put upon men of colour\\". Wells also denounced the South African government as a \\"petty white tyranny\\". Zionism Wells had given some moderate, unenthusiastic support for Territorialism before the First World War, but later became a bitter opponent of the Zionist movement in general. He saw Zionism as an exclusive and separatist movement which challenged the collective solidarity he advocated in his vision of a world state. No supporter of Jewish identity in general, Wells had in his utopian writings predicted the ultimate assimilation of the Jewish people.Cheyette, Bryan. Constructions of \\"the Jew\\" in English Literature and Society. Cambridge University Press, 1995, pp. 143‚Äì148Hamerow, Theodore S. Why we watched: Europe, America, and the Holocaust. W. W. Norton & Company, 2008, pp. 98‚Äì100, 219\\"Desirable Aliens: British Men of Letters on The Jews\\". The Review of Reviews Vol. XXXIII Jan‚ÄìJun 1906, p. 378 In notes to accompany his biographical novel A Man of Parts, David Lodge, describes how Wells came to regret his attitudes to the Jews as he became more aware of the extent of the Nazi atrocities. This included a letter of apology written to Chaim Weizmann for earlier statements he had made. First World War He supported Britain in the First World War,H. G. Wells: Why Britain Went To War (10 August 1914). The War Illustrated album de luxe. The story of the great European war told by camera, pen and pencil. The Amalgamated Press, London 1915 despite his many criticisms of British policy, and opposed, in 1916, moves for an early peace.Daily Herald, 27 May 1916 In an essay published that year he acknowledged that he could not understand those British pacifists who were reconciled to \\"handing over great blocks of the black and coloured races to the [German Empire] to exploit and experiment upon\\" and that the extent of his own pacifism depended in the first instance upon an armed peace, with \\"England keep[ing] to England and Germany to Germany\\". State boundaries would be established according to natural ethnic affinities, rather than by planners in distant imperial capitals, and overseen by his envisaged world alliance of states. In his book In the Fourth Year published in 1918 he suggested how each nation of the world would elect, \\"upon democratic lines\\" by proportional representation, an electoral college in the manner of the United States of America, in turn to select its delegate to the proposed League of Nations. This international body he contrasted with imperialism, not only the imperialism of Germany, against which the war was being fought, but also the imperialism, which he considered more benign, of Britain and France. His values and political thinking came under increasing criticism from the 1920s and afterwards.Experiment in Autobiography 556. Also chapter four of Future as Nightmare: H. G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians by Mark Robert Hillegas. Soviet Union The leadership of Joseph Stalin led to a change in his view of the Soviet Union even though his initial impression of Stalin himself was mixed. He disliked what he saw as a narrow orthodoxy and intransigence in Stalin. He did give him some praise saying in an article in the left-leaning New Statesman magazine, \\"I have never met a man more fair, candid, and honest\\" and making it clear that he felt the \\"sinister\\" image of Stalin was unfair or false. Nevertheless he judged Stalin's rule to be far too rigid, restrictive of independent thought, and blinkered to lead toward the Cosmopolis he hoped for.Experiment in Autobiography, pp. 215, 687‚Äì689 In the course of his visit to the Soviet Union in 1934, he debated the merits of reformist socialism over Marxism-Leninism with Stalin. Monarchy Wells was a republican\\"...the fall of the once-mighty Romanovs only fuelled republican sympathies elsewhere...in a letter to The Times, the celebrated author H. G. Wells asserted that ‚Äúthe time has come to rid ourselves of the ancient trappings of throne and sceptre\\". Justin C Vovk, Imperial Requiem: Four Royal Women and the Fall of the Age of Empires iUniverse, 2012. (p. 338) and an advocate for the creation of republican clubs in the UK. Other endeavours Wells brought his interest in Art & Design and politics together when he and other notables signed a memorandum to the Permanent Secretaries of the Board of Trade, among others. The November 1914 memorandum expressed the signatories concerns about British industrial design in the face of foreign competition. The suggestions were accepted, leading to the foundation of the Design and Industries Association.Raymond Plummer, Nothing Need be Ugly Design & Industries Assn. Jun 1985 In the 1920s he was an enthusiastic supporter of rejuvenation attempts by Eugen Steinach and others. He was a patient of Dr Norman Haire (perhaps a rejuvenated one) and in response to Haire's 1924 book Rejuvenation: the Work of Steinach, Voronoff, and others, Wells prophesied a more mature, graver society with 'active and hopeful children' and adults 'full of years' where none will be 'aged'.Diana Wyndham. Foreword by the Hon. Michael Kirby AC CMG. Sydney: , 2012, p. 117 In his later political writing, Wells incorporated into his discussions of the World State a notion of universal human rights that would protect and guarantee the freedom of the individual. His 1940 publication The Rights of Man laid the groundwork for the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.‚ÄòHuman Rights and Public Accountability in H. G. Wells‚Äô Functional World State‚Äô  John Partington. Academia.edu. Retrieved on 9 August 2013. Summary In the end Wells's contemporary political impact was limited, excluding his fiction's positivist stance on the leaps that could be made by physics towards world peace. His efforts regarding the League of Nations became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the Second World War, which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature. In his last book Mind at the End of its Tether (1945) he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea. He also came to refer to the Second World War era as \\"The Age of Frustration\\". References Wells, H G Category:H. G. Wells ","title":"Political views of H. G.

It is a 4,960 square-foot, two-story building, with eleven rooms, eight fireplaces, and five bathrooms.\\"Cherrydale History,\\" Furman University website. Mostly likely between 1852 and 1857, one George Washington Green built a modest, one-story farmhouse‚Äînow the rear wing of Cherrydale‚Äîat the foot of Piney Mountain in Greenville County. In 1857 Green sold the house and surrounding acreage to James Clement Furman (1809-1891), a Baptist clergyman and first president of Furman University, a school named for his father. Before 1860, Furman and his wife, Mary Glen Davis Furman, extensively remodeled the house, adding four rooms and a new entrance with a front porch, four Greek-Revival-style columns, and a three-bay portico. The Furmans eventually named the renovated house \\"Cherrydale,\\" though Greenvillians also called it Furman Hall.\\"Judith Bainbridge, \\"Cherrydale mansion dates back to 1850s,\\" Greenville News, February 23, 2008, City People, 1; Amy Clarke Burns, \\"Q&Amy;: Where does Cherrydale get its name?\\" Greenville News, October 16, 2014. Cherrydale was about three miles from the nineteenth- century Furman campus in downtown Greenville‚Äîtoo far for a daily commute‚Äîso Furman also maintained a residence near the university while his wife looked after the farm. Furman Hall Road, which runs behind the current shopping center, Cherrydale Pointe, reflects the alternate name. During the 1860s the house was surrounded by a 1,200 acre plantation that grew corn, cotton, peaches, apples, and cherries and which served as the primary source of Furman's income during the Civil War.Judith Bainbridge, \\"The History of Cherrydale,\\" Greenville News, June 28, 2017, 2A. After the death of Mary Furman in 1911, ownership passed to the Furman children. Mamie Furman Goldsmith lived there until the mid-1930s, after which it was used to store farm equipment.\\"Cherrydale History,\\" Furman University website; Abe Hardasty, \\"Home for Generations,\\" Greenville News, April 5, 2000, City People, 1. In 1939 Goldsmith sold the house to prominent textile manufacturer Eugene E. Stone III (1916-2004), who intended to demolish it before putting up a clothing manufacturing plant. His wife, Allene Wyman \\"Linky\\" Stone (1912-1998), persuaded him instead to restore and modernize the house, which was in poor condition and lacked plumbing, central heating, and electricity.Bainbridge, 15. Stone's Cherrydale plant, which he built nearby, was at one time the largest apparel plant in the world under one roof. John Nolan, A Guide to Historic Greenville (Charleston: The History Press, 2008), 70. After Stone had acquired Umbro International, he extensively renovated Cherrydale in 1997 for use as a corporate guest house. The following year Umbro closed all its U. S. manufacturing operations, and the shopping center developer AIG Baker purchased the Cherrydale property. The Stones then donated Cherrydale to Furman University.Bainbridge, 15; \\"Stone Manufacturing Company\\". On March 7‚Äì8, 1999, the university (after overcoming significant logistical problems) moved the house more than three miles north to its campus off Poinsett Highway (U.S. 276).Deb Richardson-Moore, \\"Moving Mansion a logistics lesson,\\" Greenville News, February 10, 1999, 1B. In 1958, Furman University had moved its campus from roughly four miles south of Cherrydale to somewhat more than three miles north of it. Cherrydale was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1976; but following the relocation, it was removed on December 8, 2005.Cherrydale-National Register; Cherrydale nomination form. Although the National Register generally excludes structures moved from their original locations, the Greenville County Historic Preservation Commission has argued that Cherrydale satisfies an exemption for structures moved after their period of historic significance and that Cherrydale retains \\"a high degree of architectural integrity.\\"National Register Criteria; Greenville County, South Carolina Historic Resources Survey, June 2013, 95.

The episode aired on March 9, 2015, on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. The episode received acclaim from critics, with Jonathan Banks's performance being singled out for praise. Plot =Opening= In a flashback, Mike arrives by train at Albuquerque's Alvarado Transportation Center. After re-bandaging a fresh bullet wound in his shoulder, he meets his daughter-in-law, Stacey (the woman he previously saw outside her house), and her daughter, Kaylee. Stacey and Mike briefly discuss the death of Matt, Mike's son and Stacey's husband. Stacey questions whether Matt might have been involved in something illegal, based on his behavior during their final encounter, but Mike brushes off her concerns. After the meeting, he questions a cabdriver as to \\"how well\\" he knows the neighborhood, and is later seen having his shoulder wound treated by a local veterinarian, Dr. Caldera, who inquires as to whether Mike might be interested in any \\"work\\", which Mike declines. =Main story= The police officers who met Mike at his house are from Philadelphia. Detectives Sanders (whom Mike knows) and Abbasi attempt to question Mike, who requests a lawyer and gives them Jimmy's card. Mike asks Jimmy to \\"accidentally\\" spill his coffee on Abbasi so he can steal Abbasi's notebook and investigate how much the police know about him, but Jimmy declines. In the interrogation, the detectives explain they're investigating the death of Mike's son Matt, a rookie police officer who was ambushed and killed when responding to a shots- fired call. In addition, Matt's partners, Troy Hoffman and Jack Fenske, were shot and killed in a similar ambush six months later. The detectives know Hoffman and Fenske were dirty, and suspect Mike of killing them since he left Philadelphia shortly after their deaths. Jimmy moves to end the interrogation and spills his coffee on Abbasi. Mike pretends to help Abbasi clean his jacket and steals the notebook from his breast pocket. At home, Mike discovers from the notebook that Stacey summoned the detectives to Albuquerque. She tells Mike that after she arrived in Albuquerque, she discovered several thousand dollars hidden in the lining of one of her suitcases. She decided to report it, hoping it would lead to the identification of Matt's killer. She suggests that she believes Matt might have been dirty, which angers Mike. In a flashback to Philadelphia, Mike breaks into a police car parked outside a bar. He then enters the bar, and after a few drinks, confronts Fenske and Hoffman, telling them \\"I know it was you\\". A few hours later, Mike is the last customer at closing time, and announces to the bartender that he plans to move to Albuquerque. As he staggers home, Fenske and Hoffman drive up in their patrol car, offer him a ride, and help him into the back seat. They take his handgun and ask him what he meant when he talked to them earlier. Apparently still drunk, Mike tells them he knows they killed Matt. They drive to an abandoned factory. Fenske and Hoffman plan to kill Mike and make it look like suicide, but Mike reveals that he's not really drunk. Fenske attempts to shoot him, but the gun Fenske took from Mike is empty. Mike shoots Fenske three times using the pistol he hid in the backseat earlier and retrieved while pretending to be drunk. Hoffman tries to draw his pistol, but Mike's shot hits him in the head. Fenske then draws his service pistol and fires twice, with one round hitting Mike in the left shoulder. Mike returns fire and hits Fenske in the neck. Fenske tries to crawl away, but Mike steps on his leg to flip Fenske over. Fenske raises a hand as if to beg for his life, but Mike kills him with a shot to the head. Mike picks up his unloaded handgun and walks off, preparing to depart for Albuquerque. In Albuquerque, Mike admits to Stacey that corruption was rampant in Matt's precinct, including Mike himself. When Hoffman started accepting bribes from a gang he offered to cut Matt in. Matt asked for Mike's advice, and Mike suggested that not taking the money would mark him as a whistleblower, which could endanger him and his family, so it would be better to accept it. Mike admitted to Matt that he participated in the corruption, leaving Matt upset that the father he looked up to is a criminal. Matt ultimately accepted the money, but didn't spend any, yet Hoffman and Fenske murdered him anyway because his hesitation before accepting made them fear he'd turn them in later. Mike is tormented over corrupting Matt for nothing, saying in tears of anguish \\"I broke my boy!\\" Stacey asks who killed Hoffman and Fenske, and Mike says \\"You know what happened. The question is: can you live with it?\\" Production The script was the first-ever television script written by Gordon Smith, who was previously a writer's assistant on Breaking Bad. It was directed by Adam Bernstein, who directed several episodes of Breaking Bad. Reception Jonathan Banks received critical acclaim for his performance in the episode, which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. Upon airing, the episode received 2.57 million American viewers, and an 18‚Äì49 rating of 1.3.

The site's consensus reads, \\"In a departure from the existing Better Call Saul narrative, 'Five-O' provides essential backstory for Mike's character, delivered in a gripping, award-worthy performance by Jonathan Banks.\\" On Ranker, it is currently the third-best rated episode of the series so far, behind only season 3's \\"Chicanery\\" and season 5's \\"Bagman\\".https://www.ranker.com/list/best-episodes-of-better-call-saul/ranker- tv?ref=lists_about&pos;=5&a;=0&l;=81616214&ltype;=n&g;=0 Roth Cornet of IGN gave it a score of 9.7 out of 10, praising the performance of Jonathan Banks, the episode's pacing and interwoven storylines, as well as the final scene of the episode. She concluded, \\"Better Call Saul continues to deliver some of the best of what television has to offer as both those familiar with Breaking Bad and new viewers alike were given a shattering look at Mike's tragic past.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com also highly praised the performance of Banks, and wrote it is worthy of an Emmy, calling it \\"one of the best episodes to date of 2015's best new show to date\\". \\"Five-O\\" received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Jonathan Banks was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, Gordon Smith was nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, and Kelley Dixon was nominated for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series.

Early life Van Cortlandt was born in 1699 and christened on April 23, 1699. He was the only surviving son born to Jacobus Van Cortlandt (1658‚Äì1739) and the former Eva de Vries Philipse (b. 1660). His older sister, Margaret Van Cortlandt, was married to Abraham de Peyster, a son of Abraham de Peyster, and his younger sister, Mary Van Cortlandt, was married to Peter Jay (the brother of Van Cortlandt's wife). Mary and Peter were parents of New York State Assemblyman James Jay, and John Jay, a Governor of New York and the 1st Chief Justice of the United States. His father served as the 30th and 33rd Mayor of New York City. His paternal grandparents were Flemish born Annetje \\"Anna\\" (n√©e Loockermans) Van Cortlandt, and Dutch born Captain Olof Stevense van Cortlandt, who arrived in New Amsterdam in 1637, a soldier and bookkeeper that rose to high colonial ranks through his work with the Dutch West India Company, eventually serving many terms as burgomaster and alderman. Among his extended family was uncle Stephanus van Cortlandt (who married Gertruy van Schuyler) and aunt Maria van Cortlandt (who married Jeremias van Rensselaer). His maternal grandparents were Margaret (n√©e Hardenbroeck) de Vries and Peter Rudolphus de Vries. After his biological grandfather's death, his grandmother remarried to Frederick Philipse, the 1st Lord of Philipsborough Manor, who adopted his mother Eva and changed her last name to Philipse upon their marriage (which produced another eleven children).Morris, F.O., Philipse of Philipsburgh, in The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, vol. 10 (1856) Married 1662, name listed as \\"Philipszen\\", New York Genealogical & Biographical Record (quarterly), 1875, selected extracts After his maternal grandmother's death , his adopted grandfather married his paternal aunt, Catherine (n√©e van Cortlandt) Derval, the widow of Johannes Derval. Career Upon his father's death in 1739, Frederick inherited all of his father's lands, known as Van Cortlandt Manor, which had been owned by his family since 1691 and expanded under his father's ownership. Frederick's father had established a wheat growing and processing business which included a saw mill, grist mill, and a fleet of draft boats that carried the flour from the south end of his lake down Tibbetts Brook and out to the Harlem and Hudson Rivers to market. In 1748, Van Cortlandt began construction on a large family mansion that is today known as the Van Cortlandt House, the oldest surviving building in the Bronx.

In the past five years, Red Star Rescue has saved and sheltered 64,000 pets. History The Red Star Rescue project was initiated in 1916 after the War Department recruited the American Humane Association to help save hundreds of thousands of horses that were injured during World War I in Europe. Red Star Rescue carried out animal rescue missions during the September 11 attacks, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Sandy. During Hurricane Sandy, the American Humane Association's Red Star Rescue team delivered over 100,000 pounds of food, supplies, and medicine to the areas impacted by the storm. In 2013, Red Star Rescue was invited by the State of Oklahoma to provide assistance in the aftermath of a tornado.

The building is mixed-use for apartments, office space, retail and is a venue for events. It is currently the fifth tallest building in Grand Rapids. History =19th century= The location of McKay Tower is where the first non-Native American marriage took place in Grand Rapids in 1834, only a few years after settlers arrived and the area was surveyed as part of the Michigan Territory. The marriage took place in a cabin that was owned by the American pioneer, Joel Guild which involved his daughter Harriet Guild and Barney Burton. The first town meeting was also held at the cabin that had a total number of nine voters. =20th century= The Wonderly Building was then built on the location in 1890. The first two floors of McKay Tower were then built in their current manner in 1915 and the building was then known as the Grand Rapids National Bank. Another 11 floors were added between 1921 and 1927. In 1942, the tower was bought from the Grand Rapids National Bank by Grand Rapids businessman and politician, Frank D. McKay. In the early 1940s, two additional mechanical floors were added to the tower. From the completion of the tower in 1927 to 1983, the McKay Tower was the tallest building in Grand Rapids until the completion of the Amway Grand tower. The McKay Tower was also the tallest office building in Grand Rapids until Bridgewater Place was completed in 1993. =21st century= In 2000, the University of Michigan, which acquired the building from McKay's will, sold the tower. The building was sold to Greystone Associates later that year. Mark Roller, an internet businessman, purchased the tower in 2006 for $7.8 million, who later listed the property for sale in 2009 for $11 million. McKay Tower was sold to Jonathan L.

(Photo: Daniel Andruczyk) The Hybrid Illinois Device for Research and Applications (HIDRA) is a medium-sized toroidal magnetic fusion device currently being assembled within the Center for Plasma Material Interactions in the Department of Nuclear, Plasma and Radiological Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, United States. It is anticipated that HIDRA will have first plasma by mid- September 2015 and start full experimental campaigns by December of that year. HIDRA is the former WEGA classical stellarator that was operated at the Max- Planck Institut f√ºr Plasmaphsyik in Greifswald Germany from 2001 to 2013. A unique aspect of HIDRA is that it can not only operate as a stellarator but also as a tokamak, hence the hybrid designation. In fact it should be possible to operate the two modes simultaneously. It is planned to operate up to 30 minutes of continuous plasma, with up to 60 minutes in the future and will concentrate on understanding the complex relationship between the plasma and materials inside the vacuum vessel of a fusion device  History  HIDRA is probably the most well traveled fusion devices in the world. From its beginnings in France it has operated in 3 countries and 4 cities. The research goals of the device have dramatically changed over the years from doing wave heating studies, to being a testbed for one of the world's most sophisticated fusion devices and now to studying the way plasmas interact with the inside wall and materials of fusion devices. In fact it will be the first toroidal fusion-relevant device that will be dedicated to the study of plasma wall (PWI) and plasma material interactions (PMI). = Centre d‚ÄôEtudes Nucl√©aires (1972‚Äì1982) = HIDRA, in fact, started off as a different machine at the Centre d‚ÄôEtudes Nucl√©aires in Grenoble, France in 1972. Back then it was called WEGA with construction of the device from 1972 to 1975. WEGA was a joint project between CEA Grenoble and the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Plasmaphysik in Germany to study RF heating and lower hybrid heating. There were three vacuum vessel that were built, two tokamak and stellarator. WEGA primarily operated as a tokamak from 1975 to 1982 despite plans to install the stellarator vessel in 1976 (repairs were needed on the helical coil insulation). Electron and ion temperatures achieved were, Te = 600 ‚Äì 900 eV and, Ti = 150 ‚Äì 250 eV. Densities of ne = 1.6√ó1019 m‚àí3 with a plasma current of IP = 45 ‚Äì 60 kA and heating power, Pohm = 100 ‚Äì 130 kW and, PRF = 100 kW. Typical pulse duration was, Œît = 5 ‚Äì 15 ms and an energy confinement time, œÑE = 3 ‚Äì 5 ms. = Institut f√ºr Plasmaforschung (1982‚Äì2000) = The WEGA stellarator being assembled at IPF Stuttgart. (Photo: Courtesy of IPP Greifswald) In 1982 WEGA moved from Grenoble to the University of Stuttgart in Germany. Unfortunately in Stuttgart it seems that WEGA was not used much. There is not a lot of information from this time and it is very difficult to see what results came out of this 18-year time period. The issues seem to be a lack of enough heating power and cooling. However, IPF did have the stellarator vacuum vessel installed and some of the first magnetic flux surface measurements were performed. = Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Plasmaphysik (2001‚Äì2013) = From 2000 to 2001 WEGA moved from Stuttgart to Greifswald. At this stage a new institute had been built in the former East German city to stimulate economic, scientific and educational growth in the region. MPIPP Greifswald was designated to house the brand new modular stellarator W7-X. While W7-X was being built WEGA was brought in to be the machine where much of the diagnostic, heating and control work for W7-X would be tested and perfected. It also provided a valuable tool in the training and teaching of future generations of fusion and plasma scientists and engineers. In fact, though the name was the same the acronym for WEGA changed to \\"Wendelstein Experiment in Greifswald f√ºr Ausbildung\\" the Wendelstein experiment in Greifswald for Training. WEGA's magnetic coil systems were run via transformer and rectifier sets that allowed steady state operations. This made WEGA unique among the smaller toroidal fusion devices that normally are pulsed, and only the larger devices such as LHD and W7-X have that kind of steady state capability. Some of the achievements on WEGA include the development of an OXB heating scheme that allows ECRH heating above the cut off density for the electrons in the plasma. This allowed densities almost 100 times higher to be achieved. The W7-X control system was tested on WEGA showing the real time capability of measuring plasma parameters and control of the machine. It was demonstrated, that despite being a stellarator, a plasma current could be driven via microwave heating of the plasma. In 2013 the last experiments were performed and WEGA was slowly decommissioned as operations for W7-X started to ramp up. WEGA was either going to be scrapped or if a suitable research group was found would be donated. = Center for Plasma Material Interactions (2014‚Äìpresent) = HIDRA being assembled at the University of Illinois Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. (Photo: Daniel Andruczyk) With W7-X operations starting in 2014, the space occupied by WEGA and its power systems was taking up much needed real-estate for the Thompson Scattering system and a cryogenic pellet injection system. During the 2013 SOFE conference, Daniel Andruczyk, a former Post-Doc on WEGA, met with some former colleagues and it was suggested that the University of Illinois could potentially take WEGA to the USA. After a year of negotiating between the director of the Center for Plasma Material Interactions, David Ruzic, the University and IPP, the funds were secured to make it happen. Andruczyk was brought on to lead the project of dismantling and shipping WEGA to the Urbana-Champaign Campus in Illinois. Upon arrival the Machine was renamed the Hybrid Illinois Device for Research and Applications. The Hybrid part being that it still has the tokamak capabilities, not only the stellarator ones. It took nearly 8 weeks over the autumn of 2014 of dismantling the device in Germany and was packed and shipped by Rhenus to the US in October. By early 4 November shipping containers worth of fusion device arrived by flat bed-truck to the University of Illinois at the Center for Plasma Material Interactions. Aside from lab personnel, the universities Facilities and services division were heavily involved in helping to off load, move in and assemble much of the larger, heavier components. Construction began in earnest with the transformers and rectifiers for the helical and toroidal magnetic coils moving in first. Once these were established then the base was brought in and the yokes, center-stack, half-tori and vertical field coils all installed over the next ten days. From there it took another 18 months of getting everything else assembled and hooked up. The 20 kV transformer needed for running the coils was made by Cooper electronics and the switching mechanism that to switch it all on was supplied by G&W.; Quad- Plus was brought in to commission the rectifiers which allows the field shaping of the device. In this time water cooling tanks were brought in and installed and the universities pipe fitters built the cooling system for the machine and installed the water pump. The control system was written by senior undergrad and grad students and allows the machine to be controlled from one computer via a LabView program. This also sends out the trigger signals that are needed to fire the various data acquisition and diagnostic systems.  Current Status  In April 2016, HIDRA had its first plasma, a simple glow plasma discharge, during the Nuclear, Plasma and Radiological Engineering Departments Open house. With nearly 100 dignitaries and guests including the head of department and Dean of Engineering the HIDRA team was able to demonstrate that all the working components of the device we installed and running and that operations were able to begin. iota = 1/3 magnetic flux surfaces showing the islands. (Photo: Daniel Andruczyk) The first set of data was the characterization of the magnetic flux lines on the machine. This used an in-house electron beam and fluorescing rod method, which was originally developed on WEGA for W7-X, to see what the magnetic field shape, and thus plasma shape, would look like. The beam would be scanned across the minor radius of the vacuum vessel and the rod swept through the vessel. Anywhere an electron beam hit the rod it would light up. a sensitive astronomical camera was used to image the flux surfaces and compare them to a ray-tracing code to see the validity of the plasma and any error fields present. Some gas could also be bled in to visually see the electron beams themselves. Magnetron Plasmas First plasma in HIDRA. This is with helium as the gas.

Bry's eponymous debut album, Bry, was produced by Greg Wells and released on 11 November 2016. At the time of the album's release, Bry was opening for Twenty One Pilots on the European leg of their Emotional Roadshow World Tour.  Career  Bry originally performed under the name \\"Bribry\\". He operated without a manager, booking agent or record label for four years, booking a trip overseas, tweet his intention to be in a certain spot in a city at a set time, and then wait with his guitar to see who might show up. This approach drew 80 people to Central Park and 150 more to Singapore. This first-hand market research encouraged the singer to book tours of more conventional venues, and led to sell-out tours of Australia and the UK in 2013 and 2014. In late 2014, a word-of-mouth recommendation from a friend led Jonny Quinn, Snow Patrol drummer and founder (alongside bandmates Gary Lightbody and Nathan Connolly) of Polar Patrol Publishing, to check out the singer-songwriter's YouTube channel. In 2015, Bry toured the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. In November 2015, it was announced on his secondary YouTube channel that he would be flying to Los Angeles to record his debut studio album with producer Greg Wells, who has produced for Katy Perry, Twenty One Pilots and Adele. The album, eponymously titled Bry, was released on 11 November 2016. In February 2016, Bry announced his next UK and Ireland tour that would have 18 dates throughout April. In September 2016, it was announced that he would be supporting Twenty One Pilots on their European tour.  Philanthropy  From January 2013 to early 2015, Bry fronted an online campaign known as Cut Cake Not Wrists, a charity that supported young people going through self-harm. In May 2015 it was announced in a video that the campaign had ended for a number of reasons. However, Bry continues to raise awareness for mental health issues and a number of other causes, including LGBT rights and a cancer charity in memory of his friend Ross, who died from cancer in 2010.

Peirce (died 1944) was an American civil engineer and metallurgist, who pioneered copper production in the early 20th century. Among his achievements was the , invented with Elias Anton Cappelen Smith.  Life  He joined the Baltimore Copper Smelting & Rolling Company in 1890, becoming vice president in 1895, and later, president of the company. Under his management, the company became one of the major copper producer of the United States. In 1928, the company merged with five other copper companies, to create the Revere Copper Company. Described as \\"one of the foremost metallurgists of his time\\", Peirce became the vice president, director and a member of the Executive Committee of Revere from its incorporation in 1928 until his resignation in 1933.  Invention of the Peirce‚ÄìSmith converter  Longitudinal and cross sections of a Peirce‚ÄìSmith converter The , developed in 1908 with Elias Anton Cappelen Smith, significantly improved the converting of copper matte. Before this invention, the converter was a cylindrical barrel, lined with an acid refractory lining, made of sand and clay. It was developed by two French engineers, Pierre Manh√®s and from 1880 to 1884. Their copper- converting process, named the Manh√®s‚ÄìDavid process, was directly derived from the Bessemer process. In this horizontal chemical reactor, where air was injected into copper matte, a molten sulfide material containing iron, sulphur and copper, to become molten blister, an alloy containing 99% copper. But the basic slag produced during the blowing combined with the acid silica refractory lining, thereby causing a very short lifetime of the lining. By developing a basic refractory material adapted to the matte refining process (in magnesia bricks), Peirce and his engineer Smith found a way to drastically increase the lifetime of the lining. It has been stated that, in some cases, the process allowing an increase from 10 to 2500 tons of copper produced without relining the converters.William Peirce and E.A.

October 2008 Volume 60, No. 10) A reduction of the cost of copper converting from 15‚Äì20 USD to 4‚Äì5 USD has been stated.Saga in Steel and Concrete, Kenneth O. Bjork, Norwegian-American Historical Association, 1947, pp. 249‚Äì250 The Peirce-Smith converter quickly replaced the Manh√®s‚ÄìDavid converter: by March 1912, the Peirce-Smith Converting Co claimed that \\"over 80% of the copper produced in [the U.S.] is being converted either in P-S type converters or on basic lining, under license, in the old acid shells\\". It is still in use today, although the process has been significantly improved since then. In 2010, with 250 converters working in the world, the Peirce-Smith converters refine 90% of the copper matte.  Honors In 1931, Peirce, still president of the Baltimore Copper Smelting & Rolling Co., as well as being President of the Peirce-Smith Converter Company and vice president of the American Smelting & Refining Company, is awarded of the James Douglas medal, for \\"his numerous improvements in devices for smelting, refining, and rolling copper\\".

The soup is made with boiled water, diced potatoes, onions, tomato, chile verde and oregano. Tomato puree or dehydrated chicken broth may also be added to the mix as condiments. The cheese is added only at the end, once the other are ingredients are boiled, to prevent gratination. It is most usually prepared with dices of queso fresco or queso cotija; the contact with the boiling soup heats the cheese and gives it a gummy, chewable texture; in turn it melts slightly, giving the soup a characteristic flavor.

Biography Pieter van Hanselaere was born in Ghent on 31 July 1786; he studied at the Academy of Ghent with Pierre Van Huffel, and then in Paris at the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture with Jacques-Louis David, in 1809. In 1814 he was back in Ghent and competed for the prize in historical painting; winning it gave him the funds to travel to Italy. In his early days he specialized in portraiture and achieved a high level of technical perfection. Due to the Napoleonic wars he was not able to leave for Italy until 1816; when he did, he first stayed in Rome and painted portraits of some high-ranking officials, before moving to Naples and achieving success there as well, becoming the painter for the royal court. In 1828 he returned to Ghent, where a position as professor had opened up, and competed with two others for the position; Suzanna and the elders was one of his contributions, and he was offered the position in 1829. At the Academy of Ghent Cornelis Kimmel (1804-1877) and (1816‚Äì1889) were among his pupils. Van Hanselaere exhibited in many cities and had amassed a considerable fortune, allowing him to buy three houses in the Rue Courte du Marais. By 1844 he had finished his pi√®ce capitale, a 24 by 16 foot painting depicting Philip van Artevelde and his army leaving Ghent to fight Louis II, Count of Flanders (1381). Critical response of the large and confused piece was negative, and van Hanselaere never fully recuperated from the disappointment. The death of his only son hastened him towards his death, on 10 March 1862. Work of his was in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in 1890.

She was mayor of Sloviansk from 2010 until 2014, when pro-Russian separatists occupied the city. She was imprisoned by the separatists because she refused to fully co-operate with them, freed by Ukrainian forces, but then imprisoned again by Ukrainian authorities for alleged collusion with the Donetsk People's Republic. Life She was born as Nelya Ihorivna Lytvyn () on 13 September 1962 in Sloviansk, then part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Shtepa entered Sloviansk State Pedagogical Institute in 1979, and began her career as a teacher in 1984. She later held administrative positions, and became a headmistress. During these years, she was a member of the Communist Party. She began to work for Komsomol in 1987. From 1990, she worked in various enterprises as a sales director, and then in some charities. In the 2000s, she joined the Party of Regions. She was elected mayor of Sloviansk on 31 October 2010, winning more than 60% of the vote. =Mayor of Sloviansk during Siege of Sloviansk= Amidst rising unrest in eastern and southern Ukraine, separatist militants seized a police station in the city of Sloviansk on 13 April 2014. At the time of the seizure, Mayor Shtepa spoke in support of militants, saying that they were local residents, and that she agreed that a referendum on the status of the Donbass region should be held. On the same day, the Ukrainian government launched a military operation to reclaim government buildings occupied by pro-Russian militants across the region. As this operation began, Shtepa said that she did not actually support the separatists, and that their actions were \\"an occupation\\". She said that she had only pretended to support them, in an effort to free dozens of hostages held in Sloviansk city buildings that the separatists had seized. Separatist militant Vyacheslav Ponomarev declared himself \\"people's mayor\\" of Sloviansk on 14 April, apparently usurping Shetpa. On the following day, she said that the Sloviansk militants were \\"green men\\", a reference to the unmarked Russian soldiers that seized Crimea in the lead up to its annexation by Russia in February‚ÄìMarch 2014. Two days later, she told journalists that many in her city desired more autonomy for the regional government, but that more than 75 percent of Sloviansk residents wanted to remain part of Ukraine. Nelya Shtepa disappeared on 18 April. At the time, Amnesty International reported that she had attempted to meet with Vyacheslav Ponomarev at the Sloviansk city administration building, and that she had likely been held captive by Ponomarev. In Shtepa's own description of what happened, revealed months later after her eventual release, militants entered her home late at night on 17 April. They forced her into a car, and took her to the city administration building. Ponomarev attempted to force Shtepa to sign a letter of resignation. She refused, and he then beat her into submission. Subsequently, she was forced to voice support for the separatists in a number of interviews with the Russian media, whilst being held captive in the basement of the city administration building. Shtepa was not freed until 5 July 2014, when Ukrainian forces retook Sloviansk. She was then detained by members of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on 11 July for allegedly colluding with the separatists, taken to a prison in Kharkiv, and charged under articles 110 (violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine) and 258 (creation of a terrorist organisation) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The Kharkiv regional prosecutors' office announced on 31 October 2014 that it was seeking a sentence of life imprisonment. Amnesty International and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) have expressed concerns about the fairness of the judicial proceedings against Shtepa. Journalist and Euromaidan activist Irma Krat, who was also held with Shtepa by Vyacheslav Ponomarev, has refuted the charges against Shtepa, and has volunteered to speak on her behalf. One of the main witnesses for Shtepa's defence, her deputy mayor, was abducted on 30 January 2015, and later found dead. This development was labelled \\"concerning\\" by an OHCHR report. She was released from prison on 20 September 2017, and placed under house arrest. A few weeks later, she was said to have \\"disappeared\\". As of mid of 2018, she was known to visit her doctor for intravenous therapy due to heart attack. =After Siege of Sloviansk= Shtepa was a candidate on the national list for the Opposition Platform ‚Äî For Life party in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election.https://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2019/wp407pt001f01=919pf7201=16878.html In this election the party won 37 seats on the nationwide party list (and 6 constituency seats), but Shtepa was not elected.CEC counts 100 percent of vote in Ukraine's parliamentary elections, Ukrinform (26 July 2019) Results of the extraordinary elections of the People's Deputies of Ukraine 2019, Ukrayinska Pravda (21 July 2019) On 24 October 2019, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ukraine should pay Shtepa 3,600 euros in compensation because it violated her right to a trial \\"within a reasonable time\\".https://glavcom.ua/news/shtepa-znovu-balotuvatimetsya-v-meri- slovyanska-654727.html The court turned down her request of 60,100 euros compensation, finding the claims excessive and unfounded.https://glavcom.ua/news/shtepa-znovu-balotuvatimetsya-v-meri- slovyanska-654727.html In January 2020, Shtepa announced that she intended to run for election to become mayor of Sloviansk in the 2020 Ukrainian local elections.https://glavcom.ua/news/shtepa-znovu-balotuvatimetsya-v-meri- slovyanska-654727.html She was indeed nominated by the Party for Peace and Development, Shtepa also leads the electoral list of this party for the Sloviansk City Council.https://m.tyzhden.ua/publication/248192 References External links * Who is Nelya Shtepa?

First station The original Parkside station opened on 17 September 1830 as part of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR;), and was one of the oldest passenger railway stations in the world. These early intermediate stations were often little more than halts, usually positioned where the railway was crossed by a road or turnpike. This probably accounts for variations in the names of these stopping places, this station was located where Parkside Lane (later called Warrington Road, a road between Wigan and Warrington) crossed the line. Quick (2019) reports that the station was variously known as Parkside, Park Side and Parkside & Wigan Junction in its first decade of existence before settling on Parkside. Huskisson Memorial 1913 During the opening ceremony the MP William Huskisson was killed in an accident at the station. A memorial to Huskisson was paid for by the railway and erected at the trackside in 1831. The memorial has subsequently been granted listed building status and remains at the site of the original station near Newton-le-Willows. Parkside was one of only two intermediate stops on the L&MR; where locomotives could be fuelled and watered (the other was at ), it was well placed to do so being about halfway along the line, from and from . In the early days the water was pre-heated by a lineside boiler. The boiler's chimney can be seen on the right in Bury's print. Bury's Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 1831 The Wigan Branch Railway (WBR) opened on 3 September 1832 forming a junction with the L&MR; to the East of Parkside station with an east curve (that is towards Manchester). A west curve and a flat crossing of the L&MR; had been planned, and authorised, but weren't built because of financial considerations. One of these unconstructed sections had been intended to meet a similarly unconstructed east curve of the Warrington and Newton Railway which had also not been constructed for the same reason. The lack of these two curves made through south-north journeys very difficult, for example a train or carriages coming from Warrington in the south heading to Wigan in the north would have to pass through Newton Junction station, reverse onto the mainline, pass through the station again, pass through Parkside station, then reverse again to take the WBR, avoiding any interference with the regular and busy traffic already using the L&MR.; This would have undoubtedly have caused operational problems and therefore Parkside became the terminus station for trains on the WBR. There is doubt about how any transfer of passengers took place between the lines, it is unlikely that WBR trains ran from their single-track railway into the station on the L&MR; double track, they would have had to reverse to do so, the WBR train likely stopped before the junction and passengers simply walked to the L&MR; station. Sweeney (2008) records there were complaints in October 1832 that passengers had to wait without shelter when changing trains, and the railways jointly funded the building of a waiting shed. In 1834 the WBR became part of the North Union Railway (NUR). By 1837 there were 5 tracks at Parkside, Up and Down L&MR; lines, Up and Down NUR lines (the NUR had by now installed its second running line) and a siding which ran into the point of the junction, this siding was probably used for an engine shed. The illustration by Tate shows the new station with the four lines running away from the junction to where the first station was located before the overbridge in the distance, also to be seen are the two NUR lines going to the right towards Wigan. Parkside Station from Views on the London & North Western Railway - Tait, 1848 After the passenger station was moved to the junction this first station remained open as a goods station, being labelled a \\"Luggage Station\\" on the 1849 OS map. It is not recorded when the goods station closed but by the 1894 edition of the Ordnance Survey the site was labelled as a pumping station with a couple of sidings leading into it. Second station On 31 October 1838, the station was relocated approximately east, to be at the junction of lines with the NUR which opened on the same day through to Preston. The station was constructed jointly by the L&MR;, NUR and Grand Junction Railway (GJR) which had by that time absorbed the Warrington and Newton Railway. The GJR apparently contributed to the cost of the new station as an alternative to having to build a direct connection between the Warrington and Wigan lines. It was a two-storey building with a booking office, general waiting room, a ladies room and offices. The station was gas-lit in 1841, the three companies shared the cost of the installation. This new station did not solve all the traffic problems, trains from the Liverpool, or Warrington (the east curve at Newton Junction had opened on 4 July 1837) directions still had to reverse at Parkside in order to access the northbound NUR line and vice versa. The Tate illustration does not appear to show any interconnection between the L&MR; lines on the left and the NUR lines on the right, indeed it shows passengers making their way across the lines from one side of the station to the other, indicating a pedestrian changing of trains. In 1845 the L&MR; and others amalgamated into an expanded Grand Junction Railway and a year later the GJR itself amalgamated to form the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;). Junctions There were two junctions associated with Parkside station; *one to the east of the original station facing Manchester, to which the station was relocated in 1838, this junction was known at different times as Parkside East Junction, Parkside Manchester Junction, and since at least 2005, Parkside Junction. *one to the west of both stations which opened in 1847 facing (later called Newton-le-Willows) and Liverpool was known variously as Parkside West Junction, Parkside & Liverpool Junction, and since at least 2005, Newton-le- Willows Junction. The two curves from the above junctions joined to the north of Parkside where station was built, this junction was known initially as Preston Junction but then became Lowton Junction by which name it is still known. The lines from through the west facing junction and Lowton junction formed a secondary West Coast Main Line (WCML) route that was electrified as part of the WCML modernisation which was completed in 1974. The east facing curve and the main line between and Castlefield Junction in Manchester was electrified on 9 December 2013. Services What follows describes the passenger services that ran through Parkside, there were also freight trains, both owned by the companies and private operators. =1830-1832= The L&MR; started regular passenger services on 17 September 1830, they ran three first class trains in each direction daily and introduced second class trains a week later running two daily in each direction, there were fewer trains on Sundays. The Company policy at the time was only to publish departure times from the termini, and there were no intermediate stations only recognised stopping places, of which Parkside was one as locomotives needed to take on water here. Quick (2019) documents the lack of timetables at this time, it is known how many trains ran but not where and when they stopped on-route. the L&MR; did publish fares from intermediate stations even if they didn't provide times, in 1832 it cost 3s 0d first class to Liverpool or Manchester, 2s 6d second class to Liverpool but only 2s 0d to Manchester. =1832-1839= The situation on the L&MR; continued much as described above except the railway became more popular and therefore more trains were run, by 1836 the timetable had settled down to 10 trains daily each way between Liverpool and Manchester, with an extra two trains during the summer. The L&MR; agreed to operate the WBR when it opened in September 1832, initially a passenger service was run utilising \\"an engine of the 'oldest' construction hauling four coaches\\", and the fares were fixed at 5s 0d and 3s 6d from Wigan to Liverpool or Manchester (or the reverse) for first and second class respectively. The average journey time from Parkside to Wigan was 15 Minutes, and passengers would need to change trains at Parkside to continue their journey. The WBR arranged in October 1832 for a glass coach to meet the morning first class trains at Newton Junction and transport first class passengers to Parkside. These arrangements continued when the WBR amalgamated to become the North Union Railway (NUR) until the NUR line to Preston, and the relocated station opened on 31 October 1838. =1839-1842= Services became more complicated in 1838/39 because the NUR opened between Wigan and Preston, and the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) opened between Newton and Birmingham, and between Birmingham and London. This enabled through journeys from south-north as well as the original east-west, and additionally from the south and north to both Liverpool and Manchester. This was three railways running trains through or connecting at Parkside. The L&MR; services continued much as normal with 11 trains each way between Liverpool and Manchester. From February 1839 the NUR ran four southbound passenger trains on weekdays, departing Preston for Liverpool, Manchester and Wigan at 0820 (mixed train), 1040 (first class), 1420 (second class) and 1620 (mixed train), on Sundays there were two mixed class trains at 0645 and 1715. Additionally, mail trains for Birmingham and London departed at 1710 and 0208, passengers were advised that in addition to the mail trains they could also proceed to the south by booking to Parkside and waiting for a short time for the next GJR train. All of these trains went through Parkside, and those in the opposite direction which are not mentioned in the company advertisement about return train times. The GJR had weekday trains leaving Manchester to Birmingham at 0330 (first class), 0600 (mixed class), 0815 (first class), 1030 (first class), 1215 (first class), 1600 (mixed class) and 1900 (first class), these trains all went through Parkside and Newton to connect with trains from Liverpool (which did not go through Parkside) at Warrington, most of them connected with London trains at Birmingham. In the opposite direction three of the GJR trains connected with NUR trains at Parkside. The L&MR; and NUR companies agreed that each would operate its own passenger trains on its own line but that through coaches would be provided between Preston and Liverpool and Manchester. The GJR ran its own trains over the L&MR; to Manchester. This was probably the peak of services through the station. Demise and closure The stations importance declined gradually. Advances to locomotive technology meant locomotives could make their journey between Liverpool and Manchester without needing to stop at Parkside to refuel. In 1842 the Manchester and Birmingham Railway (M&BR;) opened the direct line between Crewe and Manchester, this shorter route was used by the GJR in partnership with the M&BR; and its trains to Manchester stopped running through Parkside. In 1843 the Bolton and Preston Railway (B&PR;) opened the line between the NUR at Euxton and Bolton, the Manchester and Bolton Railway line was already operating between Bolton and Manchester. After the B&PR; became part of the NUR in 1844 the NUR used both this more direct route and via parkside for trains from the north to Manchester, partly because it combined the service with that bound for Liverpool, dividing the train at Parkside. The February 1844 departure schedule from Preston shows 5 services each way via Parkside (2 of which continued on to London and one to Birmingham) and 4 services via Bolton. A west curve and station was opened by the L&NWR; in 1847 which made north-south travel easier but reduced Parkside's importance as an interchange. The L&NWR; used Preston Junction to exchange passengers with the North Union Railway, so passengers no longer changed trains at Parkside. From around this time trains going north towards Wigan from Warrington or Liverpool didn't pass through Parkside. By 1855 the station is only listed in the Liverpool to Manchester service table with four trains to Manchester and three to Liverpool. In 1864, the L&NWR; constructed the Winwick cut-off which by-passed Parkside and its junctions, making the north-south journey much easier but effectively made Parkside redundant as an interchange. Map showing the rural area around Parkside railway junctions and former station sites Finally, there was very limited local demand as Parkside, even today, remains relatively rural. The station closed on 1 May 1878, although the buildings continued in use as cottages for some time afterwards.

As a direct lineal descendant of the railroad and land development companies founded by pioneering American businessman Henry M. Flagler, Flagler Global Logistics owns a number of key strategic assets throughout Florida. This includes land with rail, seaport and airport connectivity suitable for industrial development. A wholly owned subsidiary of Florida East Coast Industries the company was originally incorporated as South Florida Logistics Services before changing its name in 2013.  History  Flagler Global Logistics can trace its roots back to the original railroad and land development company founded by Henry M. Flagler in 1892. Flagler, who helped found Standard Oil, saw Florida's tourism potential and built a network of rail lines, depots, and associated infrastructure that eventually extended all the way from Jacksonville to Key West. As Florida's east coast was still lightly-settled, Flagler was able to obtain wide swaths of land up and down the coast, including large tracts of property in what became Miami. After a long bankruptcy that began in 1931, Florida East Coast Railway was purchased by the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust and operated as part of the St. Joe Company. In 1983 St. Joe's incorporated FOXX Holdings, which became the parent company of both FECR and the railroad's new real estate arm, Flagler Development Company. FOXX was renamed Florida East Coast Industries in April 2000. In 2007, FECI was purchased by Fortress Investment for $3.5 billion, and shortly afterwards, Florida East Coast Railway was spun off into a separate and distinct company from FECI. To better take advantage of its strategic land holdings, and provide scalable third-party logistics, FECI established South Florida Logistics Services as an LLC in Delaware in April 2013. The company officially incorporated in the state of Florida in May 2013. In November 2013, the company underwent a rebranding and changed its name from South Florida Logistics Services to Flagler Global Logistics.  Services  Flagler Global Logistics offers consolidation and deconsolidation, multimodal transportation, warehouse management, Foreign Trade Zone, dry and refrigerated cargo services, as well as commercial real estate development.. FGL is the only company with direct connectivity to PortMiami, Port Everglades, and Miami International Airport. FGL currently operates or is developing, six Class-A logistics and distribution facilities throughout Florida. In total, FGL's assets include more than 1 million square feet of move-in ready Class-A warehouse and distribution space, as well as more than 2,000 gross acres of land holdings throughout Florida that could accommodate nearly 24 million square feet of industrial development. Flagler Global Logistics flagship multimodal distribution complex ‚Äî South Florida Logistics Center ‚Äî is located adjacent to the Miami International Airport, with exclusive rail connectivity via the Florida East Coast Railway to South Florida's busiest ports‚ÄîPortMiami and Port Everglades. The 200+ acre South Florida Logistics Center opened in Nov. 2013. Its centerpiece is Flagler Global Logistics‚Äô cold-chain management facility. When fully built out, the center will consist up to 2 million square feet of industrial space. South Florida Logistics Center is an approved magnet site for Foreign Trade Zone No. 281. Tenants include Goodyear and the Flying Food Group. FGL's other holdings include: Flagler Station ‚Äì Located off the Florida Turnpike and NW 106th Street in Miami, Flagler Station is the state's largest business park, with direct access to the FECR. The facility has been built in phases. FGL is developing the third and final phase, which will include 1.7 million square feet of new warehouse and distribution space and is scheduled to come online in 2015. When finished, the park will hold more than 10 million square feet of business, commercial, and industrial space. Flagler Station is an approved magnet site for Foreign Trade Zone No. 281. Its tenants include Ryder System, FedEx, Crowley, and Carrier. Titusville Logistics Center ‚Äì The facility is located on 200 acres that were part of the original Florida East Coast Rail's land holdings. The site features nearly a mile of land directly adjacent to the FECR mainline. The land is permitting for more than 3 million square feet of Class A warehouse and distribution space when the phased build out is complete. To support its growing cargo business, the Canaveral Port Authority recently leased 246,240 square feet of space at the Titusville Logistics Center.  Technology  Flagler Global Logistics is using a new, proprietary, single-source, cold chain technology to attract more business from Latin and South American importers of perishable goods. Importers generally use colder northern ports, and then truck the products (which can include fruits, vegetables, and fresh-cut flowers) south in order to protect local farms against fruit flies and other pests. However, this circuitous supply chain route contributes to large losses in products. Industry reports estimate that $35 billion in perishable foods are lost annually between farm and table, with nearly half of those losses due to in-transit temperature changes. However, FGL's new facility allows the company to employ a new cold chain process and treatment methods that extends the shelf life of produce and other perishable items. In December 2013, the USDA approved the Logistics Center's treatment methods. Flagler Global Logistics President and CEO Chris Scott described the USDA approval as a ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù in the industry, because it opens up Miami as a viable alternate distribution hub for Latin America exporters. Flagler Global Logistics also holds certifications from PrimusGFS (Global Food Safety Initiative scheme) and the FDA.

Criminal charges In the early morning of 9 December 2011, an AMRI Hospital in south Kolkata‚Äôs Dhakuria district erupted in fire, leading to the deaths of 92 people ‚Äì mostly critically ill patients, many of them suffocating in their sleep. The following day, the license for the hospital was canceled, and the Chief Minister of West Bengal ordered a judicial inquiry into the incident. Allegedly, the fire was triggered by flammable chemicals that were stored at the site., Economic Times, 10 December 2011 Rescue efforts were hampered by the narrowness and congestion of the road leading to the hospital, and the allegations that all of the windows and doors were locked and that the fire alarms and sprinklers installed at the hospital did not work during the fire. Seven members of the hospital's board were arrested the same day, and were remanded to police custody until 20 December by the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Alipore. Among the seven arrested were Agarwal and Goenka, founders of Emami and directors of the hospital chain, who were charged with negligently causing the deaths. Ultimately a total of 16 people stood accused in the courts in July 2016, including the board members and several directors of the hospital. Amongst the charges were culpable homicide not amounting to murder under section 304 of the Indian Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment in cases where the criminal actions are undertaken knowingly but without the intention to cause death. Additional charges were laid under Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and Section 38 (effect caused partly by act and partly by omission). The fire was recorded as the largest hospital tragedy in India at the time.

Lloyd Mecham, \\"Carlos E. Casta√±eda,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review Vol. 38 No. 3 1958, pp. 383-388. Born in Mexico, Casta√±eda immigrated to the United States with his family in 1908. He gained an undergraduate and master's degree in history from the University of Texas at Austin, and then spent several years teaching Spanish at the College of William and Mary. Casta√±eda returned to Texas in 1927, serving as the first curator of the Latin American collection at the University of Texas. While he worked as a librarian, Casta√±eda pursued his doctorate in history, which he finally earned in 1932. Casta√±eda's work as a historian focused on the Spanish borderlands, especially Texas. He combed various archives in Mexico to find and copy previously unknown documentation on life in Texas and the southwestern United States. For his work in documenting Catholic history in Texas, Casta√±eda was named a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre and a Knight Commander in the Order of Isabella the Catholic of Spain. During World War II, Casta√±eda took a leave of absence from his teaching position at the University of Texas to work as an investigator for the Fair Employment Practices Committee. He advocated for equal rights for Mexican-Americans, and was promoted to regional director of the FEPC southwest region in 1946. The Perry‚ÄìCasta√±eda Library at the University of Texas is named for him. Early years Carlos Eduardo Casta√±eda was born November 11, 1896 in Camargo, Mexico, one of seven siblings born to a professor who worked at the College of San Juan in Matamoros.Carlos E. Casta√±eda papers The family moved to Brownsville, Texas in 1908, and his parents died shortly thereafter. The only Mexican-American student in his graduation class, Casta√±eda distinguished himself as valedictorian of the Brownsville High School class of 1916.Garcia (1991), p. 232. He earned a scholarship to the University of Texas at Austin, where he initially studied civil engineering. After working for prominent historian Eugene Campbell Barker, Casta√±eda discovered a love of history and changed his major. He received his BA in history in 1921. In late December of that year, Casta√±eda married his childhood friend Elisa Rios. Their daughter, Irma Gloria, was born the following year.Almaraz (2013), p. 148. For the next two years, Casta√±eda pursued his master's degree in history while also working as a high school Spanish teacher. For his master's thesis, Casta√±eda compiled a detailed index of the Spanish and Mexican documents located in Bexar County, where San Antonio is located. His work was well received; Bolton acknowledged that Casta√±eda had discovered some important documents. He received his master's degree in history from the University of Texas in 1923. Historian From 1923 through 1926, Casta√±eda was an associate professor at the College of William and Mary, where he taught Spanish. In December 1923, he helped found the Gibbons Club, a student organization agitating for a Catholic priest from Newport News to be allocated for Sunday Masses, as there were no priests or parishes in Williamsburg. Eventually, the club's activities led to the founding of Saint Bede parish, creating a chapel that is now the National Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham. Although Casta√±eda enjoyed teaching, he missed his home state and wanted to return to a focus on Texas history. He began looking for opportunities to return. In Texas, preparations were already under way for the 1936 Texas Centennial, which would mark the hundredth anniversary of independence from Mexico. The Texas delegation of the Knights of Columbus decided to fund a scholarly history of the Catholic Church in Texas, to be published for the centennial. The head of the Knights of Columbus in Texas, Joseph I. Driscoll, invited Casta√±eda to suggest ways of approaching the vast project. In his response, Casta√±eda suggested that the committee sponsoring the work appoint a single individual to gather the appropriate primary sources for the eventual publication. He volunteered his time to help, noting that he was planning to teach in Mexico City that summer, and remarking that \\"I am a graduate of the University of Texas, and though a Mexican by birth, I feel that I am a Texan in spirit.\\"Almaraz (2013), p. 149. Driscoll quickly authorized Casta√±eda to gather information. Casta√±eda received an offer for a temporary position at the University Junior College of San Antonio but rejected it to pursue more permanent employment.Almaraz (2013), p. 151. He was soon appointed curator of the newly established Latin American Collection at his alma mater, beginning the job in 1927.Garcia (1991), p. 233. He negotiated a workday of only seven hours a day, giving him time to work on his own projects and pursue a doctorate degree. After his translation of Juan Almonte's Statistical Report on Texas, 1834 was published in the Southwestern Historical Quarterly in 1927, he was named a fellow of the Texas State Historical Association. Over the course of the year, he translated and edited several books, and also began work towards his doctorate in history.Almaraz (2013), p. 154. In 1929, Casta√±eda discovered a wealth of documents relating to the history of Texas during Spanish and Mexican rule in the archives of the Mexican states of Coahuila and Nuevo Leon. Earlier historians, including Barker and Herbert Eugene Bolton, had either overlooked the records or failed to copy the information for use by historians in Texas. Casta√±eda intended to photocopy the information from the archives in Saltillo, the capitol of the defunct Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas, noting that it \\"is of the move vital nature for the history of Texas\\". Shortly after his return to the United States, Casta√±eda's six-year-old daughter Gloria died of encephalitis.Almaraz (2013), p. 160. Casta√±eda received a scholarship from the Farmer Foundation for his final year of graduate classes, 1929‚Äì1930, easing some of his financial worries. While he worked to complete his coursework, Casta√±eda translated the pamphlet Latin America and the United States into Spanish for the Knight of Columbus to distribute. After passing his examinations, Casta√±eda reapplied for the scholarship so that he could work on his dissertation. He remained busy throughout 1930, editing a volume of documents from Mexican archives, La guerra de reforma: segun el archivo del General D. Manuel Doblado, 1857‚Äì1860.Almaraz (2013), p. 161. In April 1930, Casta√±eda joined the Sociedad de Geografia y Estadistica in Mexico City. While there, he discovered that the National Library of Mexico now housed the archives from the Franciscan order in New Spain. A quick perusal revealed over 500,000 pages of new documents, many discussing Texas. Casta√±eda received his doctorate from the University of Texas in 1932; his dissertation was a translation of a book written by Fray Juan Agustin Morfi. Morfi's work had been considered lost until Casta√±eda discovered a copy in the Franciscan archives.Almaraz (2013), p. 164. The same year, Casta√±eda's second child, Consuela, was born. Bitter that his salary was lower than his non-Mexican counterparts, Casta√±eda left the University of Texas in 1933, accepting a job as superintendent of schools in Del Rio, Texas. That job lasted only a year, after white parents expressed displeasure with a Mexican-born superintendent. He returned to the University of Texas in 1936 as an associate professor and was promoted to full professor in 1946.Mecham (1958), p. 384. By 1942, he had finished five volumes of Our Catholic Heritage, covering the years of 1519 through 1810. The final two volumes, covering the time from 1810 through 1950, were published in 1948 and 1958. Activist Too old to volunteer for military service during World War II, Casta√±eda instead solicited an appointment with the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC). From 1943 through 1946 he served in the Dallas office, investigating discrimination against Hispanics and blacks. In February 1945, he was promoted to regional director, covering the states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.Foley (2010), p. 67. During his tenure, Casta√±eda took on the oil refineries in the Houston metropolitan area. Mexican-American workers had complained that they were paid less than their white counterparts, had no access to promotions, and were forced to use the facilities marked for colored people.Foley (2010), p. 68. In a scathing response to Shell Oil, Casta√±eda pointed out that Mexicans were legally classified as white, and that the state laws, \\"regrettable as the fact is\\", insisted on separate accommodations for white and black. By making Mexicans use the colored areas, the company was in violation of the law.Foley (2010), p. 69. Shell and the union both admitted that the policies violated the law, but maintained they would be at a competitive disadvantage if they chose to comply; every time the company attempted to promote Mexican-American workers, white workers went on strike.Foley (2010), pp. 76‚Äì77. Casta√±eda returned to the University of Texas in 1946. He died on April 3, 1958.Mecham (1958), p. 383. His personal papers are held at the University of Texas. Recognition and honors Casta√±eda served as president of the American Catholic Historical Association in 1939. He was also highly involved in the First and Second Congress of Historians of Mexico and the United States.Mecham (1958), p. 385. The Perry‚ÄìCasta√±eda Library at the University of Texas is named for him. For his work on Catholic history, Casta√±eda was named a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre by the Catholic Church and a Knight Commander in the Order of Isabella the Catholic of Spain. He was granted an honorary LLD degree by the Catholic University of America, and was given the Serra Award of the Americas in 1951. On his death, historian J. Lloyd Mecham declared Casta√±eda was \\"one of our most distinguished and productive scholars and teachers in the field of Latin American history\\". The Bibliography of Religion in the South notes that Casta√±eda's history of Roman Catholicism in Texas is \\"the most comprehensive and the most historiographically sound analysis of that tradition in any state\\".Lippy (1985), p. 150. Analysis of writings Scholar Mario T. Garcia described Casta√±eda's historical works as \\"an optimistic and positivist view of history\\". His books assumed that the spread of European culture and the Catholic religion were positive advances for North America. According to Garcia, Casta√±eda's \\"moralistic interpretation of history\\" was influenced by the World War II battles between fascism and democracy. Garcia points out that Casta√±eda ignored the negative impact of the Spanish history in North Americas, especially in the Spanish treatment of Indians.Garcia (1991), p. 250. Unlike many historians of the era, Casta√±eda focused on the similarities between the Spanish-Mexican and Anglo-American traditions in North America. This was an attitude common among Mexican-American leaders of the time. A disciple of historian Herbert Eugene Bolton, Casta√±eda believed that American history comprised much more than just the history of the Anglos, that it could only be understood in context with the Spanish and Mexican roots of the southwest.Garcia (1991), p. 234. In the context of Texas history, Casta√±eda was highly critical of the traditional approach of American historians, who ignored all events in Texas before the arrival of the Anglos.Garcia (1991), p. 235. In addition, he sought to revise the approach taken to the Texas Revolution. American historians focused on Anglo accomplishments in the war and stressed the Anglo victory over Mexicans, an attitude that Casta√±eda said \\"was largely responsible for the superiority complex that underlies the attitude towards the Mexican in Texas today\\".Garcia (1991), p. 239. Casta√±eda urged historians to focus on the impact that Tejanos, Mexican-born citizens of Texas, had on the revolution. In speeches, he compared the Texan army of the revolution, composed of Anglos, Mexicans, and others, to the Allied Forces of World War II, each group composed of multiple ethnicities fighting for freedom. Casta√±eda wrote several essays discussing discrimination against Mexican-Americans.Garcia (1991), p. 241. He discussed the unofficial classification of Mexicans as \\"non-white\\" but not \\"colored\\", which was generally used for purposes of racial discrimination.Garcia (1991), p. 242. His essays stressed that Mexicans had been in Texas and the rest of the Southwestern United States for much longer than the Anglos, and that because of that history they could be considered more American than those considered fully white. He attacked the economic discrimination, in which Mexicans were paid less than whites for the same work.Garcia (1991), p. 243. As a solution, Casta√±eda advocated increased educational opportunities for Mexican-Americans and the continuation of the Fair Employment Practices Commission.Garcia (1991), p. 244.

Cangemi, Judge Alvin Hellerstein of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York was presented with the novel issue of whether a copyrightable work made available over the internet could be considered published under the Copyright Act of 1976. Through analogy to traditional physical distribution, the court held that this indeed constituted publication.  Background  The plaintiff's website, an online resource for buying mechanical scooters and the like, became available publicly on the internet in 1999. A version of the website was registered with the Copyright Office in August 2000. Beginning in the early summer of 2000, the defendants' website went live. Its content had been copied directly from the source code of Getaped.com, and offered similar services. Alleging damage to their business, Getaped filed a copyright infringement suit against the defendants. Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis, calling the Getaped website an unpublished work, awarded the plaintiff a license fee of $1050.  Opinion of the Court  = Damages = At the district court, Judge Hellerstein reconsidered the appropriate damages to which the plaintiff was entitled. Under the Copyright Act, statutory damages can only be awarded for works registered with the Copyright Office.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 412 The copying had occurred before the website had been registered, but within the three-month grace period available for published works.Getaped.com at 401. Therefore, the plaintiff would only be entitled to statutory damages for the infringement if the website could be classified as a published work under the copyright act. = Copyright Publication = Under American copyright law, a work has been published once copies have been distributed to the public.17 U.S.C ¬ß 101 (definition of publication) Before the elimination of copyright formalities, publication without notice could result in forfeiture of an author's rights.Thomas F. Cotter, Toward a Functional Definition of Publication in Copyright Law, 92 MINN. L. REV. 1724, 1792. Thus, cases considering whether or not publication had occurred focused on how many physical copies of the work had left the author's control and entered the stream of distribution.Cotter at 1726. Even in reference to more intangible works, such as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, the courts paid special attention to whether physical copies of the work had been made available to the public. The court likened the fact that, once made available on the internet, anyone could have saved a copy of the website's source code to their personal computer and held that the website was indeed published.Getaped.com at 402.  Subsequent Developments  = Criticism = The opinion's reasoning on internet publication received a mixed academic reception. Melville Nimmer and David Nimmer defended the decision as a proper interpretation of the distributive definition of publication within the copyright act, and that publishing a website is the functional equivalent of a lending which would have triggered publication in the physical realm.1 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer on Copyright, note 32 ¬ß 4.07[B]. Others have argued that making a website available is akin to a public performance or a transmission, which have traditionally not been considered publication because tangible copies were not distributed to the public.Bruce P. Keller & Jeffrey P. Cunard, Copyright Law: A Practitioner's Guide ¬ß 6:1.2 n.94 (2007).Roger E. Scheter & John R. Thomas, Intellectual Property: The Law of Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks 81 (2003). Others argued that any copying of a website's code, besides the copying necessary to view web content, would be unauthorized and thus not a publication.Elizabeth Townsend Gard, January 1, 2003: The Birth of the Unpublished Public Domain and Its International Implications, 24 CARDOZO ARTS & ENT. L.J. 687, 699. = Other Districts = The question of internet copyright publication arises in multiple contexts given the reliance of multiple statutes on the published or unpublished status of a work.Cotter at 1792. In the international realm, the country of first publication determines whether a work can be treated as a \\"U.S. work\\" under American law.17 U.S.C ¬ß 101 (definition of U.S. work) In a case brought against Nelly Furtado and Timbaland in a federal court in Florida this issue became relevant (see Timbaland plagiarism controversy). Because certain non-U.S. works are not subject to the pre-registration requirement, and a work simultaneously published in the United States can qualify as a U.S. work, the published status of the allegedly infringed work was relevant. Following the Getaped line of reasoning, the court found that the work was published, therefore a U.S. work--and because it had not been registered prior to the lawsuit's filing dismissed the case effectively imposing copyright formalities on a Berne Convention national.

His move was prompted by his dissatisfaction with the boredom and monotony of asylum life at Saint- R√©my, as well as by his emergence as an artist of some renown following Albert Aurier's celebrated January 1890 Mercure de France review of his work. In his final two months at Saint-R√©my van Gogh painted from memory a number of canvases he called \\"reminisces of the North\\", harking back to his Dutch roots. The influence of this return to the North continued at Auvers, notably in F789 The Church at Auvers. He did not, however, repeat his studies of peasant life of the sort he had made in his Nuenen period. His paintings of dwellings at Auvers encompassed a range of social domains.  \\"Reminisces of the North\\"  F83: The Cottage, Van Gogh Museum Vincent van Gogh spent the early 1881‚Äì1885 years of his brief ten-year career as an artist painting in the Netherlands at Etten, The Hague, Drenthe, and Nuenen (his last family home). It was in Nuenen that Vincent executed F82 The Potato Eaters, which he considered his first really successful painting, while other early paintings of the time, such as F83 The Cottage (left), attest his sympathy for peasants and their way of life.Naifeh & Smith, pp. 423-51 Following the death of his father in March 1885 and ensuing difficulties and quarrels with both his family and neighbors in Nuenen, Vincent moved first to Antwerp, Belgium, where he briefly studied at the Academy, and then finally joined his art dealer brother Theo in Paris, France, in March 1886. His move from Antwerp was motivated by worries about his health, suffering a breakdown early in the year.Naifeh & Smith, pp. 469-92 The two years he spent in Paris with his brother are the least documented of Vincent's career, simply because the main source for Vincent's life are the letters between them and, naturally, they did not correspond when together. Nevertheless, there are abundant sources to show that Vincent participated fully in the artistic life of the city, although he never aligned himself with the Impressionist movement. In particular he came into contact with Paul Gauguin, whom he idolized. By the end of the two-year period, relations between the brothers had soured somewhat and Vincent resolved to leave Paris and settle in Arles in the south of France, where he conceived the project of starting an artists' commune with Gauguin.Naifeh & Smith, pp. 540-63 F612: The Starry Night, Museum of Modern Art F675: Winter Landscape ‚Äì Reminiscence of the North, Van Gogh Museum Gauguin joined Vincent at The Yellow House in October 1888. However, Vincent's erratic behavior and drunkenness alarmed Gauguin, and by Christmas he had resolved to leave. Vincent suffered a severe nervous collapse as a result and was hospitalized. Despite making a speedy recovery, Vincent voluntarily entered an asylum at Saint-R√©my-de-Provence on 9 May 1889, where he was able to continue painting between relapses of mania (his exact medical condition is not known with certainty). Perhaps his most loved and best known painting, F612 The Starry Night, dates from this time. It exemplifies the vigorous and agitated brush work he had developed.Naifeh & Smith, pp. 744-71 Vincent suffered his most severe relapse towards the end of February 1890. The following two months he was unable to paint, scarcely able even to write. He declared himself \\"totally stupified\\" in his single letter of this period to Theo on 17 March . Hulsker called it the saddest period of Vincent's life. Nevertheless, Vincent was able to draw and paint a little as he recovered. He described painting a few canvases from memory, which he had experimented with in F496 Memory of the Garden at Etten (Ladies of Arles) while painting with Gauguin, in a letter to Theo dated 29 April. He called these paintings souvenirs du nord, \\"reminisces of the North\\". He mentions he might redo F83 The Cottage (above left) and F84 The Old Church Tower at Nuenen. F702: At Eternity's Gate, Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum He is more explicit in a following letter to his mother and sister Willemien: \\" And while my illness was at its worst, I still painted, among other things a reminiscence of Brabant, cottages with mossy roofs and beech hedges on an autumn evening with a stormy sky, the sun setting red in reddish clouds.\\" This painting is identified by the Van Gogh Museum as either F673, F674, or F675 (right). Hulsker also singles out F695 Two Peasant Women Digging in the Snow and identifies a series of sketches depicting peasants, of which F1594r is an example, as dating from this time as well. He says these works, almost alone in Vincent's entire oeuvre, show unmistakable signs of mental collapse.Hulsker, p. 442 Finally he notes that F702: Worn Out ‚Äì At Eternity's Gate, which Vincent made at this time, is likewise an unmistakable remembrance of times long past. The original was a drawing Vincent had made in The Hague.Hulsker, p. 446Erickson, p. 77 Vincent ascribed this latest relapse to the boredom and monotony of life at the asylum. For months he had been writing Theo saying he wanted to leave the asylum. He felt sure that if he moved back to Paris he would get well quickly. At the same time Vincent had become something of a celebrity in the art world following a very favorable review of his work by the critic Albert Aurier, who declared him a genius.Naifeh & Smith, pp. 799-813 Despite his misgivings, Theo followed advice proffered by Camille Pissarro and arranged for Vincent to work at the village of Auvers- sur-Oise north of Paris under the supervision of Paul Ferdinand Gachet, a doctor.Naifeh & Smith, pp. 818-22  Auvers  Paul C√©zanne, Panoramic view of Auvers, Art Institute of Chicago Auvers-sur-Oise was a medieval town about 15 miles northwest of the center of Paris. It was only a few roads wide, but extended for miles along the river in both directions, vineyards and market gardens scattered all along its length. Its hamlets were a mix of clusters of thatched houses and farm enclosures. The French painter Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny first moored his studio barge Botin there in the 1850s, and later purchased no less than three houses in the village as well as another nearby.Zemel p. 277 n.15 With the advent of a railway, the town became a tourist center, its population swelling from 2,000 to 3,000 in the summer months. It attracted artists such as Corot, Cezanne and Pissarro, all seeking to capture its rustic charms. Dealers like Theo van Gogh sold thousand of their images.Naifeh & Smith p. 826 Auvers had consequently become a prosperous community. It was a model of Third Republic idealism regarding the modernization of the peasants:Zemel p. 218 Van Gogh was alert to the change and the new modernity. Writing Theo and Jo on the 25 May, he remarked:Zemel pp. 214-5 F1615v: Landscape with Peasant Women Harvesting, Van Gogh Museum. Van Gogh made no paintings of traditional peasant life, la vie rustique, at Auvers of the sort he had formerly made in Nuenen. His sketchbooks contain perhaps just half a dozen or so quick studies of peasant scenes, such as F1615v Landscape with Peasant Women Harvesting (right), as well as a rather larger number of studies of farm animals such as chickens and ponies. His subjects were landscapes, townscapes, portraiture, and still lifes. His paintings at Auvers imply a range of social domains. Thus his paintings of dwellings range from thatched cottages through to middle-class villas and finally aristocratic ch√¢teaus, and these are set within the social spaces of gardens, streets, and the vestiges of feudal domain respectively.Zemel p 229 n.41 During the months of May, June and July 1890, van Gogh was extremely productive. The letters give accounts of thirty-six paintings that can be dated with certainty to the Auvers period. The 1970 catalogue raisonn√© lists another fifty or so, of which some may date before Auvers and others may be inauthentic. Even the certain paintings imply a painting executed every other day over the two-month period.Hulsker pp. 454-8 The village captivated him. On his arrival 20 May 1890, he wrote his brother Theo and wife Jo Bonger that \\"Auvers is really beautiful ‚Äì among other things many old thatched roofs, which are becoming rare.\\" In his letter the following day he adds, \\"But I find the modern villas and the middle-class country houses almost as pretty as the old thatched cottages that are falling into ruin.\\"Pickvance p. 226 Van Gogh lodged at the Auberge Ravoux, where he remained until his death in the early hours of the morning of 29 July 1890 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the stomach.Naifeh & Smith pp. 850-9  Description  A postcard showing a farmhouse in Chaponval before 1914. The central house was a townhouse in the hamlet of Chaponval, about a mile west of the Auberge Ravoux. It was situated at 5 Rue de Gr√© () and still exists, although renovated. It belonged to a mason named August Lecroix and was the subject of an earlier 1873 painting by Paul C√©zanne titled La maison du P√®re Lacroix. Hulsker thought Houses at Auvers was painted shortly after van Gogh arrived.Hulsker pp. 1988-9 De La Faille thought it painted a little later at the beginning of June, citing a letter of 10 June 1890. The two thatched cottages at the left are set at right angles. They reappear in F780 Thatched cottages in Auvers (see below).Pickvance pp. 234-5 Van Gogh was generally meticulous in his depiction of street scenes, a fact that allowed the precise location of the F766 White House at Night to be ascertained, an Auvers painting that was once thought lost but re-emerged in 1995 in the collection of the Hermitage Museum. Toledo Museum of Art, the holding museum, points to the structural juxtaposition of the blue-tiled roof and the adjacent thatched roof of the house. Vigorous brush strokes, varying in direction, are used to highlight the contrast and textures. By contrast, the trees and garden are represented in the characteristic swirling manner van Gogh developed at Saint-R√©my. Pickvance notes the color scheme is restrained in accordance with van Gogh's return to the North, but also in response to the weather conditions: the sky is laden with clouds and a poplar tree bends to the force of the wind. The paint is applied remarkably thinly in places, and there are bare patches of canvas. Van Der Veen & Knapp remark that at the time of writing (2010), the shutters still retained their original green color.Van Der Veen & Knapp p. 125  Related work  = Thatched cottages = F1640r: Landscape with Houses, Van Gogh Museum The picturesque thatched cottages of Auvers appear of necessity in many of van Gogh's views of the town. Only in four paintings are thatched cottages the dominant theme: F758, F780, F792, and F806.Pickvance, p. 249 In drawings such as F1640r (right), the exaggerated rounded roof lines are not to be found in either French or Dutch cottages. They are part of van Gogh's return to the North he describes in a letter to Theo dated 29 April 1890. The drawing is a study for F750 (below). Close examination shows that there are nevertheless significant differences between the two works; for example the hills in the painting are trees in the drawing. Van Der Veen & Knapp comment that these liberties van Gogh took with his subject matter demonstrate that his paintings and drawings are not literal depictions of nature but rather interpretations of it.Pickvance p. 223Colta et al. p. 334Van der Veen & Knapp p. 77 File:Van Gogh - Bauernh√§user in Jorgus mit Figuren.jpegF758: Farmhouses in Jorgus with figures, Private collection File:Vincent van Gogh - Rietgedekte zandstenen huisjes in Chaponval (1890).jpgF780: Thatched Cottages in Auvers, Kunsthaus Z√ºrich File:Boerderij - s0108V1962 - Van Gogh Museum.jpgF806: Farmhouse with two figures, Van Gogh Museum File:Thatched Cottages at Cordeville.jpgF792: Thatched Cottages at Cordeville, Mus√©e d'Orsay * On Sunday 8 June, Theo, Jo and baby visited Vincent and they all had dinner together at Dr. Gachet. The following Tuesday 10 June, van Gogh wrote to say he had since completed two more studies in \\"the greenery\\" (i.e. the suburbs). Hulsker thought these were most likely F758 Farmhouses in Jorgus with figures and F806 Farmhouse with two figures.Hulsker p. 462 Van Der Veen & Knapp describe F758 as extremely crude, a reminder that not everything from a master is masterful, nevertheless pointing out the masterly economy of the figure on the right and the line of chickens to her left. By contrast the figure on the left is quite unfinished. Similarly F806 is unfinished in parts, especially at the lower right where there is bare canvas. The brushwork is indistinct and the sky lacks definition.Van Der Veen & Knapp pp. 128, 131 JH2116: Sketch C Letter 902 * F780 Thatched Cottages in Auvers depicts the thatch on a cottage being renewed. The location is the same one in Chaponval as F759 Houses in Auvers (i.e. the subject of this article), featuring the same house with a pointed roof and distinctive chimney (the leftmost house in F758 is the rightmost house in F780 seen at right angles). However, whereas F759 was painted shortly after van Gogh arrived in Auvers, F780 would seem to have been amongst the last of van Gogh's paintings, as he encloses a sketch of it (right) in his last letter to Theo of 23 July. Both Hulsker and De La Faille date it July 1890.Hulsker p. 476De La Faille p.300 Both Pickvance and Van Der Veen & Knapp note that it is compositionally similar to F420 Row of Cottages at Saintes Maries painted some two years earlier on a day trip from the asylum at Saint- R√©my.Pickvance pp. 249-50 * Van Der Veen and Knapp describe F792 Thatched Cottages at Cordeville as characteristic of the village views van Gogh made at this time. The colors are subdued and no use of complementary colors is made. The location is quite likely 18 Rue Rajon ().Vand Der Veen & Knapp p 123 Hulsker places it amongst the earliest of the Auvers paintings.Hulsker p. 454 De La Faille notes similarities of location with drawing F1637r.De La Faille p 303 = Views of Auvers = Other paintings from this period are: F750 Thatched Cottages and Houses (for which F1640r above right is a study), F789 The Church at Auvers (another example of his return to the North),Van Der Veen & Knapp p. 106 the size 30 canvases, and the double-square paintings.

Writing Theo and Jo around 21 May, Vincent says: \\"Now I have a study of old thatched roofs with a field of peas in flower and some wheat in the foreground, hilly background.. \\", and continues with a remark that it did him good to go into the south, \\"the better to see the north\\". Van Der Veen & Knapp point out the serene calm of the painting; not a breath of wind disturbs the smoke rising from the chimney.Van der Veen & Knapp p.72 * F770 Landscape at Twilight is a view of the . It was the first of the double-square canvases and van Gogh described it in a letter to Theo of 24 June. It was the only view he made of the ch√¢teau. The twilight is conveyed by heavy strokes of orange and yellow, but the sun itself is not seen. Nowhere in the Auvers painting did van Gogh directly depict the sun.Pickvance p. 261 Van Der Veen and Knapp note that there is a figure under the back pear tree, barely delineated in a few strokes. They describe the painting as a masterpiece of subtlety and form by a painter at the peak of his powers. * F789 The Church at Auvers, a size 30 canvas, is described in a letter of 5 June to his sister Wil: \\"... It's again almost the same thing as the studies I did in Nuenen of the old tower and the cemetery.\\" The study he was referring to was F84:The Old Church Tower at Nuenen, which he had already said he would like to redo as one of his \\"reminisces of the North\\" at Saint R√©my. Hulsker remarks that The Starry Night is probably the only painting that matches it in its intensity of color and emotional charge.Hulsker p. 460 F1638r: Dead End Street with Houses, Van Gogh Museum * De La Faille gives the location of F791 The House of P√®re Pilon as 18 rue Francois Villon (), midway between the Auberge Ravoux and 5 Rue de Gr√©.De La Faille p. 302 P√®re Pilon's villa was one of the grander modern villas in Auvers and is partly obscured in the picture by a large chestnut tree. In the letter Vincent sent Theo and Jo the day after his arrival, he said he found the villas of Auvers almost as attractive as the thatched cottages. Pickvance says the picture may have been painted as early as 24 May and that the halo effect of the sky may reflect the wet and stormy weather van Gogh experienced on Saturday 24 and Sunday 25 May. Van Der Veen and Knapp point out a preparatory study F1638r (right) in the Van Gogh Museum.Van Der Veen & Knapp p. 86 * The location of F795 Village street and stairs in Auvers with figures is the Rue de la Sansonne directly opposite the Auberge Ravoux, though the stairs connecting the two streets are no longer there.Pickvance p. 227 There is a smaller companion piece F796 showing the same site whose authenticity Van Der Veen and Knapp question.Van Der Veen & Knapp F1652r: Sheet with Many Sketches of Figures, Private collection :*A sheet of figure studies F1652r (right) has at its upper left a young girl seen from behind very close to the lower rightmost girl in the painting.De La Faille p.304 The profile of a young girl to the right on the sheet is recognizably Adeline Ravoux, daughter of the innkeeper at the Auberge Ravoux where van Gogh lodged. She is the subject of portraits F768, F786, and F769. The young girl seen from behind is assumed to be her as well. As well as F795, she is thought to appear in a number of other paintings, including especially F819 Two Ladies Walking in a Landscape. The sheet fetched $4480,000 at a Christie's sale in 2007. * F802 Village Street is a considerable curiosity as it was one of ten paintings exhibited at a Salon des Artistes Ind√©pendants exhibition in 1891 a year after van Gogh's death.De La Faille pp. 643, 691 The catalog entry read Village (derni√®re esquisse) i.e. \\"Village (last work)\\". There is no mention of the painting in the letters and presumably its unfinished nature was responsible for calling it van Gogh's last painting. Pickvance notes the energy of the painting, betraying no indication of a tormented mind.Pickvance p. 248 Hulsker noted its lively color accents give it a cheerful aspect, to be found repeatedly in other paintings of the same sort at this time.Hulsker p. 458 Van Der Veen & Knapp think it was part of a series of views of the village made between the end of May and the beginning of June and that it is unfinished simply because van Gogh abandoned it, dissatisfied with the results he was getting.Van Der Veen & Knapp p. 91 It has the distinction of being the first van Gogh painting ever to be purchased by a museum, the Ateneum purchasing it in 1903 from the estate of Julien Leclercq, who had organised one of the earliest van Gogh exhibitions. * De La Faille gives the location of F805 Houses at Auvers as 2 Rue Marceau (), about 200 yards east of 5 Rue de Gr√©. However the correct address is 4 Rue Marceau. There were originally two farms, from the Caffin Family and the Youtte Family. Albert Caffin was the mayor of the town, who also signed Vincent Van Gogh's death certificate. De La Faille p. 306 Hulsker includes it amongst his list of cheerful canvases enlivened by color accents. Van Der Veen and Knapp place the painting as a continuation of van Gogh's early exploration of the village, contrasting it with the Dutch cottage F90 Cottage and Woman with a Goat he had painted a few years before in Nuenen and a companion piece to F83 The Cottage he had considered redoing as one of his \\"reminisces of the North\\" in Saint- R√©my. They note the use of complementary colors, for example the blue shadow of the foreground cottage cast on the yellow path.Van Der Veen & Knapp p. 92 The painting was awarded top prize at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts' first \\"crowd-sourced\\" exhibition\\"Boston Loves Impressionism\\".  Provenance  The Toledo Museum of Art purchased Houses at Auvers in 1935 with funds from the Libbey Endowment, the gift of Edward Libbey. The work had previously been owned by Andr√© Bonger of Amsterdam. The painting was first shown at the 1905 Amsterdam exhibition and has been since exhibited all over the world, including at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Van Gogh in Saint-Remy and Auvers, 1986, no. 63, pp. 234, 235, repr.

The company has raised $20.6 million in financing and its clients include Sony, Autodesk, Scotts Miracle-Gro, and GlaxoSmithKline. History Luminoso was co-founded in 2010 by Dennis Clark, Jason Alonso, Robyn Speer, and Catherine Havasi, a research scientist at MIT in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. The company builds on the knowledge base of MIT‚Äôs Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS) project, co-founded in 1999 by Havasi, who continues to serve as its director. The OCMS knowledge base has since been combined with knowledge from other crowdsourced resources, games with a purpose, and expert-created resources to become ConceptNet. ConceptNet consists of approximately 28 million statements in 304 languages, with full support for 10 languages and moderate support for 77 languages. ConceptNet is a resource for making an AI that understands the meanings of the words people use. During the World Cup in June 2014, the company provided a widely reported real-time sentiment analysis of the U.S. vs. Germany match, analyzing 900,000 posts on Twitter, Facebook and Google+. Applications The company uses artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to derive insights from unstructured data such as contact center interactions, chatbot and live chat transcripts, product reviews, open-ended survey responses, and email. Luminoso's software identifies and quantifies patterns and relationships in text-based data, including domain-specific or creative language. Rather than human-powered keyword searches of data, the software automates taxonomy creation around concepts, allowing related words and phrases to be dynamically generated and tracked. Commercial applications include analyzing, prioritizing, and routing contact center interactions; identifying consumer complaints before they begin to trend; and tracking sentiment during product launches. The software natively analyzes text in fourteen languages, as well as emoji.  Products  Luminoso's technology can be accessed via two products: Luminoso Daylight and Luminoso Compass. Luminoso Daylight enables a deep-dive analysis into batch or real-time data, whereas Luminoso Compass automates the categorization of real-time data. Both products offer a user interface as well as an API. Luminoso's products can be implemented through either a cloud-based or an on-premises solution.  Research  Luminoso continues to actively conduct research in natural language processing and word embeddings and regularly participates in evaluations such as SemEval. At SemEval 2017, Luminoso participated in Task 2, measuring the semantic similarity of word pairs within and across five languages. Its solution outperformed all competing systems in every language pair tested, with the exception of Persian.  Recognition  Luminoso has been listed as a \\"Cool Vendor in AI for Marketing\\" by Gartner, and has also been named a \\"Boston Artificial Intelligence startup to watch\\" by BostInno. In May 2017, Luminoso was recognized as having the Best Application for AI in the Enterprise by AI Business, and was also shortlisted as the Best AI Breakthrough and Best Innovation in NLP.

The program was launched in 2000. The purpose of the American Humane Certified program is to give consumers access to humanely-raised food choices. Farms that meet the American Humane Association's criteria may add the American Humane Certified logo to their packaging. Certification process In order to receive the American Humane Certified logo, farms must pass an assessment based on a list of over 200 standards. The standards are unique for each farm animal species. The American Humane Association uses independent firms to perform annual audits on certified farms in order to ensure they are complying with the guidelines. The audits can be unannounced. The American Humane Association standards specify that animals must be raised in an environment that limits stress, includes the provision of fresh water, a healthy diet, sufficient space, proper facilities, shelter, and a resting area. These criteria are rooted in the \\"five freedoms\\" that are used to evaluate animal welfare in the UK. The certification is not granted to farmers who use growth hormones. The standards are regularly reviewed by a scientific advisory committee. Program results In 2014, the American Humane Association announced that it had certified one billion animals on more than 8,000 farms. 90 percent of cage-free eggs sold in the US have been certified by the American Humane Association. In 2014, turkey producer Butterball became an American Humane Certified producer. Other producers include The Happy Egg Company, Foster Farms, and Clover Organic Farms. Consumer support for humanely raised food has increased since the start of the program. Greener Choices, a project of Consumer Reports, confirms that the American Humane Certified label is verified and somewhat meaningful. Criticism In June 2015, Mercy for Animals released a video of an undercover investigation of American Humane Certified factory, operated by Foster Farms. The footage included workers treating the chickens violently and inhumane slaughter methods; this resulted in Mercy for Animals calling the program \\"a scam\\". According to Consumer Reports, \\"while the American Humane Association says its standards aim to ensure the humane treatment and improve the welfare of farm animals, the requirements fall short in meeting consumer expectations for a ‚Äúhumane‚Äù label in many ways. Most Americans think that a ‚Äúhumane‚Äù label should mean that the animals had adequate living space (86%), went outdoors (78%) and were raised without cages (66%). The American Humane Certified standards do not always assure consumers that these basic requirements were met. For example, minimum space requirements are sometimes greater than the industry norm, but do not always allow for freedom of movement. Animals such as chickens, pigs and turkeys can be continually confined indoors; female pigs with their newborn piglets can even be confined in barren crates that do not allow the mother pig to turn around, much less engage in natural and instinctive nesting behaviors. For beef cattle and dairy cows, grazing on pasture is not required and feedlots are allowed.\\" They have also been heavily criticized for certifying other corporations guilty of numerous animal cruelty cases such as Butterball.

A total of six candidates joined the race: three Republicans, two Democrats, and an independent. The Republicans were Craighead; Paul Anderson, a retired railroad mechanic who had unsuccessfully run for the Legislature in 1994 and 1998; and Patricia Hannan, a former aide to state senator Tom Baker and an unsuccessful candidate for the Legislature in 2006. The Democrats were Omaha attorney John Stalnaker; and Justin Spooner, a 23-year-old who had served as a page in the Legislature and had interned with U.S. senators Ben Nelson and Mike Johanns. The independent candidate was George Westphal, a retired mechanical technician for Millard Public Schools, who had unsuccessfully run for the Legislature in 2010. In the nonpartisan primary, Craighead won a narrow plurality, with 1581 votes, comprising 26.3% of the total. Stalnaker placed second, with 1438 votes, or 23.9%. Spooner received 1026 votes (17.1%); Hannan, 892 votes (14.8%); Anderson, 694 votes (11.5%); and Westphal, 380 votes (6.3%). As the top two vote-getters, Craighead and Stalnaker moved on to the general election. The two candidates differed on the proposed expansion of Medicaid under the provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act: Stalnaker was in favor of it, while Craighead was opposed. The two also disagreed on a referendum to increase Nebraska's minimum wage: Stalnaker said that he would vote for it, while Craighead stated that she would vote against. Over the course of the entire campaign, Craighead raised nearly $137,000 and spent $139,000. Major contributions included over $25,000 from the Nebraska Realtors PAC, $5000 from the Nebraska Bankers State PAC, $5000 from Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Ricketts and his father Joe Ricketts, and $3500 from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry PAC. Stalnaker raised about $125,000 and spent over $129,000. Major contributions to his campaign included $29,500 from the Nebraska State Education Association PAC, $5500 from the Nebraska Association of Trial Attorneys PAC, $3500 from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and $3000 from the United Transportation Union PAC; he also received $850 from the Nebraska Bankers State PAC. When the general election was held in November 2014, Craighead received 5726 of the 11,127 votes cast, or 51.5% of the total. Stalnaker received 5401 votes, or 48.5%. =Legislative tenure= 2015 session In the 2015 session of the Legislature, Craighead was appointed to the Banking, Commerce, and Insurance Committee, and the Government, Military, and Veterans Affairs Committee. Among the \\"most significant\\" actions taken by the Legislature in its 2015 session were three bills that passed over vetoes by governor Pete Ricketts. LB268 repealed the state's death penalty; LB623 reversed the state's previous policy of denying driver's licenses to people who were living illegally in the United States after being brought to the country as children, and who had been granted exemption from deportation under the Barack Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and LB610 increased the tax on gasoline to pay for repairs to roads and bridges. Craighead voted against the death-penalty repeal, and to sustain Ricketts's veto of the measure; she was listed as \\"excused and not voting\\" for the vote on LB623, and for the veto-override vote; and she voted against the gas-tax increase, and to sustain the gubernatorial veto. 2016 session In its 2016 session, the Nebraska legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed. LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de-politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to \\"an unelected and unaccountable board\\". Craighead voted against the bill in its 29-15 passage. Sponsor John Murante opted not to seek an override of the governor's veto. A second vetoed bill, LB935, would have changed state audit procedures. The bill passed by a margin of 37-8, with 4 present and not voting; Craighead was among those voting against it. The bill was withdrawn without an attempt to override the veto; the state auditor agreed to work with the governor on a new version for the next year's session. A third bill passed over Ricketts's veto. LB947 made DACA beneficiaries eligible for commercial and professional licenses in Nebraska. The bill passed the Legislature on a vote of 33-11-5; the veto override passed 31-13-5\\\\. Craighead was recorded as \\"present and not voting\\" when the bill initially passed; she voted against the override of Ricketts's veto. The legislature failed to pass LB10, greatly desired by the Republican Party, which would have restored Nebraska to a winner-take-all scheme of allocating its electoral votes in U.S. presidential elections, rather than continuing its practice of awarding the electoral vote for each congressional district to the candidate who received the most votes in that district. Supporters were unable to break a filibuster; in the 32-17 cloture motion, Craighead was among those who voted for the bill. 2017 resignation Craighead resigned from her legislative seat, effective September 8, 2017, citing the need to focus on family and work obligations. She stated that she was resigning before the end of her first term in part so that Ricketts could fill the vacant seat with a Republican, who could then run as an incumbent in the 2018 election. In October 2017, Ricketts appointed Theresa Thibodeau to the vacant seat. References External links * Craighead's Nebraska Legislature website * \\"Issues\\", from Craighead's 2014 campaign website.

He became an assistant at a printing shop owned by , a Slovak patriot and cultural figure, who used his influence to promote Klemens' education.Brief biography. Osobnosti In 1837, upon the recommendations of Karel Slavoj Amerling and Father , he was admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague for a trial period. He studied there from 1838 to 1843, attending science and technology lectures as well as his art classes. Portrait of Andrej Sl√°dkoviƒç (1872) After 1839, Klemens also worked as a teacher at a girls' school operated by Amerling, where he experimented with the educational techniques of Jan Amos Komensk√Ω (known as \\"Comenius\\"). In 1842, Amerling introduced him to Daguerrotypes in the chemical laboratory at the school. Shortly after, he opened a small photography studio called \\"Svƒõtloobraz√°rna\\" (The Light Gallery), in the school's garden.\\"Hotovwenj podobizen Daguerotypnjch\\", in ƒåesk√° vƒçela, May 1842, Vol.9 #35 online It was only the second such studio in Prague, but financial difficulties forced its closure after a year. In 1843, Klemens returned to Slovakia, where he devoted himself to geological explorations for coal in Orava and ≈†ari≈°. He also worked with \\"\\", a Slovak cultural organization, where he painted the portraits of many notable Slovak nationalists. From 1847 to 1848, he was back in Prague, auditing lectures on medicine at the University of Prague and chemistry at the Technical University. After Amerling's school was ordered closed for its nationalistic tendencies, Klemens attempted to create his own industrial school, but was thwarted by the chaos resulting from the Revolutions of 1848. Portrait of ≈†tefan Moyses (1870s) He completed his studies in 1849 and went back to his hometown, using his wife's dowry to establish a workshop for manufacturing zinc oxide with equipment he had designed himself. Once again, his enterprise ended in financial failure and he found work painting altarpieces. He briefly considered emigrating to Russia, but accepted an offer to teach at the Belgrade Lyceum (now the University of Belgrade). However, he stayed for only a short time, claiming that the climate was bad for his family's health. Returning to Prague, Klemens obtained a secondary school teaching certificate and was qualified to teach chemistry, physics and German grammar. In 1856, he won a competitive exam to teach drawing at the Gymnasium in ≈Ωilina and remained there until the school was closed in 1863. He then became a Professor of natural sciences and drawing at the Catholic high school in Bansk√° Bystrica. He retired in 1878. In his last years, Klemens suffered from kidney stones. He went to Vienna, seeking surgical relief, but died after the operation.  Technical and scientific activities In 1865, Klemens came up with a design for a printing machine called the \\"Samotlaƒç\\" (self-print). The drawings were sent to an exhibition in London, but the idea was never developed. In the late 1870s, he worked on a propulsive steam engine called the \\"≈Ωiaroruchu\\" (roughly translated, \\"out-motion\\"), to be used for construction work, and explored the possibility of using exhaust from the machine to inflate balloons that could be used to move heavy machinery. For lack of funds, he failed to create a prototype or obtain a patent, however. Klemens was a member of Matice ƒçesk√° and a founding member of Matica slovensk√°. On the basis of his work determining the epicenter of a small earthquake at ≈Ωilina in 1858, he was appointed a corresponding member of the \\"Imperial Geological Institute\\" in Vienna. He owned one of the largest collections of minerals in Slovakia.

He used his powers as the National Director of Coordination to build Laotian police forces into a national power. Appointed as Director prior to the August 1960 coup by Kong Le, Siho gathered and trained two special battalions of paramilitary police during the latter part of 1960. When his patron, General Phoumi Nosavan, seized power in December 1960, Siho's new battalions helped carry the day at the Battle of Vientiane. Acquiring the National Police from the Ministry of the Interior, and co-opting local military police, Siho consolidated the Lao police into the Directorate of National Coordination. Attaining a strength of 6,500 men, the DNC would be Siho's instrument for his short-lived 18 April 1964 coup. Having failed once in his attempt to take over the Kingdom of Laos, Siho sat out the 1965 Laotian coups. Nevertheless, the Royal Lao Army would attack and dismantle the Directorate of Coordination on 3 February 1965, driving Siho into exile in Thailand. In June 1966, he believed it safe to return to Laos and surrender. Three months later, he was shot while trying to escape. Rise to command General Siho Lanphouthacoul was born on Khong Island, the French Protectorate of Laos.Stuart-Fox, p. 299. He was of Chinese-Lao heritage.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 105-106, 125. His family served in the aristocratic household of the Abhay family. The eldest son, Kouprasith Abhay, was eight years older than Siho, and they were reared together. As a result, for unknown reasons, Siho grew up resenting Abhay.Steiglitz, p. 96. Siho would come to be characterized as \\"rough\\", \\"tenacious\\", \\"vain\\", and subject to sudden outbursts of temper.Kuzmarov, pp. 130-131. In September 1953, Siho joined the French-led Lao National Army (French: Arm√©e Nationale Laoti√©nne - ANL) as a member of its first reserve officer training class.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 6, 11, note 22. He became a protege of Phoumi Nosavan. Siho served as Phoumi's aide during a year's training in France.Conboy, Morrison, p. 45, note 27. In 1958, Siho was selected by Phoumi as his intelligence officer as well as his aide.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 105-106. Phoumi also appointed him as Director of National Coordination. On 25 December 1959, General Phoumi ascended to control of the Kingdom of Laos.Conboy, Morrison, p. 25. During the April 1960 national elections, Captain Siho blatantly rigged election results in front of the CIA case officer Stuart Methven; Siho asked Methven's birth year, then wrote it in as a pro-government vote tally.Ahern, pp. 10-11 Captain Kong Le's coup later that year in August of that year seems not to have curtailed Siho's power; he raised two special counterinsurgency battalions within the Royal Lao Police (French: Police Royale Laoti√©nne - PRL), trained to military standards, Through Siho's influence, they were the first unit in the PRL and Royal Lao Armed Forces (French: Forces Arm√©es du Royaume - FAR) to be completely armed with the U. S. automatic M-2 carbine. However, the unit was reputedly corrupt in their police duties.Conboy, p. 39. Siho conspired in Phoumi's return to power. On 17 November 1960, while acting as Phoumi's intelligence officer, he contacted a U.S. Special Forces unit, Team Ipsen. Four river gunboats of the Royal Lao Navy (French: Marine Royale Laoti√©nne - MRL) were blocking the Mekong River at Ban Sot to bar Phoumi's northward movement from Savannakhet. On 19 November, Siho and Team Ipsen set up an ambush for the MRL gunboats. However, before the boats could show up to spring it, Phoumi launched his counter-coup. Siho and his special battalions were loaded onto MRL landing crafts in Savannakhet on 21 November to join the latest coup.Conboy, Morrison, p. 37. When Phoumi's forces finally reached the Laotian capital at Vientiane, Siho and his policemen led the attack. On the final day of the Battle of Vientiane, December 16, Siho's police unit successfully captured the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) military runway at Wattay Airfield.Conboy, Morrison, p. 41. After Phoumi's coup succeeded, Siho consolidated the Royal Lao Army (RLA) military police and the PRL national police into his Directorate of National Coordination (DNC) Security Agency during March 1961. His actions cost him police funding from the U.S.; however, the DNC were considered the most effective combat troops in the FAR. The resulting 1st Special Mobile Group (French: Groupement Mobile Special 1 - GMS 1) was an airborne-qualified unit. They were soon put to test, as in April 1961, when they were moved north to prevent Kong Le's Neutralist Armed Forces (French: Forces Arm√©es Neutralistes - FAN) and the Pathet Lao communists from moving down from the Plain of Jars and recapturing Vientiane. On 25 April, they were deployed on the southern bank of the Lik River (Lao language: Nam Lik), successfully blocking the only road available, Route 13.Anthony, Sexton, p. 51.Conboy, Morrison, p. 54. Tiao Ekarath had led another of the countercoup units, Mobile Group B (French: Groupement Mobile B - GM B) in restoring Phoumi to power, and was a rival to Siho for Phoumi's favor. On 10 May 1961, Tiao Ekarath's body was discovered in an abandoned vehicle near Wattay Airfield. He had been shot in the head. Siho was widely blamed for the death.Conboy, Morrison, p. 56 note 41. On 5 November 1961, Siho's DNC personnel arrested a FAN intelligence officer who was on business in Vientiane. The detainee was released two days later.Conboy p. 97. On the 29th, a DNC unit began irregular operations near Thakhek in Military Region 3.Ahern, pp. 109-110. This action was ended in December when Siho's demand for tactical control of the operation through the communications network was refused.Ahern, p. 111 note 51. In 1962, Siho raised a third special battalion to bring GMS 1 to regimental size.Conboy, p. 105. In 1963, he went to Taiwan for advanced staff training. While there, he came under the influence of Chiang Ching-kuo, who headed the Nationalist Chinese secret police. Siho returned from his three months training on 1 May 1963. In February 1964, GMS 1 was tested in battle. Transported to Savannakhet in Military Region 3, they successfully assaulted the nearby Pathet Lao-occupied village of Nong Boualao, which had already repelled several assaults by the Royal Lao Army.Conboy, Morrison, p. 106. Siho's grab for power On 18 April 1964 there was a tripartite meeting on the Plain of Jars, as Souvanna Phouma met with his brother Souphanouvong to thrash out a coalition agreement. At this meeting, the Pathet Lao demanded the demilitarization of both Luang Prabang and Vientiane. A discouraged Souvanna Phouma returned to Vientiane, having decided to resign as Prime Minister. However, King Sisavang Vatthana would not approve the resignation until the following day.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 98-99. At this, Siho inveigled Kouprasith into a coup, on the grounds that the United States would have to accept their new government. By early April 1964, the DNC consisted of 6,500 men and served variously as a civil police force, immigration service, national police, and military intelligence service.Anthony, Sexton, p. 98 note 54. On the night of 18/19 April 1964, BS 33 seized Vientiane's infrastructure. They arrested Souvanna Phouma and 15 leading officials of several opposed factions such as the Royal Lao Army, Forces Arm√©es Neutralistes, and the French Embassy. The coup force emptied the safe in the FAN's headquarters and looted Kong Le's home. Some 15 other FAN officials sought asylum from the coup in the Soviet Embassy. Overall however, the DNC policemen were successful in their coup.Conboy, Morrison, p. 107. General Phoumi Nosavan, when informed of the coup in progress, declined to participate.Conboy, Morrison, p. 113 note 6. Kouprasith Abhay was then named successor to power, with Siho his deputy. Kouprasith called in two battalions of his Mobile Group 17 (French: Groupement Mobile 17 - GM 17) to reinforce the DNC personnel. Communist forces promptly moved into the defensive positions strung along the north edge of the Plain of Jars that had been abandoned by GM 17.Anthony, Sexton, p. 99. On 23 April, the American ambassador Leonard Unger returned from a conference in Saigon, Vietnam. He confronted Siho and the mutinous Lao officers and informed them that the United States supported Souvanna Phouma; that was the end of the coup. Siho's later activities In December 1964, Siho seized the socially prominent editor of a Vientiane newspaper, sparking widespread outrage from the military. The DNC and the Royal Lao Army were poised for a clash. However, the King was coincidentally in town, and interceded to defuse the situation.Conboy, Morrison, p. 123. Siho would hold the DNC out of the January 1965 coup activity. However, despite their non-participation in any coup activities, a company of BS 33 guarding the Frontier Police headquarters at Muong Phene was overrun by RLA tanks and dispersed on 3 February 1965. A subsequent assault upon both BS 11 and BS 99 at their camp 22 kilometers outside Vientiane went unresisted. With the exception of a single company from BS 11, those two battalions were arrested and disarmed. However, the following day, the final two companies of BS 33 made a futile raid upon Vientiane, only to be cornered and subdued. Meanwhile, Siho crossed the Mekong into exile.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 124-125. In June 1966, Siho consulted a fortune teller, who assured him it was safe to return to Laos. He recrossed the Mekong to Military Region 4 to surrender. He was imprisoned for three months before being shot while trying to escape.Conboy, Morrison, p. 125.

At the same time, he worked as a correspondent for the newspapers El Mercurio de Valpara√≠so and El Comercio, both from Valparaiso. In 1847 the Minister of Interior and Foreign Affairs, Manuel Camilo Vial, commissioned him to write the lyrics of the national anthem. He was a supporter and promoter of the revolution of 1851, the first attempt to put a liberal government into power. As a result, he was sent to jail and condemned to death during the government of Manuel Montt, but, as he was the writer of the lyrics of the National Anthem, the sentence was changed to exile, and he was sent to the southern city of Valdivia, from which he fled to Lima. He came back to Chile in 1852, and worked as a journalist for the newspaper \\"La Patria\\" until 1857. He moved to Bolivia, where he created the Bank of La Paz, and contributed to the country's mining industry. In 1878, he went back to Chile and was elected mayor of Santiago, and then superintendent of Curic√≥. He took part in the War of the Pacific as a diplomat and secretary of a naval squadron.Biography (ES) Chilean congress library 2015, retrieved on January 20, 2015 He represented Chile during the failed Peace Conference of Arica in 1880 between Bolivia, Chile and Peru.

Finally, Eusebio Lillo died in Santiago on 8 July 1910.  Work  Lillo's best known work is the lyrics of Chile's national anthem.

Linked to Herakles at latest at the beginning of the Roman Imperial Era, he has been venerated exclusively in Southern Asia Minor, more precisely in Lycia and Pisidia. As a club-bearing horse rider god, Kakasbos seems to be related to protection against wild dangers, but this hypothesis is still discussed among historians.  Mythology The mythology around Kakasbos is unfortunately unknown since no text revealing this aspect of his cult has been unearth until now. The probability of such discovery stays thin when we consider that Lycians did only produce a very small amount of texts, let alone texts that are not administrative or funerary in subject. Moreover, Greeks and Romans did not seem to be interested to Lycian and Pisidian cults. Only a tiny amount of texts mention Lycian or Pisidian deities such as Maseis or Tarchunt.  Cult  = Extent = Kakasbos‚Äô cult was limited to Southern Asia Minor, in Lycia and Pisidia. Almost all traces left by cultists were found in the region delimited by modern towns of Fethiye (formerly Telmessos) and Nebiler (about a dozen kilometers south-west of Korkuteli). Some steles dedicated to him were discovered in other Anatolian cities (Miletus or Halicarnassus, for example) or in Rhodes, but no doubt exists about their Lycian or Pisidian origin. Stele dedicated to Kakasbos, Fethiye Museum, inv. 2.11.79.1481, 3rd-4th century AD, Limestone = Traces = Kakasbos received a cult intimately linked to Herakles‚Äô. Traces left are in fact absolutely equivalent. The only way to actually distinguish the dedicatee is an explicit deity name in the dedication.Despite what asserted I. Delemen, nudity is not exclusive to Heracles. G.H.R. Horsley and M. Drouin identified a stele illustrating a naked club bearing rider god dedicated explicitly to Kakasbos, though the text is difficult to read. Near Yuvalak, close to Tefenni, a sanctuary regrouping several dozen wall bas reliefs showing Kakasbos and Heracles was found. However, most sculptures are highly eroded, giving historians very limited understanding of the deities or the archaeological site. Furthermore, the dozen inscriptions accompanying some of the reliefs were very damaged. Only four or five readable inscriptions remain, that are not enough for a solid analysis. Other sources are, however, more revealing. 121 steles decorated with a relief and inscribed in Ancient Greek have been found in Northern Lycia and Southern Pisidia. The very short inscriptions ‚Äì five to seven words ‚Äì bear a dedicatory nature and adopt the same format, with few variations:Variations occur essentially in the word order (mainly irrelevant in Angient Greek), the occasional presence of the epithet ŒòŒµœâ, ‚Äòto the god [K. or H.]‚Äô (which does not modify the meaning), and the rare addition of a dedicatory formula. Steles containing the last peculiarity have been seen as potential epitaphs by G.H.R. Horsley. However, M. Drouin did not find enough clues supporting this hypothesis to consider it plausible. ‚ÄòSomeone, son of Someone, [accomplished] to Kakasbos/Heracles his vow.‚Äô They reveal that the dedications are made mainly by people bearing Greek names, but also by several dedicators bearing Anatolian names. A couple of Latin names occurred, not enough though to suggest any Latin influence. All combinations between the origin of dedicator‚Äôs name and dedicatee occur; no ethnic cleavage seems to appear. On the other side, the reliefs are well preserved generally speaking: some details in the face of the deity, in his equipment or in his mount are still evident. Moreover, uninscribed steles ‚Äì more than a hundred ‚Äì have been found in Lycia and Pisidia. They offer a useful complement to inscribed ones, but do not bring new comprehension material. Finally, other sources were linked to Kakasbos. Coins bearing a horse riding deity wielding a weapon close to a club were unearthed, but none explicitly identified Herakles or Kakasbos. The name of Kakasbos seems to be written ‚Äì in a distorted manner ‚Äì on a gnostic gem, but the inscription is unique and cannot be linked to the deity. Figurines looking like an unidentified club bearing rider god were found in a temple in Sagalassos. However, several historians asserted that it was probably not Kakasbos, and that the temple was not dedicated to the Anatolian rider god.  Notes   Bibliography  * G.E.

The Repeating Island: The Caribbean and the Postmodern Perspective. Second Edition. Translated by James E. Maraniss.

Synopsis The novel is set in the sixteenth century and presents the narrative of a group of men from different ethnic backgrounds making their way up a dangerous and turbulent river within the jungles of Guyana. The party is led by a man named Donne, a cruel second-generation European colonialist who was born in Guyana, and who is hunting for a woman called Mariella who has run away from him. Over the course of the journey it becomes apparent that it is not the first time the men have tried to make their way up this river and that last time they attempted to traverse the river they were all drowned. It is suggested that they now exist in a liminal or spectral state between life and death. The events of the narrative are narrated by a first person narrator who is identified simply as 'Dreamer' in the opening pages of the novel. Dreamer's presence becomes increasingly oblique as the novel progresses. Publication The novel was written in 1959 after Wilson Harris had moved to London from Guyana.

Early life Smeeth was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Her mother is from east London, and her father is a Scottish trade unionist. Her maternal family is Jewish, and arrived in London during the 1890s, having escaped Russian pogroms. However, she had no contact with her father after her parents divorced when she was aged three.John Woodhouse meets Stoke-on-Trent North Labour candidate Ruth Smeeth The Sentinel, 10 May 2014 Smeeth attended school and taught at a Jewish school in Bristol, where her mother was later deputy general secretary for Amicus, and in her early life travelled extensively across the UK due to her mother's work. Smeeth graduated with a degree in Politics and International Relations from the University of Birmingham in 2000. She worked as a policy and research officer for a trade unionurl=https://www.ruthsmeeth.org.uk/about/ before working in a public relations role from January 2004 to September 2005 at Sodexo. She then became director of public affairs and campaigns at the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre (BICOM) in November 2005. She later worked in PR for Nestl√©. From 2010 to 2015, she was a deputy director of anti-racist organisation, Hope not Hate. She has also been employed by the Community Security Trust and has worked for the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Parliamentary career Smeeth was selected as Labour Party candidate for the Burton constituency in the 2010 general election, finishing 6,304 votes behind Andrew Griffiths of the Conservative Party. She was then selected from an all- women shortlist to be Labour Party candidate for Stoke-on-Trent North, following the retirement of incumbent Labour MP Joan Walley, and was subsequently elected at the 2015 general election. Smeeth backed Yvette Cooper in the 2015 Labour Leadership Election. In October 2015, Smeeth was given an adjournment debate on holiday hunger. In June 2016, Smeeth resigned her post as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the shadow Northern Ireland and Scotland teams, alongside others, in protest at Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.MP for Stoke-on-Trent North resigns from shadow cabinet post ITV News, Mon 27 June 2016 She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace him in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election. In June 2016, Smeeth campaigned for the UK to remain in the European Union. Her constituency voted for Brexit by 72.1%. In November 2016, Smeeth said \\"I‚Äôll be voting for us to move to Article 50. The general public, especially in Stoke-on-Trent, sent a very clear message with some parts of my constituency voting 80/20 to leave. My whole priority and focus is how we can make it work\\". In June 2016, at the launch of the Chakrabarti Report, Marc Wadsworth, a Labour Party activist, described Smeeth as working \\"hand-in-hand\\" with Kate McCann of The Daily Telegraph, after Smeeth passed her his press release. Smeeth said that Wadsworth was using \\"traditional antisemitic slurs to attack me for being part of a 'media conspiracy'\\" and criticised a lack of response from Corbyn or his office, calling on him to resign however, the incident was caught on video and Wadsworth didn't mention a general ‚Äúmedia conspiracy‚Äù, or anything about Jews. Wadsworth said he was unaware Smeeth was Jewish and that \\"I‚Äôve never been called anti-semitic in my life...The Jewish people have an ally in me.‚Äù Smeeth said that she received 25,000 pieces of abuse during July and August, including 20,000 in the 12-hour period immediately following the incident. However, the Jewish Voice for Labour group contested this by comparing Smeeth's claim with a study by the Community Service Trust who monitor anti- Semitic and abusive media content. The study found that over an entire year (encompassing the 12 hour period of Smeeth's claim of 20,000 cases) only 9,008 original Tweets concerning Jews were classified as antagonistic. Other studies investigating the most abused MPs on Twitter found that Smeeth wasn't mentioned since she didn't exceed the threshold of abuse to be ranked. The police strengthened her security after she received a death threat. In April 2018, Smeeth was accompanied by around 40 Labour MPs and peers to a Labour hearing into Wadsworth's conduct. Wadsworth was expelled for bringing the Party into disrepute. She retained her seat in the 2017 general election with a much reduced majority. In March 2019, Smeeth resigned as PPS to Tom Watson, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party to vote against a second referendum on Brexit, as Labour had instructed its MPs to abstain. In April 2019, Smeeth was elected Parliamentary Chair of the Jewish Labour Movement. She is a member of Labour Friends of Israel. In the December 2019 general election, Smeeth lost her seat to Conservative Jonathan Gullis, who overturned her 2,359, or five per cent, majority to a 15% or 6,286 majority of his own. Personal life Smeeth was married to Michael Smeeth, a business executive. She describes herself as 'culturally Jewish'. Since 2015, she has been a board member of Hope not Hate. In June 2020, she became chief executive of Index on Censorship, an organisation which campaigns for freedom of speech.https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/the-londoner-corbyn- critic-ruth-smeeth-is-freedom-of-speech-ceo-a4470326.html References External links * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Birmingham Category:British public relations people Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:Jewish British politicians Category:Jewish women politicians Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Labour Friends of Israel Category:Politicians from Edinburgh Category:UK MPs 2015‚Äì2017 Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:21st- century British women politicians Category:Scottish Jews ","title":"Ruth Smeeth"},{"id":"45568233","text":"Melissa Maxine Skelton (born 1951) is the 9th Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster, a diocese in the Anglican Church of Canada, and is the 12th Metropolitan of the Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and Yukon.

She began her term on the Moorestown Township Council on January 7, 2013. She made history in 2015 by becoming Moorestown's youngest Mayor ever at the age of 26, and is the youngest female to ever hold the office of Mayor statewide. In 2016, she served as the township's Deputy Mayor. Personal life Napolitano grew up in Cranford, New Jersey and is a graduate of Union Catholic Regional High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.\\"National Merit\\", The Westfield Leader, November 24, 2005. Accessed January 22, 2018. \\"Union Catholic students Amy Dooley of Carteret, Thomas Fitzgibbon of Fanwood, Bradley Gelles of Edison, Katherine McGhee of Edison and Victoria Spellman of Cranford, have been named Commended Students in the 2006 National Merit Scholarship Program. Each student will be presented with a letter of commendation from the school and National Merit Scholarship Corporation.\\" She then went on to Drexel University, where she earned a bachelors' in education and minor in English, and a masters' in teaching, learning, and curriculum in just over four years. Napolitano is currently an Instructional Designer and Trainer with Clarivate Analytics in Philadelphia, PA. Napolitano has been active in numerous civic organizations and activities, including MoorArts performing arts group, Historical Society of Moorestown, the Lenola Advisory Committee, the National Federation for Women Legislators, Save the Environment of Moorestown (STEM), the Moorestown Improvement Association, Friends of the Moorestown Library, the Burlington County Young Republicans, and Our Lady of Good Counsel Church. She married her high school sweetheart, Vinny Napolitano, who she met in 2003 when they were both in a production of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. The pair moved to the Lenola section of Moorestown in 2010 and currently reside in West Moorestown. During her 2016 re-election campaign, Napolitano announced that she and her husband were expecting their first child, making Napolitano the first member of the Moorestown Council to give birth while in office. Her daughter, Elliot Eliza Napolitano, was born on March 26, 2017. In March 2019, Napolitano and her husband welcomed their second child, daughter Reagan Noelle Napolitano. Napolitano gained attention for what she refers to as \\"motherhood in public,\\" bringing her daughter with her to Township meetings and events. She stated that she hopes \\"that serves as an example that young women can step up to take leadership positions and be involved in things like this, and they don‚Äôt have to do it before or after their child-bearing years [...] There‚Äôs no reason why we should have to sit that out.‚Äù Township Council Election, 2012 Napolitano campaigning with her running mate, Phil Garwood, in 2012 In 2012, a pool of \\"16 to 18\\" candidates were screened to run for Township Council by the Moorestown Republican Municipal Committee (MRMC). The committee opted against endorsing then-Mayor John Button for re-election, citing differences of opinion as well as his inability to work with Councilwoman Stacey Jordan and Councilman Chris Chiacchio. Instead, the Republican Party chose to run Victoria Napolitano along with Recreation Advisory Committee Chair Phil Garwood and Pete Palko, the CEO of an environmental remediation company. Button's 2008 running mates, Deputy Mayor Greg Gallo and Councilman Mike Testa, did not seek a second term. Two weeks later, the Moorestown Democratic Committee endorsed Democrats J. Greg Newcomer, Brian Sattinger and Mark Hines as their 2012 Council candidates. Both Sattinger and Hines were second-time candidates for Township Council, having lost races in 2010 and 2008, respectively. In May 2012, Mayor John Button announced that though he was not selected to run as a Republican, he would be seeking reelection as part of an Independent slate of candidates that included developer Randy Cherkas and businesswoman Elaine Goralski. However, their team withdrew from the race in early September, putting the election back to a two-slate race. During the campaign, Napolitano knocked on over 5,000 doors and ran on a message centered around bringing attention to the Lenola section of Moorestown, preserving the Open Space Trust Fund, and completing the rebuild of the Town Hall Complex, which had burned down in a 2007 fire. On election day, Napolitano was the top vote-getter with 5,580 votes, outpacing her Republican running mates as well as her Democratic opponents.November 6, 2012 Summary Results, Burlington County. Township Council Napolitano was sworn in as a Councilwoman on January 7, 2013, by Congressman Jon Runyan. Napolitano's swearing-in marked the first time in the township's history that two women served together on the Township Council, and on the same night, the council made history by electing Stacey Jordan as Moorestown's first female Mayor. During her first two years on the Township Council, Napolitano spearheaded the creation of the Lenola Advisory Commission to address the problems facing the western portion of Moorestown. Napolitano, along with her Council colleagues, increased communication between the Township Council and residents in Moorestown by bringing back \\"Residents Requests and Presentations\\" to Council meetings - an item eliminated in 2011 - and by holding office hours for members of the public who could not attend regularly scheduled Council meetings In May 2014, the Moorestown Town Council opened the doors to the new Town Hall and Library Complex under the originally allocated budget. Napolitano and her colleagues praised the opening of the building, which fulfilled a campaign promise of Napolitano and her running mate, Phil Garwood. Eight months later, Napolitano would be the first person to take the oath of office as Mayor in the new Town Hall building. At Napolitano's urging, Mayor Stacey Jordan proclaimed April as Autism Awareness Month for the first time in town history. Napolitano serves as an Autism Ambassador for Autism New Jersey. Mayor Mayor Napolitano addresses the crowd at a Town Hall Meeting at the Moorestown Recreation Center Napolitano was sworn in as Moorestown's youngest Mayor on January 7, 2015, by Judge Lois F. Downey. Though no records were kept to confirm, Napolitano may also be the youngest woman to ever be sworn in as Mayor statewide in New Jersey. Napolitano stated that her priority as Mayor will be to work on keeping taxes low and building a stronger business climate in Moorestown Of her age, Napolitano stated, \\"Credibility isn't a gift handed out on your 30th or 40th birthday [...] It's something you can earn at any age. An articulate, respectfully delivered opinion should be welcome from anyone.\\" In April 2015, Napolitano led the Township Council in passing ordinances that would protect municipal open space land from encroachments and to crack down on vacant or abandoned homes and properties. Mayor Napolitano cast the lone dissenting vote on Moorestown's 2015 municipal budget, opposing the budget's proposed tax increase. Napolitano stated that she would rather use a portion of the township's $7 million surplus to allow taxes to stay flat for residents. Napolitano celebrated the opening of two new volleyball courts at Jeff Young Park in the Lenola section of Moorestown in July 2015. The courts were created in a partnership between the Township Council and the non-profit organization Kennedy's Cause. Under Napolitano, Moorestown has moved to clean-up Strawbridge Lake watershed, spending $80,000 to test water quality, remove invasive vegetation such as spatterdock, and develop an ongoing management plan for the lake. Napolitano stated, \\"The lake has been described as the jewel in the crown of Moorestown [...] It's worth the investment.\\". Additionally, Napolitano moved to have the Township Council designate the Sustainable Moorestown Green Team as a permanent advisory committee within the township, calling the group \\"a valuable asset to the community\\" and protecting the group from potential disbandment by future elected officials. Napolitano declared August 2015 as Agriculture Appreciation Month in Moorestown and spent time visiting with local farms and agribusinesses to draw attention to Moorestown's various agricultural assets. She was joined in this effort by Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno and Secretary of Agriculture Doug Fisher. Mayor Napolitano started the process of building a dog park in Moorestown along with the Burlington County Freeholders. The park was completed in Fall 2017 at Swedes Run and incorporated historical markers for Swedes Run Barn, a picnic pavilion, and improved parking facilities. In September 2015, Napolitano joined members of Save the Environment of Moorestown (STEM) to secure placement and installation of a historical marker on Stokes Hill, a favorite sledding spot in Moorestown. The marker tells the story of the \\"saving of Stokes Hill\\" by local artist and activist Carol Mastran, who led townspeople against the development of the plot of land in the early 1990s. At the ceremonial unveiling, Napolitano said, \\"Carol Mastran's work to preserve Stokes Hill is an important part of our town's history. I hope that every child who visits Stokes Hill learns something from this historic marker.\\" In the aftermath of the 2015 fire of The Moorestown Community House, Mayor Napolitano honored first responders and others who helped save the historic building by issuing each individual a Mayoral proclamation. Napolitano and the Township Council also moved to cancel the annual Moorestown Boards and Committees Dinner, opting instead to donate the funds allocated for that event to The Moorestown Community House's restoration efforts. Deputy Mayor and Re-Election Campaign In keeping with recent tradition, Napolitano stepped down as Mayor after serving one year in order to allow another member of the Township Council to serve. She nominated her Deputy Mayor, Phil Garwood, to be her successor, and the motion carried in a 4-0-1 vote, with the lone Democrat on the council abstaining. Councilwoman Stacey Jordan nominated Napolitano to serve as Deputy Mayor for 2016, and the motion carried by the same 4-0-1 vote. Deputy Mayor Napolitano joined her colleagues in passing a tax cut for the residents of Moorestown in the 2016 municipal budget, praising the move as a real commitment to tax relief. In March 2016, Napolitano announced she would be seeking re-election along with Mayor Phil Garwood and newcomer Mike Locatell. The candidates ran on a platform of lower taxes, business development, updating Moorestown's aging infrastructure and water facilities, protecting open space, and increasing transparency. Democratic incumbent Lisa Petriello ran with newcomers Kati Angelini and Amy Leis against the Republican slate. On Election Day, Napolitano was re-elected to a second term along with running mate Locatell and opponent Petriello, delivering a continued 4-1 Republican majority in spite of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton winning the town 56%-40% against Republican Donald Trump Moody's Investors Service issued a report in October 2016 stating that Moorestown Township was \\"financially healthy,\\" with their report saying the township is doing well thanks to \\"strong financial management\\" and that the \\"economy and tax base of the Township are healthy overall.\\" Napolitano praised the news, stating that the Township Council was able to invest in infrastructure and water improvements, protecting our open spaces, upgrading our various athletic facilities, and increasing business ratables while still delivering a tax decrease. Napolitano led the charge on Township Council to continue investment into the Lenola Town Center portion of the municipality, announcing in the Fall of 2016 that the Township would be applying for millions of dollars in grant funding from the federal government to deliver streetscaping improvements, plant new trees, install new curbing and crosswalks, and more. On December 12, 2016, Moorestown saw its first Police Chief in decades with the swearing-in of Chief Lee Lieber by Mayor Phil Garwood. Napolitano held the Bible on which the Chief took the Oath of Office during this ceremony. Second term Napolitano was sworn into her second term on the Township Council on January 3, 2017. The oath of office was administered by Burlington County Freeholder Linda Hughes. On the same night, the Township Council made history by voting to appoint Moorestown's first Mayor of Hispanic descent, Manny Delgado. In January 2017, the Moorestown Township Council announced the launch of 'Moorestown TV', on online archive of recordings of Township Council meetings and other events in the community. Napolitano, who serves as the governing body's Technology and Telecommunications Committee Liaison, lauded the move and called it a \\"major priority\\" for the elected officials on the Township Council. Upon State Senator Diane Allen's announcement that she would not seek re-election, Napolitano's name was circulated by numerous sources as a potential Republican candidate for the open seat. In the end, however, Napolitano did not file as a candidate for this race. Napolitano, along with the other members of the Republican majority, voted in May 2017 to support a request from the Moorestown Police Department to acquire a non-weaponized military vehicle from the federal government surplus program. Police Chief Lee Lieber stated that the Police Department felt the vehicle was a necessary acquisition that could potentially save lives in natural weather events, terrorist acts at high-profile sites like the Moorestown Mall or Lockheed Martin, or active shooter situations. Napolitano argued that the Moorestown Police needed to be trusted, and that \\"we have to prepare for the world we live in, not the one we want to live in.\\" The lone Democrat on the council, Lisa Petriello, voted no, citing concerns about symbolism of militarizing the police. This led to a public backlash and a petition by a nonpartisan group, Support Moorestown Police, urging Petriello to stand with Moorestown Police in all future votes. In late June 2017, it was announced that Moorestown would be receiving $971,520.00 in grant dollars to revitalize the Lenola Town Center, a project pushed by Napolitano since she assumed office in 2013. The project was supported by the Township Council in 2016 and endorsed by Senator Diane Allen, Freeholder Director Bruce Garganio, and the Burlington County Board of Chosen Freeholders. Napolitano - who led the formation of the Lenola Ad Hoc Committee and Lenola Advisory Commission with Lenola resident Jamie Boren - lauded the decision to award the grant to Moorestown, stating \\"It's been a long journey, but I'm ecstatic that because of the hard work of so many people, we've finally reached a point where we can turn the page on the past and begin a new chapter for Lenola.\\" The grant dollars will be utilized to implement a conceptual plan that proposes bike lanes, improved landscaping, new sidewalks and crosswalks, parking solutions, and improved lighting on Camden Avenue and parts of bisecting Lenola Road. Napolitano introduced a municipal ordinance in October 2017 banning the sale of animals from puppy and kitten mills within Moorestown Township. The ordinance, which ultimately was passed unanimously across party lines, was praised by numerous organizations including The Humane Society of the United States. In June 2019, Napolitano joined with fellow Republican Mike Locatell in opposing a tax increase on residents contained in the Moorestown municipal budget, citing the municipality's over $8 million surplus. The budget advanced in a vote of 3‚Äì2, supported by the Democratic members of the governing body. Awards and honors Napolitano receiving the Drexel University Distinguished Alumni Service Award from Drexel President John Fry and Alumni Board Chair Tony Noce In May 2013, Napolitano was named a Star Citizen in Suburban Family Magazine for her work as an Autism Ambassador. Napolitano was named to the inaugural class of the Burlington County Times' Forty Under 40 in July 2013. In August 2015, Napolitano was named to PolitickerNJ's \\"30 Under 30\\" for influential young people in New Jersey politics. Napolitano was named to the Drexel University Forty Under Forty, an \\"annual compendium of Drexel's most innovative, impressive and inspiring young alumni,\\" in March 2016. In August 2016, Napolitano was named to Obeserver New Jersey Politics' \\"30 Under 30\\" list for political up-and-comers in New Jersey. Napolitano was awarded the Drexel University Distinguished Alumni Service Award for her work in Moorestown Township and her commitment to bettering her community and the world. Napolitano was featured on the cover of South Jersey Biz magazine after being named to the publication's 20 Under 40 list of young professionals who have shown dedication to building a better region and are working to move South Jersey forward. In 2017, Napolitano was included in the InsiderNJ \\"50 Under 30\\" in New Jersey politics list. Napolitano and her husband were listed in InsiderNJ's 2017 New Jersey Power Couples List In January 2018, Napolitano was named one of 30 Women to Watch in New Jersey politics by The Save Jersey Blog In July 2018, Napolitano was included in InsiderNJ's list of Millennials on the Rise. In November 2019, Napolitano was named a National Elected Woman of Excellence by the National Foundation for Women Legislators. According to the NFWL, \\"this award was created to identify women who have worked tirelessly, often breaking down barriers and overcoming obstacles that once seemed insurmountable, to serve their communities. These pacesetters have engendered an environment where women can now serve in public office and fight for the issues they are passionate about.\\" She was presented this award at the NFWL's Annual Conference in San Antonio, Texas.

They form the border between the cornea and the sclera. Characteristics of limbal stem cells include a slow turnover rate, high proliferative potential, clonogenicity, expression of stem cell markers, as well as the ability to regenerate the entire corneal epithelium. Limbal stem cell proliferation has the role of maintaining the cornea; for example, by replacing cells that are lost via tears. Additionally, these cells also prevent the conjunctival epithelial cells from migrating onto the surface of the cornea. Medical conditions and treatments Damage to the limbus can lead to limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD); this may be primary - related to an insufficient stromal microenvironment to support stem cell functions, such as aniridia, and other congenital conditions, or secondary ‚Äì caused by external factors that destroy the limbal stem cells, such as chemical or thermal burns, radiation, surgery, infection, use of contact lenses, or certain drugs. Signs and symptoms include : conjunctivalisation, corneal vascularisation, edema, ocular discomfort or pain, visual impairment, and blindness, which are likely associated with failure in the process of regenerating the corneal epithelium. Immediate management aims to limit traumatic or chemical damage to the limbus, control inflammation, and help achieve a healthy corneal epithelium. Initial treatment after trauma/injury includes preservative-free artificial tears, topical steroids, ‚Äòbandage‚Äô contact lenses, and autologous eye drops (eye drops manufactured from the patient's own blood serum and plasma). Once the corneal surface has stabilized, surgery is the main approach to treatment. Types of surgeries: #In the case of a partial LSCD:, a sequential sector conjunctival epitheliectomy (SSCE) can be performed to remove any tissue (pannus) that has grown over the cornea. This procedure is sometimes used as a temporary measure until further surgical interventions are possible. #Transplantation of amniotic membrane from a placenta may also help. Although amniotic membrane does not have stem cells of its own, it supports regeneration of limbal stem cells. However, further surgical intervention may be needed if these approaches are unsuccessful, or when disease is more severe. #Conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAU) involves transplantation of limbal tissue from a patient‚Äôs healthy eye. As the procedure is achieved by transplanting autologous limbal stem cells from the patient‚Äôs healthy eye, there is no risk of immune rejection, and hence no need for systemic immunosuppression. However, this procedure represents a risk for the donor eye, as the patient already has one eye damaged. #In the case of bilateral LSCD, where both eyes are affected, it may be possible to transplant limbal tissue from a living donor (usually a relative). This is known as a conjunctival limbal allograft (CLAL). CLAL can be performed with both partial or total LSCD, the donor tissue is usually from a sibling or parent. As with CLAU, only a part of the donor limbus can be transplanted, as a live donor is being used. Being an allogenic transplant, immunosuppression is required, due to the risk of rejection. #Kerato-limbal allograft (KLAL) involves transplantation from someone who has died and donated their organs. KLAL can be used for cases of bilateral LSCD when a living related donor is not available, or for patients with unilateral LSCD, who don‚Äôt want to jeopardise their healthy eye. However, most of these types of transplant fail within five years. KLAL has a number of limitations: the graft is usually up to 24 hours old before retrieval and a further period of time is often required to screen the cadaver‚Äôs blood before the tissue can be used; often the limbus is found to be damaged as the tissue is not immunocompatible, there is a high risk of rejection between the recipient and the donor cadaver and studies report only a temporary success in term of transplant effectiveness, with most failing after 5 years. #A recent procedure, less invasive than CLAU, which so far has been tested only in unilateral cases, is simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET). In this procedure, healthy limbal tissue from the patient‚Äôs good eye is cut into a number of pieces and transferred directly to human amniotic membrane covering the cornea in the damaged eye. Studies published so far have only investigated the procedure in unilaterally affected patients, and the long-term effectiveness of the technique is yet to be proven. #Another recent innovation is cultivated limbal epithelial transplant (CLET), either autologous (where donor and recipient are the same patient) or allogenic (where donor and recipient are different patients). This approach can be used when either one or both eyes are affected, providing there is sufficient limbal tissue available (1‚Äì2 mm2). A small sample of limbal cells is taken from a healthy part of the eye, and grown in a sterile laboratory to produce a sheet of cells sufficient for transplantation. Once transplanted, they multiply and regrow the corneal epithelium. The manufacturing process is designed to ensure implantation of the right number, size and quality of cells. CLET avoids some of the issues faced by other limbal transplantation procedures and does not pose a threat to the integrity of the donor eye. It also offers the possibility of re-grafting in case of failure of the first graft or need for a further graft. Types There are three types of clonogenic keratinocytes involved in the generation of the corneal epithelium: holoclones, meroclones and paraclones. 1- Holoclones: as true stem cells, have the greatest growth potential, and give rise to 2-meroclones, which have a much lower proliferative capacity, but frequently divide. 3- Paraclones have even lower proliferative capacity. Both meroclones and paraclones are known as transient amplifying cells and their purpose is to form a stratified squamous epithelium. All three types of keratinocytes are present in the basal layer of the limbus, with holoclones in the least abundance (10%‚Äì15%). The basal layer of the cornea is populated by meroclones and paraclones at the periphery, and only paraclones in the central cornea, reflecting the above process of cell division and differentiation. Holoclones are identified by high expression of the marker p63 and are also known as p63 bright cells. Society and culture In February 2015, the European Commission approved autologous CLET using the stem cell therapy Holoclar for people with severe LSCD due to corneal burns. This is the first time that a stem cell therapy (other than the use of umbilical cord stem cells) has been approved by any regulatory agency in the world. It was created by Graziella Pellegrini and Michele de Luca. Holoclar is a tissue-engineered product that comprises ex vivo expanded autologous human corneal epithelial cells including stem cells, which replace limbal stem cells in patients where the limbus has been destroyed by ocular burns. The use of p63 transcription factor as a biomarker of potency ensures specified amount of stem cells needed for clinical success. Clinically relevant long-term beneficial results have been documented in the treatment of patients with LSCD due to physical or chemical ocular burns.

TRS-80 was a brand associated with several desktop microcomputer lines sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores. It was first used on the original TRS-80 (later known as the Model I), one of the earliest mass-produced personal computers. However, Tandy later used the TRS-80 name on a number of different computer lines, many of which were technically unrelated to (and incompatible with) the original Model I and its replacements. In addition to these, Tandy released a number of computers using the Tandy name itself. Original TRS-80 (\\"Model I\\") and its successors =Model I= The original TRS-80 Micro Computer System (later known as the Model I to distinguish it from successors) was launched in 1977 and, alongside the Apple II and Commodore PET, was one of the earliest mass- produced personal computers. The line won popularity with hobbyists, home users, and small-businesses. The Model I included a full-stroke QWERTY keyboard, floating-point BASIC, a monitor, and a starting price of US$600. By 1979, the TRS-80 had the largest selection of software in the microcomputer market. In July 1980 the mostly-compatible TRS-80 Model III was launched, and the original Model I was discontinued. =Model III= TRS-80 Model III In July 1980 Tandy released the Model III, a mostly-compatible replacement for the Model I. Its improvements over the Model I included built-in lower case, a better keyboard, elimination of the cable spaghetti, 1500-baud cassette interface, and a faster (2.03 MHz) Z-80 processor. With the introduction of the Model III, Model I production was discontinued as it did not comply with new FCC regulations as of January 1, 1981 regarding electromagnetic interference. The Model III could run about 80% of Model I software, but used an incompatible disk format. It also came with the option of integrated disk drives. =Model 4= TRS-80 Model 4 (standard version) TRS-80 Model 4P The successor to the Model III was the Model 4. Its microprocessor was a faster Z80A 4 MHz CPU. Disk-based Model 4s had 64 kilobytes of RAM standard; an optional bank of additional 64 kilobytes was accessible to applications software using bank switching technology. The Model 4's new hardware features included a larger display screen with 80 columns by 24 rows, inverse video, and an internal audio speaker. Its keyboard had three function keys and a control key. It used an all-new operating system derived from the advanced Model III LDOS 5, licensed from Logical Systems, now christened TRSDOS Version 6. A more modern version of Microsoft's BASIC interpreter more closely resembled the MS-DOS GW-BASIC, featuring PC-like functionality. The Model 4 could run the industry-standard CP/M operating system without hardware modification (as was needed for the Model III). This afforded the user access to popular application software such as MicroPro's Wordstar, Ashton-Tate's dBase II, and Sorcim's Supercalc. Furthermore, the Model 4 could be booted with any Model III operating system and emulated the Model III with 100 percent compatibility. Prices started from $999 for the diskless version. Early versions of the Model 4 mainboard were designed to accept a Zilog Z800 16 bit CPU upgrade board to replace the Z80 8 bit CPU but this option was never released, as Zilog failed to bring the new CPU to market. Business systems =Tandy 10= Tandy's first design for the business market was a desk-based computer known as the Tandy 10 Business Computer System, which was released in 1978 but quickly discontinued. =TRS-80 Model II and successors= Model II TRS-80 Model II In October 1979 Tandy began shipping the TRS-80 Model II, which was targeted to the small-business market. It was not an upgrade of the Model I, but an entirely different system with state-of-the-art hardware and numerous features not found in the primitive Model I. The Model II was not compatible with the Model I and never had the same breadth of available software. This was somewhat mitigated by the availability of the CP/M from third parties. Model 12 The Model II was replaced in 1982 by the TRS-80 Model 12. This was essentially a Model 16B (described below) without the Motorola processor, and could be upgraded to a Model 16B. Model 16, Model 16B, and Tandy 6000 In February 1982, Tandy released the TRS-80 Model 16, as the follow-on to the Model II; an upgrade kit was available for Model II systems. The Model 16 adds a 6 MHz, 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor and memory card. The Model 16 sold poorly at first and was reliant on existing Model II software early on. In early 1983 Tandy switched from TRSDOS-16 to Xenix. The Model 16 evolved into the Model 16B with 256 KB in July 1983, and later the Tandy 6000, gaining an internal hard drive along the way and switching to an 8 MHz 68000. The 16B was the most popular Unix computer in 1984, with almost 40,000 units sold. Other systems =Color Computers= Tandy also produced the TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo), based on the Motorola 6809 processor. This machine was clearly aimed at the home market, where the Model II and above were sold as business machines. It competed directly with the Commodore 64, Apple II, and Atari 8-bit family of computers. OS-9, a multitasking, multi-user operating system was supplied for this machine. =Model 100 line= In addition to the above, Tandy produced the TRS-80 Model 100 series of laptop computers. This series comprised the TRS-80 Model 100, Tandy 102, Tandy 200 and Tandy 600. The Model 100 was designed by the Japanese company Kyocera with software written by Microsoft. (The Model 100 firmware was the last Microsoft product to which Bill Gates was a major code contributor.) It was also marketed as the Micro Executive Workstation (MEWS).book about the Model 100 The Model 100 had an internal 300 baud modem, built-in BASIC, and a limited text editor. It was possible to use the Model 100 with most phones in the world with the use of an optional acoustic coupler that fit over a standard telephone handset. The combination of the acoustic coupler, the machine's outstanding battery life (it could be used for days on a set of 4 AA cells), and its simple text editor made the Model 100/102 popular with journalists in the early 1980s. The Model 100 line also had an optional bar code reader, serial/RS-232 floppy drive and a Cassette interface. Also available as an option to the Model 100 was an external expansion unit supporting video and a 5\\" disk drive, connected via the 40-pin expansion port in the bottom of the unit. Tandy 200 The Tandy 200 was introduced in 1984 as a higher-end complement to the Model 100. The Tandy 200 had 24 KB RAM expandable to 72 KB, a flip-up 16 line by 40 column display, and a spreadsheet (Multiplan) included. The Tandy 200 also included DTMF tone-dialing for the internal modem. Although less popular than the Model 100, the Tandy 200 was also particularly popular with journalists in the late 1980s and early 1990s. =Reception= InfoWorld in 1985 disapproved of the computer's high cost of accessories (\\"and you'll find that the Tandy 200 has more accessories than a Barbie doll\\"), but called it \\"a big step up from the Model 100 for someone who needs a note-taker or spreadsheet on the run\\". =MC-10= The MC-10 was a short-lived and little-known Tandy computer, similar in appearance to the Sinclair ZX81. It was a small system based on the Motorola 6803 processor and featured 4 KB of RAM. A 16 KB RAM expansion pack that connected on the back of the unit was offered as an option as was a thermal paper printer. A modified version of the MC-10 was sold in France as the Matra Alice. Programs loaded using a cassette which worked much better than those for the Sinclair. A magazine was published which offered programs for both the CoCo and MC-10 but very few programs were available for purchase. Programs for the MC-10 were not compatible with the CoCo. A TRS-80 Pocket Computer (Model: PC-2) ready for use =Pocket Computers= Both the TRS-80 and Tandy brands were used for a range of \\"Pocket Computers\\" sold by Tandy. These were manufactured by Sharp or Casio, depending on the model. =PC-compatible computers= In the early 1980s, Tandy began producing a line of computers that were \\"DOS compatible\\": able to run MS-DOS and certain applications, but not fully compatible with every nuance of the original IBM PC systems. The first of these was the Tandy 2000, followed later by the less expensive Tandy 1000. As margins decreased in PC clones, Tandy was unable to compete and stopped manufacturing their own systems, instead selling computers manufactured by a variety of companies, AST Research and Gateway 2000 among them. Originally, Tandy offered computers manufactured by Tandon Corporation, and then started producing their own line of systems. The Tandy 2000 system was similar to the Texas Instruments Professional Computer in that it offered better graphics, a faster processor (80186) and higher capacity disk drives (80 track double sided 800k 5.25 drives) than the original IBM PC. However, around the time of its introduction, the industry began moving away from MS- DOS compatible computers and towards fully IBM PC compatible clones; later Tandy offerings moved toward full PC hardware compatibility. The later Tandy 1000 systems and follow-ons were also marketed by DEC, as Tandy and DEC had a joint manufacturing agreement.

It was originally the site of the German Church built in 1666‚Äì5 and demolished in 1867 to make way for Queen Victoria Street and the District line of the London Underground; the Doctors' Commons, also demolished in 1867 for the same reason; and the church of St Mary Magdelen, demolished in 1866 after being badly damaged in a fire. At No. 5, the physician Thomas Linacre founded the Royal College of Physicians. Much of the street was demolished when Queen Victoria Street was built in the 1860s. Until 1872, it consisted of three distinct streets: Old Fish Street in the eastern portion, Little Knightrider Street in the middle portion and Great Knightrider Street in the western portion. The Centre Page pub on the street dates back to the 1660s, when it was known as the Horn; perhaps inevitably, David Hasselhoff, the star of the cult 1980s TV series Knight Rider, has said that it is his favourite pub. Name Its name is first recorded in 1322 in the form of Knyghtridestrete; other forms include Knyghtriderestrete, Knyghtryderestrete, Knyghtrederistret and Knightriders streete. The 16th-century historian and antiquarian John Stow suggested in his 1598 Survey of London that the street was named after \\"Knights well armed and mounted at the Tower Royal, riding from thence through that street west to Creed Lane, and so out at Ludgate towards Smithfield, where they were there to tourney, joust, or otherwise to show activities before the King and States of the realm.\\" His proposed etymology is questioned by Eilert Ekwall, who points out that \\"a word knightrider is unrecorded and if it existed it ought to have meant either a horseman serving a knight or a knightly horseman.\\" He suggests that the original name was \\"Riderestret, to which knight was prefixed\\". In early Middle English the term \\"rider\\" was synonymous with \\"knight\\", so people may have thought that \\"Rider Street\\" meant \\"Knight's Street\\" and prefixed it with knight to make that meaning clearer.

She was built in 1903 for use on their cargo service between Harwich, Essex, and the Hook of Holland and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. She was lost at sea with all hands on 27 October 1908. Description Yarmouth was long with a beam of . She had a draught of and a depth of . The vessel was powered by two triple expansion steam engines of 170 NHP (1,650 IHP) driving twin screw propellers. Steam was supplied by two boilers working at a pressure of 180psi. These gave her a speed of . She was rigged as a schooner. History Yarmouth was built in 1903 as yard number 208 by Gourlay Brothers, Dundee, Perthshire. Built at a cost of ¬£35,000, she was launched on 18 March 1903 and delivered to the Great Eastern Railway on 4 June. Her port of registry was Harwich, Essex. The United Kingdom Official Number 116175 was allocated. Yarmouth had an uneventful five-year career on the Harwich‚ÄìHook of Holland route. She underwent a routine inspection and minor repairs by Earle's Shipbuilding, Hull, Yorkshire, between 13 and 17 September 1908. Loss Yarmouth was lost in circumstances that have never been fully explained. The ship left the Hook of Holland having taken on cargo both there and at Rotterdam. At Rotterdam of varied cargo had been loaded and at the Hook a further of meat was loaded and as the holds were already quite full, some of this cargo of cased meat was stowed on the forecastle and poop deck. Carrying a crew of 21 and one passenger (a relative of one of the ship's engineers) the Yarmouth sailed from the Hook at 10:30 am on 27 October 1908 and was next observed at 4:30 pm the same day by the crew of the Outer Gabbard Lightship. The lightship crew observed that the Yarmouth was listing heavily to starboard, so severely in fact, that the master of the lightship made a specific comment to this effect in his log. At about 5:30 pm the lightship crew lost sight of the Yarmouth in misty rain, this was the last known sighting of the ship. Four hours later, the crew of a Norwegian ship, the en route from Honfleur, Manche, France to Hull, saw debris in the water and heard cries. The crew of the Fredheim searched for two hours but found no sign of the Yarmouth or its crew. The following morning, the ship was reported to be missing. It was initially thought that there had probably been a problem with her engines being the reason she had not arrived at Harwich. No distress signal having been received. A Royal Navy cruiser, HMS Blake recovered a body wearing a lifebelt marked Yarmouth, and sighted wreckage not too far from the Outer Gabbard Lightship at , and east of Harwich. Another of the Great Eastern Railway's ships, the sailed from Harwich and recovered further debris and wreckage identified as being from the Yarmouth at a location north east ¬Ω north of the Outer Gabbard Lightship. She returned to Harwich flying her flag at half-mast. Court of inquiry A Board of Trade inquiry into the loss of the Yarmouth was held at the Caxton Hall, Westminster, London in February and March 1909. The court reported its findings on 4 March 1909 and concluded that the loss of the Yarmouth be attributed to carrying deck cargo (the crated meat on the poop and forecastle) which caused the ship to list to starboard and eventually causing the ship to capsize before the crew could attempt to save themselves. As a result of the loss of the Yarmouth the Great Eastern Railway discontinued the practice of carrying deck cargoes on all its vessels.

Built in the Greek Revival style in 1850, it was built by George Ketcham, son of one of Monroe County's leading citizens (John Ketcham). John Ketcham John was the son of Daniel Ketcham and Keziah Pigmon Lewis and born in Washington County, Maryland. His father signed the Patriot's Oath of Allegiance in 1778.Crothers, Bessie S., Oaths of Fidelity to Maryland, vol. 1, Chesterfield, Missouri, (no date) p. 60. In May, 1784 the Ketchams left Maryland to Louisville, Kentucky eventually settling near Shelbyville, Kentucky where John spent his early years.Brumbaugh, Gaius M., and Hodges, Margaret R., Revolutionary Records of Maryland, Part I, Washington 1924.Early Kentucky Tax Records: From the Register of the Kentucky Historical Society, Baltimore 1984, p. 94 & 242. In 1818, Col. Ketcham moved to Monroe County six or seven miles (11 km) from Bloomington near Victor and Harrodsburg. He built a grist mill on Clear Creek the first year and became known far and wide for his service. When the city of Bloomington was laid out in 1818, Ketcham was asked to design and contract for building of the first courthouse there. In 1836, Ketcham was named one of General Andrew Jackson's electors for the Presidential election of that year. He served in the Indiana House of Representatives. Ketcham was later appointed a trustee of the Indiana Seminary which would become Indiana University. Ketcham and a co-worker established a Methodist religious school on grounds at the south end of College Avenue in Bloomington. Col. John Ketcham died in this house in 1865 and is buried in the Ketcham Family Cemetery in Monroe County. The family cemetery is still maintained by family members. His grandson, Daniel, was last male Ketcham to own the house. Daniel's widow, Beulah, was last Ketcham to live in the house until her death in 1955. Sophia Travis, Gregory Travis' late wife, is also interred in the Ketcham Cemetery. =21st century= The home has been in the Travis family since 1998. Current owner Gregory Travis serves on architectural and historic preservation organizations. He is in the process of nominating the house for the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1998 the home has seen several major changes, perhaps the most noticeable being the removal of the cement-asbestos siding which was placed on the structure in the 1940s. With removal of that siding, the native Poplar siding of the original structure was revealed. Architecture =Structure= The structure of the house is typical of the design known as the \\"I-house\\" ‚Äî its two stories are each divided into two rooms, one on each side. Such a plan is typical of the vernacular architecture of Monroe County in the middle of the nineteenth century: the area's early settlers generally favored the \\"I plan\\", finding it simple and sufficient for their needs without sacrificing elegance.Klassen, Teri. \\"Owners seek loan to restore historic house on Fairview.\\" The Herald-Times, 1985-06-03. Few such houses remain in a condition closely resembling their early years; despite the changes made to it, the Ketcham-Travis House remains one of the best surviving examples of this mid-19th century style. =Details= Inside, the house is constructed of mortise and tendon joints, with some nails. The main structural components are 12‚Äù x 12‚Äù solid walnut hand-hewn timbers that form the skeleton of each of the four main rooms. The two rooms upstairs, which have 10 feet ceilings, and two rooms downstairs, which have 11 feet ceilings, share a central staircase. The woodwork and carvings on the stairwell and staircase are all original. The original woodwork continues to the cabinetry in bedrooms which is made of butternut wood, a variety of walnut wood, most likely constructed from native walnut trees that were harvested on the property. The cabinetry is ornate, particularly for the period, and features Moorish flourishes. Outside, much of the house appears to have been built from materials salvaged from earlier structures. This is indicated by the presence of unused mortises in many of the main structural members. Construction of the doors in the main part of the house shows them to be authentic and of the period. There are three deep cisterns on the property, one of which is under the house itself. The land is in the heart of the Indiana limestone district and is heavily karst-pocketed. Wells could not be drilled for water, although the Ketchams sank no less than five separate wells. Eventually water was collected from the roofs of the barn and main house and much of the piping, etc. for that collection system, including the cisterns, still remains. Ketcham mill lay across Ketcham (now Fluck Mill) road from the house. This mill was powered by water from Clear Creek until about 1890 and the foundations of the dam across Clear Creek are still easily visible in the creek bed behind the house. After 1890 the mill was powered by a steam engine and water power was disconnected. The final version of the mill burned to the ground in ca. 1910 but its foundations still exist. Ketcham Station was a railroad station built in 1900 by the Monon Railroad. It sat on the eastern edge of the property and was in use until about 1940. The foundations of the station still exist.

She is a resident in the Alexandria Safe-Zone. Created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Charlie Adlard, the character made her debut in The Walking Dead #72 in 2010. In both media Jessie is living in an unhappy, abusive marriage with her husband Pete and her son Ron (and Sam in the TV series) in the Alexandria Safe-Zone. Upon her husband‚Äôs death, Jessie forms a romantic relationship with Rick Grimes. She is eventually devoured by walkers, along with her youngest son Sam, when a herd swarms Alexandria. Appearances = Comic book series = Jessie appears as a resident of the Alexandria Safe Zone community which Rick Grimes and his survivors enter. She makes her first appearance at the dinner party for the community, appearing nervous and quiet.The Walking Dead #72 (November 2010) Although her investment in the safe zone itself is limited and she refuses to speak about her marital problems, she is abruptly encountered by Rick who faces the issue immediately. Rick confronts her in private and she admits that Pete has been physically abusive, but still stands by him. She remains protective of their son, Ron. A series of events occur that begin with Rick confronting Pete, which ultimately ends with Pete being executed after murdering Alexandria's leader's wife, Regina. Jessie grieves silently, but rather shortly, as she finds herself relieved that the trouble is over. She expresses gratitude towards Rick about the situation and later becomes more interested in him. She begins to make romantic advances on him, which he returns later. Rick begins to move on from his previous wife, Lori as his relationship with Jessie grows stronger. During the horde that attacks Alexandria, Jessie, Rick, his son Carl and her son, Ron cover themselves in guts to move through the horde. The plan fails and Ron is devoured by walkers, and she is later bitten. She is unable to let go of Carl's hand as the horde moves in his direction, forcing Rick to amputate her hand with a hatchet to save his son. She is later found by Sgt. Abraham Ford devoured and reanimated who shoots her to avoid Rick seeing her undead. = Television series =  Season 5  In the episode \\"Remember\\", Jessie appears as a member of the Alexandria Safe-Zone who gives supplies to newcomer Rick Grimes, who recently shaved his long beard and Jessie offers to give him a haircut. Later when the group explores the neighborhood Rick loses sight of Carl and Judith and runs into Jessie who shows a panicking Rick that they are just talking to some elderly residents. In the episode \\"Forget\\", Jessie, Pete, Ron, and Sam attend Deanna's party. In \\"Spend\\", Jessie is shown when Rick visits her. She explains to him that her owl sculpture was broken, but doesn't know who did it. Rick promises to look into it, but Jessie questions what he will do, and he tells her that he will think of some kind of punishment. Later towards the end of the episode, Carol Peletier visits Pete, asking for Jessie. In response he replies, \\"Not a good time.\\" Carol then informs Rick that Jessie is being abused and suggests that Sam may be as well. In the episode \\"Try\\", Jessie is in her garage when Rick shows up, informing her that he knows her family's secret. She tells him that she is a grown, married woman who can take care of herself. Jessie closes the garage door on Rick. Jessie appears to be crying about her problems, when Rick walks through her door, asking her to let him help her. She then gives him permission to help her. Pete walks through the back door drunk. He demands Rick to leave, but Jessie tells him softly to leave. \\"Just go\\", she tells both Pete and Rick. Pete punches Rick, which leads to them having a fight in their house, and then in the street after they blast through the window, brawling. In the season finale \\"Conquer\\", Jessie is among the crowd discussing the fight.  Season 6  In the season premiere, \\"First Time Again\\", Jessie first appears in a flashback. She is first seen hugging a devastated Sam at their home when Ron walks out. Later, Jessie is in the armory when Rick walks in. Jessie admonishes Rick for his behavior with Ron in the woods. In the episode \\"JSS\\" when The Wolves attack Alexandria, Jessie hides with Sam in a closet, but goes downstairs to warn Ron away from the house as she knows there is a Wolf inside, armed with a gun. A Wolf sneaks up behind her and slams her to the floor. The Wolf goes to pick up Jessie's gun that she threw away when she was attacked. Jessie arises from the ground and picks up some scissors from her stylist set and runs towards the Wolf when her back is turned. Jessie repeatedly stabs the Wolf in the chest violently. Ron walks in and watches her as Jessie kills the Wolf. Jessie then stabs the Wolf's brain to prevent reanimation. In the episode \\"Now\\", Jessie listens to Rick's speech after he is chased by a super-pack of walkers to the gates of Alexandria and now the community is surrounded by walkers. She goes home and removes the dead Wolf from her kitchen. Later, Jessie kills a zombified Betsy, who had committed suicide after her husband's death. In the episode \\"Heads Up\\", Jessie is at Rosita Espinosa's weapon training class learning how to use a machete. In the mid-season finale, \\"Start to Finish\\", Jessie helps Rick, an injured Deanna, Carl, Michonne, Gabriel and Ron into her house after Alexandria is swarmed with walkers. She urgently pushes against the walkers that are trying to push into her house along with the others. Pushing the walkers out downstairs, there seem to be too many and they begin entering the house. They all rush upstairs and formulate a plan to escape. They cover themselves in walker blood and guts and start walking through the herd, holding hands. In the mid-season premiere, \\"No Way Out\\", Jessie is seen walking through the herd with Rick and the others. They stop and discuss an adapted plan to leave Alexandria. Jessie attempts to get Sam to go with Gabriel and Judith to the church for safety, but he refuses. Walking through the night, Sam begins to panic when he sees a young boy walker. He starts making noise and Jessie and Ron desperately try to calm him down, but the walkers find him and devour him. Jessie breaks down in tears, still holding onto Sam's hand. Carl, Ron, and Rick tell her that they must leave to avoid discovery by the walkers. She doesn't listen, however, leading the walkers to find and devour her. While Jessie is being eaten alive, Carl attempts to escape, but is unable due to her tight grip on his hand. Rick chops off her hand with his hatchet to save Carl from being pulled in after her.  Casting  Breckenridge explained: \\"I didn't know anything. I hadn't watched the show before. I'd watched the pilot a long time ago, which I enjoyed, but I wasn't into the blood and guts at the time so I didn't continue watching for that reason. When I got the part, I watched all four seasons in a week and was having zombie nightmares. It was like cramming for an exam. I hadn't read the comics and when I first had my meeting with Scott Gimple, he suggested I not read the comics because the show and characters aren't always exact to the comics. If you've seen the comics, my character has short black hair with bangs and wears a headband ‚Äî and she's a meek; she's a weaker character than I'm playing on the show, which is great because I enjoy playing a stronger character.\\"  Reception   References  Category:Characters created by Robert Kirkman Category:Comics characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional characters from Virginia Category:Fictional hairdressers Category:Fictional housewives Category:Fictional zombies and revenants Category:Fictional domestic abuse victims Category:The Walking Dead characters Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Jessie Anderson (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"45568937","text":"St Patrick's Basilica as it is known because of its style of architecture,In Roman Catholic ecclesiastical terms, St Patrick's Basilica is not a Minor basilica.

Background After his wife died, B was left to raise his 2 daughters (referred to as D1 and D2) on his own. At the time, D1 was aged 7, and D2 5. In July 1988, without any warning, the police informed him that social workers had just collected his daughters from school, and put into their protection due to allegations that he had sexually molested both his daughters, and proceeded to interview him. However, as the police found no evidence that he had abused his daughters, no criminal charges were ever laid. B then arranged for his daughters to move back into his house under the care of one of his employees, until his parents from England arrived to care for them. The subsequent social worker and psychologists investigations, were both later held by the court to be negligently done. For example, the doctors examination did not reveal any evidence of sexual abuse, the doctor also noted that the girls \\"told lies\\", and daughter D2 said the abuse happened in the attic of their house, when it had no attic, D2 said that both had been sexually abused when the other daughter D1 denied any such abuse, and 2 weeks into their care, the D2 admitted to a family friend that she had lied about the abuse happening. Despite all this contradicting evidence, the daughters were still not allowed back with their father until 9 months later, in April 1989, and this only changed after a protracted 9 week family court hearing. B then sued the government for $50,000 for exemplary damages, and $500,000 in damages on behalf of his daughters. The Court of Appeal dismissed his claim, and he appealed. Held The Privy Council ruled that B had no arguable claim. However, the daughters claim was still arguable, and their claim was remitted back to the court for arguing.

Established in 1858 from a disused brickfield it is now an important part of cultural life in Launceston and also a heritage park. The park is known for its symmetrical planning and the bronze gilded Val d'Osne Fountain. The park is bound on all four sides by Elizabeth Street, St John Street, Frederick Street and Charles Street. History Reserved as a public space in 1826 under the name 'St John's Square', the site was first used as a clay pit for the construction of local buildings when the settlement of Launceston went from rough timber cottages to the first permanent brick buildings in the late 1810s. From 1824 to 1828, the new brickfield was notably used to supply bricks for St John's Anglican Church, the first church to be built in Launceston and immediately opposite the square from which it was built. As the clay for the rapidly expanding settlement began to be sourced from newer brickfields along Glen Dhu Rivulet to the southwest, the vacant pit saw use as a temporary rubbish dump for residents of the area until 1843 when it was acquired for use as a parade ground for soldiers stationed in Launceston. Encouraged by the presence of St Johns Church and the newly built Milton Hall tabernacle in 1842 also overlooking the site, people began to build around the square and the site began to see use as a local recreational space and meeting point. In 1851, St John's Square was the site of an election between two candidates of the new Legislative Council in Van Diemen's Land. Two years later in 1853 when Launceston was granted status as a municipality and Reverend John West and the Anti-Transportation League ended convict transportation to Van Diemen's Land, a great congregation was held in the square to announce the declaration. With the growing sense of civic pride that followed, the Municipal Council set about transforming the square into a grand and stately place aimed at the gentry of the city. In 1858, the Municipal Council applied to the Launceston Horticultural Society for curator Thomas Wade to design the new park. Both the residents of the city and the horticultural society were involved in the works which involved the setting out of paths, fencing and trees including an assortment of Oaks, two Sequoias and a mixture of exotic shrubbery. The iconic fountain was installed a year later in 1859 towards the completion of the works. The official opening of the new square was held on 9 November 1859 in a celebration to commemorate the coming of age for the Prince of Wales. In 1868, the Duke of Edinburgh visited Launceston where he planted two Oak trees and a massive celebration was held in the Square featuring a choir, candlelight and background illumination from the city's new town gas supply. The event saw the name changed from the former 'St John's Square' to 'Prince's Square' to commemorate the momentous event. Val d'Osne Fountain Standing at 7 meters high and the focal point of Prince's Square, the iconic Val d'Osne Fountain sits at the center of the park at the meeting point of the main pathways. First exhibited in the Paris Industrial Exhibition of 1855 as the show-piece for Barbezat & Co., proprietors of the foundries of Val d'Osne, the fountain was purchased by the Municipal Council in 1859 to commemorate the completion of Launceston's town water scheme in 1857. The design of the fountain was the work of the distinguished French artist M.Lienard with the 4 main base statues depicting Neptune, Galatea, Amphitrite and Acis being sculpted by M.Moreau. = Urban Legends = A popular local myth regarding the Val d'Osne Fountain is that it itself was an accident and was never intended to have been sent to Launceston. As the myth states, Launceston in Cornwall, England bought the fountain and had it shipped from France but due to the shared names of the two towns, the fountain was accidentally posted to Launceston in 'Cornwall Shire', Tasmania. Due to the high shipping costs of returning it, the fountain was then placed in the new square as the council did not know what else to do with it. Whilst the legend is not supported by historians and defies historic records of purchase, the myth itself was likely based around an article in a local newspaper whereby the 'Cornwall Chronicle' of 26 February 1859 pointed out the low price of around 40-50 pounds that the council reported having spent which seemed to go against what would have been expected for a fountain of its stature. A lesser known urban myth pertains to the originality of top piece of the fountain. The myth states that the original portrayed a half- naked nymph which was scorned by the citizens of the city as being too rude and so it was replaced by a 'pineapple'. The myth itself is flawed by the fact that the top piece of the fountain is actually a sheaf of reeds and that the catalogue from which the council made the original purchase clearly displays the top piece that is in situ today. Churches Prince's Square also has the highest concentration of churches in the city with a total of 5 churches facing the square, two with rectories/manses also visible. Starting with the construction of St Johns Church in 1824, various sites around the square were developed as the area opened up, a number of which were chosen as sites for churches and related buildings connected to the Christian faith. Listed in chronological order of construction, the churches are: * 1824 St John's Church * 1841 St John's Square Congregational Chapel (Milton Hall) * 1859 Chalmers' Presbyterian Church * 1883 Christ Church Congregational Church (now City Baptist Church) * 1939 Gospel Hall Further reading * References External links Category:Launceston, Tasmania Category:Parks in Tasmania Category:Tasmanian Heritage Register ","title":"Prince's Square"},{"id":"45569025","text":"FREAK (\\"Factoring RSA Export Keys\\") is a security exploit of a cryptographic weakness in the SSL/TLS protocols introduced decades earlier for compliance with U.S. cryptography export regulations. These involved limiting exportable software to use only public key pairs with RSA moduli of 512 bits or less (so- called RSA_EXPORT keys), with the intention of allowing them to be broken easily by the National Security Agency (NSA), but not by other organizations with lesser computing resources. However, by the early 2010s, increases in computing power meant that they could be broken by anyone with access to relatively modest computing resources using the well-known Number Field Sieve algorithm, using as little as $100 of cloud computing services. Combined with the ability of a man-in-the-middle attack to manipulate the initial cipher suite negotiation between the endpoints in the connection and the fact that the Finished hash only depended on the master secret, this meant that a man- in-the-middle attack with only a modest amount of computation could break the security of any website that allowed the use of 512-bit export-grade keys. While the exploit was only discovered in 2015, its underlying vulnerabilities had been present for many years, dating back to the 1990s. Vulnerability The flaw was found by researchers from IMDEA Software Institute, INRIA and Microsoft Research. The FREAK attack in OpenSSL has the identifier . Vulnerable software and devices included Apple's Safari web browser, the default browser in Google's Android operating system, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and OpenSSL. Microsoft has also stated that its SChannel implementation of transport-layer encryption is vulnerable to a version of the FREAK attack in all versions of Microsoft Windows. The CVE ID for Microsoft's vulnerability in SChannel is . The CVE ID for Apple's vulnerability in Secure Transport is . Sites affected by the vulnerability included the US federal government websites fbi.gov, whitehouse.gov and nsa.gov, with around 36% of HTTPS-using websites tested by one security group shown as being vulnerable to the exploit. Based on geolocation analysis using IP2Location LITE, 35% of vulnerable servers are located in the US. Press reports of the exploit have described its effects as \\"potentially catastrophic\\" and an \\"unintended consequence\\" of US government efforts to control the spread of cryptographic technology. , vendors were in the process of releasing new software that would fix the flaw. On March 9, 2015, Apple released security updates for both iOS 8 and OS X operating systems which fixed this flaw. On March 10, 2015, Microsoft released a patch which fixed this vulnerability for all supported versions of Windows (Server 2003, Vista and later). Google Chrome 41 and Opera 28 has also mitigated against this flaw. Mozilla Firefox is not vulnerable against this flaw. The research paper explaining this flaw has been published at the 36th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy and has been awarded the Distinguished Paper award.

Biblehub Verse 7 : But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. NKJV *\\"Treasure in earthen vessels\\": The Gospel, as a \\"treasure\\" because \\"it contains rich truths\\", is placed in \\"earthen vessels,\\" i.e. \\"ministers of the word.\\"Jewish scholars also think likewise, for examples, R. Eleazar says (T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 52. 2.): \\"a disciple of a wise man like, ... at first ... like to a golden cup; when he has conversed with him, he is like to a silver cup; and when he has received any profit by him, he is like \\"an earthen cup\\", which, when broken, cannot be repaired again. Also, \\"the law is not confirmed but by him, who makes himself 'as an earthen vessel'\\" (Shirhashirim Rabba, fol. 4. 2.) apud Gill, John. On 2 Corinthians 4:7. It alludes either to the \\"earth\\", where hidden treasures are to be dug, or to \\"pots and vessels made of earth\\", or to \\"earthen pitchers\\", formerly to carry lights or lamps (cf. : three hundred men of Gideon took empty pitchers and placed lamps within the pitchers); the latter may represent the Gospel as a \\"glorious light, shining in darkness\\" (; ).

Plot Oswald is a baker who bakes for a hippo king. For the majesty's dinner, Oswald bakes a giant pie filled with living crows, a reference to the nursery rhyme Sing a Song of Sixpence. When a little mess from his work gets on his master's face, the hippo king threatens to penalize Oswald. However, the princess, who is Kitty, comes to his defense and begs to give the rabbit a second chance. The hippo king forgives Oswald but warns him that he'd be beheaded if something unpleasant happens to the pie. Oswald is back at the kitchen, standing next to the pie. While the hippo king's dinner is still hours away, a crow from within the pie calls another crow from out the window. To Oswald's surprise, the outsider crow cuts a hole in the pie, enabling the crows from inside the dish to escape. As the crows are just outdoors, Oswald attempts to put salt on their tails. One of the crows, however, is clever to replace the salt shaker with one containing pepper. When Oswald sprinkles pepper which has no effect, that crow blows the condiment on the rabbit's face. But as Oswald sneezes, the crows have their feathers blown off, therefore eliminating their ability to fly. The crows then get away by running. Oswald resorts to shooting arrows. One of Oswald's arrows unintendedly hits a giant serpent. The provoked serpent heads toward the hippo king's castle. Oswald and the crows hide themselves in the pie. The serpent also enters the dish. The hippo king calls for the pie as it is dinner time. The servants are the ones who carry the dish to him. When Oswald pops out of the pie, the hippo king is quick to give the rabbit to the headsman. But before Oswald could lose his head, the serpent also pops out of the pie. The serpent frightens everybody around, especially the headsman who leaves the castle for good by smashing through the wall with his body. The serpent catches Kitty but Oswald is able to rescue her. Oswald and Kitty continue to keep distance as the long beast pursues them. As the chase goes on in circles, the serpent, without realizing, devours its tail and up to its torso, thus destroying itself. Following the defeat of the serpent, the hippo king resumes to have the pie, and no longer seeks to penalize Oswald. The crows come out of the dead serpent's mouth (implying they were swallowed sometime earlier) before reentering the pie. As the pie is presented to the hippo king, the crows rise to the surface of the dish, and play musical instruments in the style of an orchestra.

A major part of it was built in the late 1700s but it is possible that some of it dates from about 1634. It was the residence for many notable people for two centuries. It is now a hotel which provides accommodation and restaurant services and caters for special events particularly weddings. Early History ¬´About half a mile west of Sedgefield stands the manor and hall of Hardwick. Under Hatfield's Survey, Roger Fulthorp and John Herdwick held this manor, by homage, fealty, suit of court, and 10s rent. In 1391, Thomas Watkinson, of Elstop, was seized of a moiety of the manor. John de Herdwick died, seized of his proportion, in the 9th year of Bishop Skirlaw; and Agnes, his daughter and heiress, married Gilbert de Hoton, who died in the 12th year of the same prelate, seized in her right, leaving John his son and heir. The families of Cramlington and Killinghall soon after held possessions here; and, in 1500, John Hebborne, in right of Ellen his wife, and William Hansard, in right of Elizabeth his wife, as daughters and coheiresses of John Hoton, had livery of his lands. Soon afterwards, Hardwick appears to have been wholly the estate of the Hebbornes: and John Hebborne, Esq., in 1507, obtained licence to alien the manors or townships of Herdwick and Shotton, nigh Sedgefield, to Anthony Mitford and others; which alienation must have been in trust or settlement, for Anthony Hebborne, Esq.; whilst he was seized of the manor, was attainted of high treason in the Northern Rebellion, and forfeited his manor of Hardwick and lands in Mainsforth and Bishop-Middleham. In the 32d year of Queen Elizabeth, Hardwick was granted, by letters patent, to George Frevill, Esq., as a reward for his services during the rebellion, with remainder to Elizabeth his wife, and to William Jennison, under a reserved rent of ¬£25, 19s. 6d.¬ª The Frevilles and Lambtons In 1590 the manor of Hardwick was granted to George Freville. He was knighted by King James at York, 17th April, 1603. George Freville died childless in 1619, leaving his lands to his younger nephew Nicholas. In 1645 Nicholas compounded for his Hardwick estate. He died in 1674, leaving three daughters and co-heirs, Elizabeth, Mary, and Margaret widow of Thomas Lambton. Freville Lambton, son of Margaret, had Hardwick by the will of his grandfather. He and his mother, then the widow of Nicholas Conyers of Biddick Waterville, made a settlement of the manor in 1687. Freville Lambton married 1) Ann Milward, of Uttoxeter, Stafford; 2) Thomasine Milward; and 3) Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Wright, English judge and Chief Justice of the King‚Äôs Bench. By his second wife, he had his son and heir, Thomas, who had six daughters and co-heirs: Barbara, Dorothy, Thomasina, Philadelphia, Margaret and Elizabeth. They sold Hardwick in 1748 to John Burdon, who in 1780 conveyed it to William Russell, retaining a life interest. John Burdon Engraved drawing of Hardwick Hall Park 1787 Advertisement for the sale of Hardwick Hall in 1747 John Burdon (1711-1792) is credited with being the main originator of Hardwick Hall. However Pevsner believes that he built on an existing manor which was constructed in 1634. p. 301. The advertisement for the Hardwick Estate sold by the Lambton family in 1747 just before Burdon bought it states that there exists a ‚Äúgood Mansion House‚ÄùNewcastle Courant - Saturday 30 May 1747, p. 3. so it is possible that he made major alterations and additions to this building. John Burdon was born in 1711 in South Shields, Durham. His father was Nicholas Burdon an immensely wealthy salt and shipping merchant. He remained a bachelor all of his life. When his father died in 1847 John inherited his fortune p. 70. and so was able to purchase the Hardwick Estate and spend a very large sum on creating the elaborate pleasure gardens. The gardens were described in numerous publications of the time. Hutchinson in 1785 says that they are ‚Äúlaid out with exquisite taste‚Äù and then outlines in detail the buildings and ornaments that can be seen in a walk around the park.Hutchinson, William 1785 ‚ÄúThe history and antiquities of the county palatine of Durham‚Äù, Vol 3, p. 65.

In 1790 at the age of 79 John sold the Hardwick Estate to William Russell. The Russell Family Matthew Russell (1765-1822) Elizabeth Russell, wife of Matthew Russell William Russell (1734-1817) was a very wealthy banker and merchant. In 1796 he bought Brancepeth Castle and it seems that from about his time his son Matthew took over the running of Hardwick Hall and made many improvements to the house and garden. Matthew Russell (1765-1822) was born in 1765. He was educated at Oxford University and later became a Member of Parliament.The History of Parliament website. Online reference http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/russell- matthew-1765-1822 In 1798 he married Elizabeth Tennyson, the daughter of George Tennyson of Bayons Manor Lincolnshire. Elizabeth was the favourite aunt of Alfred, Lord Tennyson and he frequently sent letters to her. As he was often in financial difficulties she sent him generous gifts of money which he greatly appreciated. The couple had two children William Russell (1798‚Äì1850) and Emma Maria Russell (1809-1870). In 1817 Matthew's father died and he inherited his vast fortune and Brancepeth Castle. From this time he spent most of his energies on his new home and Hardwick Hall gardens began to decline. He died in 1822 and his son William Russell (1798-1850) inherited the property. William did not live in the house and instead rented it to various noblemen and merchants. When he died in 1850 his sister Emma Maria inherited Brancepeth Castle and Hardwick Hall.The History of Parliament.

Racial hygiene was a big concern and the intent to fix it made Germany take extreme measures. People who were deaf and hard-of-hearing and all of the disabled were considered a \\"social burden\\". Adolf Hitler and many others feared that deafness was a hereditary gene that could be passed on from mother or father to the child. Germany's main solution to decrease the numbers was through sterilization. Overview More than one hundred female sterilizations were known by the 1930s. Sterilization procedures were done by two common ways: through the vagina or Laparotomy. The incision through the vagina was very unreliable, therefore hardly ever practiced. Laparotomy is a surgical procedure through the abdominal cavity which was the most \\"successful\\" in the future infertility of the women. When the abdominal cavity was opened the ways of sterilization were by crushing or removing the fallopian tubes, but the most \\"successful\\" method was by removing the uterus, which surgeons often opted for. All of these procedures were done with little or no anesthetics. Some simple methods were removal of the tubes, but because of the high failure rate it was not commonly practiced. \\"the sterilization offered surgeons and gynecologists a broad field for experimentation on human subjects in order to test new operational procedures.\\" Another simple but dangerous procedure was sterilization by x-ray. In the end the choice of operation was left in the hands of the surgeon. \\"with a heavy heart, I let myself be sterilized again. But this was much worse than the first time. My stomach was cut up horribly. For the first sterilization, the incision was horizontal but the second time they made a long vertical cut in my belly. I've often had a rupture when I got up during the night when I was upset. It just bursts.\\" = Law for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases = Germany passed the Law for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases on July 14, 1933.Horst, Biesold, Crying Hands: Eugenic and Deaf People in Nazi Germany, Washington D. C., Gallaudet University Press 2004. It was amended and extended on June 26, 1935 and Section 10a was added, which authorized forced abortions in women who were otherwise subject to sterilization. It was used as a method to prevent the expansion of hereditary disease. Hitler believed in an Aryan nation, and that the German race could reign supreme through eugenics. Anyone that was deemed ‚Äúunfit to live‚Äù was to be sterilized or eliminated. In the case of the Jewish Deaf, many were eliminated. Section 1 of the Law for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases stated ‚Äúa person who is hereditarily diseased may be sterilized by a surgical operation, when the experience of medical science indicates a strong likelihood that the offspring will suffer from severe hereditary physical or mental defects.‚Äù Deafness was believed to be hereditary, but there was a lack of proper modern medicine or research to prove otherwise. German eugenicists believed that only legally regulated compulsory sterilization would solve the issue of \\"racial hygiene\\", a belief that placed races in a hierarchy and sought to keep people considered non- white from having children with people considered white. So, they looked to the United States for a model. Between 1934 and 1939, estimates on the number of people sterilized range from 200,000 to 400,000, as much as 0.5% of the German population. The Law for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases not only affected deaf individuals, but also those with other disabilities including mental deficiency, schizophrenia, hereditary epilepsy, blindness, physical disabilities, congenital feeblemindedness, and even severe alcoholism. The deaf were reported to the authorities by their families, peers, teachers, and doctors. Children in deaf schools were often taken by authorities, and even some of their teachers, to be sterilized unknowingly and without consent. Some were forced to undergo sterilization even if there was proof that they could give birth to ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù children. After Section 10a was added, women were not only forced to undergo sterilization, but to terminate their pregnancies without consent or knowledge. Some were terminated as late as nine months. The usual method of sterilizing men was to sever the sperm duct, known as a vasectomy. By the 1930s, there were more than one hundred different female sterilization procedures. In almost all cases a laparotomy was practiced, and either the fallopian tubes were crushed, severed, or removed, or the entire uterus was removed. This was called the ‚ÄúHitler cut,‚Äù and in many cases it would take weeks, sometimes even months, to heal. Some died due to surgical complications such as infections. X-rays were also used as a form of sterilization and became legally permissible in 1936. These procedures allowed surgeons and gynecologists the chance to experiment on human subjects in order to test for new operational procedures. Legislators, supported by other institutions, agreed to remain silent on the subject of persecution under the sterilization law, and deaf persons and their families were warned not to speak of their sterilizations. Leaflets and other propaganda were used to suggest that the operations were harmless, comparing them to appendectomies. Even some educators of deaf students characterized the ‚Äúexperience of sterilization‚Äù as positive. A questionnaire was sent out by Horst Biesold, author of Crying Hands: Eugenics and Deaf People in Nazi Germany. It was revealed that of those who responded, 1,215 people admitted to being sterilized between 1933 and 1945. Their ages ranged from nine to fifty years old, with 18% of them being between the ages of twenty-two and twenty- five. More than half of them were female. Nearly all of them were born between 1901 and 1926. Most sterilization took place in Berlin, but also occurred in cities such as Munich, D√ºsseldorf, Dortmund, Duisburg, and Essen. Sterilization of deaf children In Nazi Germany many people were forced into sterilization by Nazis who believed in race purity and their right to enforce it. Between 1933 and 1945 roughly 15,000 deaf people were forced into sterilization. The youngest victim being only 9 years old, nearly 5,000 children up to the age of 16 were sterilized. Deaf children were forced to sterilization for reported hereditary deafness or feeblemindedness. Some were even reported for asocial behavior and claimed defects of character. Some deaf children learned to act as if they could hear, some even learned to speak to avoid this fate. Although pretending to hear may have saved some, thousands of children fell victim. Many deaf children who were students in Deaf Institutes were reported by their own teachers and directors. The teachers reported, forced, and even transported students to hospitals, in order to contribute to the Nazi race cultivation plan. Students were often brought to hospitals under pretext of other treatments, and tricked into sterilization. If a student refused they were beaten and handcuffed, some cases were reported that they were forced to watch the procedure as well. Many times the parents were only informed after the procedure was done to their child. Parents often thought they were sending their kids to get cured from being deaf, when in fact they were being sterilized or even killed. By 1940 sterilization stopped and was followed by killing which was called ‚ÄúMercy Killing‚Äù by the Nazis, about 16,000 deaf people were murdered. Around 1,600 children who were deaf and had special disabilities were killed by drugs or even being starved to death. Newborn babies who were thought to be deaf were registered and marked to be murdered. Women who were pregnant and deaf, would have forced abortions, even when they were nine months pregnant. Many of the parents who sent their kids to be ‚Äúcured‚Äù were not informed of their death until after the bodies were cremated and they would not even send the bodies to the family. The families were led to believe that their children had died of natural causes. The forced sterilizations were often rushed and used little anesthetics. The sterilization process affected very intimate areas, and many victims felt maimed, violated, and degraded, especially those who were at the age of puberty. Deaf children lived their lives feeling violated and suffered physical and psychological pain. Effects of sterilization These sterilizations not only had many physical impacts, but mental and emotional impacts as well. Some forcibly sterilized deaf were admitted to neurological clinics and clinical sanatoriums because of depression. Sterilizations negatively impacted many relationships, engagements, and marriages, and often left those affected feeling lonely and isolated. Also, the burden of suffering was so great that it led to suicide. The physical effects of sterilization in the early twentieth century in Nazi Germany were less than desirable, to say the least. Because Nazi doctors often operated on people with little to no anesthesia, patients experienced extreme amounts of pain during and after the operation. Furthermore, studies show that the patients experienced intense physical effects of the operation decades after the procedure had taken place. Horst Biesold, teacher of deaf students and author of Crying Hands, interviewed and surveyed multiple deaf survivors of such sterilizations. In this excerpt of Crying Hands, an interviewee born in 1918 describes the physical effects of her own sterilization: \\"I was forcibly sterilized by the Nazis in July 1938. It was extremely painful torture‚Ä¶I suffered terrible pain‚Ä¶Throughout my marriage with a deaf husband I have had pains as a result of the operation. Even today the pains are often very intense‚Ä¶While other women have orgasms and experience the joy of lovemaking, the pain from the operation scars kills all pleasure for me.\\" Other accounts include a man who suffered for years with heart problems, a woman who had become deathly ill, and another man who only experienced pain during sexual intercourse as a result of the sterilization. Of the 1,215 people that Biesold interviewed, 601 (49.47%) people responded \\"yes\\" when asked if they still suffer from physical pain as a result of the operation. Of those 601 people, 258 (52.54%) of them reported the pain to be located in their abdomen, specifically in the \\"groin, testicles, and lumbar region.\\" Being forcibly sterilized caused a lot of emotional damages for the deaf victims in Nazi Germany. Personal statements of victims in Crying Hands mention they felt a lot of grief because they couldn't have children, and heartache because her fiance backed out of marriage because she could no longer have children. When asked if they still suffer from psychological pain, out of the 1215 asked 928 (78.38%) said yes, 49 (4.03%) said no, and 238 (19.59%) had no response. Emotional effects on young people forcibly sterilized were greater than adults. Male victims between ages 13‚Äì18 were 12% more likely to report mental suffering than older male victims. In women ages 13‚Äì18 were 9% more likely. Disruptions in adaptation and development among young victims and produced depression due to uprooting. Severe depression, attempted suicide and awareness that their entire lives could have been different were mentioned as consequences of the condition of young victims of sterilization. When they were asked \\"Do you still suffer from psychological pain?\\" \\"Are you often sad?\\" and \\"Do you feel lonely without children?\\" Men answered: 172 (85.15%) said yes, 3 (1.49%) said no, and 27 (13.37%) had no response. Women answered: 195 (84.42%) said yes, 3 (1.30%) said no, and 33 (14.29%) had no response.

He was a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council.  Early life  Benjamin Backhouse was born in England in 1829. He was a Bachelor of Arts and was educated as an architect.  Career  In early life Backhouse, with his young wife and two children, came out to Australia and settled down in Geelong, Victoria. He soon made a name for himself as an architect, and two months after his arrival succeeded in winning a hundred- guinea prize for the best design for a stock exchange for that city. Some eight years later he returned to England, and remained for a year, and then came out to Queensland. He carried on his profession for eight years, and designed some of the principal buildings in Brisbane. Although he won the design competition for the Queensland Parliament House, it was later decided that his design would be too expensive and was rejected. He was also an alderman of the Brisbane Municipal Council. For the previous 35 years Backhouse resided in New South Wales. His professional skill was recognised by his election for 12 years as the chairman of the City of Sydney Improvement Board. In August, 1895, he was appointed to a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council, which he retained until his death. Although not a union official or a Labour candidate, his sympathies were at all times with the workers. He was truly democratic, and was a follower of John Ruskin and other workers for the amelioration of society. He also identified himself with the Pitt Town Settlement, and was chairman of the board of control to look after the affairs of the settlement. Backhouse made several trips to England. On one occasion he had a long conference with William Gladstone and at another time he was honoured by being elected an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects.  Later life  Benjamin Backhouse died of heart failure at his residence, Ardath, Queen's Avenue, Rushcutters Bay, Sydney, on 29 July 1904. He was twice married, and left a widow and grown-up family, numbering 11. His sons were District Court Judge Alfred Paxton Backhouse, mining engineer Frank Backhouse, and Ernest, Clarence, Clive, Maurice, and Oscar Backhouse. In deference to his wishes, a private funeral was held.

Route description  SD 100 is expected to facilitate commercial and residential growth in the eastern section of the city of Sioux Falls. It will also serve as a second eastern bypass of the city, running roughly parallel to I-229 and about outside of it. As proposed, SD 100 will begin at the single-point urban interchange (SPUI) at exit 73 along I-29. It will run in a general northeasterly direction just outside of the southern extremities of Sioux Falls and enter the Sioux Falls city limits just west of its intersection with SD 115 (Minnesota Avenue). The route is to continue to the northeast past this intersection until it reaches what is now 69th Street; at that point, the route will curve to the east and follow that alignment. It will continue to follow 69th Street until east of an intersection with Sycamore Avenue, at which point it is to bend to the northeast. While heading northeast, the road will meet SD 11, and the two routes will together curve due north along Powder House Road. The road will meet 57th Street at a SPUI that is yet to be constructed and cross from Lincoln County into Minnehaha County. After intersecting 57th Street, SD 100 and SD 11 will continue north to an intersection with SD 42 (Arrowhead Parkway). At this intersection, SD 11 will leave SD 100 and turn east along SD 42. SD 100 is to continue north of this intersection along Powder House Road until just south of Madison Street, where it will curve slightly to the northeast. The highway will continue northeast until intersecting a proposed extension of Benson Road at another SPUI. Here, the road will curve northwest to intersect Rice Street, then back to the north before crossing the Big Sioux River and intersecting 60th Street North.

It was based on adding a pair of directory boards designed at Stanford to up to 16 SGI IRIS 4D Power Series machines and then cabling the systems in a mesh topology using a Stanford-modified version of the Torus Routing Chip. The boards designed at Stanford implemented a directory-based cache coherence protocol allowing Stanford DASH to support distributed shared memory for up to 64 processors. Stanford DASH was also notable for both supporting and helping to formalize weak memory consistency models, including release consistency. Because Stanford DASH was the first operational machine to include scalable cache coherence, it influenced subsequent computer science research as well as the commercially available SGI Origin 2000.

Structure The COX6A2 gene, located on the p arm of chromosome 16 in position 11.12, contains 3 exons and is 698 base pairs in length. The COX6A1 protein weighs 11 kDa and is composed of 97 amino acids.] The protein is a subunit of Complex IV, a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by nuclear genes. This nuclear gene encodes polypeptide 2 (heart/muscle isoform) of subunit VIa, and polypeptide 2 is present only in striated muscles. Polypeptide 1 (liver isoform) of subunit VIa is encoded by a different gene, COX6A1, and is found in all non-muscle tissues. These two polypeptides share 66% amino acid sequence identity. Function Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is a multi-subunit enzyme complex that couples the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and contributes to a proton electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane to drive ATP synthesis via protonmotive force.

Taxonomy Eionaletherium was discovered in the Late Miocene Urumaco Formation in the Falc√≥n State of Venezuela and described in 2015 as a species of mylodontid ground sloth. It is a member of the family Mylodontidae in a clade including Proeremotherium, Bolivartherium, and Glossotherium. The holotype specimen, IVIC-P-2870, housed at the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research, comprises the femurs, a tibia, fibula, some vertebrae, and fragments of the scapulae, ribs, and the ankle bone. The genus name Eionaletherium comes from the Greek words eion (shore), ale (wanderer), and therium (beast), in reference to the nearshore environment it probably inhabited. The species name tanycnemius comes from Greek tany (long) and cnemius (shin). Description Eionaletherium, based on a femur-to-body-size ratio, is estimated to have been , smaller than contemporary ground sloths. The tibia of Eionaletherium is unusually long for ground sloths, being 87% the size of the length of the femur versus the 45% to 73% in other mylodonts. The contemporary marine sloth Thalassocnus also developed this as an aquatic adaptation, so Eionaletherium may have been partially aquatic. However, the bones are not particularly dense (pachyosteosclerosis) to negate buoyancy, and the femoral head is missing indicating it could not create powerful strokes necessary for swimming. Paleoecology The Urumaco sequence contains 3 formations‚ÄìSocorro, Urumaco, and Codore formations‚Äìwhich date to the Middle Miocene to Early Pliocene, the Urumaco Formation from the Chasicoan to the Huayquerian according to the SALMA classification system. This area is representative of a nearshore coastal environment with river deltas emptying into it. Other ground sloths discovered here are Urumaquia, Urumacotherium, Mirandabradys socorrensis, M. zabasi, M. urumaquensis, B. coderensis, B. urumaquensis, and P. confusum. A wide array of fish‚Äìincluding sharks and rays‚Äìcrocodiles, turtle, and small mammals have also been found in the Urumaco Formation.

He is the CEO of Saber Partners, LLC, a public advisory firm that he co-founded in 2000. Prior to Saber, he worked for various Wall Street firms including Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, Prudential Securities and Bear Stearns & Co., as a managing director, principal. Fichera is the creator of share-adjusted broker-remarketed equity securities, also known as SABRES, as an alternative to auction rate securities. He is also considered an expert at auction rate securities, serving as an expert advisor for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Fichera was also one of California Governor Gray Davis' advisors, assisting with the California electricity crisis that took place in 2000 and 2001. Early life and education Fichera was born in Rochester, New York in 1954, his father a bookkeeper and his mother a hairdresser. His grandfather was a barber who emigrated from Sicily in 1910. Fichera grew up in Rochester and as a teenager was outspoken about racial desegregation of Rochester schools in the 1960s, becoming a student representative on the Board of Education for Rochester New York. Fichera earned a full tuition scholarship to Princeton University, where he graduated with an A.B. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1976 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"Politics, Personality and Budgeting in the States: The Case of New Jersey.\\" Upon graduation, Fichera worked as a political appointee for the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the administration of Jimmy Carter. He left HUD three years later to attend the Yale School of Management, obtaining an M.B.A. from the school in 1982. Career Fichera began his financial career with Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, then known as Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. It was during his time with Smith Barney that he gained experience in the auction-rate market and challenges to it, landing ExxonMobil as a client in 1987. He advised Exxon on how to reduce interest costs by adjusting rates and repricing periods on its tax-exempt debt and selling them when conditions were more favorable. Fichera also advised them not to sell auction rate securities, instead leading them to share-adjusted broker-remarketed equity securities (known as SABRES), an alternative to auction rate securities created by Fichera in 1988. Exxon made a $750 million deal with Smith Barney, the largest single program of variable preferred stock up until that time. He held the position of Vice President of Corporate Finance before moving on to Bear Stearns & Co in 1989 as one of that company's directors of corporate finance and also spent time with Prudential Securities. Fichera left Prudential in 2000 to form Saber Partners, a public advisory firm based in New York. He founded the firm along with William B. Moore, the CEO of Westar Energy from 2007 to 2011. Some of the firm's first clients included Exxon Corporation and the Governor of the State of California. The firm became notable for its work in the $40 billion securitization bond market for ratepayer bonds that are used to fund power utilities. Fichera pushed for the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority to recognize ratepayer bonds as a form of government guaranteed debt, allowing the bonds to be sold to investors in the United Kingdom and other European countries at a lower rate than investors in the United States. The new marketplace reduced the interest cost that utilities paid on interest for the bonds. Fichera worked with government regulators in Wisconsin, Texas, Vermont, New Jersey, Florida and West Virginia with ratepayer bonds. Fichera's Saber Partners partnered with The Blackstone Group to advise then Governor Gray Davis during the California electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001, on the state's potential acquisition of the investor-owned utilities electric transmission lines. The results included potentially selling of up to $33 billion of bonds to save utility companies from going bankrupt and stabilize the electricity market. Fichera has been a consistent critic of auction rate securities. In 2006, he was hired by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an expert advisor into its probe of security bidding practices. Its investigation led to a cease and desist order being issued to 15 banks, all of whom settled with the SEC for $13 million without having to admit any violations. He has advocated greater transparency in securities markets, especially for corporate securitized and asset-backed debt. In November 2014, in a New York Times op-ed, Fichera also proposed that the S.E.C. adopt a points system in addition to fines similar to a D.M.V. in order to change the behavior of repeat offenders through a more effective deterrent. As an expert on auction rate securities, Fichera is often quoted on the subject by major news publications including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg Businessweek. He also has served as an adjunct visiting lecturer in public and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.

Simpson was the first stage manager for NBC Television. He was also known for having directing credits on The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre, Four Star Revue, Armstrong Circle Theatre, and Mary Kay and Johnny, the first sitcom to be broadcast on network television. Early life and education Simpson was born Garry Chalmers Simpson on February 16, 1914 in Jackson, Mississippi. He was born to parents Robert Edwin and Edna Simpson (n√©e Hall). His father was an optometrist and his mother was an editor for the local newspaper. Simpson had three brothers; Vernon, Sidney, and Edwin. His family moved from Jackson to Denver, Colorado when he was five years old. From there, his family moved to San Jose, California. He graduated from San Jose High School in 1932. After graduating high school, he served in the National Guard as a corporal for three years. He concluded his studies at Stanford University in 1938 with a Bachelor of Arts in English and drama. Career Simpson first started out in show business as a performer. Initially headed to West Point Academy, Simpson wanted to pursue his passion of acting and writing. A screen test with Warner Bros. and radio work in San Francisco, led him to performing in summer stock with Olivia de Havilland in 1938. He was offered a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City, which he accepted - to the embarrassment of his family, refusing his appointment at West Point. It is reported that Havilland gave him $500 the night he left. In 1939, Simpson was hired as an actor and director's assistant for the Globe Shakespearean Company at the New York World's Fair. After the fair closed, Simpson was hired by NBC as an announcer and model for closed-circuit experimental TV programs. He learned that RCA (who owned NBC) was hiring a promotional unit to demonstrate home TV receivers, a new phenomenon, in department stores across the country. Fascinated with this new technology, his job was to educate the public by creating and directing short entertainment presentations, staged and filmed on location. While auditioning local talent for demonstrations at the toy department of Marshall Fields in Chicago, he discovered puppeteer Burr Tillstrom, later leading to the TV show Kukla, Fran and Ollie. When the Federal Communications Commission finally granted permission for TV stations to broadcast, NBC promoted Simpson to the position of studio stage manager and director of mobile-unit special events. He worked every show that was produced in the studio. He also directed sporting events and was assigned to supervise the film operations. Films comprised one-third of broadcast time and he was to select all feature films shown and edit them to fit the schedule. His career as a director took off. Simpson went on to direct hundreds of television programs, sporting events and broadcasts, most notably, Wide Wide World, Armstrong Circle Theatre, Campbell's Soundstage, Ford Festival, The Danny Thomas Show, The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre, and Mary Kay and Johnny, the first sitcom broadcast on network television in the U.S. It was also the first time a couple was shown sharing a bed and a pregnancy on TV. He directed the first- ever broadcast of heavyweight boxing, baseball and horse racing. Other credits include such televised spectaculars from the Ringling Brothers Circus at Madison Square Garden, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Heisman Trophy Awards, President Truman delivering his NAACP speech at the Lincoln Memorial, and the infamous day at the United Nations when Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev banged his shoe on his desk to make a point. In addition he wrote and produced many commercials for ad agencies; Lucky Strike, Bell Telephone, Aqua Velva, and Jell-O. In addition to his positions for NBC, he was a producer of programs for Scophony television, television director for RCA, stage manager for many Off-Broadway productions and the Globe Theatre. He was director of films for the U.S. Signal Corps and the Energy Commission, director of industrial shows for Depicto Films, General Motors, and Armstrong Cork. He also served as director of the Saratoga Summer Theatre, was a guest instructor at the American Theatre Wing, and produced Educational television programs on the Regents TV Project for the state of New York. Personal life Simpson wed his wife Kathleen McLean on November 23, 1940. They met at the World's Fair a year earlier. They had four children together; Carolyn, Brian, John and Robin. In 1979, Simpson retired from ETV and teaching at the University of Vermont, but he never rested. A new home was built in Ferrisburgh, Vermont near Lake Champlain. For the next 22 years he was active in the Charlotte, Vermont and Ferrisburgh Grange, Vergennes Rotary, gardening, and grand- children. In 1997, the Vergennes American Legion Post 14 honored him for his instrumental community service to the Bixby Library. Due to his wife's health complications, a move was made to the lodge at Shelburne Bay in Shelburne, Vermont and then the lodge at Otter Creek in Middlebury, Vermont where for over a decade he cared for her. Death Simpson died on November 19, 2011 at his home in Middlebury, Vermont at the age of 97. He was survived by his wife of 71 years, Kathleen and two sons and two daughters.

It is known from a single articulated and mostly complete specimen from Prince Edward Island in Canada. Phylogenetics has predicted that parareptiles first evolved in the Carboniferous, parallel to eureptiles (\\"true reptiles\\"). However, Hylonomus, the oldest eureptile known from fossil evidence, lived millions of years before parareptiles appeared in the fossil record. The discovery of Erpetonyx helped to shorten this gap between parareptile and eureptile fossils, as Erpetonyx lived in the Late Carboniferous as one the oldest known parareptiles (though Carbonodraco is now known to be older). However, it was not closely related to ancestral parareptiles, so its discovery also indicated that the initial diversification of parareptiles occurred earlier in the Carboniferous. Erpetonyx was a small reptile, with the entire skeleton about 20 to 25 centimeters (7.9 to 9.8 inches) in length. It was likely carnivorous, and could be characterized by a variety of skeletal features, including a relatively elongated body and large claws with powerful tendon attachment points.  Discovery  Erpetonyx is known from a single specimen, a remarkably well-preserved skeleton, designated ROM 55402. This specimen hailed from Cape Egmont, in southwestern Prince Edward Island, Canada, in rock layers of the Edgmont Bay Formation that preserves fossils that date back to Gzhelian stage of the Carboniferous period. The specimen was discovered by nine-year-old Michael Arsenault in 2003 who was on vacation with his family at the time. It was acquired by the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in 2004, and later rep. Cape Breton University's Sean Modesto, a paleontologist and expert in ancient reptiles, was the lead author of a 2015 article published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, The team, which included researchers from the ROM, University of Toronto and the Smithsonian Institution, described and named the new genus and species, the first parareptile known from Carboniferous period fossils. The name Parareptilia was identified by the American zoologist, Olson (1910-1993), in 1947 and Bolosauria was identified by Oskar Kuhn in 1959. Erpetonyx arsenaultorum was described and named by Modesto et al. in 2015. It is the closest relative of bolosaurids.  Description  The skull was crushed and partially eroded, but some features (like the tooth row) were preserved well enough to be informative. The teeth were sharp, conical, and slightly curved. They gradually decreased in size towards the rear of the skull. Some broken teeth reveal that they had an internal structure of folded dentine, formally known as plicidentine. Plicidentine was once considered to characterize \\"labyrinthodont\\" amphibians such as temnospondyls, but it is now known to occur in some extinct amniotes as well. The supratemporal bones at the rear of the skull roof formed small horns, and the palate (roof of the mouth) was covered in small cones known as denticles. Denticles reached almost as far back in the mouth as the large, robust quadrate bones which formed the upper part of the jaw joint. Preserved portions of the braincase were generally similar to those of other reptiles, with the exception of a large opening (likely for the hyomandibular branch of the facial nerve) at the front edge of the base of the braincase. The body was relatively elongated compared to other parareptiles. There were 5 cervical (neck) vertebrae and 24 dorsal (torso) vertebrae. This leads to a total of 29 presacral (pre-hip) vertebrae, while other parareptiles typically had 26 or fewer. The presacrals were hourglass- shaped when seen from above and tightly connected to each other by means of large, rounded zygapophyses (joint plates). They gradually increased in length and width towards the hip. There were three sacral (hip) vertebrae, although only the first two had large, flared ribs which connected to the ilia (upper hip plates). 20 caudal (tail) vertebrae were also attached to the skeleton, along with a disconnected string of 13 from the tip of the tail and 10 isolated caudals. Estimating from the length of missing portions of the tail, there may have been 58 caudal vertebrae in total. The forelimbs were generally similar to those of other early reptiles. The humerus (upper arm bone) was slightly longer than the ulna and radius (lower arm bones). The knobs and joints forming the elbow were poorly developed, meaning that Erpetonyx may have had more flexible forelimbs than its contemporaries. The hand was incomplete, and some the carpals (wrist bones) were large while others were unusually small. On the other hand, the unguals (claws) were long and sharply pointed, with robust flexor tubercules (tendon attachment bumps). Some of the hip bones were obscured by the rest of the skeleton, but the ischium (front lower plate) was longer than the pubis (rear lower plate). The femur (thigh bone) was twisted, with the knee joints offset at 45 degrees from the rest of the shaft. In other early reptiles, this angle of torsion was smaller, usually 10 to 30 degrees. The slender tibia and fibula (lower leg bones) were shorter than the femur. The tarsals (ankle bones) were much more robust than the carpals, but also more disarticulated. The fourth metatarsal was the longest bone of the foot, and it was unusually expanded near the toe. The ungual of the fourth toe was tall, curved, and sharply pointed. Other toe claws were longer and lower. Nevertheless, all of the toe claws were longer than the other phalanges (toe bones).

Much of the band's resemblance came from Jefferson Airplane, the group that successfully integrated jazz fusion into their compositions. Upon the album's release, it was largely unnoticed, but still became the band's only work to chart in the Billboard 200. Their most acclaimed track is the opening cover version of \\"Motherless Child\\". Background Sweetwater was composed of eight individuals of different ethnicities, all of which had common beginnings on the coffeehouse circuit in Los Angeles. With psychedelic music at the height of its popularity in 1968, Reprise Records decided to sign the band to their label to capitalize on it. The band was not just limited to the psychedelic scene though, as Sweetwater immersed itself in multiple musical genres ranging from folk rock, latin rock, and classical music. Reprise knowingly produced for the band, despite the fact their sound was not marketable to the general public. Recording commenced at the Sound Factory in Hollywood, California with producer Dave Hassinger, notable for producing other musical groups like The Electric Prunes. The tracks included original material along with covers of traditional pieces. The band was highly versatile as it possessed musicians who played a wide variety of exotic instruments including congas, percussion, and bongos. The congas, in particular, were peculiar to the group at the time as other bands, most notably Santana, had not yet come to prominence with their incorporation of the instrument in rock music. Another interesting aspect regarding recordings, was the total lack of electric guitar, an instrument Sweetwater disregarded the use of, even in live performances. Arrangements of the instrumentals were conducted by Alex del Zoppo and Frank Herrera, and, in all aspects, the two utililized the capabilities of their bandmates as they were involved in the process of each track. For that reason, there was complexity in all aspects of their compositions, from the hallucinogenic tunes such as \\"My Crystal Spider\\", and more traditional arrangements like their rendition of the Negro spiritual, \\"Motherless Child\\". Nansi Nevins was the lead vocalist on all tracks; however, Sweetwater is the only album that the singer was involved in throughout the whole process. This was a consequense of an automobile accident in which Nevins suffered severe injuries to her brain and vocal cords. Sweetwater was released in 1968 with the catalog number RS #6313, just getting into the national charts at number 200 where it would stay for two weeks. With the album, two singles, \\"Motherless Child b/w \\"Why Oh Why and \\"My Crystal Spider\\" b/w \\"What's Wrong\\" preceded it, both of which failed to chart. Still, \\"Motherless Child\\" became popular in Los Angeles when it was constantly played on FM radio. The band's take on the traditional blues song became a favorite associated with group. The cover features the group in their usual live attire, and their primary instruments in hand. Despite the limited success of their debut effort, Sweetwater, in 1969, would partake in the proceedings at the Woodstock Festival, and became remembered as the first band to perform.

Felines have been reported by news outlets to outnumber humans by ratios between 6:1 and 10:1, but as elderly inhabitants of the island have died, the ratio has greatly increased to almost 36:1. Felines were introduced to combat rodents on fishing boats, but remained on the island and reproduced in large numbers. The island is roughly long. It was formerly part of Nagahama in Kita District, but , is part of ≈åzu. The population decreased since Sardine Fisheries depleted and jobs moved to cities; causing human residence on the island to drop.  Population  In 1945, the island was a fishing village with a population of approximately 900. In 2013, the island was estimated to be home to 50 residents. In 2018, Ehime Shimbun reported that the population had decreased to 13 with an average age of \\"over 75\\". In 2019, Asahi Shimbun Globe reported that only 6 residents remained on the island. The island attracts tourists who visit the cats and give them food. The feline population of the island has been reported as between 120 and 130 between 2015 and 2018. In February 2018, it was reported by Ehime Shimbun that all cats on the island would be spayed or neutered in order to lower the feline population as a response to the declining human population. By October, 210 cats had been spayed and neutered, with another estimated 10 cats uncaptured that had been hidden by a resident who opposed the program.

Architect Anghel PƒÉunescu thus replaced the proposed dome with a semi-cylindrical vault intended to express the same \\"seduction of the curved space\\".[PƒÉuleanu, Doina. Constan≈£a. Aventura unui proiect european. Constan≈£a: Editura Ex Ponto, 2003.] In the interwar period, there had been two main synagogues in Constan»õa: there was also a Sephardic Temple, built between 1905 and 1908 in a Catalan Gothic architectural style, The sephardic synagogue was heavily damaged during the Second World War when it was used as an ammunition warehouse, later further damaged by an earthquake, and was demolished in 1989 under the rule of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. Condition As the Jewish population in Constan»õa declined, the synagogue fell into disuse. Photographs show the synagogue was still in use - and in good repair - as recently as 1996, but once abandoned, the building had been \\"ransacked of anything not nailed down\\". The structure of the building is still standing, but is in an advanced state of degradation and is in danger of collapsing. Only three of the four walls are intact, and the roof has partially collapsed. A tree grows in the middle of the sanctuary and most of the stained glass windows have been smashed. Journalists Florin Anghel and Cristian Andrei Leonte blamed local officials and popular opinion for allowing the building to \\"crumble to the point of collapse\\", noting that synagogues in other cities were \\"splendidly renovated and converted into cultural centres or exhibition halls.\\" Aurel Vainer, president of the Federation of the Jewish Communities in Romania, blamed lack of interest for the deterioration of the synagogue. In November 2014, a team of architects from Bucharest were hired to inspect the building, assess the necessary repairs and estimate costs. Architecture The synagogue has three levels. The exterior doors and windows display a Moorish influence. Inside, the worship area is divided into three naves with traditional Jewish decorations.CIMEC - Sinagoga Mare din Constan»õa See also * History of the Jews in Romania * List of synagogues in Romania References External links * Sinagoga Mare din Constan»õa pe situl Biserici.org Category:Synagogues in Romania Category:Buildings and structures in Constan»õa Category:Synagogues completed in 1911 Category:1911 establishments in Romania Category:Gothic Revival synagogues Category:Former synagogues ","title":"Great Synagogue (Constan»õa)"},{"id":"45570141","text":"2 Corinthians 11 is the eleventh chapter of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible.

Designed by Jeremiah O'Rourke of Newark, the building was named to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the new world. The cornerstone was laid by Newark Bishop Winand Wigger on April 9, 1893, and construction was completed in December 1894. Columbus Hall stands on one of the most commanding spots in the city, directly opposite St. John's Church (also designed by O‚ÄôRourke) at White and Ridge Streets. It most notably housed the parish school, St. John's School, an institution that had been established 32 years earlier in 1862 . Architectural features Built in a generally neo-Renaissance style, the building measures 150 feet (46 m) wide and 76 feet (23 m) deep and is constructed of buff-colored brick with stone belt courses and ornamental terra cotta trimmings. The main entrance of the building is reached by matching stone staircases, one on each side. Along the front of the first story of the main building, over the windows and doors, is a row of massive arches of cut stone: the central arch, over the entrance, bears the inscription, \\"Columbus Hall.\\" The building features a dome which was originally surmounted by a large gilded statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, approximately 25 feet (7.6 m) tall and with its arms extended. For many decades the statue was floodlit at night, making it visible for miles around. The statue was knocked over by a windstorm in September 2012, and subsequently removed. A large bronze statue of Christopher Columbus stood at the main entrance of the building until about 1970, when it was vandalized and replaced by a smaller marble statue. Theatre The third and fourth floors feature a theatre, 70 feet (21 m) wide and 48 feet (15 m) high (from the proscenium arch). The stage is 70 feet (21 m) wide by 25 feet (7.6 m) deep. The theatre includes balcony seating, acclaimed at the time because the balconies were hung from the roof trusses by heavy iron rods encased in brass, avoiding the need for support columns that would obscure the view for those in the main theatre.[3] The theatre ceiling was once adorned by a large crystal chandelier and topped by a dome 28 feet (8.5 m) in diameter. With a seating capacity of 1,150, the theatre was completely equipped with dressing rooms, stage settings, scenery, and gas-lit foot lamps, and featured an iron \\"fire-proof\\" curtain and a proscenium arch composed of brick. At the request of the local fire department, the theatre was closed in about 1958. Postcard showing Columbus Hall (St. John's School) and the parish church. ca 1935. St. John's School Columbus Hall was built to house St. John's Parish School, an institution that was founded in 1862 to serve children from kindergarten through 8th grade. It also housed a 9th grade \\"commercial class\\" for several decades. With 19 classrooms and class sizes occasionally as large as 65, it is likely that more than 60,000 students attended classes in Columbus Hall between its dedication in 1894 and the closing of the institution on its 150th anniversary in 2012.

The work was commissioned by David Zinman and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, completed August 26, 1986, and premiered in Baltimore, January 21, 1988. The piece is dedicated to Rouse's friend and fellow composer John Harbison.Rouse, Christopher. Symphony No. 1: Program Note by the Composer. 1986. Retrieved March 3, 2015. Composition The symphony is composed in a single adagio movement and has a duration of approximately 27 minutes. The work was conceived, in part, as a companion to Rouse's 1984 orchestral piece Gorgon. =Style and influences= The music quotes Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7. In the program notes to the score, Rouse commented on his inspirations and the use of Bruckner, saying, \\"In my Symphony No. 1 I have attempted to pay conscious homage to many of those I especially admire as composers of adagios -- Shostakovich, Sibelius, Hartmann, Pettersson, and Schuman, for example -- but only one is recognizably quoted (the famous opening theme from the second movement of Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, played both in the original and here by a quartet of Wagner Tubas).\\" =Instrumentation= The piece is scored for two flutes (2nd doubling on piccolo), two oboes (2nd doubling on oboe d'amore and English horn), two clarinets (2nd doubling on bass clarinet), two bassoons (2nd doubling on contrabassoon), four French horns (all doubling Wagner Tubas), three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (three players), and strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses). Reception Music critic David Hurwitz described the work as \\"wholly gripping and vividly contrasted despite the slow pacing and prevailing gloomy atmosphere.\\" Reviewing the 1992 Los Angeles premiere of the symphony, Daniel Cariaga of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"In the 27 intense minutes of this L.A. premiere performance, the Symphony sometimes loudly achieved a finally quiet victory over pessimism, all the while engaging the observer in its progress to that not-predictable end.

The medal, never awarded singly, was awarded to all those South Africans who were awarded the or the British War Medal.South African Medal Website - Union Defence Forces (1913-1939) (Accessed 9 May 2015) Institution The Victory Medal, also known as the Inter-Allied Victory Medal, was instituted to celebrate the Allied victory in the Great War, in accordance with a recommendation of an inter-allied committee in March 1919.The Type I Victory Medal 1914-19. Richard Flory. Orders & Medals Research Society Journal, September 2009, pages 144-152. The award of a similar medal to their own veterans by each allied country was intended to prevent a mass exchange of campaign medals. The same ribbon and variations of the basic medal design and wording on the reverse were adopted by Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Siam, South Africa, the United Kingdom and her colonies and dominions and the United States of America. Most of the medals depict the Winged Victory, a female winged figure representing Nike, the mythological Greek goddess of victory. A particular form of Nike or her Roman equivalent Victoria was chosen by each nation for its version of the medal, except by Japan and Siam, where the concept of a winged victory was not culturally relevant. The years of the war were shown as 1914 to 1918 in every case, except on the two medal versions of the British Empire, which show the years 1914 to 1919.The interallied victory medals of World War I by Alexander J. Laslo, Dorado Publishing, Albuquerque. 1986 Edition. The British version of the Victory Medal was awarded to British combatants as well as to those from the dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Empire of India and to colonial forces. The Union of South Africa awarded its own version of the Victory Medal, identical to the British version on the obverse, but with the inscription on the reverse in English and Dutch, the two official languages of South Africa at the time. In precedence, the two versions rank on par. Award criteria Recipients had to have entered a theatre of the war between 5 August 1914, the day following the British declaration of war against the German Empire, and the armistice of 11 November 1918, both dates inclusive. The medal was never awarded singly, but to all those who were awarded either the 1914 Star or the 1914‚Äì15 Star, or to all of those who were awarded the British War Medal. The Union Defence Forces served in German South West Africa in 1914 and 1915, while the volunteer South African Overseas Expeditionary Force served in Egypt in 1916, France and Belgium from 1916 to 1918, German East Africa from 1916 to 1918 and Palestine in 1917 and 1918. South African Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve contingents served with the Royal Navy in the Aegean and other theatres of war. Description The medal is a bronze disk, in diameter, with a clear lacquer coating giving a bright finish. It has the following design: ;Obverse The obverse shows the winged, full-length and full-front figure of Victoria, the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Nike, with her left arm extended and holding a palm branch in her right hand. ;Reverse The reverse is inscribed \\"THE GREAT WAR FOR CIVILISATION\\" in three lines above and \\"DE GROTE OORLOG VOOR DE BESCHAVING\\" in three lines below, with the English and Dutch inscriptions separated by \\"‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\\" and with the years \\"1914-1919\\" at the bottom, all completely surrounded by a laurel wreath. ;Naming Each medal was named in impressed capitals. ;Ribbon The ribbon is wide and of watered silk, with a double rainbow design, violet at the edges and progressing through the spectrum to red in the centre. It attaches to the medal through a ring suspender. ;Clasps No clasps were issued. ;Mentioned in Despatches Recipients who were mentioned in despatches between 4 August 1914 and 10 August 1920 wore an oak leaf cluster emblem on the medal ribbon, with a smaller version on the ribbon bar when medals were not worn. Nicknames The three World War I medals, either one of the 1914 Star or 1914‚Äì15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal, were collectively irreverently referred to as Pip, Squeak and Wilfred, after three comic strip characters, a dog, a penguin and a rabbit, which were popular in the immediate post-war era. Pip represented either of the two Stars, Squeak represented the British War Medal and Wilfred represented the Victory Medal.The Great War 1914‚Äì1918 ‚Äì A Guide to British Campaign Medals of WW1 Similarly, when only the British War Medal and Victory Medal were awarded, they were referred to as Mutt and Jeff, after contemporary newspaper comic strip characters.

Valve discontinued the Steam Link in November 2018, in favor of supporting its software-based Steam Link application for mobile devices and smart televisions, as well as providing Steam Link as a software package for the Raspberry Pi microcomputer.  Functionality  Steam Link, whether in hardware or software form, supports the streaming of content from a personal computer running Steam to the video device (a connected television or monitor for the hardware unit, the mobile device's screen for the software version). In this setup, the device acting as the Steam Link (the hardware unit or the mobile device in software form) enables a game controller connected to it to be used to control the game over the connection to the home computer. Prior to March 2019, both the personal computer and the Steam Link hardware device or mobile device using Steam Link software had to be on the same internal network. With an update in March 2019, Valve introduced the Steam Link Anywhere update that allows one to stream across the internet, though the performance of the streaming will be strongly affected by the bandwidth and latency between the personal computer and device with Steam Link.  Hardware  Steam Link is a stand-alone hardware device to enable streaming of Steam content from a personal computer or a Steam Machine wirelessly to a television set, including integration of Steam Controller gamepad.

The house was built in 1814 by Reverend Jonathan Fisher, the first settled minister of Blue Hill, and is now a museum dedicated to his legacy. Fisher (1768-1847) kept a journal of his life in rural Maine, and published other works, including Scriptural Animals, a work illustrated with woodcuts he created. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 (as Jonathan Fisher Memorial); it is open seasonally between July and October. Description and history Jonathan Fisher was born in New Braintree, Massachusetts, and educated at Harvard College, before moving to Blue Hill in 1796 to take up a new ministry. At that time he began construction of a small two-room house, which he reported moving into in 1797, still unfinished. In 1814 he built the current house, to which the older house was joined as an ell. The older house was demolished in 1896 by Fisher's grandchildren, who replaced it with a two-story addition. After the property was taken over by Jonathan Fisher Memorial, Inc. in the 1950s, a second addition was added to accommodate office and exhibition space. The property's outbuildings all decayed and were demolished over time; the last to go was the 1790s barn, which was taken down in the 1990s. The Fisher House is set on the southeast side of Mines Road (Maine State Route 176), facing northwest on a largely level lot. The main house is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, large central chimney, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. The main facade is three bays wide, which are evenly spaced but set off to the left. A plain entablature encircles the house below the roof, and the main entry, located in the lower left bay, is sheltered by an enclosed hip-roofed vestibule. The interior follows a central-chimney plan, with two rooms on the first floor and two on the second, set on either side of the chimney. The building has retained interior finishes, as well as Fisher family possessions.

Copanlisib has been shown to have an effect against survival and spread of cancerous B-cells. Efficacy resulting in the approval of copanlisib was based on the subgroup of 104 patients with follicular lymphoma from a Phase 2 clinical trial. Of these, 59 percent had a complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors that lasted about 12 months. To assess the safety of the drug, data from 168 adults with follicular lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies treated with copanlisib were evaluated. Copanlisib is administered as intravenous infusion on a weekly but intermittent schedule (three weeks on and one week off). Copanlisib is currently approved only in the United States. Adverse effects Data for safety and efficacy of copanlisib are described in the consumer-targeted FDA Drug Trial Snapshot. Copanlisib can cause serious side effects including infections, hyperglycemia, hypertension, pneumonitis, neutropenia and skin rashes. The most common side effects of copanlisib are hyperglycemia, diarrhea, decreased general strength and energy, hypertension, leukopenia, neutropenia, nausea, lower respiratory tract infections and thrombocytopenia. Copanlisib can cause harm to unborn babies. Patients with reproductive potential are thus advised to use effective contraception. Lactating patients are advised to not breastfeed. Mechanism of action Copanlisib is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with inhibitory activity predominantly against PI3K-Œ± and PI3K-Œ¥ isoforms expressed in malignant B-cells. It has been shown to induce tumor cell death by apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of primary malignant B cell lines. Regulatory history =Follicular lymphoma= For follicular lymphoma, the FDA awarded copanlisib orphan drug status in February 2015 and fast track designation in February 2016. The NDA for follicular lymphoma was granted priority review in May 2017. In September 2017, it received accelerated approval (FDA regulation 21 CFR Part 314 subpart H) for the treatment of adult patients experiencing relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Further clinical trials are to be performed as a post-marketing requirement to verify the clinical benefit. =Other= Copanlisib was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of splenic, nodal and extranodal subtypes of marginal zone lymphoma. Clinical trials Phase II clinical trials are in progress for treatment of endometrial cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Copanlisib in combination with R-CHOP or R-B (rituximab and bendamustine) is in a phase III trial for relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Two separate phase III trials are investigating the use of copanlisib in combination with rituximab for indolent NHL and the other using copanlisib alone in cases of rituximab-refractory indolent NHL. In a preclinical study, copanlisib was effective in inhibiting HER2+ breast cancer cells with acquired resistance to the HER2-inhibitors trastuzumab and/or lapatinib. This effect was increased when copanlisib was administered along with the aforementioned HER2-inhibitors. Consequently, treatments of copanlisib with trastuzumab are being clinically trialled in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

It was originally built for Wang Boqun, former Minister of Communications, including transportation, post, bank, and education, for the Kuomintang. The large 40-room mansion was built from 1932‚Äì1934 in the Victorian Gothic style. The house is currently used as a community children's center for art, music, and dance classes.http://hua.umf.maine.edu/China/p_Shanghai_Bund_history/0269827wChildrenPalace_Shanghai.html  History  The house was built by Wang Boqun for his new bride, Bao Zhining, to celebrate their marriage on June 18, 1931. He was the 46-year-old Kuomintang Minister of Transportation, the President of Great China University, and held the position of Guizhou representative to the Nationalist Parliament.http://www.idealshanghai.com/venues/2368/ Zhining was a 22-year-old honors graduate with a degree in social sciences from Great China University. They decided to build their new home in Shanghai so Boqun could continue to work full-time as President at the much-expanded Great China University after his retirement from his cabinet post in Nanjing. In early 1932, construction on the house began on no. 31, Lane 1136, Yuyuan Road, in the French quarters of Shanghai. The house was designed by a Shanghai architect, Lui Yingshi. The main building consisted of three floors, for a total of 21,500 square feet. From 1941‚Äì44, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the house was used by the head of Japan's puppet government, Wang Jingwei. After the war, it became a Kuomintang prison and was used as an execution ground for Communist revolutionaries. In 1947, Bao Zhining, widowed in 1944, returned to Shanghai and rented the house to the British Embassy for use as its Shanghai Consulate General and British Information offices. From 1949‚Äì1960, the house was used for government offices, after which it was turned into the Children's Palace.  Exterior  The 5,000 square-meter (53,820-square-foot) garden was once filled with streams, bridges and pavilions. A 120-year-old southern magnolia tree still stands on the lawn. The large stone at the entrance to the garden was brought via train from Guizhou province so Wang Boqun could have a piece of home in Shanghai.

It is an erect shrub to about usually found in mallee woodland. Description Melaleuca acuminata is an erect, rather open shrub with papery or fibrous bark and many ascending branches. The leaves are in alternating pairs on either side of the stem (decussate), narrow elliptic in shape, long, wide with a short petiole.M. acuminata foliage, flowers and fruit.M. acuminata barkM. acuminata cultivated specimen The flowers are cream or white, sometimes tinged with pink and are in cluster of three to six, the clusters occurring along the stem over a considerable length. The stamens are grouped into five clusters or \\"claws\\" and there are 9 to 17 stamens per claw. Flowering occurs in spring and is followed by fruit which are smooth, woody capsules, diameter borne singly or in small clusters. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca acuminata was first described in 1858 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae from a specimen found \\"in the stony hills of Mount Barker Creek by L. Fischer\\". The specific epithet (acuminata) is from the Latin acumen, meaning \\"sharp point\\" referring to the leaf tips. =Subspecies= There are two subspecies varying in their leaf sizes and distributions: Melaleuca acuminata F.Muell. subsp. acuminata occurs in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and the south‚Äìwest of New South Wales. Melaleuca acuminata subsp. websteri (S.Moore) Barlow ex. Craven is restricted to Western Australia. It has narrower leaves and the flowers have a shorter hypanthium. The subspecies name (websteri) honours Leonard Clarke Webster, an Australian botanical collector and later a doctor. Distribution and habitat Mallee honeymyrtle occurs in Western Australia in the Carnarvon, Coolgardie, Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions; in South Australia it is found in the far south-east corner of the state; in western Victoria, in the Murray Mallee, Lowan Mallee, Wimmera, Goldfields and Greater Grampians biozones, and in New South Wales it is rare and found only in the Balranald district. It grows in mallee communities on sandhills in New South Wales or elsewhere, in sandy or clayey soils in swampy depressions or rises, often in saline conditions. Conservation status This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This melaleuca is adaptable and easy to grow and when well supplied with water grows more vigorously than usually seen in the wild.

The band's primary member, Andrew Butler, described the song and its video as an examination of his \\"relationship to taboo words and the use of 'cunt' amongst NYC's gay community to relay flattery, empowerment and strength\\".  Work  = New Museum Triennial and Performa 15 Biennial = In early 2015, Huxtable was selected to present work in the 2015 New Museum Triennial Surround Audience, curated by Lauren Cornell and artist Ryan Trecartin. Huxtable included two text-based works and two self-portraits, each an inkjet print from the series Universal Crop Tops For All The Self-Canonized Saints of Becoming. These works, along with a sculpture by fellow Triennial artist Frank Benson that depicted a life-sized Huxtable rendered in iridescent colors, were prominent works in the show. Vogue Writer Mark Guiducci dubbed Huxtable the \\"Star of the New Museum Triennial\\". Huxtable has since disowned the sculpture, saying that it is \\"a literal embodiment of exploitation\\" that she has \\"come to hate.\\" Huxtable premiered on season two of Ovation TV's web-based talk show, Touching the Art, hosted by fellow 2015 Triennial artist Casey Jane Ellison. Artist K8 Hardy and New Museum curator Shelley Fox Aarons were also guests in the same episode. Later that year, Huxtable was selected to showcase a new performance piece in the Performa 15 Biennial. The hour-long performance titled, There Are Certain Facts That Cannot Be Disputed, was presented at the Museum of Modern Art. It included poetry, audio and voice over, video elements, and live-music with fellow collaborators and explored the complicated relationship between the ephemeral nature of digital information and the drive for historical documentation on the internet. As described by the festival's organizers, Huxtable's performance considered \\"cyberspace as a twilight zone of precariousness and preservation, traversing closed servers, bounced URLs, and Google cache as human and digital characters\\". = Shock Value, House of Ladosha, and other projects = Huxtable is a founder and DJ for Shock Value, a weekly New York City-based nightlife collective run by women artists, DJs, writers, and fashion icons. Huxtable is a member of the New York City-based collective House of Ladosha. Members include Cunty Crawford Ladosha (Adam Radakovich), Neon Christina Ladosha (Christopher Udemezue), Paws Off Ladosha (Riley Hooker), Magatha Ladosha (Michael Magnan), La Fem Ladosha (Antonio Blair), and YSL Ladosha (Yan Sze Li). In January 2016, House of Ladosha showcased various art projects in This Is Your Brain. In 2017, the collective was selected to participate in the group exhibition Trigger: Gender as a Weapon and a Tool at the New Museum. They were also featured in Issue 7 of the magazine Gayletter. Huxtable currently sits on the editorial board for Topical Cream, a New York- based platform that supports a community of artists, writers, designers, and technologists through digital publishing and public programming initiatives. Topical Cream was founded in 2013 and its board members include Lyndsy Welgos, Ara Anjargolian, Whitney Mallett, Juliana Huxtable, and Aria Dean. In 2016, Huxtable was a Visiting Artists Program lecturer at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Huxtable has participated in multiple panels and lectures, including Basquiat and Contemporary Queer Art hosted by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Transgender in the Mainstream hosted by Art Basel Miami Beach, Body Work: Performance and Practice hosted by Art Basel and Open Score: Generation You presented by the New Museum and Rhizome. Later that year, Huxtable headlined the opening night performance of the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art's Time-Based Art Festival in Portland, Oregon. = Solo exhibitions = Huxtable's first solo exhibition, A Split During Laughter at the Rally, opened at Reena Spaulings in New York City in May 2017. The exhibition featured several posters with DIY-inspired magnets, a video piece featuring members from House of Ladosha, and a flow chart. The show explored \\"the aesthetics of conspiracy and American paranoia\\" through various modes of resistance, alienation, and irony. Huxtable notes that the posters in the exhibition were formally inspired by American artist Emory Douglas. Huxtable's second solo exhibition, Juliana Huxtable, opened at Project Native Informant in London, England in October 2017. The exhibition featured three photographs of a black subject with various (often conflicting) tattoos, four sculptural paintings made of military-style clothing, and ten pamphlet-sized posters recounting, \\"a brawl between Antifa leftist skinheads and Nazi skinheads outside of a Fred Perry sample sale in Paris\\". The show continues Huxtable's exploration into conspiracy theories and paranoia, subcultures, and identity but on a more humorous note. Fashion also plays a major role throughout Huxtable's practice as this show highlights. Huxtable has referenced Jose Esteban-Mu√±oz's \\"Disidentification\\" as a major inspiration. = Books = Huxtable is the author of two books and has contributed to numerous chapbooks and artist's writing anthologies. Her first book, Mucus in My Pineal Gland, was published in 2017 by Capricious. The book is a collection of previously performed poems, like UNTITLED (FOR STEWART) and THERE ARE CERTAIN FACTS THAT CANNOT BE DISPUTED, as well as a number of new poems. The book is written in her typical all-caps style and blue font. Huxtable's second book, Life, was co-written with artist Hannah Black. The novel is a work of science-fiction and is written in both English and German. It was released in 2017 by K√∂nig. = Music = Huxtable has collaborated with renowned producer SOPHIE under the name Analemma. The duo released two tracks on a compilation for Nina Kraviz's record label Trip.  Awards  Huxtable received a 2019 United States Artists Fellowship.  Themes  Style Huxtable's practice is interdisciplinary by nature and thus explores a range of topics. Earlier works explore ideas of identity, the body, and text, with influences from Afrofuturism and science fiction. Huxtable's more recent works explore language, conspiracy theories, fashion (Baroque costumes, military surplus, punk aesthetics, etc.), and various countercultures. Huxtable's visual practice includes, \\"examining and remixing enduring imagery that, in her observations, retain 'symbolic power.'\\" Steven Zultanski writes of Huxtable's Mucus in My Pineal Gland, \\"...doesn't idealize genrelessness, it moves between genres, unmooring moments of personal experience and speculative thought from literary conventions in order to situate them in the world outside of the text, while reflecting on and enjoying those conventions.\\" Huxtable often, \\"references her use of digital spaces, including Tumblr,\\" chat rooms, social media, online sexual subcultures, Encarta, and Afripedia as well as childhood, fashion, consumer culture, and the African diaspora. Influences Huxtable has noted a range of influences including writers Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany, theorists Luce Irigaray and Jose Esteban-Mu√±oz, and the visual aesthetics of video director Hype Williams, bands TLC and Blaque, and singer Aaliyah. Nuwaubian culture has often been a major source of inspiration for her as well. Huxtable's Mucus in My Pineal Gland is dedicated to \\"Herculine, Borges, LaDosha, and Pickaninny Punks.\\"  Exhibitions and performances  Solo exhibitions *INTERFERTILITY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX: SNATCH THE CALF BACK, Reena Spaulings Fine Art, New York, NY, 2019 *Juliana Huxtable, Project Native Informant, London, England, 2017 * A Split During Laughter at the Rally, Reena Spaulings Fine Art, New York, NY, 2017 Selected group exhibitions * Dirge, JTT, New York, NY, 2017 * Perverts, Cell Project Space, London, 2017 * Time-Based Art Festival 2016, Portland Institute for Contemporary Art, Portland, OR, 2016 * Seduction of a Cyborg, Human Resources, Los Angeles, CA, 2016 * DISSENT: what they fear is the light, Curated by Shoghig Halajian and Thomas Lawson, Los Angeles, CA, 2016 * Bring Your Own Body: transgender between archives and aesthetics, 41 Cooper Gallery, Cooper Union, New York City, New York, 2015 * 2015 Triennial: Surround Audience, New Museum, New York, NY, 2015 Selected online exhibitions * New Black Portraiture, Curated by Aria Dean, Rhizome.org * Collection Online at Solomon R.

In contrast to traditional forms of regulation, where decisions concerning rules are decided by the regulator, meta-regulation has firms create their own rules while observing and monitoring those rules. The advantages of self-regulation are that devolved structures of regulation allow for greater learning in complex and uncertain environments. Firms with the potential for catastrophic failure such as finance, oil drilling, mining, manufacturing, etc. often desire effective regulation to prevent such failures because of cost and damaged public relations. Meta-regulation is said to have the advantage of fostering norms of reflexivity among institutions, as they are forced to conscientiously consider optimal levels of regulation and elucidate the reasoning to regulators. In an ideal world of meta-regulation the motivations for both regulators and regulates become the same by diffusing the norms of safety and stability. Meta-regulation in practice has been critiqued as relying too heavily on notions of consensus and rationality (see Simon, 2017) Sources on Meta-regulation: Cary Coglianese, Evan Mendelson.

It was adapted into the 1990 television film Night of the Fox, starring George Peppard as Martineau and Michael York as Erwin Rommel. Plot summary Alan Stacy, a professor from Harvard University, visits Jersey to complete his biography of his friend and pre-World War II fellow academic Harry Martineau. The work has lain unfinished since 1939. He has been unable to obtain any information on Harry's wartime activities, but he knows that Harry worked for the British Government in some very secret capacities. Harry is now dead and his body has been released to a Dr. Drayton. Stacy arrives on the day of Harry's funeral, but only one mourner is present, Dr. Sarah Drayton. Invited back to her house, he is told by Sarah that the two of them worked for Special Operations Executive (SOE) during the war. She shows Stacy a photo of them posing with Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, and then tells the story behind the photo. In the aftermath of the Slapton Sands disaster, Hugh Kelso, a US Army colonel and engineering officer, is badly wounded but manages to climb into a life-raft. He is washed ashore on Jersey, and rescued by H√©l√®ne de Ville, wife of the Seigneur of Jersey, and Sean Gallagher, a former General in the Irish Army, who has retired in Jersey. They manage to establish communications, via a contact in France, with SOE, reporting that Kelso is alive, although badly injured and under medical care. Brigadier Dougal Munro of SOE is aware that Kelso is a 'bigot', one of the few officers who knows the full details of the planned D-Day landings. After consultation with General Dwight D. Eisenhower, he decides that Kelso must either be rescued ‚Äì or eliminated ‚Äì to stop him from talking, should he be captured and interrogated. Munro recruits Harry Martineau, a former Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford, and now a covert operative and ruthless killer. Harry is recovering from an assignment in France in which he was shot and severely injured. As his assistant and 'cover', they also recruit Sarah Drayton, a young nurse with connections in, and local knowledge of, Jersey. Harry assumes the identity of SD Standartenf√ºhrer Max Vogel. He is supplied with a forged letter of authority signed by Hitler and Himmler, giving him unlimited and unquestioned authority. Sarah's cover is that of Anne-Marie de la Tour, his French 'companion'. She undertakes very brief training in the use of small arms under Sergeant Kelly, and a complete makeover by Mrs Moon, an expert make-up artist borrowed from Denham Film Studios. The two are flown to occupied France by a Westland Lysander aeroplane and Harry uses his authority to demand transport on a regular convoy from the port of Granville to occupied Jersey. Harry sails on a naval vessel, but Sarah, as a civilian, must travel on a cargo boat. On board, she meets Lt. Guido Orsini, an Italian gunnery officer. The flotilla is attacked by Allied Motor Torpedo Boats and the boat on which Sarah is sailing is sunk by torpedoes. She is rescued by Orsini and they finally arrive in Jersey. Sarah's civilian documents and status ‚Äì and the Walther PPK pistol she carries ‚Äì arouse some suspicion with Captain Muller, the local head of the Geheime Feldpolizei, but Harry's impeccable authority leaves the Germans scrambling to assist him in any way he wishes, providing him accommodation and a personal vehicle, a Kubelwagen. Nevertheless, the Chief of Police, seconded from the Gestapo, decides to find out more about Vogel. On a tour of the island, Vogel finds Inspector Willi Kleist, Muller's deputy, trying to rape a young local girl, and after a fight, Kleist is badly injured by Vogel. The former swears revenge on Vogel. The plan to evacuate the wounded Kelso is upset by the arrival of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel on a surprise tour of inspection. But no-one of the party, and only one of the German officers, Major Hofer, is aware that 'Rommel' is actually Corporal Erich Berger, a cabaret performer and actor who is Rommel's double. The real Rommel has been drawn into a plot to assassinate Hitler and needs to be temporarily away from Germany, meeting with several generals in Normandy to formulate their plan. Berger is to serve as his alibi, with Hofer as his 'aide'. A small aircraft is sitting at the airfield for the weekly mail flight, but the flight cannot be commandeered except by special authority. Harry, who has planned to assassinate Rommel, unmasks him as Berger and gets him to give that authority. Berger agrees to co-operate, and reveals that he is actually Heini Baum, a German Jew who has assumed the identity of the dead Berger and has survived as a soldier, even winning the Iron Cross while serving with the Afrika Korps. The operation is nearly upset by the arrival of a drunken Kleist, who has overheard them speaking English and now knows the real identities of both Vogel and Berger. He holds them at gunpoint, but is overpowered and killed by Gallagher. They place him in a car which is set on fire and pushed over a cliff. Sarah, Harry and Baum commandeer the plane and fly towards France. The crew are overpowered and ordered to fly to England. The escape plan is discovered, and Muller has learned that no-one in Berlin has ever heard of 'Vogel'. A Luftwaffe night fighter is scrambled to shoot them down. One of the crew is killed and the pilot, a Finn who has thrown in his lot with the escapees, drops to almost sea-level, drawing down the pursuing fighter, which crashes. They continue to England, now in radio contact with the RAF. On landing, they are surrounded by armed soldiers. Baum rushes excitedly forward and is shot by a guard, ostensibly by accident but actually on Munro's orders. As he dies, he begs Harry to say Kaddish for him. The action returns to the present, and Sarah reveals that after the war, she qualified as a medical doctor and worked in the Cromwell Hospital, where she'd been nursing when she was recruited. She later married Orsini and lived on the family estate outside Florence, operating a country practice as Contessa Orsini. When Guido died as a result of a motor race, she returned to Jersey, despite the desire of her son, the present Count, to stay in Italy.

Her works have typically focused on subjects of environmental activism, and to a lesser extent, the performing arts.  Career  Her career in documentary film and television writing, directing and producing began in 1988. She had previously worked as an artistic director for an Australian amateur theatre company, the Shopfront Theater for Young People, for which she also wrote and directed performances. Her first documentary film Heroes of our time (1991) provided the first inside look at Greenpeace during one of its 'direct action' campaigns confronting oil company Caltex. In 1992, Henkel met Jeff Canin on a sea turtle nesting beach in Queensland and they became partners in life and in work. Following the birth of their daughter Sam Lara, they formed Hatchling Productions with the intention of producing social issue and community-based documentaries. They also established a digital post- production editing studio in the northern rivers region of New South Wales. In 1999, Henkel wrote and directed Walking Through a Minefield (1999) which documented the blockade of the proposed Jabiluka uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory. The film was financed by SBS Independent, the Australian Film Commission and the New South Wales Film and Television Office. In 2003, Henkel wrote and directed her first TV documentary for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation entitled The man who stole my mother's face. The film followed Henkel's own search for justice for her mother following a traumatic sexual assault, and was awarded Best Documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York in 2004. Henkel has twice explored the intersecting topics of deforestation and climate change with The Burning Season (2008) and Rise of the Eco-Warriors (2014). Henkel was the writer and director of both projects, which involved extensive travel and documentation of the expanding palm oil plantations of Indonesia and their social and environmental impacts. Henkel completed a Masters (2002) and PhD (2011) at the Queensland University of Technology. While many of Henkel's films have explored the topic of environmental activism, others have reflected her passion for the creative arts. These include Show Me the Magic (2012) which explored the life and work of Australian cinematographer Don McAlpine and I told you I was ill: The Life and Legacy of Spike Milligan (2005). Henkel's films have received two IF Awards for Best Documentary. Personal accolades include being named SPAA Documentary Producer of the Year in 2009, receiving an ACS Award and an Emmy award nomination. In 2014 she was appointed Director of the West Australian Screen Academy at Edith Cowan University. She had previously lived and worked in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia where she managed the production company, Virgo Productions.  Early career  Henkel was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and moved to Australia when she was 18. Henkel has said that she felt ashamed of her white South African heritage, referring to it as \\"wearing a badge of the oppressor.\\" In 1978, Henkel moved to Clunes and studied at Lismore's Northern Rivers College to become a teacher. She moved to Sydney in 1982 after taking a job as a director at Shopfront.  Trial of Rolf Harris  Henkel first met entertainer Rolf Harris and his wife Alwen Hughes at a South African hotel where Henkel was a waitress in the early 1970s. He encouraged her to go to Australia and their friendship spanned over forty years. In 2014, Henkel was called to testify as a witness at Rolf Harris' trial for multiple child sexual assault charges. She had unintentionally introduced Harris to one of his victims, 13-year-old Tonya Lee in 1986 when Henkel was artistic director of an Australian theatre group, Shopfront Theater for Young People, on tour in the United Kingdom. Henkel felt pressured verbally by Harris' brother to deny assault allegations, but she resisted, testifying that while she did not see the abuse occur herself, the circumstances made the abuse possible. Rolf Harris was found guilty on 12 charges of indecent assault against four girls spanning a period from 1968 to 1986.  Rise of the Eco- Warriors  According to Henkel, Rise of the Eco-Warriors began with a phonecall she received from Microsoft Partners in Learning. Through a subsequent Virgo Productions partnership with Microsoft, the project developed into something she described as \\"too good to be true\\" as it focussed on engaging school students around the world. Henkel described her intention to make a 3D version of Rise of the Eco-Warriors as being like \\"the Avatar story, but real\\", though a 3D version of the film was never released. The project put out a casting call for young people to audition for the film in 2011, with entries closing on 11 April. In total the project received 215 applications from 26 countries, something Henkel later attributed to \\"the power of Facebook\\". The chosen group of young people would ultimately spend 100 days in the jungle of Borneo with the Dayaks, learning about the expansion of the palm oil industry and its environmental and cultural impacts. The project's home on the internet was established at http://anactionmovie.com in 2010 and migrated to http://ecowarriorsrise.com in 2013. Awards Cathy Henkel won the award of Honorary Mention at the 2010 Byron Bay International Film Festival.  Collaborators  = Jeff Canin = Like Henkel, Canin grew up in apartheid South Africa. He left South Africa at the age of 20, shifting his focus from political to environmental issues. By 24, he had completed a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree in London. He followed his passion for sea turtles to a job with Greenpeace as the International Sea Turtle Campaigner. He served in the position for years in London, Florida and Amsterdam before moving to Australia where he began to produce films. In 1992 the pair launched Hatchling Films and went on to release Walking through a minefield (1999) which followed the Australian anti-nuclear movement's response to the proposal to mine uranium at Jabiluka in Kakadu National Park. Later collaborations include The Burning Season (2008), I told you I was ill: The Life and Legacy of Spike Milligan (2005), The man who stole my mother's face (2003) and many other films. Canin is a former Coordinator of the Clunes Technology Centre. He launched a new production company entitled Green Turtle Films and embarked on his first project without Henkel, the feature-length documentary Two Degrees (2013). = Trish Lake = Henkel has collaborated with producer Trish Lake of Freshwater Pictures on several of her productions, including The Burning Season (2008), Show Me the Magic (2012) and Dance for Me (in production).

It is the first political party in Israel focused on Orthodox Jewish women. The two previously existing Haredi Israeli parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, do not allow female candidates to run on their election slates. Colian says the party will represent all women who are dissatisfied with the current state of Israel's religious establishment. The party has been described as \\"trailblazing\\". In the 2015 election, the party failed to pass the electoral threshold necessary to win seats in the Knesset, receiving only 1,802 votes (0.04%). History Colian, the founder of the party, had been associated with the Shas party, but the party refused to allow her to run on its ticket in the municipal elections in 2013. When she petitioned to have gender exclusion in political parties declared illegal, the Israeli High Court denied her bid to have funding to political parties cut if they discriminate against women. As of 2015, no female candidates have ever run on the Haredi parties' candidate lists: Tzvia Greenfeld, a Haredi Jewish woman, did become the first female Haredi Knesset member in 2008, standing for the left-wing Meretz party. Although both organizations are protesting the gender discrimination and exclusion of Shas and United Torah Judaism, U'Bizchutan has no official connection with Lo Nivchharot Lo Bocharot, a campaign promoted by Esty Reider-Indorsky and Racheli Ibenboim to encourage Orthodox women to refuse to vote for a party that does not include women on its lists. Elana Maryles Sztokman, an Israeli author and women's rights activist, notes: \\"Considering that these women are coming from a world where they have been prohibited from holding public office, the new Haredi feminist movement is radical and revolutionary. It's creating a buzz both within and outside the community.\\" While it is not expected that the party will win any seats in the upcoming election for the Knesset, it expects to make progress in having their demands heard for the Israeli government and rabbis to provide Haredi women the same rights as other Israeli citizens. About 12% of the Israeli electorate is Haredi, and rabbis and husbands expect women to vote the way they are told, even though women are often the only household member who is employed. The new political voice of Haredi women may cause shifts in the future. \\"In theory, a Haredi woman votes according to what her husband tells her, which is based on what the rabbi tells him\\", said Colian. \\"But we know that in the voting booth, that decision is between the woman and God.\\" The reaction of some in the Haredi community was swift and negative. Attorney Dov Halbertal, well known in the Lithuanian-Haredi stream, spoke on public radio condemning U'Bizchutan and telling founder Ruth Colian, \\"You will be excommunicated for generations.\\" When threatening comments from religious leaders were allegedly published, Deputy Attorney General Dina Zilber sought to protect the rights of party members and voters. In a letter to the Central Elections Committee, Zilber noted that statements in the publication were formulated to prevent Haredi women from voting freely and running in a Knesset party. Zilber protested that the women were thereby being denied their rights as citizens, and denied having representation in their government. She added that the statements constitute threats and exclusion, \\"a serious phenomenon characterized by discrimination of women only due to their being women\\". The founding of the party has created conflict in the Haredi community. Rabbis have threatened the women in the party, and caused party leader Ruth Colian to ask for protection from the government after her 10-year-old daughter was pulled out of class and questioned about party activities. Issues U'Bizchutan's nine candidates, including two men, running in the Israeli legislative election in March 2015, promoted progress on women's issues, particularly education, employment and health issues. U'Bizchutan used social media to reach voters, in part because traditional Haredi publications refuse to accept advertisements from the party. This lack of inclusion of women candidates is consistent with Haredi practices in Israel that include relegating \\"women to the back of the bus, a separate room at a wedding and even a separate side of the street in some neighborhoods\\". The party's advertisements for the March 2015 campaign were initially rejected by some Haredi newspapers, including Yated Ne'eman and Yom Le'yom. Colian then petitioned the court to stop the discriminatory practice. With assistance of the Center for the Advancement of the Status of Women and the Center for Women's Justice, the party prevailed and the court ordered the two newspapers in the complaint to accept the advertisements. The court rejected the claims made by the news organizations that they might offend customers by publishing ads for the Haredi women's party. The head of the Rackman Center for the Advancement of the Status of Women at Bar-Ilan University's Law Faculty, Prof. Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, called the court decision \\"a historic legal precedent which determines that in certain circumstances, considerations of equality for women and election equality, as well as preventing discrimination against women and their preventing their exclusion, surpass property rights of commercial bodies like newspapers. This is the height of women's exclusion. Haredi women are not only prevented in practice from realizing the basic human right of running and being elected for Knesset, they are also denied the equal opportunity to inform their potential voters that they are running independently.\\" However, Yated Ne'eman then filed an appeal, and Supreme Court Justice Neal Hendel ruled that it would not be required to run these advertisements. Yated Ne'eman, which was started by the founder of the Degel HaTorah political party, one of the parties in United Torah Judaism, claimed that the initial ruling \\"constituted unlawful coercion and impinged on cultural and religious freedoms\\". A last-minute candidate, Gila Yashar, was added to party's list for the March 2015 election. She is a Haredi woman whose situation made Israeli newspaper headlines after a rabbinical court labelled her a \\"get refuser\\" and ordered her to be detained, leaving her handcuffed to a hospital bed. MK Aliza Lavie, chair of the Knesset's committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality, who had helped Yashar with her struggle, commented on Yashar's candidacy with U'Bizchutan to promote the interests of Haredi women: \\"Those who are supposed to be representing them in the Knesset today do not represent them in many cases. I hope that in the next Knesset, we will get to work side by side, and continue advancing and leading a policy which empowers women from all sectors in Israel.\\" References Category:Haredi Judaism in Israel Category:Orthodox Jewish political parties Category:Political parties in Israel Category:Political parties established in 2015 Category:Feminist political parties in Israel Category:Feminism in Israel Category:Orthodox Jewish feminism Category:2015 establishments in Israel ","title":"U'Bizchutan"},{"id":"45571415","text":"Ott's Assay Office is a historic assay office located at 130 Main Street in Nevada City, California. The building was constructed in 1851 as a drug store; James J. Ott opened his assay office in the back of the store in 1857. In 1859, Ott assayed a sample of silver ore discovered in the Washoe Country; this ore marked the discovery of the Comstock Lode, and the resulting silver rush eventually led to Nevada's statehood and several advancements in mining technology. The silver rush also gave Ott a reputation as a quality assayer; he ran his office until his death in 1907, and his son continued the business until 1955. . The adjoining building, which shares a common wall and is often considered part of the same building, was built in 1855. It served as the offices of the South Yuba Canal Company, which was formed in 1851 to bring water to the gold mines north of Nevada City. The company owned the oldest mining ditches in California, and it was the first in the United States to provide water to gravel mining operations.

It is a large, broom-like shrub to about high with narrow leaves and cream-coloured flowers and which often grows in saline places. Description Melaleuca adenostyla is a shrub growing to about tall with mostly glabrous leaves and branches. The leaves are arranged in alternating pairs (decussate) and are long, wide, and linear or narrow elliptic in shape. The flowers are cream coloured and arranged in a spike at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. Each spike contains between one and 12 individual flowers and is up to in diameter. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 11 to 21 stamens. Flowering occurs in spring and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long and partly buried in the branches. Melaleuca adenostyla resembles M. platycalyx except that the latter is somewhat smaller, has pinkish to mauve- coloured flowers and more (25-36) stamens in each bundle. M. adenostyla flowers have 11-21 stamens for each of its five bundles compared to 25-36 for M. platycalyx. The leaves of M. adenostyla are also narrower than those of M. platycalyx. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca adenostyla was first formally described in 1999 by Kirsten Cowley in a review of Melaleuca fulgens from a specimen collected near Hyden. According to Cowley, the specific epithet (adenostyla) is derived from the Greek adenos, meaning \\"gland\\" and stylos meaning \\"style\\", referring to the glandular style. The proper word for \\"gland\\" is however adƒìn (·ºÄŒ¥ŒÆŒΩ) in Ancient Greek.Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press.

Most of these lanes are restricted to buses only at certain days and times, but some bus lanes are restricted 24/7. , there are of bus lanes within New York City. The lanes are generally used to speed up MTA bus routes on the city's public transport system, which would be otherwise held up by traffic congestion. Bus lanes are a key component of the Select Bus Service (SBS) bus rapid transit network, improving bus travel speeds and reliability by reducing delays caused by other traffic. Since implementation, the lanes have generally helped to increase bus reliability citywide. However, there have been controversies on the benefits of the bus lanes due to the resulting increased traffic and the methods used to enforce bus lanes during their operating hours. In 2010 the city began enforcing the rule by placing cameras that take photos and videos of violators, leading to increased reports of bus-lane violations. Types of bus lanes A curbside bus lane runs along the curb. Vehicles are not allowed to park or stand this lane, but may briefly enter this lane to make right turns unless otherwise specified. An offset bus lane is placed one lane away from the curb. In this setup, vehicles are able to park or stand at the curb, but are not allowed to double park or stop on the bus lane. Vehicles may briefly enter this lane to make right turns unless otherwise specified. There are also median bus lanes, which are placed in the center of the road. This setup is only used along East 161st Street in the Bronx, used by the Bx6 and Bx6 Select Bus Service routes.  History  = 20th century = As early as 1959, the city wished to build exclusive bus lanes on Lafayette and DeKalb Avenues in Brooklyn. The lanes would be built on streets that were to be converted from two-way to one-way streets. They were intended to increase the speed of bus service on these avenues, since without the bus lanes, the routes were projected to lose riders. However, traffic commissioner T. T. Wiley disapproved of the proposal, since the city did not install exclusive bus lanes. HOV lane on the Long Island Expressway near the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Expressway The first two bus-lane corridors implemented in New York City were installed on May 20, 1963. One set of bus lanes was placed on Victory Boulevard in Staten Island, at the approach to the Saint George Ferry Terminal. The other set was placed on Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn between Boerum Street and Flatbush Avenue. The same year, the city's first highway bus lane was installed on the Long Island Expressway in Long Island City, under the proposal of Traffic Commissioner Henry A. Barnes. The Brooklyn bus lane soon encountered frequent traffic slowdowns, leading officials to propose adding no-parking signs and more traffic agents to enforce the lane. Another bus lane was soon installed along Hillside Avenue in Queens, with the westbound bus lane extending to the subway station at 169th Street. In 1969, one of the most congested corridors, 42nd Street between Third Avenue and Eighth Avenue, received a rush-hour-only bus lane. Crosstown bus service on 49th and 50th Streets in Manhattan had one of the slowest speeds of those on any crosstown street in Manhattan: (walking speed). As a result, on June 12, 1979, to speed travel, lanes were implemented to be dedicated for use by crosstown buses and taxis. Cars without a destination on this pair of streets were prohibited on weekdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. between Third Avenue and Seventh Avenue. A seven-minute reduction in travel time resulted from the change. On May 26, 1981, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) implemented Commissioner Sam Schwartz's plan for bus lanes on Madison Avenue. These were the first exclusive concurrent dual bus lanes on a city street. Two lanes along Madison between 42nd Street and 59th Street were reserved for buses between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m on weekdays in order to reduce congestion and increase mass transit usage. Twenty-nine traffic enforcement agents monitored the operation. This plan was one of three major transportation initiatives undertaken by the Koch Administration. The plan was put into place after the city took a study of traffic going down Madison Avenue: 24,000 people were moved by bus, while only 11,000 moved by car between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.. The maximum time to ride on a bus along the corridor was decreased from 36 minutes to 15 minutes. The Federal Urban Mass Transit Administration (now the Federal Transit Administration) provided a grant of $788,000 for the project. While intended to only last for a year, the plan was so successful that the bus lanes were maintained. Local bus speeds increased from to , a 65% increase. Express bus speeds increased from to , a 100% increase. While it was expected to decrease speeds for private cars and taxis, the overall speed of traffic on the remainder of the avenue increased by 10%. Additional bus lanes were added in the 1970s and 1980s. By 1981, Manhattan alone had of priority bus lanes along First, Second, Third, Sixth, and Eighth Avenues; Broadway in Lower Manhattan; and 42nd and 57th Streets. Another federal grant of $575,000 allowed the city to hire 22 traffic agents to enforce bus lane rules. In 1982, the city started a pilot project in which it installed red thermoplastic strips along 10 bus lanes in Manhattan. The strips were installed to remind motorists of heavy bus-lane penalties. In 1982, a curbside bus lane was implemented on Third Avenue between 36th Street and 56th Street. = 21st century = Curbside bus lanes on Fordham Road in the Bronx The NYCDOT started painting bus lanes red in 2007-2008, with the introduction of Select Bus Service (SBS). The first bus lane that was painted red was installed on 57th Street in 2007, but the red paint was removed two years later. The NYCDOT chose an epoxy-based red paint for visibility reasons, but after extensive testing and review of said paint, found that the red paint was only durable when applied on newer asphalt surfaces. In 2010, the NYCDOT began studying other epoxy-based red paints for use on bus lanes. As a result of the study, three brands of red paint were determined to be suitable for use on New York City bus lanes. In 2017, the Bx6 became the first corridor to use bus lanes in the median of the street, as opposed to bus lanes on the curbside or one lane away from the curbside. The median bus lanes supposedly speed up traffic by going around double-parked cars. In January 2019, mayor Bill de Blasio promised to add of bus lanes a year as part of a plan to speed up the city's bus system. On April 18, 2019, de Blasio unveiled the Better Buses Action Plan, which recommended 24 locations where changes to speed up bus service should be made. As part of the plan, twenty-four corridors would receive new, upgraded, or protected bus lanes, in addition to other strategic measures intended to speed up bus service. In addition to new bus lanes on fourteen corridors and bus stop improvements to six locations, bus lanes will be upgraded along four corridors. These are Lexington Avenue between 96th and 60th Streets, Madison Avenue between 60th and 42nd Streets, and 42nd Street between FDR Drive and 12th Avenue in Manhattan, as well as Livingston Street between Boerum Place and Flatbush Avenue (potentially protected bus lanes) in Brooklyn. A busway on 14th Street was implemented in October 2019 on a trial basis. In June 2020, de Blasio announced that the city would test out busways on Main Street and Jamaica Avenue in Queens, 5th Avenue and 181st Street in Manhattan, and Jay Street in Brooklyn. The 14th Street busway would become permanent, and of new bus lanes would be added. , only the Jay Street busway had been implemented. Notable corridors with bus lanes , the city's bus lane network is about long, representing two percent of the city's of streets. =Manhattan= In the East Village, Avenue A and Avenue D received bus lanes in advance of SBS implementation on the M14. For nearly their entire lengths, the northbound-only First Avenue between Houston and 125th Streets, and southbound-only Second Avenue between 125th and Houston Streets, form a directional pair of bus lanes used by the M15 corridor. The bus lanes are used by both the M15 local and SBS routes. Northbound-only Third Avenue between 36th and 58th Streets, and southbound-only Lexington Avenue (southbound, between 30th and 96th Streets), is another directional pair hosting the M101, M102, M103, and M98 bus routes. A curbside bus lane on Fifth Avenue The two bus lanes of southbound-only Fifth Avenue carry the M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5. In fall 2017, a second bus lane was added to Fifth Avenue. They form a directional pair with the two northbound-only Madison Avenue bus lanes between 42nd and 59th Streets, which carry the M1, M2, M3, and M4. In November 2012, the hours of the double bus lanes on Madison Avenue were extended from 2 to 7 p.m. to 24 hours. Northbound Sixth Avenue between 40th and 57th Streets, carrying the M5 and M7, is a directional pair with southbound Seventh Avenue, whose bus lane between 23rd and 42nd Streets) is used by the M7 and M20. For the M20, Seventh Avenue is also a directional pair with northbound Eighth Avenue between 42nd and 57th Streets. Bus lanes also exist on major crosstown streets in Midtown Manhattan. A bidirectional, restricted-access busway carrying the M14 SBS is located on the 14th Street corridor between Third and Ninth Avenues. Additional bus lanes on 14th Street would be added between Avenue C and First Avenue. The bidirectional bus lanes on 23rd Street, carrying the M23 SBS and various express routes, stretch across almost the entire length of the street, with the westbound lane running between 1st and 8th Avenues and the eastbound lane between 10th and 2nd Avenues. On 34th Street, both lanes run between 11th and 1st Avenues, serving the M34 and M34A SBS buses as well as westbound express routes. Eight blocks north, 42nd Street's lanes between 11th and 1st Avenues carry mainly the M42, though there are also some left-turn bus lanes on 42nd Street.See:  57th Street's bus lanes between 8th and 2nd Avenues are used by the M31, M57, and various eastbound express routes. Uptown, the M79 SBS corridor employs short segments of \\"queue jump\\" bus lanes on parts of 79th and 81st Streets in order to enable buses to jump to the front of traffic at several signalized intersections. 86th Street also uses queue-jump lanes for the M86 SBS corridor. In Harlem and East Harlem, 125th Street's crosstown bus lanes between Lenox and 2nd Avenues carries the M60 SBS, M100, M101, and Bx15 routes at various points. In Washington Heights, 181st Street has bus lanes between Broadway and 9th Avenue to funnel Bronx bus routes into the George Washington Bridge Bus Station. The 181st Street lanes carry the Bx3, Bx11, Bx13, Bx35, and Bx36 routes. In Inwood, the 207th Street lanes between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue carry the Bx12 and Bx12 SBS routes. In addition, bus lanes for the M96 route have been proposed for 96th Street between Riverside Drive and the FDR Drive. In Lower Manhattan, there is one directional pair of bus lanes. Southbound Broadway contains a bus lane between Bowling Green and Houston Street, which carries the M55 and Staten Island express routes. Northbound Church Street, between Battery Place and Warren Street, carries these same routes one block west of Broadway. Other Lower Manhattan corridors where new bus lanes are planned to be installed are the FDR Drive between the Brooklyn Bridge and Battery Park, for express buses; Allen Street between Houston Street and Grand Street, for the M15 and M15 SBS; and Battery Place between Broadway and West Street, for express buses. There are short bus lanes for various destinations around Manhattan. The southbound bus lane on 11th Avenue between 37th and 42nd Streets serves buses entering the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, as well as the M12 route. Bus lanes also exist at several major crossings, including 60th Street (for the Queensboro Bridge) and the Holland Tunnel. Additionally, there is one non-MTA bus lane in Manhattan. In northern Harlem, Convent Avenue between 135th and 145th Streets carry school buses headed for the City College of New York. No MTA buses use these lanes since the discontinuation of the M18 bus in 2010 eliminated MTA bus service on Convent Avenue. =The Bronx= The Bronx has three major sets of bus lanes. The north-south Webster Avenue lanes between 166th Street and Gun Hill Road serve the Bx41 and Bx41 SBS routes. The crosstown lanes on Fordham Road and Pelham Parkway, between Sedgwick Avenue and Stilwell Avenue, are used by the Bx12 and Bx12 SBS. There is also a bus lane corridor on East 161st Street used by the Bx6 and Bx6 SBS, consisting of two main parts: an eastbound-only lane in the center roadway and tunnel from Yankee Stadium to Sheridan Avenue, and a center bus lane from Sheridan to Morris Avenues. Another major corridor is planned on 149th Street between River Avenue and Southern Boulevard. Smaller bus lane corridors exist. There are bus lanes on East 163rd Street from Tiffany Street to Southern Boulevard and East 161st Street from Melrose Avenue to Third Avenue. A southbound queue jump for the Bx5 is located at the intersection of Southern Boulevard and East 163rd Street. Bus lanes are also installed on Broadway between 218th Street and 231st Street, for the Bx7, Bx9, and Bx20 routes, and on Webster Avenue between 174th Street and 176th Street, for the Bx41 and Bx41 SBS routes. A median busway will also be installed on the Edward L. Grant Highway north of 170th Street for the Bx11 and Bx35, and queue jumps and curbside bus lanes for the Bx35 will be installed along 168th and 169th Streets. =Queens= Q84 bus using an offset bus lane in Jamaica, Queens In Jamaica, Archer Avenue between Sutphin and Merrick Boulevards carries routes leading to Jamaica Center or 165th Street Bus Terminal. The vast majority of routes run eastbound along Archer Avenue, but bus lanes run in both directions along the avenue. One block north, Jamaica Avenue's lanes between Sutphin Boulevard and 168th Street carry bidirectional bus traffic, but about half of routes use only the westbound bus lane. A longer set of bus lanes in northern Jamaica, on Hillside Avenue between Merrick and Francis Lewis Boulevards, carry the Q1, Q36, and Q43. Merrick Boulevard is also slated to get bus lanes from Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard. North-south lanes in Queens run along two corridors and are planned for a third. Main Street between Northern Boulevard and Horace Harding Expressway hosts the Q20A/B and Q44 SBS. In October 2016, plans were announced to limit southbound traffic on Main Street between 37th Avenue and 40th Road to buses and local deliveries to maintain bus speeds during the construction of widened sidewalks. In 2018, the NYCDOT announced that it planned to make the changes permanent. In late 2020, a bus lane will be added along Main Street heading northbound between the Grand Central Parkway and Union Turnpike. Further to the west, Woodhaven Boulevard, carrying the Q11, Q21, Q52 SBS, and Q53 SBS, contains bus lanes between Queens Boulevard and Metropolitan Avenue, as well as between Union Turnpike and 81st Road. Future projects will upgrade the bus lanes on Main Street and Woodhaven Boulevard. In addition, a bus lane would be added on Fresh Pond Road, carrying the Q58 and three express bus routes, between Metropolitan and Putnam Avenues. Several short east-west bus lanes were installed in Queens as well. In March 2018, the NYCDOT announced that a short bus lane for the Q60 would be installed as part of the capital reconstruction of Queens Boulevard for Vision Zero's Great Streets program. As part of the plan, the Q60 would be moved to the median of Queens Boulevard between Roosevelt Avenue and 73rd Street, and a bus lane would be located in the median at 69th Street heading eastbound. In addition, bus-only queue-jump bus stops with boarding islands would be added at 65th Place. In April 2019, the NYCDOT announced that eight queue-jump lanes would be added along Broadway: at Grand Street, Whitney Avenue and 78th Street in both directions, and at 75th Street northbound and Corona Avenue southbound. These lanes would speed up bus service on the Q53 SBS and Q58. A third corridor, Rockaway Beach Boulevard from Beach 116th to Beach 73rd Street, carrying the Q22 and Q52/Q53 SBS, also received bus lanes on parts of the corridor. Queens also has one combined bus/HOV lane in the Manhattan-bound direction. during morning rush hours only. The lane exists on the Long Island Expressway west of Calvary Cemetery. The bus lane extends to the Manhattan portal of the Queens‚ÄìMidtown Tunnel. It serves most Queens-to-Manhattan express buses. =Brooklyn= In Downtown Brooklyn, there are two major corridors with bus lanes. Fulton Mall and Fulton Street contain a bus lane in each direction between Boerum Place and South Oxford Street, with buses having exclusive use of the Fulton Mall west of the Flatbush Avenue Extension. The Fulton corridor is used by the B25, B26, B38, and B52. One block south of Fulton are the Livingston Street bus lanes, which run between Boerum Place and Flatbush Avenue. These are served by the B41, B45, B67, and B103. There is also a busway on Jay Street, served by the . Offset bus lane on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn Three major corridors also contain bus lanes to facilitate SBS operations. Southbound Nostrand Avenue contains one bus lane between Flushing Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, carrying B44 and B44 SBS. Rogers Avenue between Flatbush and Flushing Avenues was also retrofitted with a northbound bus lane, serving the B44 SBS and B49 in that direction. Bus lanes were also installed on the extreme south end of Nostrand Avenue between Avenue X and Emmons Avenue. Additionally, the Utica Avenue corridor had bus lanes between Carroll Street and Eastern Parkway prior to the implementation of Select Bus Service on the B46 in 2016. The avenue also gained lanes from St. Johns Place and Church Avenue in 2014, which were extended to Fillmore Avenue in 2015. In 2018, as part of the implementation of B82 Limited route to Select Bus Service, a section of Kings Highway between East 23rd Street and Avenue K was equipped with two bus lanes. The borough also has shorter bus lanes to facilitate operations at key destinations. On eastbound Oriental Boulevard between Jaffrey and Norfolk Streets in Sheepshead Bay, a bus lane for Kingsborough Community College serves the B1 and B49 routes. In Canarsie, Rockaway Parkway has a bus lane between Glenwood Road and Flatlands Avenue for B42 buses making connections with the Canarsie-Rockaway Parkway subway station. In Prospect Heights, Flatbush Avenue has bus lanes at Grand Army Plaza, which host the B41 service. Other bus lanes are installed on short, heavily traveled corridors. In 2017, the NYCDOT announced revised plans to implement bus lanes between Fort Greene Place and Grand Avenue on Fulton Street to speed up B25 and B26 service, with the bus lanes being in effect for fewer hours per day than originally planned. In March 2018, the NYCDOT announced plans to install a bus lane between Avenue S and East 53rd Street on the northbound Flatbush Avenue service road, as well as a leading bus interval at the traffic light at the intersection with Utica Avenue. In April 2019, the NYCDOT announced that it planned to install east-west bus lanes on Church Avenue between Flatbush Avenue and East 7th Street to facilitate B35, B103, BM3, and BM4 service. In addition, two northbound queue jumps and a short southbound bus lane would be installed on Utica Avenue between Chauncey Street and Atlantic Avenue for B46 SBS service. Brooklyn also has one combined bus/HOV lane, which runs in the Manhattan-bound direction during morning rush hours and the Staten Island-bound direction during evening rush hours. The lane exists on the Gowanus Expressway north of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The bus lane extends to the Manhattan portal of the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel. It serves most Staten Island-to-Manhattan express buses. =Staten Island= Staten Island has four major bus lane corridors. Hylan Boulevard's bus lanes host the S78, S79 SBS, and numerous express routes between Steuben Street and Lincoln Avenue. These lanes are planned to be extended from Lincoln to Nelson Avenues. South of Hylan Boulevard, Father Capodanno Boulevard also has a bus lane in the northbound direction between Midland and Lily Pond Avenues, which are used by the S51, S52, S81, and some express routes. Richmond Avenue's north-south lanes appear in two places: near the Staten Island Mall and near Hylan Boulevard. They are mainly utilized by the S59, S79 SBS, and S89, as well as some express routes. Finally, Victory Boulevard has bus lanes between Forest Avenue and Bay Street, which are used by the S46, S48, S61, S62, S66, S91, S92, S96, and S98. Staten Island also has a combined bus/HOV lane on the Staten Island Expressway in each direction from Victory Boulevard to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. It serves most Staten Island-to-Manhattan express buses. Rules Emergency vehicles and buses, including non-MTA buses such as school buses and charter buses, are the only vehicles with unrestricted access to the bus lane during the hours that the bus lane is in effect. During that time, it is permitted to enter a bus lane and drive for a maximum of in order to make an immediate right turn, or to enter a driveway. It is also permitted to be in the bus lane to actively engage in curbside parking. Finally, delivery trucks can enter bus lanes to make drop-offs or pick-ups at residences or businesses, but only when bus lanes are not in effect. =Enforcement= In 2010, the city gained authorization from the state to begin placing hidden traffic cameras on gantries above the bus lanes. The cameras take photos of the vehicles driving through the bus lane, along with their license plates. Originally, a fine of $115 to $150 was then mailed to the registrant's address. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) also enforces the bus lanes by issuing parking and moving violations to violators. In 2014, according to the Independent Budget Office, of bus lane violations were captured on camera, contributing to $41 million worth of traffic violations captured by traffic cameras in that year. Automated cameras have advantages over manual police enforcement because they rarely make errors, are not disputable, allow the police to respond to important issues, and add revenue to the city without the cost of human officers. However, there were cases where the cameras were reported to be used as traps and the legitimacy was disputed. Another disadvantage was that some drivers received violations for momentarily entering the bus lane to avoid a collision, or taking too long to exit the bus lane as a result of traffic jams. Enforcement was also criticized as lax. As a result, in January 2019, a dedicated enforcement team of tow trucks was announced. That same October, the MTA introduced a \\"graduated fine\\" system wherein a first offense would result in a $50 fine, but subsequent violations would receive increasing fines not exceeding $250. Offset Woodhaven Boulevard bus lane north of Metropolitan Avenue in Queens Prior to installing the bus lane cameras, there were disputes between the MTA and the City of New York over who will get the revenue from the tickets. At first the MTA refused to allow the cameras until the city would agree to split the revenue. The city regularly reports revenue from violations issued by the automated cameras. In one instance a camera issued nearly 7,200 violations in a two-month period, translating to an average of 115 tickets a day, and raising about $823,000 in fine revenue.  Benefits  Bus lanes have generally increased average bus speeds and reduced travel times where they are installed. For instance, after bus lanes were installed along East 125th Street in East Harlem in 2014, the average speeds of the M60 Select Bus Service route along that segment increased 32% to 34%, and the average speeds of the M100 and Bx15 local buses increased 7% to 20%. By contrast, along West 125th Street where bus lanes were not initially installed, there was no marked increase in local bus speeds. The speeds of M60 SBS buses increased 27% to 36%, but only as a result of other improvements such as off-board fare payment and fewer stops. Another corridor, Fordham Road in the Bronx, saw a 14% to 24% increase in average bus speeds on the Bx12 route after bus lanes were installed. Controversies While bus lanes reduce the time for bus commuters, they may create traffic jams and increase travel time for other vehicles. On one bus lane, some drivers reported that travel times had more than doubled, and residents reported increased honking and pollution, despite a study by the NYCDOT indicating that there would not be increased traffic for other vehicles. The cameras allow for a temporary stop to pick up/drop off passengers at curbside bus lanes, but cab drivers are concerned that customers may take longer than usual to arrange payment, which may result in a fine. The installation of bus lanes reduced the amount of on-street parking in some areas, in turn potentially forcing the closures of businesses. In one incident in 2014, the city delayed mailing out the violations for a few months, causing violators to receive multiple tickets that added up to as much as $7,000. According to one commentator for The New York Times, this did not serve the purpose of the cameras, which were to educate drivers and keep the bus lanes empty of cars. The city agreed to review the violations and to keep each driver liable only for the first violation they received. There was a bus lane camera on Staten Island that gave tickets to drivers who failed to make an immediate right turn, even though it was not possible to make the right turn, since the next possible turn was a private driveway or a one-way street that had traffic running in the opposite direction. One retired police officer showed that his ticket was withheld by the judge and the appeals system. The city eventually turned off the camera.

It will link the Elector's Photo Identity Card (EPIC) with the Aadhar number of the registered voter. It is aims to create an error-free voter identification system in India, especially by removing duplications. The project was launched on 3 March 2015. On 11 August 2015, the Supreme Court of India passed an interim order regarding the Aadhar project, which caused the NERPAP to be put on hold. Overview Under the project, the voters can submit their Aadhar and EPIC number by SMS, email, mobile application and website. 1950 call centers have been set up to accept submissions via phone calls. The voters can also submit their documents at designated registration camps and offices. Voters with multiple entries in the databases can voluntarily disclose it. Voters will be able to apply for corrections in their EPIC entries by submitting supporting documents. The project also aims to improve photograph quality on EPIC entries by borrowing the photographs of voters from the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) database. The project expects to weed out duplicate, fake and ineligible voters, and voters who have shifted to other regions from the databases. The projects will also acquire mobile numbers and emails of voters to send them poll related notifications. According to the data provided by UIDAI to the Election Commission, 50,00,00,000 of the country's 85,00,00,000 voters are currently registered with the UIDAI. The UIDAI is expected to complete the registration of all voters in a few months. Criticism On 20 May 2015, CPI (M) leader, Sitaram Yechury, wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner of India, Syed Nasim Ahmad Zaidi, expressing concerns about the project. He said the data collected by linking the EPICs with Aadhaars may result in misuse such as discriminating against a section of citizens. He also asked Zaidi to clarify that possession of an Aadhaars was not mandatory for voting and that linking with Aadhaar was voluntary. He said that the SMS sent to voters made it seem like it was mandatory. With the order of the Supreme Court of India collection of Adhaar number and linking it with the electoral role has been suspended with Delhi first to suspend collection of the data.

Composed by Sachin‚ÄìJigar, the song is sung by Arijit Singh and Rekha Bhardwaj, with lyrics by Dinesh Vijan Priya Saraiya. The music video of the track features actors Varun Dhawan and Yami Gautam.  Background and development  On 22 January 2015, The Times of India revealed that a track from the film titled \\"Judaai\\" will \\"complete the film's musical story\\" and marks the first collaboration of Arijit Singh and Rekha Bhardwaj in a duet. The duo had earlier worked in Barfi! (2012) where Bhardwaj and Singh performed the original and reprise version of the song \\"Phir Le Aya Dil\\" respectively. Apart from Barfi!, they also worked together in \\"Kabira\\" from Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013), where Bhardwaj performed the original version while Singh performed the encore version of the song. The song was recorded on 9 January 2015 and was materialised in 90 minutes. Sachin Sanghvi from the composer duo Sachin‚ÄìJigar stated; \\"We waited six months to get Rekha Bhardwaj and Arijit Singh together for the first time for \\"Judaai\\". We knew that their voices would make the song unforgettable\\". Regarding Bhardwaj's recording experience with Sachin‚ÄìJigar, she mentioned; \\"They make me feel comfortable. As they composed the music keeping me in mind, I tried my best to deliver better. The way they have made me sing in a high octave, it is something which I could achieve only because of them\\". The released music video consists of several snippets from the film, showcasing various phases of Raghu's (played by Varun Dhawan) life. According to India.com, the song \\"shows how one feels when they are separated from the one they love, especially under tragic circumstances\\". It was conceptualised as a setback where Dhawan reminiscence his past life with his wife and child. Dhawan, picking the song as his personal favourite song from the album declared that the \\"video of \\"Judaai\\" is actually what Badlapur is, that's how sensitive the film is\\".  Release and response  \\"Judaai\\" was digitally released on 23 January 2015 as part of the soundtrack album of the film. The music video of the song was officially released on 2 February 2015, through the YouTube channel of Eros Now. \\"Judaai\\" was the third track released from the album, after \\"Jee Karda\\" and \\"Jeena Jeena\\". = Critical reception = Joginder Tuteja writing from Rediff.com applauded the \\"unconventional pairing\\" of Bhardwaj and Singh: \\"Both singers are known for their quality output and it is good to hear them together in this offbeat duet\\". Further mentioning that the lyrics too are \\"unconventional\\", Tuteja opined that it \\"may not become a chartbuster, but it makes for good listening\\". Suanshu Khurana from The Indian Express mentioned how Sachin‚ÄìJigar broke the \\"monotony of Bharadwaj's folksy voice\\" by giving her a song where she has to stick to bass notes and not go beyond bass scale. Khurana felt that \\"Judaai\\" is packaged with Singh's voice, \\"who is his usual self\\". The Times of India's Kasmin Fernandes wrote; \\"Bhardwaj starts off the song with her restrained yet powerful vocals and the pace picks up when Singh comes on. It is a lounge song that gets a dreamy treatment with the sarangi that is heard throughout\\". Rajiv Vijayakar from Bollywood Hungama expressed a mixed response to the lyrics of the song. Vijayakar thought the lyrics have an \\"unnecessarily high proportion\\" of Punjabi, though some of the \\"lines connect, with their simple familiar language\\". Regarding the vocals, Vijayakar affirmed that Singh \\"overshadows\\" Bhardwaj, \\"which does not happen every day, given her calibre and skills\\". Rucha Sharma of Daily News and Analysis stated; \\"In their first collaboration together, Arijit Singh and Rekha Bhardwaj take turns with the hook, Chadariya jheeni re jheeni and the result is spectacular. The use of the sarangi touches your heart\\". According to Surabhi Redkar of Koimoi, \\"Judaai\\" proved \\"how versatile Sachin-Jigar are since they are also the composers who have given us peppy numbers in the past\\". He further commented that both Singh and Bhardwaj \\"give their best and the soft musical arrangements give it the required calm\\".

It was released on 9 October 1989 on 4AD. Originally intended to be a three-track single release, Scar was produced by John Fryer and the band themselves and recorded at London's Blackwing Studios in 1989. Lush were the subject of considerable attention from the British music press, including NME and Melody Maker, around the time of Scar. The mini album was met with critical acclaim upon release, particularly for its shoegazing style and its unusual songwriting arrangements. Scars material drew comparisons to several fellow independent artists, including My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth and Cocteau Twins. In support of its release, Lush toured with Pale Saints and Loop, performing a dozen dates on the UK university circuit. Scar was also a moderate commercial success for 4AD, selling over 15,000 copies in its first four months of release and peaking at No. 3 on the UK Independent Albums Chart. It was reissued as part of the compilation album Gala‚ÄîScars original working title‚Äîin November 1990. Background Lush were formed in 1987 in London by vocalist Meriel Barham, guitarist Emma Anderson, vocalist-guitarist Miki Berenyi, bassist Steve Rippon and drummer Chris Acland. Berenyi had met Barham, Rippon and Acland while all four were attending the Polytechnic of North London;Anderson 2014, 42:18-42:41 Berenyi and Anderson had been friends since the age of 14 and edited the Alphabet Soup fanzine together. The band performed their first show at the Camden Falcon in London in March 1988, soon after which Barham left and joined Pale Saints; Berenyi subsequently assumed vocal duties. The band recorded two demo tapes‚Äîboth consisting of songs that would later appear on Scar‚Äîwhich were sent to various independent record labels, as the band were apprehensive of signing to a major label. Berenyi said that although major labels had shown interest in the band, she thought \\"if a [major] label takes us, its only gunna be cos there's two girls in the band and they're gonna completely capitalise on that. Which we obviously didn't want at all.\\" 4AD co-founder Ivo Watts-Russell heard Lush's demos and attended a show at the Camden Falcon in April 1989, where both Lush and Pale Saints were performing. Watts-Russell, impressed with Lush and Pale Saints' performances, offered both bands recording contracts;Watts-Russell 2014, 44:08-44:30 Lush's contract was a five-year and five-album deal. Recording For Scar, Lush originally planned for Cocteau Twins guitarist Robin Guthrie to produce the mini album. Anderson contacted Guthrie and provided him with a cassette of Lush's earlier recordings, to which he responded warmly and expressed his interest in working with the band. However, Lush and Guthrie's schedules \\"couldn't coalesce for Scar\\", and the band instead decided to work with producer Fryer. Guthrie did produce Lush's subsequent extended play Mad Love in 1990‚Äîfor which the Scar song \\"Thoughtforms\\" was rerecorded at his suggestion‚Äîand the band's debut full-length studio album Spooky (1992). Lush held the recording sessions for Scar at Blackwing Studios in south London in July 1989. The sessions were originally intended to only produce a three-song demo, with \\"Etheriel\\" as a potential A-side single release. The band instead recorded three full-form songs (\\"Baby Talk\\", \\"Thoughtforms\\" and \\"Scarlet\\"), and decided on the strength of the recordings to produce a further three songs (\\"Bitter\\", \\"Second Sight\\" and \\"Etheriel\\") to accommodate the release of a mini album. An extensive amount of vocal and guitar overdubs were recorded during Scars sessions, but neither Anderson nor Berenyi spent much time experimenting with their guitar sound as they did on subsequent releases such as Mad Love and Spooky; Anderson said \\"it was just either clean or distorted‚Äîthat was it\\". Following Scars recording, and reviewing the session's master tapes, Anderson said she considered Scar \\"like demos\\" rather than a debut album, but said that the band were still \\"quite pleased\\" with the quality of the recordings. Upon release, Scars production values drew comparisons to My Bloody Valentine's sound. In response, Rippon said that the mini album's production techniques were \\"completely derivative in the sense that there's nothing in our music that hasn't been done before\\", but made the distinction that it was \\"a different combination of familiar elements\\" instead of directly emulating another band's sound. Composition Scar is a mini album featuring six full- length tracks. Three of its songs (\\"Baby Talk\\", \\"Bitter\\" and \\"Second Sight\\") were written and composed by Berenyi and one (\\"Thoughtforms\\") was written and composed by Anderson; the two remaining songs (\\"Scarlet\\" and \\"Etheriel\\") were joint compositions between Berenyi and Anderson. Scar was described as having a distinctive style, \\"somewhere between Cocteau Twins and Sonic Youth\\", as well as \\"a mix of angelic vocals over subtle guitar trash, of melodies over chaotic rhythms, of haunting whispers over spitting feedback.\\" The mini album's songs were also noted by The Quietus as having \\"dissonant arrangements\\" and \\"swirls of ethereal, narcotic guitar\\" amidst Berenyi's vocals. Berenyi attributed the unusual arrangements on Scar to the fact that \\"none of [Lush's members were] particularly brilliant musicians, certainly at the beginning\\". She further explained that the band's nature was \\"quite experimental\\" and that the songs developed in the studio, with one member often writing other members' song parts and \\"quite laboriously\\" attempting to explain how to perform it. Berenyi's vocals on Scar, described by The Quietus as \\"submerged girl-next-door vocals\\", are largely indistinct and deliberately low in the mix, typical of the shoegazing genre. Scars lyrics , according to the band, are \\"female rather than feminist\\" and were described as \\"perverse or brilliant or funny or even stupid\\" by Alternative Press. Lush often disregarded suggestions by the British music press that the band's earliest material featured sexual themes, but Berenyi later admitted that \\"they're all about shagging, but not some heavy metal anthem about great sex ‚Ä¶ most of them are really cynical stories like losing my virginity.\\" Packaging Vocalist Miki Berenyi performing on tour with Pale Saints at l'Ubu in Rennes, France in April 1990 The packaging and sleeve design of Scar was designed by Christopher Bigg and Vaughan Oliver and featured photography by Jim Friedman. The front cover art features alternating shades of several colours, described by Alternative Press as \\"streaked in pale, pale blue and pink, highlighted by just-slightly-outdated print, lined in bright pinkish-orange.\\" Scars sleeve design was both commissioned and approved by 4AD without any input from members of Lush. Scars interior sleeve contains several drawings and singular words that are deliberately obscured. According to Berenyi, \\"One says tongue, the other says elder sister, and they sort of meet in the middle.\\" Berenyi described the interior design as \\"a bit perverse\\". The run-out matrix codes on the groove of the vinyl pressing of the mini album feature two similarly obscured messages: \\"Fanny tits delight\\" on side 1 and \\"I'll still fondle you\\" on side 2. Originally the mini album was due to be titled Gala, after Salvador Dal√≠s wife, Gala Dal√≠, but Scar was ultimately chosen as the title \\"because it juxtaposed the image of Lush and highlighted the band's abrasive side\\", according to Anderson. Release Scar was released by 4AD on 9 October 1989 in the UK. It was issued on vinyl, CD and cassette; it was later made available as a digital download. In support of the mini album, Lush began a 12-date national tour. The tour began with a \\"one-off\\" show at the Warehouse in Leeds on 27 November 1990, co-headlining with Pale Saints; Lush performed two subsequent headlining shows at the Joiner Arms in Southampton on 28 November and the University of Surrey in Guildford the following day. The following nine dates of the tour, beginning at the University of Hull on 1 December and concluding on 9 December at the Portsmouth Polytechnic, were in support of Loop. Upon its release Scar placed in the [UK Independent Albums Chart, peaking at No. 3. The mini album entered the chart on 21 October 1989 and remained for a total of 10 weeks. Within four months of its release, Scar sold over 15,000 copies, and the album was reissued as part of the Gala compilation in November 1990. Remastered versions of \\"Thoughtforms\\" and \\"Etheriel\\" were included as the final two tracks on Ciao! Best of Lush, a compilation album released in March 2001. Reception Scar was well received by critics, in particular by the British alternative music press. NME was hugely favourable, with reviewer Simon Williams referring to Scar as \\"a work of art\\" and rating the album 9 out of 10. He described the album as \\"colourful, contrasting, crafty\\" and said it was a \\"unique New Pop blueprint ‚Ä¶ that cuts it above the competition\\". A subsequent NME review of Gala said that \\"Scar swoops and dives between Pixies and early Siouxsie and the Banshees\\", though it noted that \\"there is no single word, no single influence\\" to define the album's sound. David Stubbs review of Gala in Melody Maker referred to the songs on Scar as \\"semi-ethereal, bittersweet confection\\" and \\"regular and reliable consignments\\". Selects review of Gala was particularly favourable of Scars material; Graham Linehan wrote that \\"'Thoughtforms' [and] 'Etheriel' [are songs] that nestle in the backbrain and kickstart whatever pleasure circuits you have left\\", adding that \\"'Baby Talk' and 'Second Sight' [are] songs that try to get from A to B as quickly and as loudly as possible without trembling to bits\\". Writing for Vox, Susan Corrigan referred to Scars songs as \\"chilly tunes with a warm centre\\" in a review of Gala, and said that with \\"Etheriel\\" and \\"Thoughtforms\\", \\"great things were hinted at ‚Ä¶ Lush already boasted songs that were worth remembering\\". As a result of Scars widespread critical acclaim, Lush were featured in year-end readers' polls in both Melody Maker and Sounds, tipped as the \\"Brightest Hope\\" for music in 1990 in the latter alongside Pixies, the Stone Roses and the Sundays. Scar has since been regarded as one of the most important albums in establishing the shoegazing sound and made Lush one of the first bands to attract the label, though the band were critical of their association with the genre.

The plot focuses on Marie, played by Marie Eline, as a young girl who plays with a jack-o-lantern crafted by her father. When she falls asleep, the girl dreams that she is invited by the Fairy Queen to their Halloween party. Her doll and pumpkin are given life and she enjoys the party. As she awakes, she mourns that it was all a dream, but was content for the experience. The film was advertised as a trick film and received mixed reception by reviewers. It was released on October 28, 1910, but records show that the film was still being shown in 1913. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: \\"Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural that she should be thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only known credit is for Marie Eline in the role of Marie. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The film was advertised as being a trick film, employing the use of clever camera techniques to create special effects.  Release and reception  The single reel comedy, approximately 1,000 feet long was released on October 28, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with theaters showing the film in Indiana, North Carolina, Arizona, Maryland, Kansas, and Pennsylvania. One advertisements shows the film still being promoted in 1913 and a possible showing in 1917. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by the Province Theatre. The Moving Picture World gave it minor praise and short summary of the film, but it does not evaluate or describe the special camera effects used to produce the film. The reviewer states: \\"To see the doll and the pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes the little girl to whom they belong surprise. The good times they have with the fairy's help will long remain in her memory, even though it is only a dream.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror was critical of the production, stating \\"This sounds as if it ought to be very clever, but aside from the work of the little heroine and the dance of the fairies it is entirely uninspired. It needs a drastic application of imagination. The broad idea is excellent, but the details of the management indicate impoverished resources. When the aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment, but this film doesn't get away from stolid realities. For example, nobody could imagine anything more earthly than the outside of the house from which the little girl escaped with the fairy queen and her comrades. That should have been treated fancifully. The events pictured don't amount to anything; there is a sameness about them, nothing surprising happens, and not very much that is pretty. Worst of all is the poetry(?), which is interpolated to explain the narrative; that is beyond criticism. The Thanhouser Company has missed good opportunities in this film.\\" The strange inclusion of the question mark after poetry is not a note by Bowers, for it was actually written into the review itself in the edition. Though no other review mentions poetry.

Individuals who identify with gray asexuality are referred to as being gray-A, or a gray ace, and make up what is referred to as the \\"ace umbrella\\". Within this spectrum are terms such as demisexual, semisexual, asexual-ish and sexual-ish. The emergence of online communities, such as the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), have given gray aces locations to discuss their orientation.  Definitions  = General = Gray asexuality is considered the gray area between asexuality and sexuality, in which a person may only experience sexual attraction on occasion. The term demisexuality was coined in 2008 by Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN). The prefix \\"demi\\" derives from the Latin dimidium meaning \\"divided in half\\". The term demisexual comes from the concept being described as being \\"halfway between\\" sexual and asexual. The term gray-A covers a range of identities under the asexuality umbrella, or on the asexual spectrum, including demisexuality. Other terms within this spectrum include semisexual, asexual-ish and sexual-ish. The gray-A spectrum usually includes individuals who very rarely experience sexual attraction; they experience it only under specific circumstances. Sari Locker, a sexuality educator at Teachers College of Columbia University, argued during a Mic interview that gray-asexuals \\"feel they are within the gray area between asexuality and more typical sexual interest\\". A gray-A identifying individual may have any romantic orientation, because sexual and romantic identities are not necessarily linked. = Demisexuality = The demisexual flag, in which the black chevron represents asexuality, gray represents gray asexuality and demisexuality, white represents sexuality, and purple represents community A demisexual person does not experience sexual attraction until they have formed a strong emotional connection with a prospective partner. The definition of \\"emotional bond\\" varies from person to person. Demisexuals can have any romantic orientation. People in the asexual spectrum communities often switch labels throughout their lives, and fluidity in orientation and identity is a common attitude. Demisexuality, as a component of the asexuality spectrum, includes inclusion in queer activist communities such as GLAAD and The Trevor Project, and itself has finer divisions.https://www.thetrevorproject.org/trvr_support_center/asexual/ Demisexuality is a common theme (or trope) in romantic novels which has been termed compulsory demisexuality.McAlister, Jodi. \\"First Love, Last Love, True Love: Heroines, Heroes, and the Gendered Representation of Love in the Category Romance Novel.\\" Gender & Love, 3rd Global Conference. Mansfield College, Oxford, UK. Vol. 15. 2013 Within fictitious prose, the paradigm of sex being only truly pleasurable when the partners are in love is a trait stereotypically more commonly associated with female characters. The intimacy of the connection also allows for an exclusivity to take place.  Community  Online communities, such as the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), as well as blogging websites such as Tumblr, have given ways for gray- As to find acceptance in their communities. While gray-As are noted to have variety in the experiences of sexual attraction, individuals in the community share their identification within the spectrum. A black, gray, white, and purple flag is commonly used to display pride in the asexual community. The gray bar represents the area of gray sexuality within the community.

She is a graduate of the University of British Columbia. Al-Hathloul has been arrested and released on several occasions for defying the ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia and was arrested in May 2018, with several prominent women's rights activists, on the charge of \\"attempting to destabilise the kingdom\\" after being effectively kidnapped in the United Arab Emirates. , her husband, Saudi stand-up comedian Fahad al-Butairi, had also been forcefully returned from Jordan to the Kingdom and was under arrest. Al-Hathloul was ranked third in the list of \\"Top 100 Most Powerful Arab Women 2015\\". On March 14, 2019, PEN America announced that Nouf Abdulaziz, Loujain Al-Hathloul, and Eman Al-Nafjan would receive the 2019 PEN America/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, which was presented on May 21 at the 2019 PEN America Literary Gala. Al-Hathloul was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2019. Women's rights activism (2014‚Äì2017) Al-Hathloul is known both for her role in the women to drive movement and in opposing the Saudi male guardianship system. On 1 December 2014, she was arrested and detained for 73 days after an attempt to cross the border in her car from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Saudi Arabia on charges related to defying the female driving ban in the kingdom. She has a UAE licence but the Saudi police still arrested her. Al-Hathloul attempted to stand in Saudi local elections in December 2015, the first vote in Saudi Arabia to include women, but was barred. In September 2016, along with 14,000 others, al-Hathloul signed a petition to King Salman asking for the male guardianship system to be abolished. On 4 June 2017, she was arrested and detained at King Fahad International Airport in Dammam. The reason for the arrest was not officially disclosed, although Amnesty International believed it was for her human rights activism, and al-Hathloul was not allowed access to a lawyer or any contact with her family. 2018‚Äì2020 detention and torture Loujain Al-Hathloul was kidnapped from UAE in March 2018 and deported to Saudi Arabia where she was arrested for a few days then put under a travel ban. Al-Hathloul was detained again on the eve of 15 May 2018, along with Eman al-Nafjan, Aisha al-Mana, Aziza al-Yousef, Madeha al-Ajroush and some men involved in campaigning for women's rights in Saudi Arabia. Human Rights Watch interpreted the purpose of the arrests as frightening \\"anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince's rights agenda\\". In June 2018, women were granted the right to drive in Saudi Arabia, while al-Hathloul remained under arrest. According to ALQST and Amnesty International, al-Hathloul and several of the other women detained for their women's rights activities were tortured. Torture techniques included being beaten on their feet, given electric shocks, whipped, in a torture location called \\"the hotel\\" or \\"the officer's guesthouse\\". According to Loujain al-Hathloul's sister Alia, (who lives in Brussels, Belgium), torture techniques used specifically against Loujain also included beating, electric shocks and waterboarding, and the torture occurred between May and August 2018. Loujain al-Hathloul's parents stated that Loujain's \\"thighs were blackened by bruises\\" when they visited, and that Loujain \\"was shaking uncontrollably, unable to hold her grip, to walk or sit normally\\" during their visit. According to Alia al-Hathloul, Saud al-Qahtani visited al-Hathloul during her torture, laughing at her, threatening to rape and kill her and to dispose of her body in the sewage system, and he tortured her \\"all night during Ramadan\\". Alia al-Hathloul stated that she had expected that under Saudi norms in relation to women, her sister would not have been tortured. As of December 2018, al-Hathloul was in jail with her fellow activists at Dhahban Central Prison. According to her brother Walid al-Hathloul (who lives in Ontario, Canada), al-Hathloul was by February 2019 held in al-Ha'ir Prison. On 1 March 2019, the office of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs public prosecutor announced that the preliminary investigation had been completed and they would be preparing to try al-Hathloul and other activists in court for undermining state security. On 13 March 2019, the trial began, although the charges were not specified and reporters and diplomats were barred from attending. In April 2019, a hearing on her case was postponed without a reason being given. As of May 2020, her trial has been indefinitely postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has raised concerns over her health inside the Saudi prison. On 11 August 2020, Lina al-Hathloul the sister of Loujain al-Hathloul (Nobel prize-nominated campaigner) expressed fear about the possibility of the activist being tortured again in the Saudi prison, as she has not been heard from for over 60 days. Loujain al-Hathloul had been held in incommunicado detention for three months. When she came to know that other detainees were allowed to call their family, she went on a 6-day hunger strike to demand the same. She was then allowed to meet her parents. Saudi Arabia has restricted many prominent human rights activists, clerics and royal family members from contacting their family or lawyer, raising concern over their safety & wellbeing. On September 15, 2020, around 30 countries called on Saudi Arabia to release jailed women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, along with 4 other women who are in detention, who campaigned for women to drive.

He led the team that developed the Baade 152. Life =Early years= Brunolf Baade was born and grew up on the southern edge of Rixdorf (today Neuk√∂lln), a densely populated district then just outside the northern perimeter of Berlin. (Rixdorf would be incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920.) His father was employed in a small electronics company, later rising to the position of assembly and technical worker. Brunolf had two younger sisters. His mother contributed to the household budget by running a small shop. Baade's father came from farming stock, but his mother's ancestry included teachers and artisans, along with the popular nineteenth century poet Hofmann von Fallersleben, an ancestor of whom Brunolf Baade was particularly proud. Baade attended the \\"Emperor Frederick Grammar School\\" (\\"Kaiser- Friedrich-Realgymnasium\\") locally from 1910, successfully completing his school leaving exam in 1922. When he was 14 his enthusiastic if brief involvement in some of the preparations for revolution which erupted in postwar Germany alarmed his parents, who were never themselves particularly political, and suggested that his rather conservative school environment had released a rebellious streak in the boy. He then studied at the Technical University of Berlin. He combined his time as a student with an internship at Blohm + Voss in Hamburg, reflecting his ambition at that time to make his career in the booming ship building industry. In Hamburg he was involved in the construction of the \\"Waskenland\\". Later, after the ship had been fitted out, she made her maiden voyage to South America. Baade joined the crew as a \\"coal trimmer\\", and then took the opportunity to explore South America, discovering its people and customs. =Building aircraft= Returning to Berlin, Baade resumed his studies, now increasingly focused on the potential of the aircraft business, to which he had been introduced during his stay in South America. He joined the Academic Flying League and started to construct gliders. (Production and operation of powered aircraft in Germany had been restricted under the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles signed in 1919.) Baade also learned to fly and participated in the annual glider competitions at the Wasserkuppe. At the end of 1927 he learned to fly powered aircraft, undertaking a course with the still semi-clandestine German Flying School (DVS) and obtaining a pilots licence. Incorporated into his study period with the DVS was an internship that ran from 27 November 1927 till 5 December 1928 and based in Berlin, which involved responsibility for static load testing. He now spent a year at the Technical University of Munich, concluding his undergraduate studies, in 1929 finally obtaining a degree in mechanical engineering. While studying in Bavaria he also undertook a further brief period of internship, from 16 March till 20 April 1929, with the Bavarian Aircraft Works (BFW / Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG). For another year he continued to work for Bavarian Aircraft Works through a period of financial crisis from which some years later the company emerged as \\"Messerschmitt AG\\". Willy Messerschmitt had been working in partnership with BFW since 1926, and during 1929/30 Baade worked with Messerschmitt on a succession of innovative passenger aircraft including the M18, the M20 and the M24. In 1930 Baade traveled to the United States, sent by BFW in order to hand over some production licenses to American firms. Once there, however, he loosened his ties with BFW, remaining in the USA for some years, working at various times for Eastern Aircraft, North American Aviation and the US subsidiary of the (since 1919 Dutch domiciled) Fokker Company. In 1932 he switched to Goodyear where his projects are thought to have included work on the futuristic Comet railcar project. 1932 was also the year in which he married Anna Stierle, like him a German expatriate. Despite apparent professional success in North America, Baade maintained his contacts with the German aeronautical industry. During the early 1930s employment prospects for aircraft engineers in Germany remained dire, but in the second half of 1936 he returned to Germany with his wife. There is some ambiguity as to whether, at this stage, the couple had expected to stay in Germany, but on 1 October 1936 Baade took a job to the south of Berlin, at Dessau with Junkers. High calibre aircraft engineers were now becoming highly valued: he achieved rapid promotion, an unexpectedly large salary and ended up living in a large house, all of which led to the abandonment of any half formed intentions that he might have had to return across the Atlantic. Appointed to head up the Development and Design Department, Baade stayed with Junkers through World War II which was declared by several western European governments in 1939, following Germany's invasion of Poland in the late summer. With Junkers Baade was involved in development of a succession of military aircraft including the Ju 88, Ju 188, Ju 388 and Ju 287. =After the war= The World War II ended in May 1945, but the previous month Brunolf Baade had been arrested by an advance party of US soldiers that had surprised him at the outsourced Junkers design office at Raguhn. Baade had been a member of the German Nazi Party since 1937 and was held prisoner by the Americans in Bad Hersfeld for a couple of months. With his gifts for easy friendship and fluent English he was able to engage his captors in conversation. Baade would later recall emphatic assurances received at this time from US officers that Germany would be radically de- industrialised and certainly not permitted an aircraft industry for many decades. It was, he said, this that persuaded him to support a German future determined by the Soviet Union. Between April and June the Americans occupied Dessau: they comprehensively looted the Junkers library and technical documents, along with the latest aircraft and engines which their soldiers removed apparently as trophies. The Americans released Baade in June 1945 and early in July American forces were replaced in central Germany by Soviet troops, respecting the division of Germany into occupation zones, already agreed between the allies at the Yalta Conference. Dessau was now in the Soviet occupation zone. =The Soviet Union= The Soviets had their own plans for post-war Germany. In Autumn/Fall 1945 Baade was mandated by the Soviet Military Administration to reconstruct the Junkers research facilities, using whatever remained of the wreckage in Dessau factory. The physical assets having been removed by the Americans, the Soviets were chiefly dependent on the \\"intellectual property\\" that could be extracted from plant personnel. Engineering and production specialists were required to write down everything they could remember. In the end more than 2,000 written reports were prepared and shipped to the Soviet Union, though as matters turned out the subsequent researches of the Junkers engineers would be of greater value than their memories of the past. Progress resumed on the company's advanced jet-engined designs and work began on rebuilding the former Junkers factory at Dessau. On 22 October 1946, however, Soviet troops appeared outside the houses of selected company personnel who were given four hours to pack their possessions and prepare for a two-week journey by truck to a village north of Moscow, and close to Dubna, called Podberezye (–ü–æ–¥–±–µ—Ä–µ–∑—å–µ). Some were accompanied by their wives, while for others their families followed a few weeks later. When they arrived they were confronted by a large complex of otherwise abandoned military buildings containing a considerable quantity of machinery that the Soviets had managed to gather from various formerly German aircraft manufacturing facilities. There had never been any doubt that the Soviets viewed formerly German military-industrial assets in their occupation zone as Soviet property, and while their commitment to progress on the advanced aircraft design for which Junkers was known was genuine enough, it now transpired that further work would be undertaken back in the Soviet Union. It is not clear whether Baade was one of those abruptly transported of whether he was already in the Soviet Union. In any event, Baade, whose talents for leadership and for charming people were not in doubt, quickly emerged as the leader of the relocated German engineers, and as a man whom the Soviets were in large part prepared to trust. Unlike the other German engineers in Podberezye, Baade was apparently allowed to move freely, and was even seen, early in 1947, on holiday in the Crimea while the other Germans aircraft specialists had no choice but to shiver through the coldest winter the Moscow region had known for many years. Under Baade work continued on developing the Junkers Ju 287 jet bomber with its characteristic \\"forward-swept\\" wings, now renamed as the OKB-1 EF 131, although progress was hampered by the Soviet refusal to allow the German engineers near the military airfield used to test the prototypes. The project was abandoned in June 1948. The final prototype was adapted for use in the OKB-1 140 programme. The other principal project of Baade's team of involuntary expatriates was the OKB-1 150, a jet bomber on which serious work began in 1948. The design incorporated innovative ideas on materials and design. As with the earlier project, progress was hampered by the inconsistent nature of support from the Soviets when it came to obtaining materials and permitting the German expatriates the freedom necessary to develop and test the aircraft effectively. By 1951 the OKB-1 150 had been developed into a heavy bomber with a range of approximately 1,500 km and a bomb capacity of around 600 kg, but in 1952 this project, too, was abandoned as resources were again reprioritized. While the German aircraft engineers were enduring the hospitality of the Soviet Union, Germany's Soviet occupation zone had become the German Democratic Republic, formally founded in October 1949. Economic hardships in the young country, exacerbated by the large reparations payments still being made to the Soviet Union and the high cost of supporting the Soviet military presence, are seen by some historians as a key cause, directly and indirectly, of the East German uprising in 1953. High profile show trials of officially designated enemies of the state were also a feature of East Germany in the first half of the 1950s. Nevertheless, 1953 was also the year in which Stalin died, and as the decade unfolded the political temperature in Moscow and East Berlin started, slowly, to become a little less nervous, and Moscow's approach to its East German ally became less antagonistic. After a period of uncertainty, in December 1953 Baade persuaded the Soviets to permit his team to develop the abandoned OKB-1 150 bomber into a world-class jet engined passenger aircraft. Holding the German aeronautical engineers in a village north of Moscow made less sense once the decision had been taken to lift the ban on aircraft manufacture in East Germany with effect from 1955. In 1954 Brunolf Baade relocated back to East Germany and joined the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) / '). By June 1954 the last of the German engineers had been repatriated back to Germany or Austria. =Back in the GDR= After returning the German Democratic Republic with Soviet assent to the passenger jet promised, Brunolf Baade was given responsibility for developing and producing what now came to be known as the 152. In terms of stealing a march on the west, political support from the national leadership was enthusiastic, but sources written with the benefit hindsight nevertheless surmise that Baade had underestimated the challenges. When his 300 aeronautical engineers arrived back from the Soviet Union, there was not even space to accommodate them. There was no longer any infrastructure to support an aeronautical industry in terms of a supply chain, and although there was plenty of available enthusiasm, there was no experienced labour pool from which to draw workers. High wages in West Germany and elsewhere were sucking the country dry of its skilled workforce. A survey in 1956 found that only 11% of the specialist workers engaged on the project had worked in aeronautics the last time Germany had had an industry, before 1945. In respect of the development work already undertaken in the Soviet Union, Baade no longer had access to the Soviet test pilots who had been permitted to fly the earlier military versions of the plane. He had been forced to leave key technical documentation behind, and never passed over: it was never entirely clear whether this resulted from overlapping bureaucratic structures in the Soviet system or from some high level decision. Nevertheless, Baade's connections in the Soviet Union meant that where key components could not be obtained in East Germany, they would be delivered from the Soviet Union. Finance was found for the construction of a new development centre at a former Luftwaffe airfield at Klotzsche on the edge of Dresden and work began on recruitment and training of the necessary workforce. Meanwhile, developments to the west of what had come to be known as the Iron Curtain, such as the prototype maiden flights of the Comet (1949), Boeing 367-80 (1954) and Caravelle (1955) led Baade's team to distance the 152 further from its bomber origins, increasing the seating capacity, fracture load factor and (marginally) maximum speed without changing the basic architecture of the design or significantly increasing its weight. Time-line slippage was inevitable and it became clear that a critical constraint would be development of the Pirna 014 engines. In order to secure continued funding and political support, Baade was committed to a 1958 launch, but when the 152 appeared outside the hangar at Klotzsche for its high-profile \\"roll-out\\" in April 1958, the \\"152-V1\\", it did so without engines. A 35-minute first flight was achieved for December 1958 when the prototype was powered not by the Pirna engines designed for the purpose, but by Soviet built Tumansky RD-9 engines, for which the controls and fuel feed components had been adapted. A second flight took place in March 1959, still with the Soviet engines, in order to pass low over the prestigious Leipzig Trade Fair and provide photo-opportunities, but on this occasion the engines stalled and \\"152-V1\\" crashed while descending towards the Klotzsche airfield, as it rehearsed for the public demonstration scheduled to take place half an hour later. The four people on-board were killed and the accident was attributed to pilot error. Much later, more considered verdicts concur around the suspicion that the engines were starved because of issues involving the fuel feed system and/or the 16 rubber fuel bladders positioned in the wings. Aircraft development at the Dresden facility and Pirna engine plant ended formally in 1961. In March 1961 Baade became director of the newly founded Institute for Lightweight construction and the economical use of Materials (IfL), based in Dresden-Klotzsche. He had previously held a position, since 1955, as a lecturer at what was at the time the Faculty for Aeronautical Engineering at the Dresden University of Technology. =Death= Brunolf Baade retired from the Institute when he reached 65, in March 1969. He died on 5 November 1969 in a Berlin hospital or in Dresden, from complications caused by stomach cancer. He is buried at Eichwalde on the edge of Berlin. At least one source indicates that he had never recovered his full health after returning from the Soviet Union in 1954. There is some consensus between the sources that Baade's real brilliance lay not so much in his engineering talents as in his personal gifts as a political and institutional fixer. He was an imposing man, capable of great achievements when supported by good technicians and economists.

Early life Aksella Luts was born Aksella Hildegard Kapsta in Moscow to Estonian parents Maria Kapsta (n√©e Mark) and Martin Kapsta. She was the middle child of three siblings; her sister Erica Regina was born in 1903 and her brother Alfred was born in 1911.Estonian World Review 10 January 2005 The family returned to Estonia when she was quite young. She attended secondary school in Tartu, graduating in 1924 before attending dance classes in Tartu and then the Union des Professeurs de Danse de France (UDPDF) in Paris, where she studied modern dance. She married Estonian future filmmaker Theodor Luts (younger brother of writer Oskar Luts) at age 19 and the two opened a dance studio in Tartu. Film In 1927, Theodor Luts founded Tartu Filmi√ºhing (Tartu Film Society) and using the knowledge he had gained from filmmakers in Paris and Berlin, the couple began writing the script for the patriotic silent film Noored kotkad (Young Eagles), which was Estonia's first feature-length dramatic historical film. It was financed through a bank loan.Postimees: H√ºvasti, imeline Aksella! 11 January 2005 The film was a dramatic telling of the Estonian War of Independence of 1918-1920 and was filmed in Tartu, Mustvee and V√§rska in the summer of 1927. Theodor directed, acted as cinematographer and had several small roles in the film. Aksella appeared in the film as an actress and was the film's make up artist.Ekspress.ee archive. September 1996 Noored kotkad is generally regarded as the cornerstone of Estonian cinema.Culture And Customs of the Baltic States By Kevin O'Connor After Theodor made several silent film nature and cultural documentaries for Eesti Kultuurfilm, the couple would co- write the script for the 1932 melodrama P√§ikese lapsed (The Children of the Sun). The film would be Estonia's first feature-length Estonian language sound film; it was co-produced by Erkki Karu of Finland's Suomi-Filmi and Theodor Lutsu Filmiproduktsioon. Theodor would again direct and Aksella would choreograph a dance routine, while Estonian actor Ants Eskola would have a starring role.Eesti filmi andmebaas (in Estonian) Travel abroad In 1938, Theodor and Aksella moved to Helsinki, Finland, where Theodor hoped to further his education. From 1938 until 1944, Aksella worked as screenwriter for Fenno- Filmi OY under the masculine pen name Antti Metsalu. Many of her scripts from the era were anti-Soviet in nature. In 1944, the couple moved to Stockholm, Sweden, where Aksella worked as a librarian and archivist at the Folk Universitetet. Following World War II and the annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union, they relocated to the city of S√£o Louren√ßo near S√£o Paulo in the South Region of Brazil.Eesti filmi andmebaas: Theodor Luts. 13 June 2007 (in Estonian) In Brazil, the couple made a permanent home. Aksella Luts worked primarily with her husband at his new film company Theodor Lutsu firma as a screenwriter, author of manuscripts, cameraman's assistant, film editor and photojournalist. She was a founding member and secretary of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church in S√£o Paulo (EELK S√£o Paulo Kogudus), worked as a librarian at the Estonian-Brazilian New Cultural Association (Eesti-Brasiilia Kultuuri√ºhing Uus), worked as a film editor at Milo Harbichi Films, and was made an Honorary Member of the Academia de Ci√™ncias e Letras de S√£o Louren√ßo for the introduction of Estonian culture to Brazil. Later years Following the death of Theodor Luts on 24 September 1980, Aksella remained in Brazil until 1996, when she returned to Estonia and settled in P√§rnu. She gave frequent television and radio interviews and was made an Honorary Member of Eesti Kinoliit (Estonian Filmmaker's Association). She died in P√§rnu in 2005, aged 99, and was cremated.

Early Baseball Career A native of Nagasaki, Taiga started playing softball in 2nd grade all the way to junior high school. He joined Kaisei High School's baseball club but his team never made it to Koshien. Upon entering Komazawa University, he participated in the Tohto University League games as an outfielder, and won the League Best Nine Award thrice. Together with current Tigers teammate Ryutaro Umeno, they played in the 2013 Japan-USA University Baseball Championship, where Japan won the 5-game series 3-2. In the autumn of his senior year, he batted 0.357 and led his team to its first league championship since 2001. He recorded a total of 11 home runs in his university career. Hanshin Tigers He was the Tiger's 3rd pick in the 2014 annual professional baseball draft. On November 26, he signed a contract for an annual salary of 10 million yen, plus a signing bonus of 60 million. He was assigned the jersey number 25, formerly owned by his Komadai senior, Takahiro Arai (now with the Hiroshima Carps). 2015 During the February spring camp in Okinawa, he showed early promise by hitting relatively well during batting practice sessions and intra-squad games. He even went 4-for-5 during a practice game with the KBO's Samsung Lions. He continued his productive streak, and eventually made it to the starting roster for the pre- season exhibition games. On March 4, he hit a 2-run homerun off Softbank's Kenji Otonari, and became the first Hanshin rookie to hit a home run in an exhibition game since Takashi Toritani in 2004. Fellow rookie Tsuyoshi Ishizaki also recorded the win that day, making them the first Hanshin rookies to record a victory and homerun in an exhibition game since Masashi Fujiwara and Akinobu Okada in 1980. He batted .267 in all of his exhibition game appearances, and earned himself a spot in the main squad's opening day roster. He decided to skip his university graduation ceremonies in order to attend the season opener, and witnessed the Tigers notch their first victory for the season, and first opening day walk-off win in 74 years. He first appeared as a pinch hitter on the 7th inning of the April 2 match against the Swallows, where he got hit by a wild pitch by Tetsuya Yamamoto. He made it to the starting line up 3 days later, but still failed to record a hit. His first hit came from Baystar's Shoichi Ino on April 8, but he again went hitless on his next start which prompted management to take him off the active roster on April 13. Despite the demotion, he got his rhythm back in the farm games and was once again called up to the main squad on the 23rd. On his next start, he cracked a 3-run home run off Swallow's Yoshihisa Naruse on his first at-bat. The home run - his first official one, helped Hanshin take two straight wins during an early season slump. ‚ÄúMy first hit came at Koshien and I wanted to get my first home run at Koshien too,‚Äù he said, as he recalled connecting on Naruse‚Äôs 0-1 slider on a drive to left-center. ‚ÄúI swung at the first pitch but was a little tight, so I relaxed and had a nice compact swing on the second pitch.‚Äù On July 24, he homered in his second straight game and became the first rookie in franchise history to accomplish the feat since Akinobu Okada in 1980. Two days later, he notched his first career modasho(3 hits in a game) against Yokohama and became the first rookie to accomplish the feat since Shunsuke Fujikawa in 2010. Playing Style During his university years, Egoshi was known for his slugging power and speed (5.8 seconds for a 50-meter dash). His throwing arm can also be relied upon for defense in the outfield. Eventually, he became known as the triple three right-handed slugger (batted above 30%, hit 30 homers since high school, and stole 30 bases).

They later moved to New York City. Although influenced more by new romantic and Britpop music, Soviet was one of several Electropop artists who surfaced in the late 1990s that popularized the sound New York promoter and DJ Larry Tee coined as electroclash. The longest standing core member lineup consists of vocalist and songwriter Keith Ruggiero, and keyboardists Christopher Otchy, Amanda Lynn Berkowitz, and Greg Kochan.  History  =Formation (1995-1999)= The band began in 1995 while Keith Ruggierio attended Syracuse University as a film student. Having long been fascinated with the electronic new wave sound made popular by groups like China Crisis, Human League, Talk Talk, Ultravox, Gary Numan, and OMD, he set out to make music in this vein. It was difficult for him to find a band with similar interests, and so he began writing songs and recording on a Tascam 4-track tape machine with a few analog synthesizers he was able to acquire cheaply. He began to create demos, which he circulated to several friends. A mutual friend gave a demo to Christopher Otchy, who was also attending Syracuse University, and the two began to talk about forming a band. Ruggiero then recruited Adam Hughes and Ian Scheller on synthesizers and drums respectively, and the band began practicing. They began to play at parties and rock venues throughout the area, notably the Starlight Ballroom, Styleens, Planet 505, Shrine Student Center, and the Senior block party where immediately after they performed a riot erupted. The demos recorded at this time were collected into a rough debut album, . The name Soviet was derived from Ruggiero's fondness for old Russian filmmakers such as Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Vertov who he became familiar with in his film studies. Ruggiero saw a similarity between the way these Soviet filmmakers edited film and the way he constructed his own electronic music, cutting up sounds, building a library, and then using them to tell his own musical story. =Early Success (2000-2001)= Soviet performing in January, 2002. After graduating from Syracuse, the band began playing shows in New York City and met some success there. Being an electronic act with a full band, they were versatile enough to play both traditional rock venues and dance clubs. Soviet entered talks with several potential producers and labels to help record, release and distribute their first album. Among those they spoke with were Shadow Morton and Larry Tee, but an agreement could not be reached. Regarding being courted by major labels, Ruggiero would say, \\"I want people to share our vision rather than tell us what our vision is.‚Äù In the end, the band self-produced in a studio built by Ruggiero himself in Shelton, Connecticut. It was in this studio that he refined his sound, amassed more synthesizers, and recorded Soviet‚Äôs first official release, We are Eyes, We are Builders. The album name was taken from the Russian filmmaker, Dziga Vertov, whose theory of the kino eye influenced Ruggiero whilst in film school. In Ruggiero‚Äôs words, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the act of observation which leads to a new vision on creation whether it be through art, music, painting, etc.‚Äù In 2001, the California imprint, Plastiq Musiq agreed to release the album. The album was released in the UK the following year by Mogul Electro. When Plastiq Musiq went bankrupt in 2002, We are Eyes was re-released in the US by Mogul Electro with a different album art, a different track order, and the addition of guitar on a number of the tracks by Kenan Gunduz. =Touring (2000-2002)= The band Soviet performing in Boston, April 7, 2002. Soviet became quite well known for their live shows, as they performed electronic music in the same way a rock band did‚Äîi.e., most of the parts were performed live as opposed to using all pre-recorded or pre-programmed sounds. This style of performing gained them a following. The band went on several nationwide tours, performing with acts such as Add N to X, Stereo Total, The Killers, Fischerspooner, Peaches, The Faint, Adult. and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. In August 2003, they held a residency at Spaceland in Los Angeles. Between tours the band began to record what would become their second studio album, Spies in the House of Love. =Los Angeles (2003)= After touring the US and Canada for 2 years, the strain of being on the road wore on the band. The Electroclash movement was slowing as the most popular bands, such as Fischerspooner and Ladytron struggled with waning audience interest. The band began to lose momentum, and Ruggiero wished to take the music and his career in new directions. In late 2003, he moved to Los Angeles to find work as a commercial composer and sound designer. In L.A., Ruggiero finished the Spies album under the guidance of seasoned producer and The Pulsars band member, Dave Trumfio, who also mixed the album. The album was released under Ruggiero's label, Soundsred in 2004. =Post-Soviet (2003-2014)= Ruggiero‚Äôs first solo output was a series of soundtracks entitled Moving Pictures. It was released in 2005. It was also during this time that Ruggiero met director Trevin Matcek, with whom he found a shared taste of music and film.(12) Ruggiero agreed to score Matcek's sci-fi film, \\"Life Begins At Rewirement.\\" About the soundtrack composed by Ruggiero, Matcek remarked, \\"The result is synthetic, but never artificial. It's warm and earnest, with a layer of loneliness just below the surface. Keith summed up the feeling it creates with a single word: chills.\\" Ruggiero also scored Bot and Dolly‚Äôs motion projection epic BOX, Ken Block‚Äôs Gymkhana series 4-7‚Äù, and a short film entitled The Chamber for the Vimeo/Samsung connected series. =Reunion and Ghosts (2015- present)= While working on the Life Begins at Rewirement film, Ruggiero was inspired to create a new album of music under the Soviet name. He recorded the Ghosts album in Los Angeles 2014-2015. The album was also produced by Dave Trumfio and was released by Rosso Corsa recordings.http://rossocorsarecords.com/artists/soviet/  Musical Style and Influences  Soviet has used and continues to incorporate many analog synthesizers to create their music. Ruggiero was initially inspired to use them as they featured prominently in the music of his idols. Once he started using them, he realized the instruments had ‚Äúendless possibilities.‚Äù Ruggiero has admitted to being influenced by multiple artists and producers, including Steve Lillywhite, Brian Eno, John Leckie, Stephin Street, Hugh Jones, and Kraftwerk. Their style has been described as \\"smooth and curvy pop songs,\\" \\"combining the straight-ahead synth sound of Depeche Mode with the hooks of Disintegration-era Cure.\\" Ruggiero's vocal and lyrical style has been described as \\"earnest in melody and lyrics...
