S√∏ltoft plays a 17-year-old high school student who discovers the youthful excesses of sexual desire during his summer vacation in 1913. Based upon the semi-autobiographical 1953 novel by Carl Erik Soya, Sytten was a financial success for the Palladium Film company and ushered in a wave of erotic films such as the Bedside-films and Zodiac-films, most of which starred S√∏ltoft.Nissen, Dan, 100 √Örs Dansk Film, Rosinante, (2001) 445 pg, p232 Plot In the summer of 1913, 17-year-old Jacob (Ole Soltoft), a Danish high school student, lives in the frustrating limbo between boyhood and manhood. He worries about his excessive focus on masturbation and, although he is aware of the sexual overtures by the housemaid Sophie (Lise Rosendahl), Jacob doesn't know how to respond to her. Jacob is invited to spend his vacation at the summer house of his wealthy uncle (Ole Monty). At the summer house in an idyllic coastal town, Jacob meets his uncle, aunt (Bodil Steen), free-spirited housemaid Hansigne (Susanne Heinrich), virginal housekeeper Rosegod (Lily Broberg), and his dream-girl cousin Vibeke (Ghita N√∏rby). He is also pursued by his Uncle's employee (Ingolf David), who tries to seduce Jacob. While the Uncle is off on a fishing trip and the Aunt spends the night in town with her lover, Jacob has his first sexual experience with Vibeke‚Äîan awkward encounter. Afterwards, when Vibeke leaves for school, Jacob spends his nights with Hansigne‚Äîa joyful, uncomplicated and liberated woman. She guides him through his awkwardness and teaches him erotic techniques. One night, Hansigne's boyfriend Knud (Hugo Herrestrup) catches them together and attacks and threatens Jacob. Jacob discovers he finally feels like a man. In great spirits, he returns home after vacation and prepares to accept the advances of Sophie. Cast *Ole S√∏ltoft as Jacob Petersen, a 17-year-old searching for sexual experience. The role was a break-out performance for the 23-year-old S√∏ltoft. Although he tried a few serious roles, he was quickly typecast in comedic sex romps. Through the late-60s and 70s, he went on to star in a successful series of Danish sex comedies before retiring from film in 1978. *Ghita N√∏rby as Vibeke *Emil Hass Christensen as Professor Petersen *Ole Monty as Jacob's Uncle *Bodil Steen as Jacob's Aunt *Lily Broberg as Mrs. Rosegod *Arthur Jensen as Kondukt√∏ren *Henry Nielsen as Stationsforstanderen *Annie Birgit Garde as Girl on Train *Susanne Heinrich as Hansigne *Ingolf David as Pharmacist *J√∏rgen Kiil as Dr. Irving Mogensen *Hugo Herrestrup as Knud *Lise Rosendahl as Sophie *Jytte Abildstr√∏m as Mrs. Steinkop  Reaction  Although Sytten was one of the first mainstream films in Denmark dealing with explicit nudity and sex (along with ' and I, a Woman), the film provoked little controversy within the country.Skretting, Katherine, Filmsex und Filmzensur Die \\"Bettkanten\\"-Filme in Skandinavien 1970-1976, Montage AV, Issue 9/1, (2000) p49-50 It had been more than ten years since the Danish public was indignant over the publication of Soya's novel as well as other controversial novels by Henry Miller and Agnar Mykle. By 1965, Danish attitudes had changed.Kutchinsky, Berl Pornography, Crime and Public Policy, AIC conference proceedings, Australian Institute of Criminology, 1990-1996, ISSN 1034-5086 In 1964, the state prosecutor had brought a pro forma obscenity case against the publishers of a new translation of Fanny Hill which ended in acquittal.Barbano, Nicolas, Sagen on Fanny Hill, Thanning & Appel, 1965. Two years later, Denmark's laws against pornographic literature were repealed, and, in 1969, pictorial pornography was also decriminalized. Reaction outside of Denmark was different and viewings were limited. In the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) refused to certify Sytten for viewing in standard cinemas. However, the final decision is always left to individual local authorities (which normally follow the BBFC's decisions). Only in London, the Greater London Council permitted showings under an X-rating (for individuals aged 16 or over, at that time). The film became an enormous box office success in Denmark, achieving a record profit of 3 million Danish kroner for the Palladium film studio. Palladium followed it the next year with a more serious work, Soya's Tagsten, also based upon a novel by Soya, however this film was a financial failure. After a few more attempts at more serious erotic films, Palladium finally discovered the correct formula was sex comedies with Ole S√∏ltoft in the lead, such as Mazurka p√• sengekanten,. The film was the final production by Palladium, but it was another box-office hit, had many sequels and continued the wave of erotic comedies.

On 1 December 1970, President Luis Echeverr√≠a appointed him Secretary of Foreign Affairs. He oversaw a period of intense diplomatic activity, during which Mexico doubled (from 67 to 129) the number of countries with which it maintained diplomatic relations, particularly among the nations of the Third World and the Non- Aligned Movement. During Rabasa's time at the foreign ministry, Mexico refused to impose OAS-led sanctions on Castro's Cuba and admitted a flood of political refugees from Pinochet's Chile.

BiographyEarly life= Azem Bejta was born in the village of Galica (medieval Kalica) in the Vushtrri town of the Kosovo Vilayet, Ottoman Empire. He was the son of Bejta Galica, a patriot who died fighting against the Ottoman Empire and for Albania's separation from the Serbian state. Azem followed his father, and first fought against the Kingdom of Serbia in 1912. =Resistance against Serbia= Azem Galica was one of the leaders of armed resistance to Serbian rule in Kosovo in the years 1912-1914. With his Kacak fighters, he resisted Serbian forces that invaded Kosovo during the Balkan Wars and early in World War I. In the winter of 1915‚Äì16, during World War I, Kosovo saw the Serbian army retreat when Kosovo was occupied by Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary. =Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary= In 1915, after the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Kosovo following the rout of the Serbians, Azem Galica began an armed resistance against the new invaders. However, after persuasion by Luigj Gurakuqi, Prenk Bib Doda and Fejzi Alizoti, as well as the opening of 300 Albanian schools, the right to fly the Albanian flag, and assurances that the Austrians would respect the customs of the country, the Albanian language, and both the Christian and Muslim religions, Azem Galica accepted the Austrian occupation. In 1918, the Serbian Army pushed the Central Powers out of Kosovo. After World War I ended, Kosovo found itself in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians (later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) on 1 December 1918. Galica again became an outlaw, fighting again the soldiers and police of the King. =Resistance against Yugoslavia= Disaffected Kosovar Albanians, who had rallied around Hasan Prishtina, formed a 'Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo' in Shkoder in 1918, their main demand being the unification of Kosovo with Albania. The best known of the Kachak leaders were Bajram Curri, Hasan Prishtina and Azem Galica. A general revolt started, known as the Kachak (outlaw) movement, led by Azem Galica, against the incorporation of Kosovo into Yugoslavia. Fighting blew up in Drenica, Azem Galica's home territory. It was estimated that there were 10,000 active rebels at this time. His wife Qerime Radisheva, known as Shota Galica, fought alongside Azem Galica. They succeeded in creating a \\"free zone\\" in Galica (Azem's hometown) and 3 villages around, called \\"Arberia e Vogel\\" (little Arberia). The Yugoslav kingdom, however, had no intention of letting this zone survive, and with superior fire power and troop numbers they moved into Drenica. They succeeded in wounding Azem who later died from his wounds. His last wish was for his body not to be found by the Serbs, and thus he was buried in a deep cave somewhere near Drenica. He died on July 15, 1924. =Aftermath= The death of Galica dealt a mortal blow to the armed resistance against Yugoslav military presence in Kosovo, which he had led for the past eight years. The Yugoslavs intensified their repression of the Albanian movement in Kosovo. Apart from some small groups which were never subdued, the end of the major Kacak resistance came when Yugoslav government helped Ahmed Zogu to return to power in Tirana in December 1924, in exchange for his suppressing the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo. Legacy As national heroes, Azem and Shota Galica epitomized the Albanian Kosovar resistance. The Albanians gave these fighters for a national cause a rightful place in history, celebrating them as martyrs for the nation. Their sacrifice was seen as integral to the national effort to free Kosovo from Serbian rule. In the long term, the killing of the Galicas and of many others stimulated, and set an example of, Albanian resistance against repression and inequality in Kosovo.

Born in The Corran, County Antrim, Ireland, the son of Malcolm McNeill, his mother was the sister of Duncan McNeill, 1st Baron Colonsay. McNeill was educated Wimbledon, Surrey, England and at Trinity College, Dublin. A lawyer, he was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the Ontario electoral district of Bruce North in the 1882 federal election. A Liberal- Conservative, he was re-elected in 1887, 1891, 1896, and 1900. His election in 1900 was overturned in 1901 and he did not run in the by-election held later that year. He was defeated in his attempt to regain a seat in parliament in the 1908 election. In 1872 Alexander married his recently widowed second cousin, Hester. Alexander and Hester immigrated to Canada and settled on a fram in Elderslie township, County of Bruce which had been his brother inlaws - John McNeill. From 1872 to 1881 they remained in Elderslie Township. Their only son was born in 1874, named Malcolm (Junior). Alexander McNeill purchased 300 acres north of Wiarton and called it, The Corran (which means land running into the sea - named after his birthplace in Ireland). In 1882 the extension of the rail service came to Wiarton and construction of the 17 room manor began. In 1890, Hester McNeill died before the Corran was totally complete. Hester was the driving force behind the construction of the Corran. Alexander was devastated. Subsequently, Alexander contacted a friend in England, Alfred Lewis, and asked him to move to Canada to help him with the Corran. Alfred, his wife and 2 girls moved to the Corran where he became the manager of the estate. Three acres of gardens were designed and planted with the highlight of the gardens being 500 rose bushes and the black rose from Ireland. Many beds of peonies and 500 fruit trees were planted. Alexander also operated a successful cattle farm, \\"Durham Shorthorns from England\\" which contributed to the Canadian cattle breeding. Other buildings on the estate besides the house and barn: ice storage building, a power generating building and two cottages. One cottage was the home of Mr. Lewis and his family. Dominion Day 1901, a long line of carriages paraded down the main street of Wiarton and up the steep hill to the great stone gates where the coachmen turned their carriages right to the Corran. People came from throughout Ontario, the rich, the politicians and gentry to spend a day amongst the roses and peonies with the music of violins filling the air. In 1931, Alfred Lewis was killed in the first auto hit and run fatality on the Bruce Peninsula. Alexander McNeill never recovered from the shock of Alfred's death. In the following year April 18, 1932 Alexander died. The Estate was left to his son Malcolm (who never married). Malcolm, who continued to live on the property, except for the years when he fought in the Great War. Malcolm was a generous man who was left with money and a large, sprawling estate. But life was too much and Malcolm's fortune dwindled away. Malcolm sold 20 acres of land for back taxes. In 1956, Malcolm died and the Corran was left to Sally Simmons, Malcolm's faithful housekeeper of 20 years. Sally tried to keep the house, but it was beyond her ability to keep it as Malcolm had a few outstanding debts. After closing off most of the house and living in the kitchen, she was coaxed into leaving the Corran. In 1960 the Corran was sold to a gentleman in Willowdale. But by 1964, every window, door, lightfixture was destroyed. In 1971, the Corran was purchased by Grey Sauble Conservation but vandalism and looting continued until 1976 vandals set fire to the Corran. Today, the walls of the Corran are still standing high on the Niagara Escarpment looking down on Colpoy's Bay north of Wiarton and is known as McNeill Estate & Spirit Rock Conservation Area, owned by Grey Sauble Conservation. www.greysauble.on.ca.

Nevertheless, by April 1934 the network had identified \\"fascist\\" movements in 39 countries, including all European countries except Yugoslavia, as well as the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, five countries in Asia and six in Latin America.

TIME Magazine, 31 December 1934 The conference in Montreux occurred only six months after the assassination of the Austrofascist Austrian chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss by Nazi agents and the resulting diplomatic crisis between Italy and Germany. Likewise, Mussolini did not allow any official representative of the Italian Fascist Party to attend the meeting, ostensibly in order to see what the conference could achieve before lending full official support. Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, while allowing members of the Falange to participate, stated that the Falange as an organisation would not be represented, as the CAUR was \\"not a Fascist movement\\".Payne, Stanley G. \\"Fascist Italy and Spain, 1922‚Äì1945\\". Spain and the Mediterranean Since 1898, Raanan Rein, ed. page 106. London, 1999 Other notable absences included the Austrian Ernst Rudiger von Starhemberg and any representatives from the British Union of Fascists.  Proceedings  From the outset, the conference was marred by serious conflicts between the participants. Coselschi, acting as President of the Conference, clashed with Quisling over the importance of Nazi Germany to international fascism. Mo»õa, supported by the Danish and Swiss delegates, likewise created a rift by underlining the centrality of anti-Semitism to fascist movements, a move opposed by Coselschi and O'Duffy. The Romanian Iron Guard stressed the need for race to be an integral component of fascism.Morgan, Philip. Fascism in Europe, 1919‚Äì1945. London, UK; New York, USA: Routledge, 2003. Pp. 169-170. On the matter of anti-Semitism, several compromise resolutions were adopted. These declared that \\"the Jewish question cannot be converted into a universal campaign of hatred against the Jews\\" while also stating, \\"Considering that in many places certain groups of Jews are installed in conquered countries, exercising in an open and occult manner an influence injurious to the material and moral interests of the country which harbors them, constituting a sort of state within a state, profiting by all benefits and refusing all duties, considering that they have furnished and are inclined to furnish, elements conducive to international revolution which would be destructive to the idea of patriotism and Christian civilisation, the Conference denounces the nefarious action of these elements and is ready to combat them.\\". The delegates at the conference also unanimously declared their opposition to communist movements and the Third International.  Results  A second and final conference was held in Montreux in April 1935. Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera made a brief appearance at this conference, using the opportunity to express sympathies with the movement while stating that Spain was not ready to participate in any venture of international fascism because his movement was estrictamente nacional (strictly national).Payne, Stanley G. \\"Fascist Italy and Spain, 1922‚Äì1945\\". Spain and the Mediterranean Since 1898, Raanan Rein, ed. page 107.

The museum is located in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California and is open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. every Sunday weather permitting. In 1956, all of the model locomotives were steam-powered, hence the name \\"Live Steamers\\". Over the years, gasoline-powered models of diesel locomotives and battery-electric locomotives and trolleys have also become popular. The museum operates a gauge miniature railway on which these locomotives pull trains that the public can ride. The museum also has multiple smaller gauge railroad layouts for members usage in 4.75\\" gauge, 3.5\\" gauge, elevated 1 gauge, and g-scale. In addition to live steam layouts, the museum also operates a stationary 19th century steam plant every 3rd Sunday with a variety of vintage restored steam appliances. The museum hosts two live steam gatherings per year for visiting live steam hobbyists, the Spring Meet on Memorial Day Weekend in May and the Fall Meet on the first weekend of October. The museum has also hosted a number themed fundraisers and charity events over the years for Halloween, City of Hope, PADRES Contra el Cancer, and many organizations. The museum also hosts exhibits related to Walt Disney and his passion for trains, including a full-size barn once located on the ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad in his backyard. The Carolwood Society, a separate entity from the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum, provides volunteers to host the Disney-related exhibits. Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn is referred to by the Carolwood Society as \\"the only free Disney attraction in the world\\". History By 1956, the live steam hobby had gained enough popularity among machinists and craftsmen in the Los Angeles area that a movement was begun to form a new local club. For many months, the group sought out several different locations to no avail. By mid-1956, the group attracted the interest of Charley Atkins, who was at the time the director of the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks and was looking for an accompanying attraction for the neighboring Travel Town Museum which he had helped establish several years prior. By October 1956, both parties had agreed on a location situated on a former floodplain, and the area was leveled with decomposed granite. Starting in 1957, the group installed elevated turntable steaming bays for 7.5\\" gauge and the smaller 4.75\\" and 3.5\\" gauges, then laid two concentric ovals of track. Prior to the construction of Zoo Drive and the Ventura Freeway in the 1960s, Crystal Springs Drive was the primary road through the area in what now forms the museum's member access driveway. In addition, the perimeter of the museum was encircled by the narrow gauge Crystal Springs & Cahuenga Valley Railroad operated by Travel Town Museum utilizing former Oahu Railway and Land Company equipment. There was no perimeter fencing in the first decade of operation, so the public was free to wander the grounds and ask generous engineers for rides. By 1960, the attraction had become so popular that a formal station had to be established for riders to queue in and a perimeter fence added. Old Sherwood Station, named after charter member and longtime museum art director Gordon Sherwood, became a loading area for all three gauges until 1965 when Sutchville Station was established for public loading on the 7.5\\" gauge only. Sutchville Station was named after charter member Buss Sutch who was also instrumental in the early years of the museum. By 1965, the railroad had many sidings and longer eastern loops for both the 7.5\\" and 4.75\\" gauges with some short bridges. It was also around this same time that famed charter member Walt Disney shortly before passing donated the tracks from his former Carolwood Pacific Railroad to the museum to form the Disney Loop extension. In 1968, a huge mudslide blocked Crystal Springs Drive and part of the Disney Loop which was cleaned up and would eventually form the grade for the Mountain Division. The railroad would undergo tremendous expansion in the 1980s after the former Crystal Springs Drive right of way would become the High Line route of the West End. Starting in the east end with the construction of a 200-foot trestle and driveway crossing in 1981, the expansion entailed constructing an additional three tunnels and four bridges, culminating with the crane installation of the massive O'Brien-Moore Bridge in 1983. During the 1990s, extensive rail wear from public hauling led the club to switch from aluminum to steel rail. In 1995, a landslide in the West End caused the original Eucalyptus Canyon route to be phased out in favor of the current routing. Also during this time period, public loading operations were moved from Sutchville Station to New Sherwood Station for better crowd control. Shortly thereafter, a new g-scale layout was added adjacent to New Sherwood Station for members usage and to entertain riders exiting the station. Several improvements to safety were made in the early 2000s with the introduction of straddle-type bench cars instead of gondolas for public riders, as well as right-of-way improvements. In 2002, members constructed and opened the Smith Valley line designed as a lower alternate route to the High Line. From 2006-2007, the tracks comprising Webb Yard and Sutchville Station were updated extensively with more sidings and improved traffic flow. As a result, the 50th Anniversary Spring Meet was rescheduled from 2006 to 2007 along with the Fall Meet. From 2010-2012, a new station building was constructed to house a new ticket booth and ADA-accessible restroom facilities for public riders at New Sherwood Station. During the summer of 2014, the West End of the railroad was shut down temporarily for tunnel work as part of the LADWP Headworks Reservoir pipeline project. In 2016, the museum celebrated its 60th anniversary by hosting a special Spring Meet and commemorating a new 1 gauge elevated live steam layout. Signaling Since the 1980s, the track has gained a comprehensive signal system based on Automatic Block Signaling for maintaining safe separation between trains and route indication. The layout has more than 80 electronic signal blocks and 50 motorized turnouts and was extensively used for bidirectional operations from 1995-2005. In addition, the layout utilizes a restored Wigwag (railroad) crossing signal and has a replica 19th century highball signal on display. Facilities The museum has more than 1.5 miles of 7.5\\" gauge track covering an assortment of different routes. Since 2007, public operations have been largely limited to the High Line on the West End and the Mountain Division on the East End. While New Sherwood Station is only used for public boarding, Sutchville Station and Old Sherwood Station are still used for member boarding and private events. There are several large yards, sidings, turntables, transfer tables, and reversing tracks for trains on the layout. In addition, the museum also has extensive loading, maintenance, and storage facilities for members trains. Over the years, the museum has brought in several historical pieces of full-size rolling stock renovated for use as museum offices and meeting rooms. There are three cabooses originally built for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Texas and New Orleans Railroad, and Union Pacific Railroad, as well as two streamlined Union Pacific passenger cars that saw service on the City of Los Angeles (train). The 4.75\\" and 3.5\\" gauges are configured in a ground level shared dual-gauge format. Two loops make up the current layout with three yards, a turntable, roundhouse, transfer table, and elevated steaming area. In 2016, members begun a massive multi-year extension of the existing 4.75\\" gauge layout starting with the installation of over 1000 feet of new track in the West End along the Smith Valley route. Locomotives In addition to the numerous privately owned consists operated by members, the museum maintains several locomotives for public hauling by qualified members. Currently, the club has 4 operational diesels which use gasoline-hydraulic and battery- electric propulsion, and an oil-fired 3.75\\" scale 2-4-4T Forney built by RMI Railworks in 2008. Disney-related exhibits Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn, his personal workshop building and creative space for his miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad, was loaned to the City of Los Angeles by the Walt Disney Family Foundation in 1999. The barn is located within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex. Complimentary public admission to these exhibits is available on the third Sunday of each month from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., which coincides with demonstrations of the stationary steam plant. The barn is referred to by the Carolwood Society as \\"the only free Disney attraction in the world\\". The barn has an extensive collection of Disney and steam-train-related memorabilia. During the times when it is open to the public, Carolwood Society volunteers are available to answer questions, provide informal tours, and describe displays about the intimate relationship Walt Disney had with railroading. The Disneyland Railroad combine car is on display adjacent to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn. In addition to the items on display inside the barn, the combine car from the Disneyland Railroad's original Retlaw 1 passenger train, and a miniature train station once owned by Disney animator Ollie Johnston, are on display adjacent to the barn. A surviving locomotive and two train cars from the former Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland Disneyland attraction will also be displayed next to the barn after they are restored by the Carolwood Foundation. Special guests The Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum has had many special guests make appearances; mainly Disney Legends who meet with fans and talk about their experiences with Walt Disney. Such notable people have included Bobby Burgess, Margaret Kerry (the live-action model for Tinker Bell), Floyd Norman, and Disney Imagineers such as Tony Baxter, Rolly Crump, and Alice Davis.

History The Desert Patrol was formed as a semi-independent part of the Arab Legion in February 1931 by Glubb Pasha to secure Transjordan's desert region of the country, effectively everything east of the cultivated area that formed Trans-Jordan‚Äôs western border with Palestine. The patrol replaced the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force in the desert. Initially it had 20 men in four trucks with Lewis and Vickers machine guns. Additional men were located in small forts throughout the region and relied on camels for mobility. Glubb recruited mainly Bedouins for the Patrol and helped establish strong links between the Bedouin and the monarchy that survive today. The remaining four-fifths of the Arab Legion at this time were police and gendarmerie serving in the cultivated area. Over the next five to ten years, Glubb successfully pacified the tribes. Between 1936 and 1939, forces were expanded in response to threats posed by the Arab Revolt in Palestine and civil disturbances in Syria. The Patrol now consisted of 350 Bedouins organised into two truck mounted companies. The Patrol formed the basis of the Mechanized regiment of the Arab Legion.

Syntax The syntax of PCASTL is derived from programming languages C and R. The source of R version 2.5.1 has been studied to write the grammar and the lexer used in the PCASTL interpreter. =Influences= Like in R, statements can, but do not have to, be separated by semicolons. Like in R, a variable can change type in a session. Like in C and R, PCASTL uses balanced brackets ({ and }) to make blocks. Operators found in PCASTL have the same precedence and associativity as their counterparts in C. for loops are defined like in C. \`++\` and \`--\` operators are used like in C to increment or decrement a variable before or after it is used in its expression. An example of PCASTL using the for reserved word and the \`++\` operator: for (i = 1; i < 4; i++) print(i) Functions and comments in PCASTL are defined like in R: # function definition (comment) a = function() { print(\\"Hello, world!\\") } # function call a() =parent and childset reserved words= Those reserved words can only be written lowercase and will not be recognized otherwise. The parent reserved word gives a reference to the parent node in the syntax tree of the code where the word is placed. In the following code, the parent node is the operator \`=\`. a = parent The variable \\"a\\" will hold a reference to the \`=\` node. The following code shows how to get references to the two child nodes of the operator \`=\` with the childset reserved word. a.childset[0] a.childset[1] To display the value of \\"a\\", some ways are given in this example: a a.childset[0].parent a.childset[1].parent a.childset[0].parent.childset[0].parent # and so on... In the following code: we assign a code segment to the right child of the \`=\` node, we execute the \`=\` node a second time and we call the newly defined function. a.childset[1] = \`function() print(\\"hello\\")' execute(a) a() See also *Abstract syntax tree *Self-modifying code ReferencesExternal links *PCASTL: by Parent and Childset Accessible Syntax Tree Language Category:Free compilers and interpreters Category:Procedural programming languages Category:Articles with example code Category:Programming languages created in 2008 ","title":"PCASTL"},{"id":"17955098","text":"Sequoia Hospital is a hospital in Redwood City, California, US.

Genevi√®ve, Missouri. It is an example of poteaux sur solle (\\"posts-on-sill\\") construction, and is located in the first European settlement in the present-day state of Missouri. The first historic structure in Ste. Genevieve to be authentically restored, the house is a prime example of the traditional French Colonial architecture of the early 18th century in North America and was designated in 1970 as a National Historic Landmark. History Ste. Genevieve was founded in the mid- eighteenth century by French-Canadian settlers, most of whom migrated from villages on the east bank of the Mississippi River, such as Prairie du Rocher, Illinois. Because of repeated flooding from the Mississippi River, with an especially bad occurrence in 1785, they decided to relocate to a higher site further away from the river. In 1792 Louis Bolduc, a successful merchant and trader, who also had lead mines to the west, built a one-story house at the new village site, about three miles north of the first. First to be built in the one-story house was a large \\"keeping room\\", about 26' √ó 27', where the family conducted most of its activities. It has a large fireplace at the north end, and a wide-plank puncheon floor, made of logs cut flat on only one side, with the curved side laid down. Storage for lead, corn and other goods was in the attic above the room. In 1793, Bolduc had the wide hallway and a large sleeping chamber added, the latter also about 26' √ó 27' in size. Historians believe the sleeping chamber had two \\"sleeping cells,\\" areas partially walled off for privacy: one for him and his wife and one shared by their three children. Bolduc had tall windows with glass installed in both large rooms, another mark of his wealth. The walls of the house were built with heavy oak timbers set about six inches apart and infilled with bousillage, a mixture of mud, straw, and horsehair that hardened to a cement-like texture. Sometimes other animal or human hair was added to the mixture. Diagonal timbers on each supporting wall added stability.Carl J. Ekberg and Anton J. Pregaldin, Louis Bolduc: His Family And His House, Tucson, AZ: The Patrice Press, 2002 The steep hip roof, made of cedar shakes, was supported by heavy, hand-hewn Norman trusses held together by mortise and tenon joinery. It extends over the four sides of the house's porches to provide shade and cooling. The house is surrounded by a reconstructed stockade fence typical of the time (to keep out livestock that roamed in the area). Gardens have been reconstructed on the grounds. Located at 123 South Main, the property was owned by Bolduc family descendants until the 1940s. Furnished with pieces typical of the period, today it is operated as a historic house museum. Three items are original to the Bolduc family. The property has been owned since 1949 and operated by The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in the State of Missouri. It was restored in 1956‚Äì1957, under the direction of the architectural historian, Dr. Ernest Allen Connally. As may be seen by a comparison of photos below, the house was restored to show its original colonial style, whose elements were intact under later changes. In 1970 the house was designated a National Historic Landmark. and It is a contributing property in the Ste. Genevieve Historic District, which has National Historic Landmark status.

The film is told from the perspective of a flamenco dance company that will mount a show devoted to the mythical and biblical figure of Salom√©, as a story of love and vengeance. The movie is both about the performance and the preparation for it. Plot The first part of the film is conceived as a documentary and we discover, step-by-step, the whole construction and preparation of the show. A director prepares a troupe of flamenco dancers for a production of the biblical story of Salom√©. He summarizes the story and describes his spring for the drama's action: Salom√©'s attraction to John the Baptist. When the prophet rejects her, she seeks revenge. We are witnessing the working sessions with the musician, the choosing of the costumes. The score composer, set designer, choreographer and costume designer are shown doing their jobs in the part of the stage. We also see the troupe of dancers during rehearsals. We meet the principals. We watch the troupe on rehearsals, and then the performance. The main dancers are presented: Salom√©, King Herod, John the Baptist and Herodias. Each of them tells the story of their beginnings as dancers in childhood. Salom√© overcame a bad case of scoliosis to eventually succeed as a dancer and now she is the director of the Spanish National ballet company. John the Baptist has emigrated from his native Cuba and both Herod and Herodias had to confront initial unwillingness by their parents to allow them to follow a career as dancers. The second part of the film is the production of the stage dance adaptation of Salom√©. It is a lush presentation in a spare stage, colorfully illuminated. We follow the plot. King Herod has married Herodias, his brother's widow. Herod is devoted to his stepdaughter Salom√©. On his birthday celebration, he wants to maker her to dance for him, but she refuses. Herodias encourages her daughter to do so; allowing her daughter to be the lust interest of her husband. However, Salom√© refuses because she is only interested in John the Baptist, whom on the other hand Herod fears. Salom√© tries to seduce the prophet, but his status as a holy man does not let him be carried away by his feelings. Disappointed and frustrated, Salom√© agrees to dance for her stepfather. In a sensual and frantic performance, she takes on the dance of the seven veils. The king, fascinated by the dance, would give Salom√© anything she asks for. He is surprised when Salom√© requests, in defiance, the head of John the Baptist. The king, reluctantly, fulfills her wish. When the head of the saintly man is presented to Salom√© on a tray, she realizes that she is still in love with him. Grief-stricken, Salom√© commits suicide hanging herself.

(2018). Mikkel Hindhede (1862‚Äì1945): A pioneering nutritionist. Journal of Medical Biography 26 (3): 202‚Äì206. Biography Hindhede was the manager of the Danish National Laboratory for Nutrition Research in Frederiksberg in Copenhagen 1910 ‚Äì 32 and food advisor to the Danish government during World War I. On his suggestion, much of the pigs were sold off and the number of cows for dairy was reduced by one third. Alcohol production was also limited. The agricultural food freed that way was used for human consumption. With these measures, not only could famines be completely avoided during the allied blockade in 1917 and 1918, the death rate also sank to the lowest number ever. These results were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1920. Germany had more food per capita, but a larger share was used for animal production, and famine was widespread in 1918. Encouraged by his uncle, the physicist Niels Johannes Fjord at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Hindhede was allowed to study medicine in Copenhagen and graduated with distinction in 1888. After two decades as a general practitioner and hospital doctor in Skanderborg in Jutland, he returned with his family to Copenhagen in 1909, where he lived for the rest of his life. In his research, he studied the protein minimum and showed that earlier estimates of more than 100 grams per day were exaggerated. He recommended more rye bread, potatoes, and vegetables, and less meat. Hindhede Nature Park and Hindhede Quarry in Singapore are named after the elder of his two sons, Jens Hindhede, who was a businessman and tea farmer in Singapore and Malaysia in the 20s and 30s. The younger son was the civil engineer and industrialist Kristian Hindhede. Dieting In 1912, Hindhede showed that humans can live on potatoes.Fitzgerald, Matt. (2014). Diet Cults: The Surprising Fallacy at the Core of Nutrition Fads and Guide to Healthy Eating for the Rest of Us. Pegasus Books. p. 117. One of his laboratory assistants (a young man called Frederik Madsen) agreed to live on potatoes and butter (and sometimes a few apple slices) for almost a year. Hindhede concluded that \\"man can retain full vigor for a year or longer on a diet of potatoes and fat\\". Polish scientists Stanislaw Kon and Aniela Klein confirmed Hindhede's findings (as did a number of German scientists).Kon, Stanis≈Çaw Kazimierz; Klein, Aniela. (1928). The value of whole potato in human nutrition. Biochemical Journal 22 (1): 258‚Äì260. Kon and Klein used potatoes and butter (with some apples and pears) for 167 days. In 1928, they reported that \\"digestion was excellent throughout the experiment and both subjects felt very well\\". Hindhede recommended people to eat a lacto-vegetarian diet that is low in protein, as it is cheaper and healthier than a meat based diet.Treitel, Corinna. (2017). Eating Nature in Modern Germany: Food, Agriculture and Environment, c.1870 to 2000. Cambridge University Press. pp. 77-81. In 1920, in the journal Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift, Hindhede commented: \\"The reader knows... how sharply I have emphasized the advantages of a lacto- vegetarian diet.

Born to a poor family of Jews in Akhaltsikhe, Koboshvili was originally intended for the Rabbinate, but quit religious training at an early age. His interest in art was discouraged by his family, and he was originally apprenticed as a printer. All his knowledge of art was effectively self-taught.

His work there apparently inspired him to devote himself to painting and all his surviving work dates from the period 1937-1941, the year of his death. Koboshvili's work, which is all in a competent but naive style, is entirely devoted to scenes of Jewish life; sometimes painted in oils, sometimes in water colours on paper. There are scenes relating to Jewish marriages, to Jewish festivals (including Succot and Yom Kippur), and to scenes of Jewish life in Georgian villages and on Jewish collective farms. The Georgian Jewish Museum was forcibly closed in the 1950s and its contents, including the works of Koboshvili, were transferred to the National Museum of Georgia, to which they still belong.

Much business was conducted there; the channel was trafficked by ships leaving and arriving on fishing and turtling trips, and by freight- and mail-carrying vessels as well. The first lighthouse for the East End was erected about a half-mile away from the site of the present tower, being built on Gun Bluff in the early twentieth century. It was one of two lighthouses built on the island; the other was constructed in George Town at about the same time. The structure consisted of a steel ship's mast, tall, standing on the bluff. William James Watler served as the first keeper, ensuring that a kerosene lantern was hoisted to the top of the mast at 6:00 every evening and bringing it down at 6:00 every morning. A fine \\"not exceeding forty shillings\\" would be levied on him should he be derelict in his duties. This first lighthouse was visible from ten miles out at sea. It was recognized by 1918 that a more substantial lighthouse was needed for the point, and a French engineer named Terrier was appointed to plan the project. Land at Gorling Bluff was leased, and a new structure was built, along with a shed for holding kerosene. The new site was perfect for a lighthouse, commanding as it did a good view of nearby reefs; it was also the highest point in the district. The new structure was a cylindrical steel mast supporting a wooden frame; this held a three-wick kerosene lamp. Two keepers, Austin B. Conolly and Police Officer Captain Elliott Conolly, were appointed to oversee maintenance and lighting of the light. Remnants of this lighthouse may still be seen standing beside the current tower, while its kerosene lamp is now in the Cayman Islands National Museum. With the completion, in 1935, of the coastal road along Grand Cayman's southern coast, the community around East End ceased to be as isolated as it had traditionally been, and it was no longer used as a port of entry. As a consequence, the old lighthouse was deemed less necessary, as it was easier to access the village by land. The tower remained in use until 1937, when the British government provided five \\"navigational lights\\" of modern design to be scattered among the three Cayman Islands. It was required that these were to be erected on Crown Property, so as a consequence Gorling Bluff was acquired by the British government that same year; the light was placed on the bluff by a Mr. Morell, who came from England to perform the job. The first lights in the new structure were automatic, controlled by the sun, and could be left for up to six months; as a consequence, the employment of light keepers was no longer deemed necessary. As World War II began, it was decided that the site would be worth turning into a lookout post, and guardians of the light were assigned for this purpose. They also served as lookouts until hostilities erupted, at which point the light came under the jurisdiction of local police. Albert Connor remained in charge until the formation, in June 1942, of the islands' Home Guard. The Guard maintained a 24-hour coastal watch along Grand Cayman's coasts, and a four-man team, commanded by a corporal, was stationed at East End. Although they were trained, they were rarely armed, instead using powerful binoculars to scan the area. The men were given a small barracks, containing a bunkroom, kitchen, and outside latrine as quarters, and had a telephone line connecting them directly with the central office in George Town, to which they reported every half-hour. The East End Light remains an active aid to navigation, being administered for that purpose by the Cayman Islands' Port Authority; today it is powered by solar energy. The Authority has allowed the National Trust for the Cayman Islands to do some work around the structure to make the site more presentable. A stairway of thirty-seven steps has been installed leading to the summit of the bluff, and large amounts of infill and soil have been taken up to create pathways for visitors. Flower beds show examples of various plants which were used as medicines by the Islands' earliest settlers, and a thousand-gallon water tank has been installed to provide irrigation. , work on the park was ongoing.

It lies on land donated to the local Quakers that is positioned between the Worcester Regional Airport and Worcester Reservoir. The actual name is the Friends Cemetery but it is more commonly known as the Spider Gates Cemetery. History The cemetery was founded in 1740. The first Quakers in Leicester were the Ralph Earle family and the John Potter family. The first burial was in 1740. The first Southwick, Amasa, didn't arrive in Leicester until 1800 and had nothing to do with the founding of the cemetery in 1740. The Southwick family probably joined in 1810 or thereabouts and became one of the largest groups to be buried in the cemetery. The Leicester Quakers closed the meeting around 1850 and transferred it to the Worcester meeting. The granite posts and iron gates were installed in 1895 under the terms of a bequest made by Dr. Pliny Earle. Their design was originally meant to represent the rays of the sun but have since taken on their more popular name of Spider Gates. The Southwick family has since had to replace one of the gates as it was stolen but an exact replica of the remaining gate was made so it is nearly impossible to tell the difference. http://www.boudillion.com/SpiderGates/spider.html The cemetery is currently maintained and in use by the Worcester Friends Meeting with the most recent burial being near 2013. Policy The Worcester Friends Meeting tries diligently to keep the cemetery a peaceful and restful place as cemeteries should be. The cemetery is open to visitors during the hours of daylight but is closed once darkness falls. Because of the frequent visits made to the cemetery and its proximity to both the Worcester Regional Airport and Worcester Reservoir, the area is well patrolled by both the Worcester and Leicester police.

With the Castillo San Felipe, an earlier fort built at sea level, it formed part of a complex of fortifications designed to protect Puerto Cabello and its important harbour from naval attacks. It was constructed by order of Don Jos√© Solano y Bote on behalf of the King of Spain. It has been described as the last military construction built in Venezuela during the colonial era. The fort has been the center of several notable events in Venezuelan history. Spanish commander Antonio Zuazola was hanged after a surprise attack by the forces of Rafael Urdaneta overthrew the royalists, giving control of the fort to the patriots. Pedro Carujo was imprisoned in the fort after attempting to kill Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in 1828. In 1962, the fort was the stronghold of an uprising led by several commanders in the city. It was declared a National monument in 1965 and is located inside the San Esteban National Park, which was designed in 1987. Description Fort√≠n Solano is located in the San Esteban National Park, south of Puerto Cabello, Carabobo. It is a military fort built by order of governor of Venezuela, Don Jos√© Solano y Bote in the area referred to as Cresta de Vig√≠a (or \\"lookout crest\\"). It was designed to house artillery and was intended to protect the commercial complex of the city and the harbour from naval attacks. It was the only colonial fortification to be built between 1763 and 1771 and it is described as the last military construction built during the colonial era in Venezuela. HistoryEighteenth and nineteenth centuries= Fort√≠n Solano Before the construction of Fort√≠n Solano, Puerto Cabello had resisted attacks from the British in the Battle of Puerto Cabello. Puerto Cabello continued to be controlled by Spanish forces after the fort's construction in 1766 until it was lost to Venezuela patriots on September 1, 1813. A surprise attack took place, aided by the forces of Rafael Urdaneta, in the midst of the Admirable Campaign in the Venezuelan War of Independence. The following day, Spanish commander Antonio Zuazola, who was known for having mutilated hundreds of prisoners in the east of the country, was imprisoned. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, leader of the patriots, offered Domingo de Monteverde, leader of the royalists, the exchange of Zuazola with Domingo Jal√≥n. After the proposal was rejected by the royalists, Bol√≠var ordered the death of Zuazola, who was hanged from a flagpole outside the walls of the fort. In 1828, Bol√≠var issued a decree establishing his dictatorship in the country; as a result, a group of young lawyers gathered to depose Bol√≠var and proclaim Francisco de Paula Santander as constitutional president. On the night of September 25, 1828 the conspirators attempted to assassinate Bolivar at the presidential palace; Bol√≠var managed to escape with the help of Manuela S√°enz by jumping from a window until the military forces restored control of the city. Pedro Carujo, born in Barcelona, became a Commander in 1828, hand picked by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var to lead the Military Academy founded in Bogot√°. However, Carujo joined the supporters of Santander and attempted to kill Bol√≠var while on the revolt of September 25, for which he was sentenced to death and moved to the Solano fort in March 1829. After managing to escape several months later, he was recaptured and irons were attached to him. He was deported to Curacao in June 1830, only to return several months later under the government of Jos√© Antonio P√°ez. =Twentieth century= In 1904, a budget designed by engineer Germ√°n Jimenez was approved by the Ministry of Public Works to repair the fort. On June 2, 1962 an uprising (the Porte√±azo) led by Manuel Ponte Rodriguez, commander Pedro Medina Silva and Lieutenant Commander Victor Hugo Morales occurred in the city of Puerto Cabello. As soon as the national Government became aware of the revolt, troops of both the Air Force and the Army led by Colonel Alfredo Monch are sent to bomb and surround the city. At the same time, most of the officers in command of 55th National Guard squadron and detachment refuse to participate in the uprising. The following day, the Ministry of Interior announced that Armed forces loyal to the government defeated the rebellion with a balance of 400 deaths and 700 wounded. On June 6, Fort√≠n Solano, which was used as a stronghold by the rebels, fell when the leaders of the revolt were captured by the Army. =Conservation= The fort was declared a National monument in 1965. It is included in the boundaries of a National Park which, as well as being of ecological importance, protects other infrastructure dating from the colonial era, including the Camino de los Espa√±oles, a route to Valencia.

Operable from 1858 to 1942, it contributes to the Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District and is most notable as President Abraham Lincoln's point of arrival on November 18, 1863 and departure, following delivery of the Gettysburg Address. The station served as both a hospital during the battle and hub for outgoing wounded soldiers and incoming resources and supplies following the end of the war. On 2015, following several years of delays, the station, which was originally owned by the Borough of Gettysburg but was bought by the Gettysburg Foundation, the non-profit partner to the National Park Service, was placed under the purview of the National Park Service. History After an uncompleted 1830s plan for a railroad through Gettysburg, on December 1, 1858, the Gettysburg Railroad line was completed from the east to Gettysburg with a reception for railroad dignitaries held several days later at \\"a large and recently furnished building near the depot\\" (the depot was being built on purchased from George W McClellan in the summer). The Gettysburg Railroad Company had contracted for Passenger Depot construction on September 18, 1858 for \\"the Corner of Carlisle and Railroad street\\"; and on January 10, 1859, the stockholders resolved to hold their future meetings \\"in the office [of] their Passenger Depot\\". American Civil War Train service to the depot was stopped when Jubal Early's Confederates burned the Rock Creek trestle on June 27, 1863. The station was undamaged during the battle and returned to service in 1865 following the end of evacuation of the wounded or dead and repairs to the lines. The station was used as a hospital, and soldiers used the station's cupola during the battle. A station east of the borough was established for Camp Letterman before rail traffic was restored to the depot on July 10, and by the end of July, nearly 15,000 wounded troops had passed through the station via the twice-daily trains. A medical inspector of the Army arrived on July 8 and used the depot while \\"in immediate charge of the transportation of the wounded\\". =Heroine of the station= As the Confederate forces approached the town the depot's telegrapher, the adopted young daughter of a \\"Mr. (Brown) Lee in Washington Pa.\\", evacuated the station on the at the beginning of the battle and \\"took the machine from the operating table [and] connected the wires so as to preserve the circuit intact and carried the instrument to Cemetery Hill\\" where, after instructing soldiers how to connect to the wires (e.g., along the Baltimore Pike), she used the key to relay Union Army information. The girl remained during the duration of the battle, even when the soldiers around her were felled by bullets and shells. Following the end of the battle, she packed up the machine and returned to the station to resume her work. Her name was unknown during and after the battle and a news article 30 years later attempted to identify the young girl. Gettysburg Address For the consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg (cited by Klement p. 267) on November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln arrived at 6:00 p.m. on the 18th and departed 24 hours later, having delivered the Gettysburg Address. Postbellum Commercial telegraph service in the depot began in 1866, (L. D. Plank replaced Charles T. Rose as the 1902 Western Union Telegraph operator in the \\"W. U. office\\") and the station's railroad line became part of the successor lines: Susquehanna, Gettysburg and Potomac Railway (1870), Hanover Junction, Hanover and Gettysburg Railroad (1874), Baltimore and Harrisburg Railway (1885), and Western Maryland Railway (1917). The last passenger train departed the depot at 4:00 p.m. on December 31, 1942, when the depot's passenger service was discontinued. (scheduled Reading passenger service had ended in 1941). The depot was used until 1948 for administration of freight trains and telegraphy. On April 1, 1955, Western Maryland leased the building to the Gettysburg Travel Council (CSX Transportation owned the station in 1987). =Renovation= Following a 1996 meeting regarding the station's condition (the station was near collapse), (cited by Bennett p. ~28) renovation was funded. The Borough of Gettysburg acquired the property on May 6, 1998; the Gettysburg Convention and Visitors' Bureau vacated the depot in 2002; and renovation began in January 2005 (completed 2006). The Pennsylvania Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission was \\"pivotal in the grand re-opening of the Historic Gettysburg Train Station\\" on the 2006 anniversary of Lincoln's arrival. The borough approved a 2007 2nd floor lease for the Gettysburg International Arts Festival, and the station has been operated by the National Trust for Historic Gettysburg since 2008. In 2010, by Todd Platts failed in the US Senate for allowing Gettysburg National Military Park acquisition of the depot. Gettysburg railroad museum :Not to be confused with the Lincoln Train Museum The depot's first floor is a museum with an information counter and is open daily (free) to the public. The museum contains models, diagrams, exhibits, and artifacts which were found during the renovation of the station.

Mulroy was born to Morris, a dairy farmer, and Elizabeth, a former schoolteacher. His father served as the Marcellus supervisor on the Onondaga County Board of Supervisors from 1937 to 1953, when the senior Mulroy died in office. Mulroy served as a bomber pilot in the United States Air Force for three years during World War II, and was married September 15, 1945 to the former Virginia Spaulding. He graduated with a degree in history from the University College of Syracuse University and initially earned a living by delivering milk from his family's dairy. He began his political career by getting elected to his father's old position on the County Board of Supervisors, starting in 1957 and rising to Chairman of the Board in 1961. In the 1961 election, Onondaga County voters approved the adoption of a new county charter which provided for the creation of the office of county executive. The Board of Supervisors appointed then-Chairman Mulroy as the first county executive to serve a one-year term before the office was to become elective. In 1962, the electorate voted Mulroy into his first elected term in office, which lasted five years. His achievements in office include: *Building the $26 million Onondaga County Civic Center *A $12.8 million renovation of the Burnet Park Zoo *Construction of the Onondaga County Correctional Facility *Creation of the Beaver Lake Nature Center *Undertaking of the $45 million Lake Ontario Water Project *Building the 526-bed Van Duyn Home and Hospital *Building the $127 million metropolitan sewage treatment plant *Building Onondaga Community College *Creating a county-wide health department *Modernizing MacArthur Stadium *Developing Oneida Shores Park Mulroy was investigated several times for corruption between 1977 and 1982. . He was ultimately convicted of misdemeanors and fined. Mulroy announced his intention to retire in 1987. In his retirement, he served on the boards of several not-for-profit organizations, notably the Onondaga Historical Association, to which he donated a quarter of a million dollars. Mulroy was stricken while on a Syracuse Newspapers-sponsored fishing trip in the Thousand Islands and was taken to Kingston General Hospital. He died after two days. He is buried in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery in the Town of Marcellus. The Onondaga County Civic Center is named in his honor. His son, former Judge J. Kevin Mulroy, was felled by a mysterious, rapidly progressing illness in 2005 and is buried alongside his parents. One of his daughters, Martha E. Mulroy, currently serves as a Family Court Judge.

A modern- day Condercum Road marks the site. Description The remains of the fort lie on Hadrian's Wall to the west of Newcastle. The fort measured from north to south by east to west and the defences enclosed an area of just over . It was a cavalry fort, and had three gates leading to the north of the wall. There were two side gates, facing east and west, through which the Roman military road, running along the south side of the wall, entered and exited. There was also a south-facing gate that led to a causeway that crossed the vallum. The causeway had a gateway, halfway across which was closed by doors. The fort contained a commandant's house, headquarters, two granaries, workshops, barracks, stables and a hospital.  Excavation  The fort was excavated in the 1920s to 1930s where a dedication table was found that suggested the origin date of 122 AD. Also, pottery was found that dated to the 2nd century indicating the time of the rebuild. Other finds from the site include altars dedicated to the gods, square-head and cruciform brooches, a strong room or treasure vault, and a silver spoon. Construction and garrison It is known from several building inscriptions that the defences of the fort at Benwell were built by soldiers from the Second Augustan Legion (Legio II Augusta). It is believed that it was built between 122 AD and 124 AD. Soldiers from the Twentieth Legion (Legio XX Valeria Victrix) were apparently responsible for some additional building or repair work at Benwell in the late-2nd century. The fort contained two granaries, and it is known that these were built by a detachment from the British Fleet, probably because the legionaries responsible for construction of the fort had been called away. It is likely that the detachment was sent from nearby Arbeia, in modern-day South Shields. In the 2nd century Condercum was garrisoned by the Cohors I Vangionum Milliaria Equitata, which was a part-mounted unit from Upper Germany. This had a nominal strength of one thousand men, but it is likely that only half of this number occupied the fort. It is thought that from AD 205 to AD 367, a five-hundred-strong auxiliary cavalry unit (Ala I Hispanorum Asturum), from the Astures tribe in northern Spain, was stationed at the fort. Other buildings There is evidence that a village, or vicus, grew up around the fort, lying to the north and south of the vallum. The remains of three notable buildings were found near the fort. Temple of Antenociticus A number of altar- stones have been found at the site, dedicated to various gods. Three of the altars were dedicated to Antenociticus, who is believed to be a Celtic deity. Another dedication to the \\"three lamiae\\" may likewise refer to local Celtic deities.Matthias Egeler: ‚ÄúCondercum: Some Considerations on the Religious Life of a Roman Fort on Hadrian‚Äôs Wall and the Celtic Character of the lamiae tres of the Dedication Stone CIL VII, 507,‚Äù in: Studi Celtici 7 (2008-2009), pp. 129-176. A hundred yards to the east of the fort, the remains of a temple dedicated to Antenociticus, can still be seen. The building, which was discovered in 1862, measures from east to west and from north to south, with an apse extending a further six feet on the south end. It is believed that the apse contained a life-size statue of the god, as a full size head was found, together with the fragments of an arm and a leg. The head was adorned with a Celtic neck torc. The temple also contained three altars to Antenociticus. Three hundred yards to the southwest of the fort, a bathhouse was discovered in 1751. The building had several rooms, which were probably the hot and cold rooms and dressing rooms normally found in such bathhouses. Just south of the vallum causeway, a third building was found. This was a large domestic building, believed to be a mansio, or resthouse for official travellers. References *J.

Africa and Jugurtha In 110 BC, during the Jugurthine War, he served his brother during Spurius‚Äô unsuccessful campaign against Jugurtha in Africa. At the end of the campaigning season Aulus was left in command of the army in the Roman province of Africa while Spurius returned to Rome to oversee the elections. Aulus decided on a bold stoke and in mid-winter he marched his army to Suthul, one of Jugurtha‚Äòs treasuries, and started to besiege the town. Jugurtha used bribery to induce him to lead his army into the desert, where he was suddenly attacked by the Numidian king, and only saved his troops from total destruction by allowing them to pass under the yoke (a symbolic gesture of submission to the enemy), and undertaking to leave Numidia in ten days.Sallust, Jugurthine War 36‚Äî38T. Mommsen, The History of Rome, P. 100. Social War and death In 89 BC, during the Social War, Aulus served under the consul Lucius Porcius Cato. Early on Cato died and command passed to Lucius Cornelius Sulla who started laying siege to the Campanian cities. During the siege of Pompeii, Aulus was in command of the fleet blockading the harbor. Under Aulus' command were a number of Hirpini who had sided with Rome. He kept on offending these troops until they were so fed up with his behavior that they stoned him to death. When news of this reached Sulla, he declined to punish the murderers. He needed the men and he figured Albinus had brought it on himself.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, pp 91-92.

Genevieve Historic District is a historic district encompassing much of the built environment of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. The city was in the late 18th century the capital of Spanish Louisiana, and, at its original location a few miles south, capital of French Louisiana as well. A large area of the city, including fields along the Mississippi River, is a National Historic Landmark District designated in 1960, for its historically French architecture and land-use patterns, while a smaller area, encompasses the parts of the city historically important between about 1790 and 1950, was named separately to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. and Includes 37 photos and accompanying map. Ste. Genevieve is home to one of the highest concentrations of distinctive types of French colonial architecture known as poteaux en terre, or post in ground, and Poteaux-sur-sol, or post on sill. Both of these styles involve construction of walls consisting of vertical logs, the former placed directly into the ground, and the latter onto a horizontal sill of wood or stone. Prominent local examples of these architectural styles include the Beauvais-Amoureux House, the Felix Vall√© House State Historic Site, La Maison de Guibourd, the Delassus-Kern House, the Louis Bolduc House (itself listed separately as a National Historic Landmark) and Old MillerSwitch Train station was a vital part of History proving supplies and Rest on the Old Railroad. In 2018, the National Park Service was authorized to establish Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park as a unit of the U.S. national park system, following a favourable study by the park service. History Ste. Genevieve was established in the 1750s by French colonists, when the territory west of the Mississippi River was part of French Louisiana. It became the principle civic center of the region, and continued to be so when the area passed into Spanish control with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The original site of Ste. Genevieve, about south of the present city, was severely damaged by major flooding in 1785. After this event, the city was, over the next ten years, relocated to its present site on higher ground. The oldest surviving buildings in the city date to this period, with the church moved from its old site in 1793. The agricultural area just outside the city to the southeast is largely still laid out as it was at that time, following traditional French colonial lines. Americans began to arrive in Ste. Genevieve after the Louisiana Purchase in 1810, and were followed by immigrant groups as the 19th century progressed. By the mid-19th century German-Americans made up the single largest population group in the city. Late in the 19th century, the manufacture of lime became a major local industry, and in 1904 the city became the western end of a railroad ferry, connecting to Kellogg, Illinois. Historic preservation and district designations The importance of Ste. Genevieve's early architecture has long been recognized. In the 1930s a number of its builds were documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), and the Bolduc House was restored in 1956-57. The National Park Service conducted a historic site survey of the region in 1960, leading to the designation of the National Historic Landmark District, one of the first to be made. A survey by the Park Service in 1980 identified the location of Ste. Genevieve's early settlement on the Mississippi floodplain, which had long been thought to be lost to floodwaters. The state has stepped in to acquire several of the older buildings for preservation and interpretation as historic sites. The landmark designation as made in 1960 was short on details and exact boundaries. In 1970, the designation was amended to set a boundary, encompassing about , including much of the town and river bottomlands that reflected French colonial land-use methods. Repeated attempts to further update the landmark designation, including an explicit enumeration of contributing and non- contributing properties, have been made (in 1975, 1986, and 2001), but none of these have passed review. As part of the 2001 work, a separate National Register nomination was prepared, approved in 2002 by the Park Service, that focused on the area's broader historical patterns. Its boundaries exclude the outlying agricultural areas. The park service has been developing plans for a potential national historical park based on Ste. Genevieve's history and architecture. On March 23, 2018, the National Park Service was authorized to establish Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park, when President Trump reluctantly signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus appropriates bill which contained a single line about the park in its 2,232 pages.Blunt, Smith bill to establish Ste.

In 1973, the squadron returned to the fighter mission as the 128th Tactical Fighter Squadron. It became the 128th Bomb Squadron in 1996, and assumed its current role in 2003. HistoryWorld War I= The 128th Airborne Command and Control Squadron traces its origins to the 840th Aero Squadron, which was organized at Rich Field, Waco, Texas on 4 February 1918. However, the 840th's history itself dates to the middle of December 1917 when many of the squadron members first enlisted in the Army at Fort Slocum, New York and the Columbus Barracks, Ohio. Just before Christmas, 1917, the men were transported to Kelly Field, near San Antonio, Texas where they began indoctrination into the Army as an unorganized unit. Many men were transferred into and out of the unit in its first weeks at Kelly. On 8 January, the men was transferred to Rich Field, and placed in temporary squadrons. Time was taken up by drills, hikes, physical training and other exercises. Also the men attended various lectures about military courtesies and customs. Finally, on 4 February 150 men from the group were selected and formed into the 840th Aero Squadron.Gorrell After several more weeks of Army indoctrination training, the squadron was ordered for overseas service, being transferred to the Aviation Concentration Center, Garden City, Long Island. It arrived at Mineola Field on 4 March 1918 where it was prepared and equipped for overseas duty. On 15 April, the squadron was ordered to the Port of Embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey where it boarded the former White Star Line liner . After an uneventful Atlantic crossing, the squadron arrived at Liverpool, England where it boarded a train headed south to Winchester, where it arrived at the Romney Rest Camp. There, the 840th was detached to the Royal Flying Corps for technical training, arriving at the No. 3 Western Aircraft Depot, RFC Yatesbury, Wiltshire, on 4 May. There squadron personnel were placed in different departments of the depot and were engaged in the production and repair of airplanes. The 840th was the second American squadron assigned to the depot, and there was quite a curiosity by the English about them. The men were warmly received in the villages around the depot and celebrated in Bristol. On 13 August, training ended and the squadron moved to Southampton for transport across the English Channel to France. The 840th arrived at Le Havre, France on 18 August, where the squadron was greeted by a German air-raid on its \\"rest\\" camp. The squadron was hurriedly moved during the raid to a race track, where some ammunition was stored. However, after the \\"All Clear\\" was given, it returned to its barracks. After three days, the squadron was transported to Courban Aerodrome, in eastern France where it was assigned to the No. 3 Aircraft Depot, Independent Air Force, RAF. There, the squadron began work on Handley Page and de Havilland planes. The squadron had the distinction of turning out the first Handley Page aircraft to be assembled in France. It also saw its first United States-built Liberty Engine at the depot. The 840th was one of only three Air Service squadrons assigned to the British depot. The squadron remained at Courban until the end of the war. The squadron turned out two squadrons of Dayton-Wright DH-4 aircraft, prepared for the attack on Metz that was about to commence at the time of the Armistice. The squadron was moved to Latrecey Aerodrome, on 20 November 1918 where it waited for orders to return home. It finally moved to the port of Brest on 1 February, where it sailed on a troop ship for the United States, moving to Langley Field, Virginia in early March 1919. There the squadron was demobilized and returned to civilian life. =World War II= Antisubmarine operations The 128th Observation Squadron was allotted to the Georgia National Guard, activated in May 1941 at Atlanta Airport as an army observation squadron, and equipped with several types of observation aircraft. The squadron was called into federal service in September 1941 and assigned to II Air Support Command, which moved it to Lawson Field, Georgia as the United States mobilized prior to World War II. It continued to train as an observation unit after the Pearl Harbor Attack, standardizing on North American O-47s, until June 1942. On 20 June 1942, the squadron moved to New Orleans Army Air Base, Louisiana, where it was attached to the Gulf Task Force and began antisubmarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico. It was attached to Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command in the fall of 1942, and was assigned to the command in March 1943, when it was redesignated the 21st Antisubmarine Squadron. 1943 also saw the conversion of the squadron to the more capable North American B-25 Mitchell. The squadron moved to Gulfport Army Air Field, Mississippi in May 1943 and ended antisubmarine operations. In July 1943, the Army Air Forces and the Navy reached an agreement to transfer the coastal antisubmarine mission to the Navy. This mission transfer also included an exchange of AAF long-range bombers equipped for antisubmarine warfare for Navy Consolidated B-24 Liberators without such equipment.Ferguson, pp. 82‚Äì83 Heavy bomber operations Like many antisubmarine units flying heavy bombers, the 21st became part of Second Air Force. It moved to Ephrata Army Air Base as the 818th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 28 September 1943, where it became the 818th Bombardment Squadron, helping form the cadre for the new 483d Bombardment Group. In November, the squadron moved to MacDill Field, Florida, where it trained with Flying Fortresses under Third Air Force. At MacDill, it exchanged designations with another squadron, becoming the 840th Bombardment Squadron, and was consolidated with the World War I 840th Aero Squadron.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 354‚Äì355 The 840th deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, where it became part of Fifteenth Air Force at Sterparone Airfield in Southern Italy. The squadron's air element flew its Flying Fortresses to Sterparone via Tortorella Airfield, while the ground element moved to Sterparone via troop ship. It began operations in April 1944 with an attack on a cement factory in Split, Yugoslavia. The squadron engaged in long-range strategic bombardment of enemy military, industrial and transport targets, including factories, oil refineries, marshalling yards, airfields, and troop concentrations in Italy, France. Southern Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the Balkans. In June 1944, the squadron participated in a shuttle mission, departing Italy and landing in the Soviet Union, attacking targets en route and on the return flight. This enabled attacks on targets too far from the squadron's base to strike and return home. The squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation for combat action two months later. On 18 July 1944 the squadron, along with the other elements of the 483d Group, bombed the objective, an airfield and installations at Memmingen, engaging numerous enemy aircraft in the target area despite a lack of cover from its planned fighter escort. It received a second citation for braving fighter assaults and flak to bomb tank factories at Berlin on 24 March 1945. The squadron was occasionally diverted from the strategic attack on Germany. It struck targets in southern France in preparation for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of August 1944. The group also supported ground forces in northern Italy during the Allied offensive in April 1945. After V-E Day, the unit moved to Pisa Airfield, where it operated under the control of Air Transport Command's Green Project which was the movement of troops back to the United States. The squadron carried troops from Pisa to a staging area in Morocco. Its B-17s were disarmed with flooring and seats for 25 passengers installed. It carried passengers from Pisa to Port Lyautey Airfield, French Morocco for further movement them across the Atlantic. The squadron was inactivated in Italy in September 1945. =Georgia Air National Guard= 128th Fighter Squadron Republic P-47N ThunderboltAircraft is Republic P-47N-25-RE Thunderbolt, serial 44-89403 at Marietta AAF, GA in May 1946. This aircraft was part of the last production block of P-47s at Republic Aircraft, Farmingdale, Long Island. The wartime 840th Bombardment Squadron was re- activated and re-designated as the 128th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the Georgia Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Marietta Army Airfield, Georgia, and was extended federal recognition on 20 August 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The 128th Fighter Squadron was entitled to the history, honors, and colors of the 840th Bombardment Squadron. The squadron was equipped with Republic F-47 Thunderbolts and was temporarily assigned to the 54th Fighter Wing on 20 August, then permanently to the 116th Fighter Group on 9 September 1946. The 116th Fighter Group consisted of the 128th and the 158th Fighter Squadron at Chatham Army Air Field, near Savannah. As part of the Continental Air Command Fourteenth Air Force, the unit trained for tactical fighter missions and air-to-air combat. Korean War federalization The 128th was federalized on 10 October 1950 due to the Korean War. It was assigned to the federalized Oklahoma Air National Guard 137th Fighter-Bomber Wing and equipped with Republic F-84G Thunderjets. Along with the Oklahoma 125th Fighter Squadron and Kansas Air National Guard 127th Fighter Squadron, the wing was scheduled for deployment to the new Chaumont- Semoutiers Air Base, France, as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). By 27 November, the wing assembled at Alexandria Air Force Base, Louisiana for conversion training in the newer F-84Gs. Deployment of the wing was delayed, however, by the need to transfer pilots to Korea from training and delays in receiving engines for the F-84Gs, as well as the ongoing construction at Chaumont Air Base. Training and delays continued throughout 1951. Due to these delays, many of the activated National Guard airmen were released from active duty and never deployed to France. With mostly regular Air Force personnel and all the delays behind them, the remaining Guardsmen departed Louisiana on 5 May 1952 for Europe; however, the 128th inherited a base that was little more than acres of mud where wheat fields used to be. The only hardened facilities at Chaumont were a concrete runway and a handful of tar-paper shacks. The 128th wound up being stationed by USAFE at Neubiberg Air Base, West Germany until the facilities in France were suitable for military use. The aircraft arrived at Chaumont on 25 June, being the first USAF tactical air fighters to be based permanently in France, albeit working mostly in tents and temporary wooden buildings on their new base. The Guardsmen of the 128th ended their active-duty tour in France and returned to the United States in late June, leaving their F-84 Thunderjets in Europe. Air Defense Command 128th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-84F ThunderstreakAircraft is General Motors built Republic F-84F-40-GK Thunderstreak, serial 51-9520. The 116th Fighter-Bomber Group designation was returned to the Georgia Air National Guard on 10 July at Dobbins AFB. At this time the Group was restructured to include the 128th and 158th Fighter Squadrons. Initially upon their return to State Control both squadrons were equipped with the long-range F-51H Mustang and given an air defense mission. The 116th was assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC), being assigned to the 35th Air Division with a mission of the air defense of the Southeastern United States. Commencing in February 1953 the 128th began conversion to F-84D Thunderjets, yet most were not received until mid summer. During the summer of 1955 the 128th was re- designated as the 128th Fighter Interceptor Squadron and converted the swept- wing Republic F-84F Thunderstreak. Strangely enough, it was not until March 1957 that the surviving D models were dispatched for salvage, with eleven of those aged D models having been lost in accidents while serving with the 128th FBS. In 1958, the 116th implemented the ADC Runway Alert Program, in which interceptors of the 128th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron were committed to a five-minute runway alert. In 1960 the F-84s were again replaced by the North American F-86L Sabre, a day/night/all-weather aircraft designed to be integrated into the ADC SAGE interceptor direction and control system. Air Transport In 1961, the 116th FIG was reassigned to Military Air Transport Service (MATS), trading in its Sabre interceptors for 4-engines Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter transports. With air transportation recognized as a critical wartime need, the squadron was redesignated the 128th Air Transport Squadron, Heavy. The 116th was assigned to the MATS Eastern Transport Air Force, (EASTAF), and the squadron flew long-distance transport missions in support of Air Force requirements, frequently sending aircraft to the Caribbean, Europe Greenland, and the Middle East in support of Air Force requirements. In 1966 MATS became the Military Airlift Command (MAC) and EASTAF became the MAC Twenty-First Air Force. The 116th was upgraded to the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II strategic heavy airlifter, being the first Air National Guard unit to receive the aircraft. Due to requirements generated by the Vietnam War, missions were flown across the Pacific to Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Okinawa and Thailand. Post-Vietnam the last F-105 in USAF service at Dobbins AFBAircraft is Republic F-105F-1-RE Thunderchief, serial 63-8299 heading to the \\"boneyard\\" on 25 May 1983. It was the last F-105 in USAF service. Next to it is McDonnell F-4D-26-MC Phantom, serial 65-604, arriving for service with the 128th Tactical Fighter Squadron. In the years after the Vietnam War, the transport requirements of MAC along with the retirement of the C-124 led the 116th to be reassigned back to Tactical Air Command in 1974 and was re-equipped with North American F-100 Super Sabre tactical fighter-bombers, many aircraft being veterans of the Vietnam War. The 116th was changed in status from a Group to a Wing with the reassignment to TAC, and the 128th flew the Super Saber jets for six accident-free years until May 1979 when the last aircraft left Dobbins AFB to be retired as part of the phaseout of the F-100 from the inventory. The F-100s were replaced with other Vietnam-era hand-me-down combat veteran aircraft by TAC during the early 1980s, as F-105G Thunderchief Wild Weasel electronic warfare aircraft were assigned, then retired and McDonnell F-4D Phantom II fighter bombers in their final years of service. In 1986 the 116th retired the last of its Vietnam War Phantoms and received McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle air superiority fighters. The F-15A was introduced into the inventory in the mid-1970s and now were being upgraded in the active duty by the improved F-15C. The 128th flew the F-15 for the next ten years. The 116th Tactical Fighter Wing developed an impressive record of accomplishment and was awarded nine Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards. B-1B Lancer Four U.S. Air Force Rockwell B-1B Lancer from the 128th Bomb Squadron, 19 April 2002 In 1992 as part of the post Cold-War reorganizations of the Air Force, the 116th converted to the Air Force Objective organization and the 128th was assigned to the new 116th Operations Group. In 1992 Tactical Air Command was inactivated and the 116th was assigned to the new Air Combat Command (ACC). After calling Dobbins AFB home for 50 years, the 116th was presented with a new challenge in 1996. The wing simultaneously converted from the F-15 Eagle fighters to the Rockwell B-1B Lancer strategic bomber and moved 110 miles south to Robins Air Force Base east og Warner Robins, Georgia. As part of the post Cold-War drawdown, the active-duty fleet of B-1Bs were being reduced for budget reductions and being taken off Alert Status by the former Strategic Air Command (SAC), which itself was inactivated in 1992. Having to make the most of the available facilities, including the former Strategic Air Command alert facility at Robins, the 116th Bomb Wing was quickly up and running and participated in a number of deployments and exercises around the world in the B-1B. Airborne Command and Control 16th ACW E-8C Joint STARS 01-2005 In order to save money, in 2002 the USAF agreed to reduce its fleet of B-1Bs from 92 to 60 aircraft. The 116th Bomb Wing, having older aircraft was ordered to send its aircraft to \\"active storage\\" which meant that they could be quickly returned to service should circumstances dictate. Its first B-1B was flown to AMARC storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona on 20 August. Under the Air Force's Total Force Initiative as a \\"blended\\" wing. America's first \\"Total Force\\" wing, the former 93d Air Control Wing, an active-duty Air Combat Command unit, and the 116th Bomb Wing, a Georgia Air National Guard unit, were inactivated effective 1 October 2002. The 116th was immediately reactivated and redesignated as the 116th Air Control Wing. The 116th was a blend of active-duty and national guard Airmen into a single unit. The 116th ACW was equipped with the new E-8C Joint STARS airborne battle management aircraft. Its mission is command and control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Its primary mission is to provide theater ground and air commanders with ground surveillance to support attack operations and targeting that contributes to the delay, disruption and destruction of enemy forces. The E-8C evolved from Army and Air Force programs to develop, detect, locate and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops. The 128th Airborne Command and Control Squadron has flown more than 82,000 combat hours in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, Operation Odyssey Dawn, and Operation Unified Protector. Beginning in 2011, its operational resume expanded to include support of five Combatant Commands including U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command. On 1 October 2011 the 128th Airborne Command and Control Squadron was inactivated as a Joint Air National Guard/United States Air Force Unit. The 116th ACW was returned to the sole jurisdiction of the Georgia Air National Guard on 1 October 2011 and reactivated.

Reese Hopkins. Hopkins was a news anchor and news director for the Star and Bucwild show. From December 2007 to October 2008, he hosted a mid day show for Boston station WRKO.  Radio career  E. Reese Hopkins officially began his radio career in April 2001 as a writer for the Star & Buc Wild radio show at Hot 97. He introduced himself by faxing fake news to the show. As a result of his comedic pieces being read on air, he was offered a news anchor position. Hopkins stayed in that position until 2005. Hopkins resigned from the show in October 2005, seeking new opportunities in radio. Hopkins took two years off from radio, and moved with his family to Fort Lee, New Jersey. He managed a tile warehouse and produced a program for Howard 100 on Sirius Satellite Radio. In October 2007, he auditioned for an on-air position after a call from WRKO station manager John Capuano. After a successful audition station management offered him a slot in December 2007. He was fired from WRKO Boston on October 16, 2008 as part of company wide cost cutting in the face of declining revenues and stock prices. He was replaced by Laura Ingraham, a syndicated talk host.  Controversy College degree= In April 2008, challenges were made to Hopkins' claims that he graduated from Fordham University in 1991. In an interview with the Boston Herald, Hopkins said he graduated under a different name, citing \\"legal reasons\\". He added, \\"I had to go to college either under an emancipated name or under a guardianship, which is under my father‚Äôs name. It‚Äôs a private matter. I did graduate from Fordham University.\\" On October 22, 2008, a week after being let go by WRKO, Hopkins was arrested at his Malden, Massachusetts home on a fugitive from justice charge. It is alleged that Hopkins raped a 12-year-old girl some four years earlier. He waived extradition to New York City where he was charged with two counts of rape. One in the first degree, one in the second degree and one charge of endangering the welfare of a child. In a statement to the press, Hopkins denied the charges stating: > ‚ÄúShe charged me on Oct. 1 of 2004. I was living in Manchester, Connecticut. > I couldn‚Äôt have been there.‚Äù Not being able to make bail of $100,000 cash or $300,000 bond, Hopkins was held at Rikers Island for 2-1/2 years. In November 2009, he was offered a deal of time served if he pleaded guilty to a lower sexual offense and register as a sex offender. Hopkins professed his innocence and turned the deal down. He was finally put on trial March 2, 2011 when jury selection began. During the trial, Hopkins' accuser changed her story and the investigating detective was cut from the witness list. The trial ended in a mistrial on March 24, 2011 after two days of deliberation when eight of the jurors voted not guilty on all charges, and all but one juror voted not guilty on the most serious charge of child rape. Hopkins was finally freed on bail April 6, 2011 after bail was dropped to $20,000. The prosecutor promised to file for a re-trial, however the arrest of Hopkin's accuser on a gun charge has muddied the case and a re- trial has not been filed.

The clan operates in the neighbourhoods of Secondigliano, Scamp√¨a, Miano, Marianella, Piscinola, and in the adjacent municipalities of Casavatore, Melito, Arzano, Villaricca and Mugnano (all in the province of Naples). The head of the clan is Paolo Di Lauro (known as \\"Ciruzzo il milionario\\"), from Via Cupa dell'Arco, in Secondigliano. History The Italian Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia (\\"Antimafia District Directorate\\") first investigated the clan in 2002, which led to the imprisonment of its most influential members, including Abbinante clan boss Raffaele \\"Papale e Marano\\" Abbinante, who was aligned with Di Lauro, but Paolo Di Lauro managed to stay free. Despite this setback, the clan increased its power and the arrested members were replaced by several of Di Lauro's ten sons: Cosimo (b. 1973), Ciro (b. 1978) and Marco (b. 1980). E ora √® caccia a Marco e Nunzio , Il Roma, March 28, 2007 At the same time, the coalition was strengthened with other clans in the Secondigliano Alliance. The clan's \\"old guard\\" lost its power, and some of Di Lauro's former faithful allies formed a rival alliance (Scissionisti di Secondigliano) and started a bloody power struggle in 2004, known as the Scampia feud. Activities In the early 2000s, the clan's drug revenue from their sellers were reckoned by Italian investigators to be worth about ‚Ç¨200 million per year. In the time of the reign of Paolo Di Lauro, Secondigliano, the clan's stronghold, became the largest open-air narcotics market in Europe. The Di Lauro clan funnelled the proceeds into real estate, buying dozens of flats in Naples, owning shops in France and the Netherlands, as well as businesses importing fur, fake fur and lingerie. Cosimo Di Lauro used to travel to Paris to control the business of the clan in France. In his visits to Paris, Cosimo often drove his Lamborghini around the city.'The blood is running': Mafia wars erupt again, The Independent, December 8, 2004 The clan is also very active in counterfeit clothes in the Netherlands. The Di Lauro clan is believed to invest large amounts of money in Greece. According to the pentito Antonio Accurso, the Di Lauro clan has several links to the Sacra Corona Unita in question with regards to drug trafficking. The Di Lauro clan allegedly has a alliance with the Contini clan, particularly with Ciro Contini, the nephew of the boss Edoardo Contini. According to the pentito Domenico Esposito both clans have a pact with regards to the drug trafficking business. On 12 July 2019, the Italian police confiscated ‚Ç¨300 million, including 600 houses, lands, 16 cars and bank accounts belonging to Antonio Passarelli, a businessman believed to be connected to the Di Lauro clan.

The first season was held in 1891. There have also been a number of changes in the competition format: #Between 1891 and 1966 it was played during one year in a double round-robin tournament. #Between 1967 and 1985 there were two championships per year (Metropolitano and Nacional). #Between 1985 and 1991 it was contested via round-robin again, but with the European style calendar (season started in mid year). #Since 1991, it is contested with an Apertura and Clausura format, meaning there are two champions per season. #Since 2012, it is contested with a format similar to this last, with two champions per season, and a third, which is the winner of a final played between these two teams. The championships are named Inicial, which replaced the Apertura; and Final, which replaced the Clausura.

He became a popular concert pianist in Australia and was a founding member of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music, where he taught for fifty years. Early life and education Hutchens' parents, Richard Lavers Hutchens and his wife Maria Siles, n√©e Hoskins, both Cornish,http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090410b.htm?hilite=cornish migrated to New Zealand in 1879. Richard tried his hand at farming and bootmaking before settling down at HƒÅwera as a piano teacher. Frank Hutchens was born in Leeston near Christchurch on 15 January 1892. He attended Hawera District High School. In 1904, at the age of twelve, Hutchens had the opportunity to demonstrate his talents after his piano teacher arranged for him to play for the virtuoso Ignaz Paderewski, who was then touring New Zealand. Impressed with the boy's potential, Paderewski encouraged him to study in Europe. The following year, at the age of thirteen, Hutchens travelled alone to London to attend the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied piano and composition with Tobias Matthay and Frederick Corder. At the Academy, he won the Sterndale Bennett and Thalberg scholarships, and also the Hine Prize and the Chappell gold medal for pianoforte playing. In 1909, at the age of 17, he became the youngest sub-professor yet appointed to the Academy.Australian Music Centre. In 1911 however, he was forced to return home after his mother fell ill and the family faced financial difficulties. Later career Having given many recitals in New Zealand, Hutchens decided in 1913 to return to London to resume his career, but after arriving in Sydney, Australia for a stopover, he was given the opportunity to perform with the Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society conducted by Alfred Hill. He decided to stay, and in 1915 was offered a position by Henri Verbrugghen as a founding professor with the newly formed New South Wales Conservatorium of Music, which he accepted. Hutchens was rejected for military service in 1916, and he went on to become an influential teacher, retaining his role as a professor with the Conservatorium for fifty years. Prior to his death in 1965 at the age of 73, he was the only remaining original member of the Conservatorium on staff. In addition to his successful teaching career, Hutchens in 1924 formed a piano duo with Lindley Evans, which was destined to become another long and successful partnership. Over the course of the next forty years, Hutchens and Evans made many tours of Australia and New Zealand, giving concerts and broadcasts, and they were among the first composer-performer teams to be recorded commercially in Australia. Highlights of the partnership included the premiere of Hutchens' own work the Fantasie Concerto and Evans' Idyll with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1943 (later recorded by the duo in 1962), a recital for Dame Nellie Melba, and the premiere performance in Australia of Francis Poulenc's Concerto for Two Pianos in D minor. The success of the Hutchens-Evans partnership enabled them to establish a scholarship for young musicians, funded by their own concerts. As an examiner for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music and Trinity College of Music in London, Hutchens had the requisite experience to assist in the establishment of the Australian Music Examinations Board as an independent body. He was also a professor at the Newcastle Conservatorium of Music, President of the NSW Musical Association, a director of APRA, and a member of the Sydney Conservatorium's advisory board. Personal life In 1955 Hutchens married Joyce White, granddaughter of R. H. D. White.

It is subject to a wide variety of regulatory, policy, management, and technical issues. Horse riders enjoy a Sunday outing on a peaceful lane near Bristol, England  Horses on the roadways  Before the popularity of automobiles increased, seeing someone riding in a horse-drawn buggy, or atop a horse on the roadway was fairly common. It was, in fact the primary form of transportation until automobiles took over in the early nineteen hundreds. As advancements in transportation and developments began, the need to use horse-driven vehicles for the primary form of transportation began to decrease. Even now, when cars are such an important part of many people's everyday lives, horses are still utilized by some on a day-to-day basis. In some states, such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, where certain sects reside, such as the Amish, seeing equestrians on the roadway is a regular occurrence. As well as a way of life, some people still use the roadway to leisurely ride horses and enjoy their love for the equestrian life-style. Although you are more likely to see a vehicle than you are a horse-drawn carriage or someone cantering on the side of the road, horses and carriages alike are still allowed on roadways.  Safety precautions  The roadways in the United States of America are to be shared with others - this includes cyclists and equestrians. An equestrian is a rider or performer on horseback, relating primarily to horse riding. According to the State of both Ohio and Pennsylvania, in which a section of each state has an Amish or Mennonite sect, approximately sixty major crashes involving horses and buggies occur yearly, over the course of a decade. This means that over the course of ten years, approximately six hundred accidents occur that involves horses. These accidents are more common in places such as Ohio and Pennsylvania because of the Amish culture. There are some safety precautions, however, you can make in order to attempt to prevent these types of accidents from occurring. Displaying some form of a fluorescent light or reflective clothing can help other motorists on the road see you more easily (if you are a horseback rider). Riding a horse is best done during daylight and in fair weather. Avoiding riding a horse on roadways in icy, snowy or foggy conditions can decrease the chances of an accident. If your horse is unfamiliar with riding on roads, avoiding roads all together is a safe practice. Horses can be spooked fairly easily, and to minimize your horse becoming panicked, avoiding a busy roadway is a good safety precaution to take. However, if it is necessary to ride on the roadway or cross a roadway, asking someone to accompany you that may be more experienced can be helpful. Riding single file, as well as crossing major roadways in a group increases your visibility for oncoming motorists. Although horses are rather large animals, from a far distance it is easier to see a number of horses rather than just one. For motorists, to increase an equestrians‚Äô safety on the road, be prepared to stop. It is important to not sound your horn or rev your engine while you are near or passing a horse. Although they may be slow moving, patience is important to make sure both the rider and the horse remain safe. Make sure to pass someone who is riding a horse widely. For experienced riders, it is also important to have your horse walk, rather than go in a faster gate on roadways that are hard, such as asphalt. Faster gaits lead to a higher likelihood of your horse falling with you on it due to the hardness of the surface.  Leisure equestrians  The equine industry is an ongoing hustling and bustling market. This industry is best known for its pricey thoroughbred filly's and stallions and the races that we see on television, such as the well-known Kentucky Derby. About 4.6 million Americans are involved in someway, shape or form with horses. There are many different ways in being a part of the equine community. Wranglers, ranchers, parents and more are all part of this community. As a wrangler, you can be wrangling wild horses out in the western portion of the United States. As a parent, you could be investing equally as much time as your child for something that they adore, such as equine. Many people use horses in a variety of shows and races in order to win awards, including jumping, endurance races, and horsemanship and western pleasure. Horses can also be used in an occupation, such as ranching or wrangling. Approximately 6.9 million horses are own by citizens throughout the United States of America in total. There is a four to one ratio with the number of horses that are in the country to people who own horses that are in the United States of America. In a recent survey performed by The American Horse Council, an estimated four million horses are used in recreational use, three million for showing, one hundred thousand for racing and two million for other forms of utilization. Ultimately, horses are primarily used leisurely and recreationally now. Horses have become not exactly a necessity to many people, but rather a favorite past time, and a hobby that can be life-long. However, there are, of course, people who use horses as livestock and a major mode of transportation, which makes this luxury to some, and a necessity to others.  Horses - a necessity to some  Throughout history, transportation using a horse and buggy has developed into a more modern realm, eventually becoming today's automobile. However, in certain areas of Ohio and Pennsylvania, horse and buggy is a main form of transportation. The Amish, Mennonite and the Brethren community can be dated back to as early as the sixteenth century. In the eighteen hundreds, members of their conservative Christian faith fled Europe and began a new life in a small county in Pennsylvania called Lancaster. They are best known for their simple life styles, including having limited forms of electricity, living off the land and having very modest and conservative viewpoints on a number of topics. Many families have adapted to the modern age and now allow some forms of technology, as long as it does not interrupt or affect family time. Amish are forbidden to own cars, but are allowed to ride in them when needed. That is why the Amish, Mennonite and Brethren population use horse and buggy for their main mode of transportation. In many states throughout the United States of America, an orange triangle that symbolizes ‚Äòa slow moving vehicle‚Äô must be fastened on the back of the carriage part of the buggy. When this symbol is in use, it means that the vehicle is prohibited or unable to move faster than twenty-five miles per hour. Unfortunately, the majority of accidents involving horses involve high- speed automobiles. Nonetheless, when approaching a horse-drawn carriage or someone riding a horse, remember that horses are an animal and can be unpredictable at times. Although some horses are relatively comfortable and used to being around motor vehicles, loud cars and horns can still spook horses easily. It is also important to slow down and give plenty of room to pass the horse and buggy legally and safely. If you were to visit the county of Lancaster today, you would see that almost all Amish, Mennonite and Brethren families own some form of transportation, typically horses and a buggy. Horses do, in fact, have rights when it comes to being on the road, similarly to cyclists and runners who utilize the roadways. However, there are specific rules and regulations that they must abide, as well. Horseback riders must ride with traffic, as far to the right as possible on the roadway. However, many equestrians believe that riding against traffic is a safer way to use the roadway with a horse. Horses do best when they can see what is coming towards them, rather than guessing what is coming towards them from behind. Although this is not the same in each state in the United States of America, the vast majority follow this rule. From state to state, some statues and regulations vary. For example, the state of New York has a very set comprehensive list of rules for the use of horses on the road- both being ridden upon and being horse-driven vehicles. The state of Louisiana prohibits the riding of a horse on any asphalt-based road. There are many states that prohibit the driving or riding of horses on the right of way on a limited access highway like an interstate highway. A lot of the regulations are similar. They include only passing the horse-driven vehicle or horseback rider when it is safe to do so and prohibiting the use of any form of noise, such as a horn. In order to minimize the number of accidents that occur with horse and road distractions, people who are actively driving should try to be as cautious as possible to try and avoid these situations.

Playing career Braham began his playing career with Tunisian side US Monastir. His first club in Germany was 1. SC G√∂ttingen 05 . In 2001, Braham moved to Regionalliga S√ºd side SV Eintracht Trier 05, but only played in six matches in his first season. After Trier's promotion to 2. Bundesliga, the club looked to off-load him, but no interest was shown. In the next season, Braham had his breakthrough with Trier, scoring 13 goals in 29 matches and securing a mid-table finish for the club. However, in the following season, Braham hit a dry spell, not scoring once in all his 15 matches, leading to his transfer to newly promoted FC Rot-Wei√ü Erfurt in 2004. But at Erfurt, Braham's problems continued, he only played in 12 matches, scoring once. Eventually the rest of the team declared itself displeased by Braham's egoistical way of playing, and he moved back to Eintracht Trier. Trier had been relegated to Regionalliga S√ºd, and Braham's 12 goals in 24 matches could not prevent the club from being relegated to the tier IV Oberliga S√ºdwest. From the 2006‚Äì07 season onwards, Braham played for Regionalliga S√ºd side Sportfreunde Siegen, but played for the reserves in the tier V Verbandsliga most of the time. In the winter break of the 2007‚Äì08 season his contract was terminated, and on 22 January 2008 he signed for 1. FC Magdeburg. Despite the club missing out on qualification for the newly created 3. Liga, Braham extended his contract until 2011, but left the club on 13 July 2009 to sign with FC Erzgebirge Aue, after Magdeburg had told the player that he no longer played a role in their plans. International career Braham has had 14 caps for Tunisia, he was part of the Tunisia squad that won the 2004 edition of the African Cup of Nations, playing in two matches and scoring once. Coaching career In February 2014, Braham took over as manager at G√∂ttingen 05. He was released by the club in October 2014.

The eldest daughter of the actor and filmmaker Richard Attenborough and the actress Sheila Sim, she was first employed as overseas membership secretary at the Royal Academy of Dance. Attenborough later joined the Arts Council of Great Britain to its national touring programme in 1979 before moving to the Rambert Dance Company as dance liaison officer, expanding its education programme from schools activities to local community events. In 1985, she became administrator for the National Organisation for Dance and Mime (later Dance UK). Attenborough was later promoted its executive director, expanding the organisation's activities to help companies and choreographers to produce works by ignoring financial means and developed a programme to maintain the fitness of dancers. She worked as arts manager for the Paul Hamlyn Foundation from early 2000, promoting music education in schools in North East England and established links with four London theatres. In her final years Attenborough was manager of the experimental Musical Futures project. She was killed by the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami while holidaying in Thailand in December 2004. After Attenborough's death, Dance UK established the Jane Attenborough One Dance UK Industry Award in her name and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation awarded the Jane Attenborough Dance in Education Fellowship to assist a retiring dancer transition to community and education work from 2005 to 2009. A drama and music facility at Waterford Kamhlaba in Eswatini and a small studio at the University of Sussex were named after her. Biography Jane Mary Attenborough was born on 30 September 1955 in London. She was the eldest daughter of the actor and filmmaker Richard Attenborough and the actress Sheila Sim. Attenborough had two siblings: Michael and Charlotte. From her childhood, Attenborough was raised amongst people from the artistic world and she was focused on addressing a concern that many individuals lacked an opportunity to participate in the arts. She was educated at the Lady Eleanor Holles School in Hampton, before going on to enroll on a sociology course at the University of Sussex from 1973 to 1976. Her first role of employment was as overseas membership secretary at the Royal Academy of Dance for a short period of time in 1977. Attenborough subsequently joined the Arts Council of Great Britain and was assigned to its national touring programme, where she assisted the consultant Jodi Myers. In 1979, she joined the Rambert Dance Company as dance liaison officer, where she expanded its education programme from traditional schools activities to encompass local community events, before she was promoted to press and public relations officer, a position which she held from 1980 to 1984. After leaving the world of employment to raise a family, Attenborough was persuaded to join the National Organisation for Dance and Mime (later Dance UK) as administrator in 1985, leading its transformation from a minor lobbying group to an organisation which had significant authority and impact. She later became Dance UK's executive director and used managerial experience and fundraising events to contribute to the promotion of the dance world and improve the conditions in which dancers had. An initiative in which Attenborough was instrumental in the development of was the Healthier Dancer Programme to help dancers maintain their fitness and reduce the risk of injury. She also helped to establish the Digital Dance Awards in 1987, which allowed companies and choreographers to produce works that they could not have created beyond their normal financial means. In early 2000, the Paul Hamlyn Foundation had a vacancy for a job as arts manager and Attenborough was its successful applicant. There she was involved in multiple projects that introduced \\"at risk\\" individuals to the arts and had an increasing involvement in the Paul Hamlyn Foundation's support for employment in prisons. Furthermore, Attenborough was involved in the promotion of music education in schools in North East England and she led the Paul Hamlyn Performances at the Royal Opera House, introducing thousands of young people to opera. She additionally helped the foundation to establish links with the Royal National Theatre, the Royal Court Theatre and the Sage Gateshead and undertook other projects to provide audiences with opportunities to get involved in the arts. In her final years Attenborough was manager of the experimental Musical Futures project, working with the civil servant Claus Moser and project leader David Price. On the morning of 26 December 2004, she and her family were holidaying on the Khao Lak Beach in Thailand when the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami struck their villa, killing Attenborough, her daughter Lucy and her mother-in-law. Her husband Michael Holland (whom she married in 1982) and two other children survived her. In March 2005, she was given a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral, attended by her family, friends and colleagues.  Personality  Attenbrough's brother Michael described her as \\"intense\\", Moser called her individual who had a \\"generous spirit, integrity, wisdom and involvement\\", and Myers noted her \\"infectious sense of humour\\" and \\"great charm\\". She was able to get individuals from many backgrounds to relax and provide and combined \\"great enthusiasm and passion with impressive administrative skills and acute sensitivity to the needs of artists and audiences.\\" Legacy The Musical Features project of which she was manager expanded operations outside of the United Kingdom and one million young people took up the initiative. Dance UK established the Jane Attenborough One Dance UK Industry Award in recognition of \\"an individual working in dance who has made an outstanding contribution to the art form.\\" From 2005 to 2009, the Paul Hamlyn Foundation honoured Attenborough with the two-year ¬£50,000 Jane Attenborough Dance in Education Fellowship, which aimed \\"to enable a dance company to provide practical assistance, mentoring and training to help a dancer coming to the end of his or her career to make a successful transition to education and community work.\\" The Paul Hamlyn Foundation also funded the construction of a drama and music facility, the Jane Holland Creative Centre for Learning at Waterford Kamhlaba in Eswatini, which was opened by Lord & Lady Attenborough in November 2006 in honour of their eldest daughter. Her alma mater, the University of Sussex, named a small studio in the Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts after her in 2015.

The freeways consist of an advanced network of interconnecting freeways which include Interstate highways. The Metro Detroit region's extensive toll-free freeway system, together with its status as a major port city, provide advantages to its location as a global business center. There are no toll roads in Michigan. Detroiters may refer to freeways by the formal name more often where one has been designated rather than route number. Other freeways without formal names are known by the number such as I‚Äë275 and M‚Äë59. M‚Äë53, while not officially designated may be locally referred to by its name \\"Van Dyke\\". Detroit area freeways are typically sunken below ground level to permit local traffic to pass over the freeway and for appearance. Augustus Woodward's plan following the 1805 fire for Detroit's baroque styled radial avenues and Grand Circus Park. Following a historic fire in 1805, Judge Augustus B. Woodward devised a plan similar to Pierre Charles L'Enfant's design for Washington, D.C.. Detroit's monumental avenues and traffic circles fan out in a baroque styled radial fashion from Grand Circus Park in the heart of the city's theater district, which facilitates traffic patterns along the city's tree-lined boulevards and parks. The 'Woodward plan' proposed a system of hexagonal street blocks, with the Grand Circus at its center. Wide avenues, alternatively and , would emanate from large circular plazas like spokes from the hub of a wheel. As the city grew these would spread in all directions from the banks of the Detroit River. When Woodward presented his proposal, Detroit had fewer than 1,000 residents. Elements of the plan were implemented. Most prominent of these are the five main \\"spokes\\" of Woodward, Michigan, Gratiot, Grand River and Jefferson Avenues. The Mile Road System in Metro Detroit and Southeast Michigan facilitates ease of navigation in the region. It was established as a way to delineate east‚Äìwest roads through the Detroit area and the surrounding rural rim. The Mile Road system, and its most famous road, 8 Mile Road, came about largely as a result of the Land Ordinance of 1785, which established the basis for the Public Land Survey System in which land throughout the Northwest Territory was surveyed and divided into survey townships by reference to a baseline (east‚Äìwest line) and meridian (north‚Äìsouth line). In Southeast Michigan, many roads would be developed parallel to the base line and the meridian, and many of the east‚Äìwest roads would be incorporated into the Mile Road System. The Mile Road System extended easterly into Detroit, but is interrupted, because much of Detroit's early settlements and farms were based on early French land grants that were aligned northwest-to-southeast with frontage along the Detroit River and on later development along roads running into downtown Detroit in a star pattern, such as Woodward, Jefferson, Grand River, Gratiot, and Michigan Avenues, developed by Augustus Woodward in imitation of Washington, D.C.'s system. As Detroit grew, several Mile Roads were given new names within the city borders, while some roads incorporated as part of the Mile Road System have traditionally been known by their non-mile names. It is unclear if they ever bore mile numbers formally. The baseline used in the survey of Michigan lands runs along 8 Mile Road, which is approximately eight miles directly north of the junction of Woodward Avenue and Michigan Avenue in downtown Detroit. As a result, the direct east‚Äìwest portion of Michigan Avenue, and M‚Äë153 (Ford Road) west of Wyoming Avenue, forms the \\"zero mile\\" baseline for this mile road system. The precise point of origin is located in Campus Martius Park, marked by a medallion embedded in the stone walkway. It is situated in the western point of the diamond surrounding Woodward Fountain, just in front of the Fountain Bistro. Freeways View of southbound lanes of Northwestern Highway in Metro Detroit passing beside John C. Lodge Freeway M‚Äë10 which is sunken below street level in front of the Southfield Town Center325px Satellite image of the terminus at I‚Äë275 nicknamed the \\"mixing bowl\\" * (known as the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway from Downtown Detroit to Pontiac in the north and Fisher Freeway though southern and central Detroit) is the region's main north‚Äìsouth route, serving Flint (and points north to Sault Ste. Marie), Pontiac, Troy, and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Detroit-Toledo and Seaway Freeways) to serve the Downriver communities and further south, many of the communities along the shore of Lake Erie, most notably Toledo, Ohio before continuing to Florida. * (Edsel Ford Freeway & Detroit Industrial Freeway) runs east‚Äìwest through Detroit and serves Ann Arbor to the west (where it continues to West Michigan and Chicago) and Port Huron to the northeast. The stretch of the current I‚Äë94 freeway from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one of America's earlier limited-access highways. Henry Ford built it to link his factories at Willow Run and Dearborn during World War II. It also serves the north access to the Detroit Metro Airport in Romulus. A portion was known as the Willow Run Expressway. * runs east‚Äìwest through Livingston, Oakland and Wayne counties and has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit. The portion east of I‚Äë275 is known and signed as the Jeffries Freeway, named for Edward Jeffries (a former mayor of Detroit); however, this portion of I‚Äë96 was officially renamed by the state legislature as the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway in December 2005. * runs north‚Äìsouth from I‚Äë75 in the south to the junction of I‚Äë96 and I‚Äë696 in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit. Originally intended to travel north 23 miles (originally as I‚Äë275 and later changed to M‚Äë275) from the I‚Äë696/I‚Äë96/I‚Äë275/M‚Äë5 junction to the I‚Äë75/US 24 (Dixie Hwy.) junction in Waterford Twp., where I‚Äë75's median was significantly widened in its initial construction to accommodate the future interchange. The planned M‚Äë275 has essentially been scrapped, with the northward extension of M‚Äë5 utilizing the original M‚Äë275 right-of-way but terminating after just six miles at Pontiac Trail in West Bloomfield. * is a short spur route in downtown Detroit, an extension of the Chrysler Freeway. * (Walter P. Reuther Freeway) runs east‚Äìwest from the junction of I‚Äë96 and I‚Äë275 on the west to I‚Äë94 on the east, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit. Taken together, I‚Äë275 and I‚Äë696 form a beltway around Detroit. The Lodge Freeway was previously designated a Business Spur of I-696 before it was redesignated as part of US 10 and later as M-10. * This freeway begins as the stub left over from the Brighton-Farmington Expressway after Interstate 96 was rerouted to the Jeffries. Originally designated as I‚Äë96 and later as an extension of M‚Äë102. From 1994 to 2002, it was extended north as the Haggerty Connector. * is the Davison Freeway. Opened in 1942, this was the first modern depressed limited-access freeway in America. Originally supposed to run as a freeway from I‚Äë96 east to Mound Rd. and then north to join the already-existing M‚Äë53 freeway at Van Dyke Ave. in Sterling Heights. In 1996, the Davison was closed for a year and a half to reconstruct it to Interstate Highway standards with an additional through travel lane and a wider left shoulder for improved safety and traffic handling as well as a new interchange with Woodward Avenue. The reconstructed freeway was reopened 18 months later on October 8, 1997 * (John C. Lodge Freeway) runs largely parallel to I‚Äë75 from Downtown Detroit to Wyoming Ave., where it turns northwesterly and largely maintains this trajectory through the I‚Äë696/Telegraph Rd. interchange in Southfield and then continues as a surface boulevard as Northwestern Highway, terminating at Orchard Lake Rd. in Farmington Hills. * runs east‚Äìwest from I‚Äë275 in Livonia to Ann Arbor. * (Southfield Freeway) runs north‚Äìsouth from Southfield to Allen Park. North of 9 Mile Road and south of I‚Äë94, the freeway ends and continues as Southfield Road into Birmingham and Ecorse respectively. * (Christopher Columbus Freeway from Sterling Heights to Washington), more commonly known as the Van Dyke Expressway or Van Dyke Freeway. Continues as Van Dyke Road or Van Dyke Avenue north to Port Austin and south through Warren to Gratiot Avenue in Detroit. * (Veterans Memorial Freeway from Utica to Pontiac), continues east as Hall Road to Clinton Township and west as Huron Road through Pontiac and Waterford, and as Highland Road further west through Highland and Milford to I‚Äë96 near Howell. Originally intended to be a limited-access freeway between US 23 on the west and I‚Äë94 on the east. =Other selected major roads= *, known by many through the film 8 Mile, forms the dividing line between Detroit on the south and the suburbs of Macomb and Oakland counties on the north. Outside of Detroit it is also known as Base Line Road, because it coincides with the baseline used in surveying Michigan; that baseline is also a boundary for several other Michigan counties. 8 Mile is designated as M‚Äë102 for much of its length in Wayne County. For several years the M‚Äë102 designation continued from its current terminus at Grand River Ave. and followed the old I‚Äë96 freeway to the I‚Äë96/I‚Äë696/I‚Äë275 interchange; this stretch, along with the rest of Grand River southeast to Downtown Detroit, is now signed as M‚Äë5. The portion of M‚Äë102 from Grand River Avenue east to M‚Äë3 (Gratiot Avenue) is designated as the \\"Columbus Memorial Highway\\". * is a major road that runs from Port Huron to downtown Detroit. *Jefferson Avenue is a scenic highway whose northern leg runs between M‚Äë10 in Downtown Detroit along the Detroit River and Lakes St. Clair to New Baltimore. The portion is also the principal thoroughfare for the Grosse Pointes, where it is called Lake Shore Drive. Another important dividing line between Detroit and the city of Grosse Pointe Park is Alter Road, where portions of some intersecting streets have been reconfigured or walled-off in order to thwart vehicular and pedestrian movement from Detroit into Grosse Pointe Park. As a major thoroughfare, Jefferson's southern leg (sometimes designated as Biddle Rd. in some Downriver communities) runs from Dearborn St. in Detroit south (again, running mostly adjacent to the Detroit River) to a point just north of Huron River Dr. in Newport, where its name changes to U.S. Turnpike Rd. and then Dixie Hwy., (both segments of which parallel the Lake Erie shoreline) to terminate in Monroe. In Detroit north of Dearborn St., Jefferson is reduced to two-lane road that is disjointed at Clark St. It resumes one block north at Scotten St. as a side street north to 21st St. (at the Ambassador Bridge over-crossing), at which point a gate frequently prevents traffic from proceeding. From 21st St. to Rosa Parks Blvd., Jefferson is largely unpaved. And between Rosa Parks and M‚Äë10, Jefferson is a four lane road, although this segment is not nearly utilized as much as the portion north of M‚Äë10. The portion of Jefferson between the Rouge River over-crossing and Rosa Parks Blvd. is heavily industrial and bucks the avenue's otherwise consistent trend as a pleasant scenic byway. * runs from downtown Detroit through the western suburbs toward Ypsilanti, passes south of Ann Arbor, and eventually reaches Chicago. * is considered the Detroit area's main north‚Äìsouth thoroughfare. It is the dividing line between the East Side and the West Side. Woodward stretches from downtown Pontiac to the Detroit River near Hart Plaza. In Downtown Detroit, the Fox Theatre and Detroit Institute of Arts are located on Woodward as well as the Detroit Zoo just outside the city. The Woodward Dream Cruise, a classic car cruise from Pontiac to Ferndale is held in August and is the largest single day classic car cruise in America. * is a major north‚Äìsouth road extending from Toledo, Ohio through Monroe, Wayne, and Oakland Counties to Pontiac. It has gained notoriety in a song (\\"Telegraph Road\\") by the group Dire Straits. *Dixie Highway is one of America's historic highways. Its eastern division extended from Miami, Florida, to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The remnants of this highway exist northbound and southbound through the Detroit metropolitan area. * is a major road through southwest Detroit before becoming a major boulevard through Downriver. It extends from Flat Rock to downtown Detroit. *Grand River Avenue runs from Grand Rapids east through Lansing and then connects the suburbs of Brighton, Novi, and Farmington to downtown Detroit. It is one of the five roads planned by Judge Augustus Woodward to radiate out from Detroit and connect the city to other parts of the state. It extends out to Lansing and Grand Rapids (the segment of the road that runs between these two cities follows the trajectory of the Grand River) and is the main road and the dividing line between the city of East Lansing and the campus of Michigan State University. It formerly carried the designation US 16 prior to that route number's decommissioning in Michigan, and now parts of it are designated as M‚Äë5 between Farmington Hills and downtown Detroit and as M‚Äë43 between Lansing and Webberville). There is also a small portion of Grand River Ave. designated as M‚Äë52 as well as several areas where its designation is Business (Loop or Spur) I‚Äë96. Mile roads traveling northMile roads within Wayne County= The mile roads that cross through Wayne County are designated as follows: * 0 Mile‚ÄîMichigan Avenue in Detroit; Ford Road west of Detroit from Wyoming Street, though Ford Road does straddle the Detroit city limits for some blocks. The Michigan Avenue stretch is slightly north of the Ford Road alignment. Occupied by Cadillac Square east of Campus Martius. * 1 Mile‚ÄîWarren Avenue (turns east- northeastward at 25th Street in Detroit to conform with the Woodward plan). Western county line to Mack Avenue on the Detroit/Grosse Pointe Farms limits. Deviates off-grid to the south between just east of Lilley Road in Canton to Central City Parkway Road in Westland. From the west, for a half-mile east of the western county line, it is not paved. * 2 Mile‚ÄîJoy Road (also turns east- northeastward (at Livernois), but for a shorter distance). Western county line to Linwood Street in Detroit. Interrupted twice, first between Hines Drive and Wayne Road on the Westland/Livonia border and again just before the western county line, where its gridline is occupied by Ann Arbor Road. * 3 Mile‚ÄîPlymouth Road. Mill Street in Plymouth (here it continues westward as Main Street) to the intersection of Grand River Avenue and Cloverlawn Street (one block west of Oakman Boulevard) in Detroit. Runs off-grid west of the Ann Arbor Road split in Livonia. * 4 Mile‚ÄîSchoolcraft Avenue/Street (Detroit's west side); Schoolcraft Road (mostly now the service drive for I‚Äë96). 5 Mile Road in Plymouth to Ewald Circle in Detroit. Occupied by Miller Street on Detroit's east side. Note that the 0-4 Mile roads are not signed and never referred to as Mile Roads; it remains unclear if they were ever signed as Mile Roads. There is a Three Mile Drive in the far eastern portion of Detroit and going into Grosse Pointe Park, but it is unclear if this was ever intended to be a part of the Mile Road System. * 5 Mile‚ÄîFenkell Street (Detroit's west side); 5 Mile Road (west of Detroit). Western county line to Northville Road in Northville Township, resuming mile to the south from Northville Road in Plymouth Township (circumventing Phoenix Lake) to Rosa Parks Boulevard in Detroit. Occupied by Lynch Road on Detroit's east side. * 6 Mile‚ÄîMcNichols Road (Detroit); 6 Mile Road (west of Detroit). Western county line to Gratiot Avenue in Detroit. A mile gap exists between French Road and Conner Street/Outer Drive due to a northerly extension of Coleman A. Young International Airport. * 7 Mile‚Äî7 Mile Road (Detroit and west of Detroit). Western county line to Main Street in Northville, resuming 500 feet south from Main Street/Northville Road to Kelly Road in Detroit. A -mile portion of 7 Mile Road in Northville is signed as part of Edward N. Hines Drive. * 8 Mile‚Äî8 Mile Road (Detroit and suburbs); Base Line Road (west of Detroit); also signed as M‚Äë102 from Grand River Avenue to Vernier Road. Lodge Freeway (M‚Äë10) passing underneath the Cobo Center in downtown Detroit Note: On Detroit's far east side, which is aligned according to the French colonial long lot system rather than the Northwest Ordinance survey grid, Cadieux, Moross, and Vernier Roads are not extensions of 6 Mile Road, 7 Mile Road and 8 Mile Road, respectively. East McNichols (6 Mile) ends at Gratiot Avenue, with traffic continuing to Cadieux two miles (3 km) away via Seymour Street and Morang Drive. East 7 Mile Road ends as a short four-lane one-way side street at Kelly Road, two blocks east of where Moross veers off from 7 Mile, taking most traffic with it. Most traffic on 8 Mile Road continuing east of Kelly Road veers onto Vernier Road; 8 Mile continues as a side street eastward for a short distance past Harper Avenue. This is a common misconception by residents of Detroit, Harper Woods and Grosse Pointe, as Cadieux, Moross and Vernier appear to be extensions of their mile-road neighbors, but are in fact roads in their own right. In the city of Detroit, residents only refer to three of the mile roads by number: 6, 7, & 8 Mile. 6 Mile Road is signed as \\"McNichols\\" throughout the city of Detroit, but is often referred to as \\"6 Mile\\" by residents. 5 Mile road, on the other hand, is almost always referred to as \\"Fenkell\\" (which is how it is signed in Detroit), and only very rarely as \\"5 Mile\\". The dual naming of McNichols is an occasional source of confusion to out-of-town travelers. Although not signed as such, Detroit also has roads along half-mile grid lines: * Mile‚ÄîPaul Street (Dearborn and Detroit), Ann Arbor Trail (for a short distance), Hass Avenue (Dearborn Heights), Maplewood Avenue (Garden City), Hunter Street (Westland), Hanford Road (Canton) * 1 Mile‚ÄîTireman Avenue/Street (Detroit (there turns east-northeastward), Dearborn and Dearborn Heights), Ann Arbor Trail (also for a short distance), Koppernick Street/Road (for a short distance in Westland), Gyde Road (Canton) * 2 Mile‚ÄîWest Chicago Avenue/Street (exists in discontinuous segments between Ann Arbor Road in Livonia and Livernois Avenue/I-96 in Detroit; east-northeastward Chicago Avenue is a separate segment); Ann Arbor Road (Plymouth/Livonia between Beck Road and Hix Road) * 3 Mile‚ÄîFullerton Avenue/Street (once again, turns east-northeastward) * 4 Mile‚ÄîLyndon Avenue/Street * 5 Mile‚ÄîPuritan Avenue/Street (once again, turns east-northeastward) * 6 Mile‚ÄîCurtis Avenue/Street (west of Woodward), Nevada Street, Greiner Street (east of Woodward) * 7 Mile‚ÄîPembroke Avenue (west of Woodward), Outer Drive, State Fair Street (east of Woodward) =Mile roads within Washtenaw County= Few of the mile roads continue west into Washtenaw County. * 0 Mile (M‚Äë153)‚ÄîFord Road‚ÄîRuns off the grid to meet M‚Äë14. This is the only portion of Ford Road within Washtenaw County that is paved. * 0 Mile (West of M‚Äë153)‚ÄîFord Road‚ÄîWest to Earhart Road, interrupted between Plymouth and Dixboro roads. * 1 Mile‚ÄîWarren Road‚ÄîEastern county line west to Whitmore Lake Road, interrupted between Berry and Curtis Roads due to M‚Äë14. Paved for a short distance west of Curtis Road. * 2 Mile‚ÄîJoy Road‚ÄîEastern county line west to Mast Road near Dexter. Runs off the grid west of Whitmore Lake Road. * 5 Mile‚ÄîEastern county line west to a dead end west of Whitmore Lake Road, interrupted between Spencer and Nollar Roads, and at US 23\\\\. * 6 Mile‚ÄîEastern county line west to Whitmore Lake Road, interrupted between Spencer and Nollar Roads, where it falls off the grid westward. * 7 Mile‚ÄîEastern county line west to East Shore Drive near Whitmore Lake. Has a T-intersection with Tower Road and then resumes off the grid. * 8 Mile‚ÄîEastern county line west to Hall Road. Interrupted between Spencer Road and US 23 due to Whitmore Lake. =Mile roads within Livingston County= Few of the mile roads continue west into Livingston County. * 8 Mile Road - Eastern county line to Spencer Road/Marshall Road east of Whitmore Lake. Resumes west of Whitmore Lake from Main Street at US 23 to Hall Road. * 9 Mile‚ÄîEastern county line west to Spicer Road. Signed as M‚Äë36 from US 23 to Spicer Road. Runs off- grid west of US 23\\\\. * 10 Mile‚ÄîEastern county line west to Rushton Road. * 12 Mile‚ÄîEastern county line west to Rushton Road. =Mile roads within Oakland County= The mile roads in the southernmost part of Oakland County are known only by their numbers. From 15 Mile Road northward, however, all mile roads have local names, sometimes several. And like Macomb County and Detroit, some roads are placed at half-mile intervals. * 8 Mile Road * 8 Mile Road‚ÄîMadge Avenue (Hazel Park), Wordsworth and Alberta Streets (Ferndale), Northend Avenue (Oak Park and Royal Oak Township), Midway Avenue/Road and Frederick Street (Southfield), Independence and Colfax Streets (Farmington Hills) * 9 Mile Road, from the western county line (Dixboro Road) to Folsom Road east of Farmington Road (Farmington), resuming at Grand River Avenue/South Orchard Lake Road in Farmington to the eastern county line (Dequindre Road). A short residential segment between Freedom Road and Grand River Avenue in the Farmington gap is signed as 9 Mile Road, but is not connected to the main segments. * 9 Mile Road‚ÄîFink Avenue and Eldon Street (Farmington Hills), Mount Vernon Street (Southfield), Oak Park Boulevard (Oak Park), Woodward Heights Boulevard (Ferndale, Hazel Park) * 10 Mile Road‚ÄîLake Street (through South Lyon), overtaken by Grand River Avenue in Farmington Hills, resumes from Farmington Road in Farmington; service drive for I‚Äë696 from approximately Coolidge Highway to I‚Äë75, where I‚Äë696 swerves north a half-block before turning northeastward near Dequindre Road. * 10 Mile Road‚ÄîLincoln Avenue, Civic Center Drive (Southfield) * 11 Mile Road‚Äîservice drive for I‚Äë696 from approximately Greenfield Road to approximately Lahser Road, where I‚Äë696 swerves slightly south. Exists in several disconnected segments to the west. * 11 Mile Road‚ÄîGardenia Avenue, Catalpa Drive, Saratoga Boulevard, Winchester Street * 12 Mile Road, continuous from Dequindre Road to Beck Road/I-96. Several discontinuous segments to the west. * 12 Mile Road‚ÄîWebster Road * 13 Mile Road, from the eastern county line to Old Novi Road/South Lake Drive in Novi * 13 Mile Road‚ÄîWhitcomb Avenue, Normandy Road, Beverly Road * 14 Mile Road, from the eastern county line to Southfield Road at the border of Birmingham and Beverly Hills, resuming from Evergreen Road to East Walled Lake Road at the eastern shore of Walled Lake.

One notable exception is Hall Road, which is part of M‚Äë59 and almost never referred to as 20 Mile Road. In Macomb County 16 Mile Road and Metropolitan Parkway are used interchangeably. Note: there were some roads listed as xx-half Mile Roads, and placed in between the roads, such as 13 Mile Road, 13 Mile Road, 14 Mile Road, in that succession for example. Some are signed as such. * 8 Mile Road * 8¬Ω Mile Road‚ÄîToepfer Drive * 9 Mile Road * 9¬Ω Mile Road‚ÄîStephens Drive * 10 Mile Road * 10¬Ω Mile Road‚ÄîFrazho Road and Lincoln Avenue * 11 Mile Road‚ÄîI‚Äë696 Service Drive from I‚Äë94 to roughly Dequindre Road * 11¬Ω Mile Road‚ÄîMartin Road, called \\"Tank Avenue\\" for part of its length running through the old Arsenal property between Van Dyke and Mound * 12 Mile Road * 12¬Ω Mile Road‚ÄîCommon Road * 13 Mile Road, partly diverted between Hoover and Mound to become Chicago Road because the General Motors Technical Center was built over its old alignment.

However, although not signed as mile roads, major roads still lie at intervals in Lapeer County and in fact a few major roads that start in and around the city of Flint continue east into Lapeer County. * 38 Mile Road‚ÄîBordman Road/Davison Lake Road * 39 Mile Road‚ÄîHough Road * 40 Mile Road‚ÄîAlmont Road, St. Clair Street, General Squier Road * 41 Mile Road‚ÄîTubspring Road * 42 Mile Road‚ÄîDryden Road * 43 Mile Road‚ÄîHollow Corners Road * 44 Mile Road‚ÄîWebster Road, Ross Road, Sutton Road * 45 Mile Road‚ÄîHunters Creek Road * 46 Mile Road‚ÄîNewark Road * 47 Mile Road‚ÄîBelle River Road * 48 Mile Road‚ÄîAttica Road * 49 Mile Road‚ÄîDavison Road (west of Lapeer, eastern continuation of a major section-line road that starts in Flint); Imlay City Road (between Lapeer and Van Dyke); Weyer Road (east of Van Dyke) * 50 Mile Road‚ÄîOregon Road (west of Lapeer); Bowers Road (east of Lapeer) * 51 Mile Road‚ÄîMcDowell Road, Davis Lake Road, Haines Road, Utley Road, Muck Road, Norman Road * 52 Mile Road‚ÄîDaley Road, Armstrong Road, Turner Road * 53 Mile Road‚ÄîColdwater Road (eastern continuation of a major section-line road in the Flint area), portions of Marathon and Flint River Roads, Mountview Road, King Road, Lyons Road, Speaker Road * 54 Mile Road‚ÄîStanley Road (eastern continuation of a major section-line road in the Flint area), Coulter Road, Reside Road * 55 Mile Road‚ÄîMount Morris Road (eastern continuation of a major section-line road in the Flint area), Sawdust Corners Road, Curtis Road, Martin Road, Abbott Road * 56 Mile Road‚ÄîPyles Road, Norway Lake Road, Clear Lake Road * 57 Mile Road‚ÄîColumbiaville Road (turns southeast as Pine Street from the east and southwest as 2nd Street from the west within Columbiaville), Mott Road, Willis Road * 58 Mile Road‚ÄîPiersonville Road, Miller Lake Road (briefly), Hasslick Road, Deanville Road * 59 Mile Road‚ÄîSister Lake Road, Barnes Lake Road, Johnson Mill Road, Martus Road, Wilcox Road * 60 Mile Road‚ÄîHowell Road, Burnside Road (part of M-90 east of Van Dyke) * 61 Mile Road‚ÄîOtter Lake Road, Tozer Road, Elm Creek Road, Brooks Road * 62 Mile Road‚ÄîCastle Road, Stiles Road * 63 Mile Road‚ÄîElmwood Road, Dwyer Road, Peck Road * 64 Mile Road‚ÄîBarnes Road * 65 Mile Road‚ÄîMillington Road, Montgomery Road * 66 Mile Road‚ÄîMurphy Lake Road * 67 Mile Road‚ÄîSwaffer Road, Markle Road, Soper Road * 68 Mile Road‚ÄîBrown Road, Marlette Road (northern border of Lapeer County) =8 Mile Road= Locally, 8 Mile Road is considered the political and social dividing line between the city of Detroit and its northern suburbs. (It marks most of the northern boundary of both Detroit and Wayne County.) In 2002 this local notoriety was promoted to international attention, reflected in the name of Eminem's acclaimed film, 8 Mile. =16 Mile Road= The alignment for 16 Mile Road through Oakland and Macomb Counties is composed of five named roads: * Buno Road (through Milford Township) * Walnut Lake Road (through West Bloomfield Township) * Quarton Road (from Inkster Road to Woodward Avenue) * Big Beaver Road (from Woodward to Dequindre) * Metropolitan Parkway (from Dequindre to Metro Beach Metropark) Walnut Lake Road turns slightly southward in West Bloomfield and runs parallel to Quarton Road to the south, between Inkster and Franklin Roads. West and East Quarton Roads are disconnected slightly by Telegraph Road due to Gilbert Lake. Walnut Lake Road ends at Haggerty Road in Commerce Township and the grid-alignment of 16 Mile Road remains non-existent through much of the township. Buno Road continues this grid alignment in Milford =Addresses= With a few exceptions, one can determine which mile roads an address is between on major north‚Äìsouth roads north of Five Mile/Fenkell by using the formula: :[(first two numbers of the address)-5] / 2 ::Example: 34879 Gratiot Avenue [(34-5)/2]= 14.5 which indicates the address is between 14 Mile and 15 Mile roads. In the early days of Detroit-area house numbering, surveyors calculated position on the grid of mile roads to define addresses. The resulting system, adopted in 1921 and sometimes referred to as the Detroit Edison system, generally assigns 2000 addresses to each mile. (There are often gaps in the numbering; for instance, east addresses 9000 to 10999 and north addresses 2300 to 5599 [at Ford Road] are skipped). Addresses in the Detroit area tend to be much higher than in many other major cities, with numbers in the 20000s common within the city limits and in the inner-ring suburbs. Typically, addresses of single family homes on adjacent lots on the grid system, both within Detroit and in the suburbs, are incremented by 8, 10, 12 or more rather than by 2 as is the case in most other large cities in the United States. Addresses are generally numbered outwards from Woodward Avenue (south of McNichols Road) and John R. Street (north of McNichols) for numbers on east‚Äìwest roads and from the Detroit River (east of the Ambassador Bridge), a Norfolk Southern Railway/CSX Transportation railroad line between the Ambassador Bridge and the Rouge River, the Rouge River itself north to just past Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, an imaginary line from there to the eastern end of Cherry Hill Road and Cherry Hill Road for numbers on north‚Äìsouth streets, with the numbers increasing the further one is from these baselines. The highest addresses used in the Detroit system are the range 79000 to 80999, for north‚Äìsouth roads beyond 37 Mile Road in northern Macomb County, and from 81000 to the high 81900s in the portion of the city of Memphis that bulges about into St. Clair County. For many years, the Guinness Book of World Records incorrectly listed 81951 Main Street (M‚Äë19) in Memphis as the highest street address number anywhere, but higher numbers are in use elsewhere, such as Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park at 127011 Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway in Orick, California. The Detroit system also extends as far west as Lyon Charter Township, whose supervisor's offices are located at 58000 Grand River Avenue,Lyon Township - Supervisor's Office and as far south as the southernmost border of Wayne County. The westernmost street within the city of Detroit is Five Points Street, which is a north‚Äìsouth half- mile road located along the border with Redford Charter Township halfway between Telegraph and Beech-Daly Roads and runs north from Puritan Street to 8 Mile Road. The easternmost point of the city is located in the intersection of Mack Avenue and Kingsville Street, which is located east-southeast of Interstate 94 along the border with Grosse Pointe Farms and Grosse Pointe Woods. The city's southernmost point is within the median of Outer Drive at the intersection of the borders with Ecorse and Lincoln Park just east of Bassett Street, eight-and-a-half-blocks east-southeast of Fort Street. Even though many suburbs also use the Detroit system, there are several that border those using the Detroit system that instead use their own numbering systems, these include Belleville, Berkley, Birmingham, Ecorse (whose system extends west into Lincoln Park), Ferndale, Grosse Pointe Farms (whose system also extends into Grosse Pointe Shores), Mount Clemens, Northville, Pleasant Ridge, Plymouth, River Rouge (although it uses the Detroit system for addresses on Jefferson Avenue), Rochester (whose system also extends into Rochester Hills), Romeo, Royal Oak (whose system has a baseline for north‚Äìsouth numbers at 11 Mile Road and one for east‚Äìwest numbers at Main Street), South Lyon, Trenton and Wyandotte. Addresses on Woodward Avenue use the Detroit system in all cities. Clawson also uses its own street numbering system with its north‚Äìsouth number baseline along 14 Mile Road and its east‚Äìwest number baseline along Main Street/Livernois Avenue; its system also extends north into Troy. Pontiac also has a numbering system of its own, numbered radiating away from Saginaw Street (downtown), Woodward Avenue (south of downtown), and Baldwin Road (north of downtown) for east‚Äìwest numbers and Pike (downtown eastward) and Huron (west of downtown) Streets for north‚Äìsouth numbers; its system also extends into Auburn Hills, as far north as Independence Charter Township, south to Bloomfield Township and Bloomfield Hills, and west to White Lake Township. Mile roads traveling south The grid continues south of Ford Road, although not numbered as part of the Mile Road System. None of these roads connect to Detroit. Further south and west, along the Lake Erie shoreline, and through Downriver, the roads tend to fall off the grids more often, for several reasons, including remnants of the French ribbon farms and natural features preventing straight road building, though west of Monroe, major roads, for the most part, still lie one mile (1.6 km) apart uninterrupted up to, and past, the border with the state of Ohio, which lies almost south of Ford Road. * Ford Road‚ÄîZero Mile Road * Saltz Road‚ÄîSouth Mile, Saltz Road west of I‚Äë275, Marquette Avenue/Road east of I‚Äë275 to Inkster Road, Wilson Drive east of Inkster Road. * Cherry Hill‚ÄîSouth 1 Mile, Dixboro to Dearborn. * Avondale Street‚ÄîSouth Mile, Dearborn Heights to Westland. * Palmer Road‚ÄîSouth 2 Mile, Canton Township to Westland-Inkster border.

On the north, it borders Canton, Wayne, Westland and Dearborn Heights. On the south it borders Van Buren Township, Romulus, Taylor and Allen Park. Just before Lilly Road it falls off grid. West of that point, its gridline is occupied by Yost, Mott, Clark and Scio Church Roads. * Beverly Road‚ÄîSouth Mile (only within Van Buren Township, Romulus and Taylor) * Ecorse Road‚ÄîSouth 5 Mile, former M‚Äë17. Once a major artery to the Willow Run Expressway. West of US 12 in Washtenaw County almost migrates a mile. In Ypsilanti, the alignment is followed by Cross Street, which continues westward to Ann Arbor as Packard Road and Eisenhower Parkway. Becomes Waters Road west of Ann Arbor-Saline Road. * Champaign Street/Road‚ÄîSouth Mile, Taylor to Lincoln Park (side street for its entire length, off-grid east of Allen Road), Robson Road in Van Buren Township. * Wick Road/Hartwick Highway‚ÄîSouth 6 Mile, Romulus to Lincoln Park, divided side street in Allen Park. Ends at Vine Avenue and resumes as Hartwick Highway (despite its suffix is a residential street), merging with Minnie Street at Bailey Avenue and falls off-grid. East of I‚Äë75 it is almost followed by the residential Rose Avenue eastward to Fort Street. West of I-275, its alignment is followed by Tyler and Ellsworth Roads. * Hildebrandt/Kinyon- South Mile‚ÄîHildebrandt Street in Romulus, starting at Middlebelt Road which runs along the boundary of the Detroit Metro Airport, ends a mile after, Kinyon Street takes over in Taylor, but is a residential street and is interrupted several times. Midway Avenue in Allen Park also follows it twice. It is also followed by Buckingham Avenue in Lincoln Park. * Goddard Road‚ÄîSouth 7 Mile, Romulus to Wyandotte, falls off grid just east of I‚Äë75. Moran Avenue takes over to River Drive while Goddard turns southeastward, running jagged to Biddle Avenue in Wyandotte. In Washtenaw County, the alignment is followed by Morgan and Pleasant Lake Roads. * Brest Road‚ÄîSouth Mile - 2nd Street in Wyandotte to Inkster Road in Taylor. Has a few interruptions. Brest Road (west of Wyandotte); Baumey Avenue (Wyandotte) * Northline‚ÄîSouth 8 Mile‚ÄîNorthline Road (west of Wyandotte); Ford Avenue (Wyandotte). Interrupted by the Metro Airport, then west of there, meanders northwest with Wabash Street taking over just west of the CSX railroad crossing, ends at Hannan Road and becomes a service drive for I‚Äë94. West of that point, its alignment is followed by Huron River Drive, which continues into Washtenaw County as Textile Road. * Superior‚ÄîSouth Mile‚ÄîSuperior Street/Road (west of Wyandotte). Almost followed by Vinewood Avenue within Wyandotte * Eureka Road‚ÄîSouth 9 Mile, forms southern boundary of Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Veers off-grid and becomes a boulevard between Wayne Road and just east of Merriman Road, featuring a trumpet interchange that provides access from the south along this portion. Becomes Hull Road west of the Huron River. In Washtenaw County, its alignment is followed by Merritt and Bethel Church Roads * Leroy Street‚ÄîSouth Mile‚ÄîLeroy Street (west of Wyandotte); Grove Street (Wyandotte) * Pennsylvania‚ÄîSouth 10 Mile, township border road. Borders Wyandotte, Southgate, Taylor and Romulus on the north side and Riverview, Brownstown Township and Huron Township to the south. Becomes Bemis Road west of the Huron River. * Prescott‚ÄîSouth Mile‚ÄîPrescott (Huron Township); Crawford (Brownstown Township); Longsdorf Street (Riverview). Is interrupted near its western end by the former Pinnacle Race Course. * Sibley Road‚ÄîSouth 11 Mile, Jefferson on the Riverview/Trenton limits to Huron River Drive in New Boston. Becomes Willis Road west of the Huron River. * Bredow Road/Avenue‚ÄîSouth Mile‚ÄîAlmost followed by Greentrees Drive in Riverview. * King Road‚ÄîSouth 12 Mile, Jefferson in Trenton to Vining Road in Huron Township. Becomes Judd Road west of the Huron River. * Carter Road‚ÄîSouth Mile‚ÄîCarter (west of Trenton); Harrison Avenue (Trenton) * Huron Road/West Road‚ÄîSouth 13 Mile‚ÄîHuron (west of I‚Äë275); West (east of I‚Äë275).

Similar to McNichols Road in Detroit, Wyandotte residents refer to Northline Road (south 8 Mile) as such, although it is signed as Ford Avenue within the city. The north‚Äìsouth mile grid There are many roads through Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and even Monroe, Washtenaw and Livingston counties that parallel the Michigan Meridian, creating a grid- type system. Like the east‚Äìwest Mile Road System, the north‚Äìsouth grid roads lose cohesion to the grid in much of Detroit, the Grosse Pointes, eastern Downriver, and in the lake-filled areas of Oakland County. Proceeding west from Lake St. Clair: * Greater Mack Avenue‚ÄîResidential street, cuts off several times between 10 and 15 Mile before becoming a steady street. Mack Avenue in Detroit. * Little Mack Avenue‚ÄîApproximately 9‚Äì16 Mile, cutting off once at 14 Mile. Gridline taken by Heydenreich Road in the northern suburbs. * Kelly Road and Romeo Plank Road (Between Clinton River Road and roughly 24 Mile Road) Becomes diagonal at 9 Mile and remains that way to Hayes Street in Detroit. * Garfield Road‚ÄîFrom Utica Road in Fraser to 22 Mile Road in Macomb Township. * Hayes Road‚ÄîAlthough not fully contiguous, Hayes Road is a township border road through eastern Macomb County. Terminates at 28 Mile. Also continues south of 8 Mile in Detroit as Hayes Street to the large intersection of Harper, Chalmers and Hayes just near I‚Äë94. * Schoenherr Road - An example of a gridline road with a divided highway portion. Paved between southern terminus and 26 Mile Road. Terminates at 29 Mile. * Hoover Road, Dodge Park Road, (Chicago Road and Maple Lane Drive connect Hoover and Dodge Park from just south of 14 Mile to 15 Mile), M‚Äë53 Freeway, and Jewell Road. These series of roads follow the same grid line until about 29 Mile Road when Van Dyke Avenue takes over. * Van Dyke Avenue M‚Äë53 (Van Dyke Avenue) Runs from Jefferson Avenue in Detroit to Grindstone Road in Port Austin. Although M‚Äë53 ends at Gratiot Avenue in Detroit, Van Dyke Avenue itself actually continues to Jefferson Avenue in Detroit, adjacent to the Detroit River. At 18-Mile Road in Sterling Heights, M‚Äë53 splits off towards the east into a freeway, and the grid road (old M‚Äë53) continues northward as the Van Dyke Road (also signed in some places as the Earle Memorial Highway). South of 28 Mile Road, Van Dyke begins a northeast shift to a mile eastward and Camp Ground Road takes over to continue the grid. * Mound Road - Originally planned to be at least partially a freeway, connecting the Davison Freeway with I‚Äë696 and the M‚Äë53 Freeway, hence the massive stacked interchange at I‚Äë696. Mound Road is the Avenue due north of the Renaissance Center. Not fully contiguous, falling off the grid as it turns into Auburn Road just north of M59. Resumes back to its grid just south of 23 Mile Road and ends at 32 Mile Road. * Ryan Road‚ÄîRuns from 23 Mile in Shelby Township through Sterling Heights, Warren and into Detroit before falling off the grid at Davison. * Dequindre Road‚ÄîThe borderline between Oakland and Macomb Counties. Not fully contiguous, falling off the grid briefly at 26 Mile before resuming just north of 28 Mile. * John R Road‚ÄîBegins at Bloomer Park in Rochester just north of 23 Mile (Avon Rd.) and continues south to McNichols. Past that it turns to run parallel with Woodward to downtown Detroit. * Stephenson Highway‚ÄîBranches off of Rochester Road south of the Troy I‚Äë75 Interchange. Rochester turns west before turning back south and running parallel with Stephenson. Stephenson becomes the service drive for I‚Äë75 at 12 Mile. * Campbell Road‚ÄîBegins at 14-Mile. Runs parallel to Stephenson Highway and Rochester Road. Continues past I‚Äë696/10 Mile Rd. as Hilton Road in Ferndale, with its southern terminus at M‚Äë102 8 Mile Rd. North of I‚Äë696/10 Mile Rd., the road runs in Royal Oak and Madison Heights, and it serves as the border between the two cities for most of the stretch. * Rochester Road (north of Troy I‚Äë75 interchange). Known as Main Street in downtown Rochester. Splits off to Stevenson Highway and turns west for a short path until it turns back parallel with Stevenson. It continues down into Royal Oak, where it ends at the Main-Crooks-Rochester interchange. Ends in Lapeer County on the northern end. Carries the M‚Äë150 state highway designation through Rochester Hills. * Livernois Avenue‚ÄîDiscontiguous between 9 Mile & 10 Mile Roads. Known as Main Street in Royal Oak and Clawson (between its intersection with I‚Äë696/Woodward/10 Mile and 14¬Ω Mile Road (Elmwood Avenue)). Portion north of 14¬Ω Mile Road signed as Livernois Road. Southward, Livernois extends past Joy Road before turning south-southeastward at Alaska Street to run parallel with Woodward and terminate at Jefferson at the Detroit River. Northward, it ends in Rochester at 26¬Ω Mile as a dirt road. Portion running through Detroit was once known, and dually signed, as the \\"Avenue of Fashion\\" * Dix Road/Highway‚ÄîBegins at Oakwood Boulevard in Melvindale, runs just west of the Greenfield Road line through Lincoln Park and Southgate (where it becomes Dix-Toledo Highway) before turning southwestward at Northline Road. * Allen Road‚ÄîBeginning at an off-grid Greenfield in the same city that Dix starts in, Allen also continues south through Allen Park and at Goddard Road runs along the Evergreen/Cranbrook line as a city limit road with Taylor to the west and Southgate through the east, then going through Brownstown Township and Woodhaven before running parallel with Fort Street to a T-intersection with Gibraltar Road. * Wyoming Avenue/Street, Rosewood St., Crooks Road, Old Perch Road, Lake George Road‚ÄîAlthough disconnected by several miles, these five roads lie along the same grid alignment. Wyoming is the easternmost north‚Äìsouth grid road to reach the Zero Mile road (Ford Road) on the same north‚Äìsouth alignment. 2nd Street in Wyandotte almost follows this grid a few feet to the west. *Meyers Rd. (sometimes incorrectly signed as \\"Myers\\")‚Äì‚ÄìAligned on a half-mile line, Meyers runs from Capital St. (in Royal Oak Township) to just north of Tireman St. (1¬Ω Mile). From Tireman south to Michigan Ave., Miller Rd. follows this gridline and then shifts to a south- southeasterly route to its terminus at Fort St.); and from just north of Capital Ave. to its terminus at 11 Mile Rd., Scotia Rd. follows this gridline. * Schaefer Highway (Detroit and Dearborn), Coolidge Highway (River Rouge and Oakland County). Prior to Detroit's annexation of Greenfield Township, Schaefer Highway was known as Monnier Road. Although disconnected from Schaefer Highway, Gohl Road in Lincoln Park also runs along this gridline, which is also occupied by 15th Street in Wyandotte before falling off-grid (but still on a north‚Äìsouth alignment) at Ford Avenue. * Greenfield Road‚ÄîTownship border road. Begins in Melvindale and runs north to end at 14 Mile Road. Formed the border of former Greenfield Township and Redford Township, now parts of Detroit. Less than a mile north of Greenfield's terminus at 14 Mile, this grid line continues via Adams Road, beginning at Woodward (just south of Lincoln [14¬Ω Mile Rd.]) and runs north to approximately 1/3 mile north of Auburn Road (21 Mile), where it swings about a mile east, then runs north roughly along the Schaefer/Coolidge line to end at Stoney Creek Road (30¬Ω Mile). This gridline is also occupied in the Downriver area by Burns Street in Lincoln Park and Southgate, Fort Street in Riverview and Trenton and Division Street in Trenton. * Squirrel Road‚ÄîUnusual for not following exactly the mile grid lines, Squirrel runs north from Wattles Road (17 Mile) along a north‚Äìsouth line displaced 1/4 mile east from the line of Southfield Road. Squirrel then drifts further east before ending at Silver Bell Road (27 Mile Road). * Southfield Freeway/Road‚ÄîDesignated as M‚Äë39, a limited-access freeway with service drive, for much of its length from I‚Äë94 in Allen Park north to 9 Mile Rd. in Southfield. Follows grid beginning as Southfield Road, a surface street (but without the M‚Äë39 designation), north of 9 Mile Road (ending at Maple Road [15 Mile]) and then south as a freeway to Michigan Ave (0 Mile Rd.), where it curves southeasterly, then southwesterly, and finally, southeasterly again (all within a stretch of less than three miles) and then continues south of I‚Äë94 as surface street Southfield Rd. (but this time retaining its status as State Highway M‚Äë39) to just south of its intersection with I‚Äë75 at Fort St. before once again abandoning the M‚Äë39 designation for the remainder of its route, ending at Jefferson Ave. and the Detroit River. * McCann Road/Avenue/Street‚ÄîFollows Southfield Road's grid line in Southgate and Brownstown Township (near Lake Erie Metropark). * Evergreen Road south from 13¬Ω Mile (Beverly) Rd. to Ford (0 Mile) Rd. (Evergreen swings off-grid north of 13¬Ω Mile), where it shifts sightly to the east before terminating at Michigan Ave. Opdyke Road (pronounced by the locals as ‚ÄúUP- dike‚Äù) parallels the grid but just slightly to the west of it from Woodward north of Long Lake Road (which at that point is roughly 17¬Ω Mile), then drifts further east before dumping into M‚Äë24 (Lapeer Road) just north of Walton Boulevard (24 Mile). Pelham and Allen Roads follow Evergreen's grid from Dearborn to Gibraltar Road near Fort Street. * Lahser Road‚ÄîThe center road for old Redford Township (now part of Detroit), Lahser connects with Outer Drive just south of Fenkell (5 Mile) and runs north to end at Square Lake Road (19 Mile). The name Lahser is often mispronounced, most often because of careless misreading as ‚ÄúLasher‚Äù. Another common but deprecated pronunciation is ‚ÄúLAH- zer‚Äù. Students of Lahser High School in Bloomfield Township are quick to assert ‚ÄúLAH‚Äîsir‚Äù as the correct pronunciation, but many older Detroiters are equally insistent on ‚ÄúLAH‚Äîsher‚Äù (rhymes with \\"nosher\\"). Monroe and Racho roads follow Lahser's grid, in a discontinuous fashion, from southern Dearborn to Brownstown Township. * Telegraph Road - US 24 follows the grid alignment from Brownstown Township to Southfield, where it strays slightly off the gridlines. Telegraph forms much of the western boundary of Detroit. The second Single- Point Urban Interchange in metro Detroit opened at Telegraph and I‚Äë94. * Beech Daly Road‚Äîsimply Beech Road between 8 Mile and 10 Mile, where it ends; Franklin Road in Oakland County roughly corresponds to this alignment north of 11 Mile Road. Formerly known as Jim Daly Road in southern Wayne County. A short gap exists in Inkster, between Avondale Street and South River Park Drive north of Michigan Avenue. * Inkster Road‚ÄîTownship border road; separates several communities, including Farmington Hills and Southfield in Oakland County (where it begins at Lone Pine [17 Mile] Rd.), and Redford Township, Livonia, Dearborn Heights, Westland, Taylor and Romulus in Wayne County (where it ends at Huron River Dr. at the minus 15 Mile Rd. mark). Runs through the city of Inkster. * Middle Belt Road‚Äîmore commonly known, and often signed, as Middlebelt Road‚Äîfollows the grid line from Walnut Lake (16 Mile) Road in West Bloomfield Township. south to Huron River Driver (just south of the minus 14 Mile mark) in Huron Township, although Middlebelt itself continues north from Walnut Lake Road, winding north another to terminate at Orchard Lake Road. * Merriman Road (south of 8 Mile Road), Orchard Lake Road (north of 8 Mile Road) - At its south end, Merriman leads into the Detroit Metropolitan Airport and becomes John D. Dingell Drive It resumes its grid position south of the airport. Orchard Lake Road roughly turns into Auburn Road at the Woodward intersection in Downtown Pontiac. * Farmington Road‚ÄîMajor road north from Ann Arbor Trail and exists as a small, residential road through Westland and Garden City. Venoy Road serves as the major artery although at a grid position 1/4 mile east of Farmington from Hines Park south to Van Born. Vining Road resumes Farmington Road's position south of Metro Airport. * Drake Road (north of 9 Mile Road), Wayne Road (south of Plymouth Road) * Newburgh Road (south of 8 Mile Road), Halsted Road (north of 8 Mile Road) * Haggerty Road‚ÄîA township border road between Pontiac Trail and 6 Mile Road, Haggerty significantly deviates westward south of 6 Mile, migrating to an alignment one mile west within Canton Township. Other roads that follow the border alignment include Eckles Road, Hannan Road, Clark Road, and, in Monroe County, Exeter Road. * Meadowbrook Road, Welch Road‚ÄîSeparated between 13 and 14 Mile. Haggerty follows this alignment in Canton Township * Lilley Road‚Äîaligned on a half-mile line, Lilley forms much of the eastern border of the city of Plymouth, where it is also known as Mill Street. * Novi Road‚Äîfrom 8 Mile north to 14 Mile, originally; north of 12 Mile Road, Novi Road was realigned in the 1990s to meet with Decker Road, which runs 1/2 mile to the east. Very briefly veers to the west to end at 8 Mile because there is a large bridge on 8 Mile over a railroad track where Novi Road would normally end. * Morton-Taylor Road‚ÄîIn Canton Township and Martinsville Road in Van Buren and Sumpter Townships, although not connected to Novi Road or each other, follow this alignment. Morton-Taylor continues northward into Plymouth as Main Street, where it curves in downtown to meet Plymouth Road. * Sheldon Road‚ÄîLike Lilley, Sheldon Road is on a half-mile alignment, and it is a county road from 8 Mile Road in Northville to Van Born Road at the Canton/Van Buren Township border. Sheldon forms much of the western boundary of the city of Plymouth, and is one of only two exits off of M‚Äë14 that services Plymouth. Known as Center Street between 7 Mile and 9 Mile where the road ends. * Canton Center Road‚ÄîIn Canton Township, most urban development prior to the 21st century occurred east of Canton Center Road. Although originally slightly discontinuous with Belleville Road at Michigan Avenue, Canton Center Road was realigned to connect with Belleville Road. Northbound thru traffic into Plymouth Township is pushed through northeasterly on Sheldon Center Road to connect with Sheldon Road, while Canton Center continues as a side road servicing the Plymouth-Canton Educational Park. Taft Road follows this line in Novi and Northville. * Beck Road‚Äîfrom Tyler Road in Van Buren Township to Potter Road in Wixom. Recently, a Single-Point Urban Interchange opened at Beck and I‚Äë96, the first in Metro Detroit. * Ridge Road‚Äîa largely rural route, Ridge veers off to the west significantly south of Ford Road, crossing the Wayne-Washtenaw county line and into the easternmost part of Ypsilanti. At Saltz Road, Denton Road splits form Ridge and resumes the line from Cherry Hill Road to Ecorse Road. Garfield and Wixom Roads follow this line in Oakland County. * Napier Road‚Äîfrom Cherry Hill to Grand River. Napier forms part of the border between Wayne and Washtenaw Counties for the most part, though it does veer off to the west for a few miles. From I‚Äë94 to Oakville-Waltz Road, Rawsonville Road follows the same alignment. * Chubb Road‚Äîfrom 5 to 10 Mile Roads, entire length is gravel. Gottfredson Road follows the same alignment from Brookville Road to Geddes Road, paved between North Territorial Road and Plymouth-Ann Arbor Road. * Currie Road‚Äîfrom 5 to 10 Mile Roads, paved from 6 to 8 Mile. * Milford Road‚ÄîMilford Road starts at 10 Mile and runs north and northeast shortly after the intersection of Huron River Pkwy to General Motors Road near Downtown Milford and continues through Highland Township and turns into Holly road in the city of Holly. Curtis Road, which runs from 6 Mile to Plymouth-Ann Arbor Road, runs roughly along the same line, as does Prospect Road from south of Murray Lake (after winding eastward from Plymouth-Ann Arbor Road) to Grove Street just north of I-94. * Griswold Road, Tower Road‚ÄîTower Road is gravel. Griswold runs from 8 to 10 Mile in Lyon Township and South Lyon. * Pontiac Trail‚Äî Through some twists and turns Pointiac Trail ends in the northeast at Orchard Lake Road at the village of Orchard Lake and takes a meandering southwesterly route to New Hudson in Lyon Township to avoid the nearby shopping center and Interstate 96. This results in Pontiac Trail ending at Milford Road north of I‚Äë96 and then continuing at a three-road intersection of Grand River, Milford and Pontiac Trail south of I‚Äë96. Later turning south at the intersection of Silver Lake Road it goes south and through Downtown South Lyon as Lafayette Street and goes southwest to Ann Arbor and ends at Swift Street one block north of Plymouth Rd. in Ann Arbor. * Dixboro Road‚ÄîOakland and Livingston County line, also runs southward into Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. * Carpenter Road‚ÄîWashtenaw County, former US 23 from M-17 in southwest Ann Arbor to Main Street in Milan. Signed as Dexter Street in Milan. Another portion of Old US 23 in Monroe County follows the alignment from Cone Road (US 23 exit 22) into Dundee. Earhart Road north of Geddes Road follows the same alignment, veering eastward between Goss Road and M-14, staggering eastward at Joy Road, and again at 6 Mile where it drifts further eastward off the grid. Exceptions to the gridline alignment There are some notable exceptions to the gridline system as described above. This is similar to enclaves and exclaves in terms of geographical discrepancies. =East‚Äìwest= 8 Mile *Veers slightly north between Griswold and Taft Roads in Northville due to the ravine. *Interrupted by Whitmore Lake in Livingston County. Traffic carried over Spencer, 7 Mile, East Lake Shore Drive, and Main Street. *8 Mile ends at the east side of Greater Mack Avenue (this segment at its east end starts at Yorktown Street's intersection with Goethe Street), with a discontinuous one- block gap to the west of that portion (land occupied by the closed Shorepointe Lane Housing Community). *8 Mile (proper) veers sharply onto Brys Drive (avoiding Shorepointe Lane Housing) in order to connect to Greater Mack Avenue 2 blocks of the terminus mentioned directly above this note. 9 Mile *Interrupted east of Grand River for approximately 2 miles until west of M-5 in Farmington. 9 Mile diverts south into Orchard Lake Rd. 10 Mile * Interrupted in much of the Farmington area, where its gridline is occupied by Grand River Avenue. 11 Mile * Approaching Telegraph Road from the east, veers north to avoid the Telegraph/696/Lodge/Northwestern Highway interchange. * Approaching Telegraph Road from the west, veers south and becomes Franklin Road once it is off the grid line. * Ends at Farmington Road from the east and continues as Brittany Drive, a residential street that meanders south and west to a dead end. * Ends at Drake Road from the west. Crossing Drake continues as Pleasant Valley Road, a residential street that curves south. * Becomes Eleven Mile Court crossing Halsted Road from the east. This ends at a cul-de-sac where Saratoga Circle exits north. * Breaks into two parts east of Meadowbrook Road at the 96/696/M-5 interchange, where it discontinues westward * Ends at Town Center Drive from the east, is contiguous with Ingersol Drive in the Novi Town Center shopping plaza. * Ends at Whipple and Creek Crossing roads, from the west, west of Novi Road * Ends at a T junction with Wixom Road, from the east. * Continues from Napier Road to Johns Road * Ends at Haas Lake Road from the west. * Approaching Dixboro Road from the east, it veers north and ends, continuing as Dixboro. 14 Mile * Interrupted between Evergreen and Southfield Roads in the Birmingham and Beverly Hills area. =Mutual= This section covers irregularities involving areas where an east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth road would otherwise intersect. All roads involved with a domino effect will be involved in a single summary. *In eastern Washtenaw County, M‚Äë14 runs diagonally. Because of this, it causes other irregularities. From the west, Warren Road falls off the grid to run along the westbound side of the freeway and T's with Curtis Road. Ford and Plymouth roads physically cross each other near M‚Äë14. Ford Road also has an indigenous dirt road segment between Dixboro and Earhart Roads. *6 Mile/McNichols in Detroit is interrupted between French Road and Outer Drive/Conner Street by Coleman A.

In 1948 he moved to Red Star where he played 36 games and scored 22 goals. The highlight of his playing career started in 1950, when he decided to wear the Blue-White jersey of OFK Beograd where he played until 1963. During that period, he played 520 games and scored 184 goals in official matches. Curiously, in his entire career, he has never been sent off. He played for the youth national team from 1953 to 1956, scoring 7 times in 9 matches. He was later a member of the B national team for which he scored 6 goals in 10 games. As far as the A national team is concerned, he played 5 matches, all of them in 1956, and scored two goals. He was also a member of the Olympic national team, during the Olympic Games in Melbourne, where Yugoslavia won the silver medal. He was one of the best forwards at that period, but was unfortunate to play in the glory days of Rajko Mitiƒá, the legend of Red Star and Yugoslav football. For this reason, he was not given a real chance in the national team. After his career as a player, he became a coach in OFK Belgrade.

It was on what is now called the Cotswold Line. The station was immortalised in the poem \\"Adlestrop\\" by Edward Thomas after his train stopped there on 24 June 1914.Harvey, p.11. History Adlestrop station was opened on 4 June 1853 by the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OW&W;) as part of the section of the Cotswold Line from Wolvercot Junction to . The line was originally mixed gauge single track throughout with a narrow gauge passing loop at . The line through Adlestrop was dualled on 2 August 1858, after the sections between Wolvercot - and Handborough to Charlbury were respectively doubled on 18 November 1853 and 1 August 1854. The station had a broad gauge passing loop, but the only broad gauge train to use it was the inspection special, two days before opening. Adlestrop served the rural villages of Oddington and Adlestrop, for which Adlestrop House was the major feature. Facilities for goods traffic were on the Up side (the side for passengers toward London): a loading bank which could hold four wagons, a goods shed with a crane where a further three wagons could be held, with capacity for a further thirteen on the Worcester side of the shed. A signal box was added in 1907, which controlled access to the goods shed as well as to the refuge siding on the Down side which held 46 wagons. A 5-ton weighbridge was located on the Up side near the goods shed and main station building; this was replaced in 1938 by a 10-ton model which cost ¬£160 (). The Down platform was long, while the Up platform was shorter at . The main station building on the Up platform was timber-built and originally designed by Brunel, with the construction being completed by John Fowler. On the Down side a wooden waiting shelter was provided, behind which was the station house constructed in alternating courses of red and grey bricks. On 1 January 1860 the OW&W; became part of the West Midland Railway which, on 1 August 1863, was absorbed by the Great Western Railway. It then passed on to the Western Region of British Railways after nationalisation in 1948. British Railways closed Adlestrop to goods traffic on 26 August 1963 and to passenger traffic on 3 January 1966. The signal box closed on 27 April 1964 and the sidings were made redundant. The site today Adlestrop station site in 2008 The station building was demolished soon after closure in 1966. A station seat and nameboard were subsequently moved to a bus shelter in the village. Trains on the Cotswold Line pass the station site in the Evenlode Valley, where all evidence of its existence has vanished. The stationmaster's house is now a private residence, while the former goods yard is a vehicle dump. \\"Adlestrop\\" poem Adlestrop bus shelter with the station sign Despite the station's demise, it is better- known today than many small stations still open as a result of the short poem \\"Adlestrop\\" by Edward Thomas, written in 1914, which recounts the moment in June that year when the train on which the poet was a passenger stopped at Adlestrop. Thomas's field note books show that the stop was made at 12.45 which corresponds to a scheduled down stopping service, not an unscheduled stop by an express as described in the poem. Other elements in the poem are based on stops by the same train at Campden and Colwall.Harvey, p.11.

Foreign Reports advises energy companies, governments, and financial institutions on world energy issues, with a specialization on the Middle East. The President of the firm is Nathaniel Kern. Overview Foreign Reports Inc. has been in this business for more than 50 years and counts among its subscribers many of the world‚Äôs largest oil companies‚Äîboth international and national‚Äîas well as many other financial institutions. It reports on political developments that are highly relevant to oil markets, crude oil price formation, and related macroeconomic variables. Methods In providing political intelligence and analysis of world oil markets, Foreign Reports uses three simple tools: *Focus: Its Reports focus on political questions that impact oil markets. They are brief (rarely more than two pages), single-topic reports and are transmitted three to five times a week to its clients. They filter out the mass of extraneous intelligence which accumulates every day in today's world. *Facts: The Reports do more than focus on what is truly relevant; they are also the product of intensive efforts to go to difficult-to-access sources to find out what political decisions are being made and why they are being made. Sources are more comfortable and more open in talking with Foreign Reports because they know that their identities will be protected and that the information they provide will receive highly limited circulation. *Analysis: Frequently the focus and the facts are not enough to predict uncertain outcomes. Foreign Reports uses its expertise and experience in world oil markets to create a focused product that is relevant to these markets. History Foreign Reports Inc. was founded in 1956 by Harry Kern, who had previously been Foreign Editor of Newsweek, in which capacity he traveled extensively throughout the world, but especially in the Far and Middle East. Newsweek and Time Magazine during that period were practically the sole elements of the U.S. news media reporting on world activities in a timely fashion. As Foreign Editor, Harry Kern also was Editor- in-Chief of the magazine‚Äôs International Edition and thus had the privilege of picking who or what would adorn the cover of those editions. Since various foreign leaders, or aspiring ones, angled to get their pictures on the front of Newsweek, Kern was a popular visitor in many foreign capitals. In the process, he managed to befriend both current and future leaders and to gain insights into how their policies were developed. Foreign Reports grew out of these unique circumstances, as Kern saw a need among growing multinational companies with sizable stakes around the world for a level of international political reporting that surpassed what was then being carried in the daily newspapers of the period. From Newsweek, he brought with him to Foreign Reports two bureau chiefs, one in Beirut and one in Tokyo. From these \\"bureaus\\" of Foreign Reports came a steady stream of insightful reporting on the regions they covered. Among its initial major subscribers were the world‚Äôs major oil companies, but also other industrial and banking concerns. Oil Crises In the year of its founding, Foreign Reports benefited from one of the first ‚Äúoil crises‚Äù that have afflicted the Middle East over the years‚Äîthe 1956 Suez Crisis, with its concomitant closure of the Suez Canal, which was a great boon to notable tanker owners of the time, who were avid clients of Foreign Reports. Since that time, Foreign Reports has closely covered for its subscribers all the major and minor crises that have bedeviled world oil markets ever since, as well as the broad geopolitical trends that have affected markets and business conditions. The methods it uses to anticipate the unanticipated are relatively straightforward and avoid being unduly alarmist. They are methods that have been refined over time. Most every crisis begins with a series of rumbles, and the rumbles have to be distinguished from mere bluster and bombast. Knowing who the players are, how they think, what they confide in others, their history of risk-taking and their own domestic political requirements is essential. As any potential crisis builds, often over a period of months, Foreign Reports writes up a contemporaneous narrative, covering the story as it develops, often focusing on key details, which, only later, historians pick up on and piece together. Foreign Reports and the Middle East The Middle East, with its vast reserves of petroleum, was an obvious early focus of Foreign Reports, especially as the firm‚Äôs subscribers had substantial equity interests in oil concessions in that volatile part of the world, where Kern remained a frequent visitor to many of the key players‚Äîthe Shah of Iran, Gamal Abdul Nasser of revolutionary Egypt, Crown Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia, etc. Kern also maintained close relationships with the leading foreign policy actors in the Eisenhower Administration, notably Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother, CIA Director Allen Dulles, forging a long relationship with U.S. intelligence, both in Washington and in the Agency‚Äôs foreign ‚Äústations.‚Äù Nathaniel Kern (also Nat Kern) joined his father at Foreign Reports in 1972 after graduating from Princeton University and attending the University of Riyadh from 1970-71 as the first non-Arab student. By the time he graduated and joined the firm, rumblings of the first full-scale ‚Äúenergy crisis‚Äù had begun and the role of Saudi Arabia on the world scene began to be transformed. Within two years of Nat's joining the firm, the world of oil and the Middle East had changed dramatically, with prices skyrocketing and the volumes of crude oil being produced in Saudi Arabia growing steadily. The firm‚Äôs business branched out from providing political reporting on oil in the Middle East into also providing business development assistance to firms wishing to break into new markets in the Middle East, primarily, though not exclusively, in Saudi Arabia. The main areas the firm concentrated in were competitive bidding opportunities in the power and desalination markets. This required an understanding of the technologies, engineering and procurement issues inherent in complex projects, and Foreign Reports brought on board the necessary skilled individuals in these areas. Nat Kern was a frequent visitor to Iraq during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, at a time when U.S.-Iraqi relations were improving, and was tasked by the U.S. government with maintaining ties with certain key Iraqi officials from 1991 onwards, at a time when the U.S. government maintained a policy of shunning any official contact with the Iraqi government. Changing Realities of the Oil Market By the early 1980s, the nature of the world oil business began to change in a number of different ways, all of which affected how Foreign Reports would be able to continue to provide services to its client base. The major international oil companies were gradually losing their equity ownership of Middle East oil production and many needed to forge different kinds of relationships with producing governments. In addition, a new class of players in the oil market was gradually emerging as interest and liquidity grew in the futures market. World oil prices had been practically a secret in the early days of Foreign Reports and had been remarkably stable in general during the firm‚Äôs first 16 years, but it would be another ten years before price volatility would become a major reason for the firm to develop another service for its clients. OPEC did not institute its first quotas until 1982, just as crude oil prices were beginning to come under downward pressure in the market. When prices did eventually start to crash in late November 1985, no other reporting service in the industry had so closely chronicled how that crash would materialize as Foreign Reports had done. The firm had watched intensely how then Saudi Petroleum Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani had wrestled over new ways to price Saudi Arabia‚Äôs oil as he cruised the Mediterranean on his yacht during August 1985. Foreign Reports was the first to report that Yamani, just before that Labor Day, had got off his yacht and signed ‚Äúnet-back pricing deals‚Äù with his main international customers. These deals that would cut all previous supports for crude oil prices and lead prices from the high $20s to the single digits within nine months. Incredibly, in those early days of the NYMEX, futures prices did not start to decline until the day after Thanksgiving. As the pace and sophistication of NYMEX trading has accelerated greatly since those days, and as access to the incredible amounts of information over the internet has exploded, the services that Foreign Reports has offered have also changed, while still staying with time-tested methods: follow the narrative; know the actors; know their characters; understand the rules; understand cultures and histories; pay ever increasing attention to separating the wheat from the chaff in an information-laden age; and communicate concisely and clearly. Current work Foreign Reports continues to report on political developments that are highly relevant to oil markets, crude oil price formation, and related macroeconomic variables. It closely monitors and reports on the political and economic situations in places such as: Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Venezuela. The firm also reports on OPEC politics and examines what oil production decisions might be looming in the near future. Executive and legislative activities in the U.S. which affect world oil markets are also often reported on. * Iraq: Many of the world's major oil companies currently rely on Foreign Reports for their understanding of Iraq's political events, the status of its oil industry, and the broad trends which appear to be shaping the future of the country. With the security situation in Iraq not yet suitable for international oil companies to have much of a physical presence there, and because Western news agencies have a limited number of journalists stationed throughout the country, many energy companies, governments, and financial institutions rely extensively on the political reporting and analysis done by Foreign Reports. * Iran: The political and economic events in Iran are often discussed, yet rarely understood. Foreign Reports has shown an ability to look beyond the bluster and bombast coming out of Iran, in an attempt to understand what is really making things work in its domestic and international affairs. Recent reports have analyzed President Ahmadinejad's unique economic policies; Iranian involvement in Iraq; the effects of sanctions and the trajectory of the nuclear file; the Iranian risk premium; Iran's winter gas crisis; and Iran's inability to sell the heavy sour crude from its Nowruz and Soroush fields. * Saudi Arabia: With extensive experience and contacts in Saudi Arabia, Foreign Reports is able to report with confidence on the country with the largest oil reserves, highest level of oil production, and the highest spare production capacity. Political and economic decisions made by the Kingdom are critical to world oil markets, and Foreign Reports closely follows these developments. Recent reports have analyzed Saudi oil policies; the Saudi viewpoint on oil prices; the development of the 500,000 b/d project soon to be brought online from the Kingdom's Khursaniyah field; and the 1.2 million b/d project at the Khurais field expected to be brought online in June 2009.

Darrow was born in the East New York section of Brooklyn. Darrow had plenty of opportunity to observe would-be mobsters and their attitudes while growing up in his neighborhood in Brooklyn. As a teenager, he gravitated towards show business, entering and winning talent shows while working odd jobs. After ten years of singing in nightclubs, Darrow received an offer to appear in what turned out to be a cult film, Street Trash in which he played a mobster. Several months after Street Trash, Darrow was contacted by the film director Martin Scorsese. It turned out that Scorsese had seen Street Trash and wanted him to audition for a role in Goodfellas. He was successful and was cast as the owner of the Bamboo Lounge, Sonny. Darrow was also in the Woody Allen films Bullets over Broadway, Mighty Aphrodite, Deconstructing Harry, Small Time Crooks and Sweet and Lowdown. In 1999, Darrow played a large role in Analyze This with Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. The following year, he appeared in Mickey Blue Eyes with Hugh Grant, and got another big role as mobster Larry Barese in the HBO hit series The Sopranos, which he was on for the entire series run (1999‚Äì2007).

Along with Gambino crime family soldier Joseph \\"Joey Boy\\" Orlando and associate Giovanni \\"Johnny\\" Monteleone, Darrow was accused of ordering the maiming of a man in Monticello, New York who owed money to a loan shark. Darrow and Orlando both pleaded guilty in federal court to these charges on February 2011, in exchange for a sentence of up to 33 months. However, Monteleone cooperated with the FBI. At sentencing, Darrow's attorney successfully argued that Darrow's 50+ year history of community service, medical condition, and lack of prior criminal history warranted a sentence of house arrest, followed by a period of probation.

He was born at Newport, Shropshire, son of William Friswell, of 93 Wimpole Street, London, attorney-at-law, and educated at Apsley School, near Woburn, Bedfordshire. He was intended for the legal profession, which he did not enter, but for some years was obliged to follow a business which was uncongenial to his tastes. He early showed a preference for literature, and contributed in 1852 to the Puppet Show, conducted by Angus B. Reach and Albert Smith. Much of his life was devoted to the defence of Christianity. He was a frequent contributor to Chambers's Journal, The Leader, The Spectator, the London Review, the Saturday Review, and the Pictorial World. His first successful works were Houses with the Fronts off, brought out in 1854, and Twelve inside and one out. Edited from the Papers of Mr. Limbertongue, which appeared in the following year. In January 1858 he founded the Friday Knights, a social society, the name of which was changed to the Urban Club on 15 Nov. 1858. One of his most useful publications was Familiar Words, a Collection of Quotations, a work of much labour, which he produced in 1864. In the same year he wrote his best-known work, The Gentle Life, which became very popular, and ran to upwards of twenty editions, including an edition dedicated by desire to the queen. His own periodical, The Censor, a Weekly Review of Satire, Politics, Literature, and Arts, enjoyed but a short life, only running from 23 May to 7 Nov. 1868. He was the projector and editor of the Bayard Series, a Collection of Pleasure Books of Literature, published by Sampson Low & Co., and he also edited the Gentle Life Series, the latter series consisting chiefly of reprints of his own writings. In 1867 he was a contributor to the Evening Star under the signature of Jaques. While on a visit to Richard Brinsley Sheridan at Frampton Court, Dorsetshire, in December 1869, whither he had been invited to meet John Lothrop Motley, author of the Rise of the Dutch Republic, he ruptured a blood-vessel. He was henceforth a confirmed invalid, but continued to work till within a few hours of his death. In 1870 he produced Modern Men of Letters honestly criticised. Mr. Sala, whose life was very severely commented on in this work, brought an action for defamation of character against Hodder & Stoughton, the publishers of the book, and obtained 500 pounds damages. In the advancement of the working classes Friswell took a great interest, delivering lectures, giving readings, and forming schools for their instruction. He also laboured earnestly to reform cheap literature for boys, and his efforts were successful in repressing the circulation of some of the most notorious of the penny publications. The majority of his essays attained great popularity; but his novels did not possess the elements of enduring life. His poetry was memorably savaged by Tennyson in hendecasyllables: \\"...he, the would-be poet,/Friswell, Pisswell - a liar and a twaddler - \\".G Lee, Catullus (OUP 2008) p. xxvi He died at his residence, Fair Home, Bexley Heath, Kent, on 12 March 1878.

Records. Its tracks were recorded during December 1961 to April 1963 at engineer Rudy Van Gelder's recording studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The first in the Verve for Lovers series by Verve Records, the album contains eleven of Coltrane's romantic ballads recorded during his early years with Impulse! Records. The songs feature Coltrane's classic quartet and collaborations with vocalist Johnny Hartman and pianist Duke Ellington. The recordings compiled for Coltrane for Lovers initially received criticism for Coltrane's stylistic move from complex jazz compositions of the free jazz form to a simplistic formula of ballads and blues. Following the initial controversy, the album's recordings gained a legacy as one of Coltrane's most popular recordings and significant in the genre of romantic jazz. The tracks were compiled by producer Richard Seidel and remastering engineer was Allan Tucker at Foothill Digital, New York City. Coltrane for Lovers was issued 33 years after Coltrane's death and nearly 40 years after the original recording dates. The album peaked at number ten on the Top Jazz Albums chart and received positive reviews from most critics.  Background and recording  Coltrane in 1963 Shortly before completing his contract with Atlantic in May 1961, John Coltrane joined the newly formed Impulse! label, with whom the \\"Classic Quartet\\" would record. It is generally assumed that the clinching reason Coltrane signed with Impulse! was that it would enable him to work again with recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder,Porter 1999, pp. 197-198. who had taped his Prestige sessions, as well as Blue Train. It was at Van Gelder's new studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey that Coltrane would record most of his records for the label. During this period of Coltrane's recording career, critics and fans were fiercely divided in their estimation of Coltrane, who had radically altered his style from bebop to the modal and free jazz styles, as featured on Coltrane (1962), his first studio project for the Impulse! label. John Tynan of Down Beat magazine went so far as to call his playing \\"anti-jazz.\\" In the midst of this controversy, Coltrane decided to release his next three albums in order to improve the critical perception of himself. In an interview with music journalist Gene Lees, Coltrane was asked of his musical and stylistic change from modal and free jazz to more simplistic forms and standards. He responded by stating \\"Variety\\". John Coltrane's primary record producer, Bob Thiele, who had worked with Coltrane on his previous albums Live! at the Village Vanguard (1961) and Coltrane (1962), acknowledged that the next three Coltrane albums to be released were to be recorded at his behest and as ballad-themed to quiet the negative criticism of Coltrane's more diverse playing.Henderson, Alex. [ Review: Coltrane for Lovers]. Allmusic. Retrieved on July 19, 2009. The material chosen for Coltrane's next records would be suited for more slow-tempo, smooth and romantic playing, in contrast to Coltrane's forceful, aggressive style that had dominated his previously issued recordings, and which had led to reviewers describing his playing as \\"angry\\". The recordings featured on Coltrane for Lovers were recorded between December 1961 and April 1963, during his early years with Impulse! Records.  Composition  As Bob Thiele intended, the next of Coltrane's releases featured the hard bop form of playing, incorporating influences from rhythm and blues, gospel music, and the blues, especially with the saxophone and piano, and straight-ahead ballads and standards. Ballads, recorded in late 1961 and 1962, was at first criticized as predictable and too simple after the aggressiveness Coltrane displayed on his previous recordings, but was later reevaluated favorably, by some as a masterpiece. On Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, Ellington \\"sat in\\" with the John Coltrane Quartet for a set dominated by the pianist's songs. Some performances had Ellington's usual sidemen, bassist Aaron Bell and drummer Sam Woodyard, replacing Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones in the group. Recording for the collaboration LP John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963) found the \\"classic quartet\\" backing up singer Hartman on ballad standards. Rolling Stone magazine later described the album as \\"...one of Coltrane's least innovative records, but impeccably dignified and elegant\\", and music critic Richard S. Ginell commented by saying that \\"Coltrane's eloquence and the warm, masculine baritone of Hartman can still break your heart.\\" Renowned writer and poet Al Young wrote of the album's most well-known recording, \\"My One and Only Love\\", and interpretation of the song by Coltrane and Hartman: Shortly after the release of his ballad-oriented albums, Coltrane returned to a more experimental phase, recording Impressions (1963) and his magnum opus A Love Supreme (1965). In spite of this, the previous serious of ballad-oriented recordings served in helping increase Coltrane's legacy and influence on romantic jazz.Porter 1999, pp. 224-226.  Release  Coltrane for Lovers compiled eleven of the recordings from this period seen best fit by the compilation's producers for a romance-themed compilation. The album was released in the United States by the Verve Music Group on January 23, 2001. Thirty three years after Coltrane's death and nearly 40 years after the original recording dates, the album entered the Top Jazz Albums chart and peaked at number 10 on March 3, 2001. It remained on the chart for 63 weeks. The album served as the first of several other For Lovers compilations that the Verve label would later issue, including recordings by Sarah Vaughan, Chet Baker, and Charlie Parker. A similar compilation, entitled Plays for Lovers, was released by Prestige in 2003. Another Verve compilation of Coltrane ballads, entitled More Coltrane for Lovers, followed in 2005.  Critical reception  In a four-star review, Allmusic editor Alex Henderson called Coltrane for Lovers \\"an excellent collection that has no problem reminding us just how warm and expressive his ballad playing could be.\\" After discussing how Coltrane's ballad-playing has been undervalued in comparison to his more experimental recordings, in a December 21, 2001 article for The New York Times, writer Ben Ratliff wrote that \\"This collection ... presents all the argument you need.\\"Ratliff, Ben. Review: Coltrane for Lovers. The New York Times. Retrieved on July 19, 2009. Some, however, have criticized the album and Verve negatively for repackaging Coltrane material for an unnecessary cash-in compilation. In The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, Richard Cook and Brian Morton gave the album one out of four stars and commented, \\"Oh, for goodness' sake! We're tempted to tell you that this contains a previously unreleased rehearsal of Ascension, which we have long regarded as excellent make-out music, but it does not. Needless to say, the music is fine ... It's the concept we have problems with. Avoid.\\"Richard Cook and Brian Morton, The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, 7th edn (London: Penguin, 2004), p. 343. In a 2007 interview for Esquire magazine, author and Coltrane biographer Ben Ratliff praised Coltrane's music and balladry, stating \\"His work contains most of the well-known ideals of jazz... If you're interested in improvisation, this guy pushed improvisation to the wall. He was the best blues player of his time. He wrote and played incredible ballads. Record companies are still putting out compilations of Coltrane ballads called Coltrane for Lovers or whatever. You can poke fun at the idea, but if you ever listen to one, they're indescribably beautiful.\\" The recordings compiled for Coltrane for Lovers have endured a legacy as one of Coltrane's best performing and interpreting of ballads and standards. In a September 2000 essay on the recordings, writer Al Young elaborated on John Coltrane's ability during the period of recording the compiled jazz ballads, writing that \\"The rapport between performer and audience smooths and deepens when a player of John Coltrane's caliber breathes personal expression into some aspect of a song's lyric or meaning.\\" Young continued in his review of the album, stating:  Track listing  All tracks have John Coltrane playing tenor saxophone.Track listing and credits as per liner notes for Coltrane for Lovers album ;Track sources *a originally from Coltrane (1962) *b originally from Duke Ellington and John Coltrane (1962) *c originally from Ballads (1962) *d originally from John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963) *e originally from Impressions (1963)  Charts  Billboard Music Charts (North America) ‚Äì Coltrane for Lovers *2001: Top Jazz Albums ‚Äì #10 (63 weeks)  Personnel  Musicians = *John Coltrane ‚Äì tenor saxophone *Aaron Bell ‚Äì double bass (tracks: 3, 8) *Duke Ellington ‚Äì piano (tracks: 3, 8) *Jimmy Garrison ‚Äì double bass (tracks: 1, 2, 5‚Äì7, 9‚Äì11) *Johnny Hartman ‚Äì vocals (tracks: 1, 5, 10) *Roy Haynes ‚Äì drums (tracks: 7) *Elvin Jones ‚Äì drums (tracks: 1‚Äì6, 9‚Äì11) *McCoy Tyner ‚Äì piano (tracks: 1, 2, 4‚Äì7, 9‚Äì11) *Reggie Workman ‚Äì double bass (tracks: 4) *Sam Woodyard ‚Äì drums (tracks: 7) = Production = *Pamala Cestero ‚Äì research *GrowingStudio, Bklyn ‚Äì design *Amelie Hazard ‚Äì illustrations, cover art *Carlos Kase ‚Äì research coordination *Peter Keepnews ‚Äì note editing *Hollis King ‚Äì art direction *Bryan Koniarz ‚Äì production coordination *Renee Rosnes ‚Äì sequencing *Richard Seidel ‚Äì compilation production *Sherniece Smith ‚Äì art production *Chuck Stewart ‚Äì photography *Bob Thiele ‚Äì original production *Allan Tucker ‚Äì remastering *Rudy Van Gelder ‚Äì original engineering *Al Young ‚Äì liner notes  References  Bibliography   *  External links  *Coltrane for Lovers at Discogs *Coltrane for Lovers at MusicBrainz Category:2001 compilation albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Thiele Category:Impulse!

(17 April 1924 ‚Äì 22 May 2008) was an American apiologist, noted authority and author in the field of artificial insemination of queen bees for the purpose of developing disease resistant and gentle bee colonies. Biography Mr. Stephen Taber III, was a world-recognized honey bee researcher. He was born on April 17, 1924, to Dr. Stephen Taber II and Bessie Ray Taber of Columbia, S.C. His father was the South Carolina State Geologist from 1912 to 1947 and the head of the Department of Geology at the University of South Carolina, where he was involved in the engineering of the Santee Cooper Dam among many other projects. =Early years= Steve became interested in bees at an early age, using the banks of the Broad River in Columbia as his research yard. Steve's first commercial beekeeping experience was in 1941 in upstate New York where he worked one summer making $30 a month. He continued working in NY and later Wisconsin where he claimed to have learned much of the basics of beekeeping. =Navy / WWII years= He graduated from University High School in Columbia, SC in 1942 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an Aviation Cadet in October that same year. While serving in the Navy, he taught beekeeping as a sideline job at several local universities. Steve was later honorably discharged from the Navy in September 1945 after the end of World War II. After the Navy, Steve attended the University of Wisconsin. In 1950, he graduated from the University of WI in Madison, with a Bachelor of Science, specializing in Bee Research under the tutelage of Professor C.L. Farrar. =USDA years= His first position was with the Entomology Research Division of USDA as an assistant to Dr. O. Mackenson in Baton Rouge, La. This is where he met his longtime friend Murray S. Blum. It was during this time that Steve pioneered the use of instrumental (artificial) insemination, undertaking some of the first seminal and biochemical investigations carried out with invertebrate spermatozoa. After 15 years in Baton Rouge, he was transferred to the USDA Bee Research Center in Tucson, Arizona, where, in his words, \\"I was my own instructor.\\" Steve traveled extensively teaching, lecturing, and researching. Steve retired from the USDA and moved to Vacaville, CA where in cooperation with Tom Parisian, he founded the company known as \\"Taber's Honey Bee Genetics\\" in 1978. Steve later moved to southern France before returning in recent years to ElginStephen Taber Obituary - Vacaville, CA  The Reporter Retrieved 2018-06-22. in his home state of South Carolina. He enjoyed international prestige as a bee researcher and queen breeder and spoke at beekeepers' conventions across Europe. Steve continued his queen rearing and research work on a limited basis, although he continued to be a prolific writer until shortly before his death in 2008. =Legacy= Some of his students are leaders in the world of beekeeping research today. His book, \\"Breeding Super Bees,\\" will attest to some of his research and his studies around the world. His articles and research publications are still being referenced by honey bee researchers worldwide. Articles written by Steve, and his collaborative efforts with others, appeared in numerous publications for more than 50 years. They include American Bee Journal, Gleanings in Bee Culture, Journal of Economic Entomology, Journal of Apicultural Research and Beekeepers Quarterly.

Popular music pedagogy tends to emphasize group improvisationHiggins, Lee and Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Free to be Musical: Group Improvisation in Music (Rowman & Littlefield Education, 2010). and is more often associated with community music activities than fully institutionalized school music ensembles.Higgins, Lee, Community Music: In Theory and in Practice (Oxford University Press, 2012). The origins of popular music pedagogy may be traced to the gradual infusion of rock music into formal schooling since the 1960s (in the UK, the USA, and elsewhere), however it has expanded as a specialization to include the offering of degree programs ‚Äî including graduate degrees ‚Äî in institutions of higher education.Lebler, Don \\"Popular Music Pedagogy: Peer Learning in Practice.\\" Music Education Research 10 no. 2, pp.93-213 (2008). Some notable community institutions, such as Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and Seattle's Experience Music Project have also contributed to the development of popular music pedagogy through symposia and educational outreach programs. The UK has pioneered the teaching of popular music, the first degree programme beginning as early as 1994 at Salford University. Postgraduate programmes were later introduced, for example at the Institute of Popular Music at the University of Liverpool. There are now more than 76 popular music studies degree programmes in the UK. These programs expanded when the UK government made popular music a core part of schools' music provision through the Curriculum 2000 developments. The effect rippled into other countries as well. Popular music is commonly taught in German speaking countries http://www.iaspmjournal.net/index.php/IASPM_Journal/article/view/571 and in Ghana, for example.http://www.iaspmjournal.net/index.php/IASPM_Journal/article/view/563 It is also increasingly common in Australia. However, popular music courses tend to be based in newer institutions, rather than older more traditional ones, which often still focus principally on classical music.

A gambler plots to rob MacGregor of his money, and he works up a friendship with MacGregor's son by giving him gambling winnings. Arthur, who dislikes the gambler, tells Auld MacGregor where his son got the money he's been spreading around, and the old man fights with his son. Young MacGregor gets in a saloon fight with the gambler, and both Arthur and MacGregor's daughter each fire a gun at the gambler simultaneously. Arthur's bullet kills the gambler, but since she is not aware that Arthur also fired a shot at the gambler, the girl believes it was her bullet that killed the man. MacGregor's son convinces his father to lie for the girl and provide an alibi for her, which goes against all his religious beliefs.

Proof based on non-electronic navigation is also acceptable. Whereas other outdoor recreational activities like geocaching have a precise goal, geohashing is mainly fueled by its pointlessness, which is deemed amusing by its players. (However, a variation on geocaching, known as geodashing, features a closely comparable principle.) The resulting geohashing community and culture is thus extremely tongue-in-cheek, supporting any kind of humorous behavior during the practice of geohashing and resulting in a parody of traditional outdoor activities. Navigating to a random point need not be pointless. Some geohashers document new mapping features they find on the OpenStreetMap project.Cover stories History On May 21, 2008, the 426th xkcd comic was published. Titled \\"Geohashing\\", it described a way for a computer to create an algorithm that could generate random Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates each day based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the current date.xkcd comic number 426 The algorithm was quickly seized by the xkcd community, which used it as intended by xkcd creator Randall Munroe.Beta testing the geohashing algorithm Originally a stub where people willing to try the algorithm in real life were to issue their reports, the geohashing official wiki expanded in the following weeks and was a working website as early as June 2008.History of geohashing wiki main page The current expedition protocol was then established during the following years, with the creation of humorous awards, regional meetups and a hall of amazingness for the various geohasher achievements.Hall of Amazingness Over time, geohashing gained fame across the internet and now counts more than 10,000 expedition reports.10,000th expedition 19,000 users are registered on the geohashing wiki, with only 31 active as of January 3, 2019.Geohashing wiki statistics Geohashing has spread mostly in North America, Europe and Australia.Maps and statistics  Geohash  The sign forbids a geohasher to trespass and reach the location set by the algorithm. His expedition has to end there. Geohashing divides the earth into a grid made up of graticules which are one degree wide in latitude and longitude. Inside these graticules, a random location is set. Geohashers then have the opportunity to go at the chosen location, either inside their own graticule or in a nearby one. If the location is inaccessible or in a private area, geohashers are advised not to try to reach it, although obviously inaccessible locations have been reached several times. In addition to the repeating location in each graticule, each day there is a single global hashpoint, much more challenging to reach.Conquering Nature  See also  * Benchmarking (geolocating) * Geocaching * Location-based game * Orienteering * Questing * Randall Munroe * xkcd ReferencesExternal links * Geohashing official wiki Category:Global Positioning System Category:Hobbies Category:Outdoor locating games ","title":"Geohashing"},{"id":"17956798","text":"Le Nouveau monde is a 1995 French drama film directed by Alain Corneau about post-World War II France, starring Nicolas Chatel and Sarah Grappin.

Mac and Marie love each other, but Mac wants to make something of his life so he travels to the big city and decides to join the Mounties. Forrest, a fellow Mountie, is sent to Mac's old hometown to investigate a smuggling ring. There he meets Marie and attacks her lustfully.

When he returns to his home town, Mac is jeered by his old friends, and even by Marie, for wearing the despised \\"redcoat\\".

When the townspeople attack in a mob, Jacques fights at Mac's side and protects him. Mac refuses to take Jacques back as his prisoner, but Jacques reminds him of his duty as a Mountie.

Objectives and Membership The Guild states its objectives as follows: # To raise the spiritual tone of altar servers; # To promote a conscientious performance of the duties of altar servers; and # To encourage more frequent attendance at the Holy Eucharist, in addition to times of duty.GSS n.d. Membership is open to any man or woman who is an altar server in the Church of England and 'accepts Catholic Faith and Practice'. (In the context of the Guild, Catholic is understood to mean 'of the universal church' and not 'Roman Catholic'.) Organisation The Guild is organised into local chapters, each overseen by a secretary, who is a member of the Guild, and a chaplain, who is a priest and thus a 'priest associate' of the Guild. Chapters meet regularly: a typical gathering takes the form of a specially-tailored version of Evensong called the 'Guild Office': this consists largely of Psalms and Canticles sung antiphonally, culminating in the Magnificat (Song of Mary) and a brief reading from the Holy Bible. The Guild Office will often be followed by a short address and perhaps Benediction. When undertaking Guild activities, members dress in choir dress: typically a black cassock with a white surplice, but sometimes a white or coloured cassock-alb according to local usage. Members also wear a special 'Guild Medal' engraved with the text (in Latin) 'I will go unto the altar of God', Introibo ad Altare Dei, which is the opening line of a well-known prayer said by those preparing to assist at the Holy Eucharist. Ordination of women As with many of the Catholic Societies of the Church of England, the Guild is officially opposed to the ordination of women. On 18 March 2006 the Guild's General Council affirmed an earlier Warden's Statement not to recognise as valid the orders of women ordained to the priesthood and stated that any meeting using the sacramental offices of a woman priest could not be considered to be a meeting of the Guild; however, the Council stopped short of expelling individual members of the Guild who availed themselves of the offices of women priests outside the immediate context of the Guild, instead asking that they 'should respect the stance of the Guild on such matters.'GSS 2006.

As she walks through the streets, the villagers shun her and news quickly spreads that the repentant sinner has returned. The citizens call upon their new minister to force the woman to leave town.

April, 1590) was an English Roman Catholic priest. He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929. Life Descended perhaps from the Gerards of Ince, he was, about 1576, tutor to the children of Squire Edward Tyldesley, at Morleys Hall, near Astley, Lancashire. In 1579 he went to the seminaries of Douai and Reims, where he was ordained 7 April 1583, and then stayed on as professor until 31 August 1589 (O.S.), when he started for England with five companions. At Dunkirk the sailors refused to take more than two passengers; so the missioners tossed for precedence, and Gerard and Francis Dicconson, the eldest (it seems) and youngest of the party, won. Though bound for London, they were driven out of their course into Dover harbour, where they were examined and arrested on suspicion (24 November, N.S.). A contemporary newsletter says that they were wrecked, and escaped the sea only to fall into the hands of persecutors on shore, but this is not consistent with the official records. These show that the prisoners at first gave feigned names and ambiguous answers, but soon thought it better to confess all. After torture in London prisons under Topcliffe, they were condemned as traitors. They were taken to Rochester, where they were hanged and quartered, says Father John Curry, writing shortly afterwards.

The film's scenario, written by Arthur Rosson, was based on an event experienced by composer Ludwig van Beethoven. The film is now considered lost. Plot Joy reigns in a colony of struggling artists because Old Felix, a composer, has at last sold one of his symphonies. The night of its initial hearing at the Grand Opera House, the members of the colony turn out en masse. Too poor for orchestra seats, they gather in the gallery around the old composer. The old composer is happy almost to tears, and when the last note has died away there is a cry for the composer. Felix attempts to utter a few words of thanks, but is smothered with flowers. At his studio his friends have prepared for his welcome, and it is upon his arrival there that be feels the happiness which comes of success. However, at the other end of the hall a different drama is being enacted. A girl sits beside her stricken mother, and as the merriment in the studio reaches its height, her mother dies. After all of his friends have left, the disconsolate girl seeks Felix's Felix. The old musician is touched and he carries all of his flowers into the death room and agrees to lend the girl financial assistance. The following day, Felix legally adopts the girl as his ward. Lon, a sculptor, is impressed by her simplicity and beauty, and falls in love with her. Forrest, an artist, comes onto the girl and is rejected by her. Felix puts up the money for Lon to travel to Europe and study, and Lon secretly marries the girl before leaving, with Felix‚Äôs consent. Forrest overhears when Lon and the girl are discussing their intimate plans, and unaware that they are now legally married, he spreads vicious gossip to discredit the girl‚Äôs reputation, and finally on the eve of Lon‚Äôs departure, he convinces Felix‚Äôs friends that he is right. The old musician is utterly oblivious to what is going on; he scarcely notices that all of his friends are deserting him one by one. They decide to tell Felix exactly what kind of woman he has adopted. Old Felix drives them from his studio in anger. However, he is rendered feeble by the thought of losing all his old friends. He labors with feverish haste to complete his last symphony, but Life has taken too great a toll on him and he staggers into his bedroom and dies. The girl finds him there, and tells his old friends he is dead. They congregate around Felix's bedside, and play his last symphony one more time, hoping his soul will forgive them. Lon, the sculptor, returns from Europe, famous, and while the party of friends are still standing around the death- bed, Lon enters the room and greets the girl as his wife. Now the culprits understand the grave injustice of their treatment of Old Felix, and again gather around his bed in mourning.

She is also the daughter of composer Erwin Gutawa. Although she originally studied piano, Gutawa later switched to vocals. She was discovered in 2004 while practising her vocals, then booked to sing a duet with ADA Band. After Heaven of Love (2005), featuring the duet, sold 800,000 copies, Gutawa was approached by Sony Music Indonesia with an offer to record a solo album. The success of that album, the self-titled Gita Gutawa, led to numerous acting and marketing job offers. Since her debut, she has recorded two more albums, the well-received Harmoni Cinta in 2009 and the Islamic-themed Balada Shalawat in 2010. As an actress, she has starred in two Indonesian soap operas, Ajari Aku Cinta and Ajari Lagi Aku Cinta. She voiced a character for the animated Meraih Mimpi, and made her feature film debut in 2010's Love in Perth. Personality-wise, Dian Kuswandini of The Jakarta Post has described Gutawa as being \\"sweet like cotton candy and warm like a kiss\\"; however, Gutawa has noted that there are people who believe she succeeded through nepotism. Gutawa has received several awards, including Best Newcomer at the 2008 Anugerah Musik Indonesia. She also won the 6th International Nile Children Song Festival in Cairo.  Biography  Early life = Erwin, 2008 Gutawa was born Aluna Sagita Gutawa ‚Äì Aluna Sagita meaning \\"song rhythm\\" ‚Äì in Jakarta, Indonesia on 11 August 1993 to Erwin Gutawa, a composer, and Luthfi Andriani. The first child of the couple, she enjoyed watching her father work on his compositions. As a result, he enrolled her in a classical piano course, later sending her to a vocal course to develop her soprano voice. She received full support from her father, who assisted her as an adviser. In Chrisye's 2003 Dekade Concert, Gutawa performed in public for the first time, after Chrisye ‚Äì who often collaborated with her father ‚Äì invited her on stage. She later described him as her idol. = Music career = In 2004 Gutawa was approached by the manager of ADA Band, who had heard her practising at her singing lessons from the band's studio next door. She was asked to sing a duet with the band's lead singer; Gutawa, although at the time only singing as a hobby, accepted. The duet, titled \\"Yang Terbaik Bagimu\\" (\\"The Best for You\\"), was included on ADA Band's 2005 album Heaven of Love, which sold 800,000 copies. After singing other duets with different singers, including religious singer Haddad Alwi, Gutawa was asked to record a solo album by Sony Music Indonesia. After a year in production, Gutawa's self- titled debut album was released in February 2007. The album was produced by her father and featured songs written by Glenn Fredly and Melly Goeslaw. Well- received, Gita Gutawa sold 150,000 copies in four months and was eventually certified triple platinum. After the success of the album, Gutawa's previously school-oriented schedule was filled with requests for media appearances and sponsorships. This led to Gutawa's mother stepping in and serving as her manager, in which role she continued until she became pregnant. Other members of Gutawa's family then assisted in managing her, with her mother scheduling Gutawa's media appearances and recording sessions. Gutawa soon began singing in music festivals to gain experience. In 2008, she won the 6th International Nile Children Song Festival in Cairo with Ria Leimena's \\"To Be One\\", which she had previously sung on her debut album. That same year she attended a song festival in Italy. She later assembled a girl band to support her after several performances had to be cancelled due to an inability to find musicians at short notice. After her return from Italy, Gutawa began production of her second album, Harmoni Cinta (Love's Harmony), in June 2008. She played a larger role in its production than in her debut album, choosing the concepts behind the album as well as the track listing; she eventually wrote five of the album's twelve songs. The album was released in May 2009. selling well. In August of that year, she released her biography, Kota Musik Gita Gutawa (Gita Gutawa's Music Box). Gutawa followed Harmony Cinta in August 2010 with a third album, the Islamic religious album Balada Shalawat (Ballads for Salah). During recording, Gutawa received coaching from an Islamic scholar, or ustad, regarding the correct pronunciation of Arabic lyrics used in some songs. The album was launched during Ramadhan, with profits donated to Indonesia's poor. Gutawa playing the piano in the Kotak Musik Gita Gutawa concert, 2008 Gutawa has expressed concern that the public sees her rise to fame as being dependent on her already-famous father; she has stated in an interview with The Jakarta Post that she learned that \\"nepotism wouldn't work in the music industry\\". As such, Gutawa has attempted to emphasise that her duet with ADA Band and contract with Sony Music was won entirely on her own merits, with the band's manager not knowing that she was Erwin Gutawa's daughter when he approached her. She also cites the \\"negative sentiments against [her] sudden popularity\\" as pushing her to do her best. In 2011, Gutawa announced that she would be retiring from music to study abroad. As a farewell celebration, her father held the concert \\"A Masterpiece of Erwin Gutawa\\" in Jakarta. She announced that she planned to take a degree in economics. On 5 April 2012, during a visit to Indonesia from her university in England, she performed Chrisye's song \\"Baju Pengantin\\" (\\"Wedding Dress\\") in the Kidung Abadi Chrisye concert at Plenary Hall, Jakarta Convention Center. She and her father also wrote a new song for the concert, entitled \\"Kidung Abadi\\" (\\"Eternal Ballad\\"), which was made by stringing together 246 syllables in Chrisye's voice. = Acting career = After the success of Gita Gutawa, Gutawa performed in numerous television commercials. She later received an offer to act in an upcoming sinetron (Indonesian soap opera) entitled Ajari Aku Cinta (Teach Me About Love), which used her song \\"Bukan Permainan\\" (\\"Not a Toy\\") as its theme. Gutawa accepted the offer, viewing it as a mainly promotional role. She later starred in its sequel, Ajari Lagi Aku Cinta (Teach Me More About Love). In 2009, Gutawa voiced a character in Meraih Mimpi (Chasing Dreams), the Indonesian adaptation of Sing to the Dawn; the voice recording took four months. She later cited it as a good learning experience. The following year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, Love in Perth, in which she played a shy student studying in Perth, Australia. She considered it challenging; for the most difficult part, a scene in which she had to cry, she practised in front of a mirror. In May 2011 she began dating her Love in Perth costar Derby Romero; the couple split up sometime before January 2012.  Education  While in elementary school and junior high school, she was chosen as the best student for five consecutive years. After becoming famous, she continued to attend Al-Izhar Junior High School instead of being home schooled like most Indonesian child stars because she felt that \\"attending a normal school is more fascinating,\\" with more friends and chances to socialise. She later attended Bina Nusantara Senior High School. In 2009, Gutawa was chosen by the education-oriented Sampoerna Foundation ‚Äì run by the investment company Sampoerna Strategic ‚Äì as its first youth ambassador, taking a direct part in the company's initiatives. As one of her first acts, she promised that part of the sales of Harmoni Cinta would be used to send poor Indonesian children to school; every twenty albums sold would be enough for one child. * 1996‚Äì1999 : TK Bakti Mulya, Jakarta * 1999‚Äì2005 : SD Bakti Mulya, Jakarta * 2005‚Äì2008 : SMP Al-Izhar Pondok Labu, Jakarta * 2008‚Äì2011 : SMA Bina Nusantara Simprug, Jakarta * 2011‚Äì2014: University of Birmingham, UK * 2014‚Äì2015 : London School of Economics and Political Science, UK  Styles  In a 2011 interview with the Jakarta Globe, Gutawa said that she continued to treat singing as a hobby despite it being her career.  Songwriting  Gutawa often draws her inspiration from her own experiences, as well as those of her friends. When she receives inspiration, she will write the lyrics down and work out a melody immediately.

Intelligence has been referred to as the \\"lost dimension\\" of the fields of international relations (IR) and diplomatic history, as the secretive nature of the subject means most intelligence successes are unknown.Evans and Newnham, p. 256. Among the academic journals concentrating on the subject are the International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence, Journal of Intelligence Studies in Business and Intelligence and National Security, while other periodicals in the fields of IR and security studies, such as International Security, publish articles concerned with intelligence studies regularly. Many universities, such as Aberystwyth, teach intelligence studies as an independent degree or as part of courses in IR, security studies, military science or related subjects.  Intelligence studies and international relations  Until recently, IR scholars had limited interest in intelligence assessment. Even historical strategists such as Clausewitz and Machiavelli paid scant attention to intelligence.Jackson and Scott, p. 173. In British universities, intelligence studies developed within international history departments, while in US institutions it became the preserve of political science, and even then the subject was approached in terms of public policy and decision-making rather than IR.Jackson and Scott, p. 174. Recently attempts to connect intelligence studies with international relations theory have emerged, such as Andrew Rathmell's work on a postmodern theory of intelligence. According to a 2020 forum in International Studies Review, there are five factors that have generally been important in the development of intelligence studies subfields in different countries: \\"access to relevant government information, institutionalization of research on intelligence and security in a higher education setting, periodic scientific meetings and networks, teaching and learning opportunities, and engagement between researchers and practitioners.\\"  References  Bibliography  * Jackson, Peter and Scott, Len (2005). \\"Intelligence\\", ed.

Early life  Born in Avignon in 1964, he took to the seas at age 16 where he stayed on for two years as a shipman. This voyage, an initiation of sorts, covering the Northern Atlantic to the South Pacific sharpened his sensibilities, taught him an appreciation of open spaces thus allowing the elements to shape his spirit. Back on terra firma for health reasons, never to go back out to sea, he tries to voyage by dabbling in painting, sculpture, music and especially photography, which he holds close to heart. The collection of photos by Brassa√Ø entitled Paris de nuit would inspire his work. He began by learning to touch up photos with an old salt of a photographer who lived in the neighbourhood, then on his own. His career as a photographer was beginning to take off. During a banal portrait shoot he came to the realization that what he was looking at seemed to be more interesting to him through his lens than in reality. It was at this point that he realized that he would be an artist.  Professional career  Over the course of several years he shared his time between personal research, which had him globetrotting from Bolivia to Russia, and his work as a photographer in the press. This world, however, with its own specific photographic language began to wear on Calandre. He decided, at this point, to dedicate himself to a more artistic approach to photography where he could express himself freely. After two exhibits in Paris and Beirut, a Parisian gallery, Zabriskie, decided to include his work alongside those of Weegee and Leonard Freed as part of its ¬´ Une nuit, un voleur ¬ª series (in 1996). A few years later, the National Fund for Contemporary Art acquired ‚ÄòGhost Stations‚Äô, a series depicting abandoned gas stations that the artist came upon during his highway rambling. Philippe Calandre is particularly interested in architectural photography and still life. In all his series, reality serves as the foundation from which he creates his own worlds where an ambiguity, or perhaps even a confusion, between the real and the imagined settles in. His studies often were used as a springboard to highlight everyday architectural aspects, pulled from their daily lifelessness and given life. Gas stations, then his ‚Äòsilos‚Äô, which were presented at FIAC in 2001 by Anne Barrault, the Parisian gallery, with whom the artist collaborated from 1999 to 2007, were lifted to the realm of the supernatural. For ‚ÄòInsomnia‚Äô (2006), which depicts strange nocturnal apparitions Calandre plunges into the world of the fantastic with his pure and spooky scenes. As early as 1996, his various series have been displayed in galleries, museums and contemporary art shows in France and abroad from Greece to Argentina to the Netherlands and back to New York and Taiwan.

It protects Battle Hill, a hillfort built by the Gitwangak people in the mid-17th century. The park was developed by George Macdonald, whose archaeological study was of the site, and who was the Director of the National Museum of Civilization until the opening of its current building. The nearby Gitwangax Village features several wooden totem poles that were originally erected by several 'clans' ('Wilp' in the Gitksan language; 'house' in contemporary use) along the shore of, and facing the Skeena River. After the flood of ca. 1934, they were moved to higher ground, but (in contrast to traditional practice) to face the village. History Battle Hill was a fortress that utilized a strategic location, with a number of different defensive fortifications: rolling things such as rocks and huge logs covered with spikes down the sides of the slopes that surrounded the fortress during raids. This fortress was defended by a legendary chief named (Nehl'xt) he was a warrior that wore a grizzly bear hide for protection which could not be penetrated by any weapons used by the enemy nations attacking. He used a number of weapons most notably a weapon called The One Strike Club to kill his enemy. The Gitwangak people would drop back to this location during raids on the village in the lower part of the Gitwangak territory. This location was never lost during battle. The legends of the battles are recorded and passed on through oral history passed on by the Gitwangak people. The Gitwangak is one of six communities that belong to the First Nations‚Äô group called the Gitxsan. The word \\"Git\\" means \\"the people,\\" and the word \\"Xsan\\" (also spelled 'Ksan) is the ancient word for the nearby Skeena river, which the people thought of as the \\"river of mist.\\" Therefore, the Gitxsan are the \\"people of the river of mist.\\" The Gitxsan have lived in this area for centuries. In the late 1700s, a Gitwangak warrior chief named ‚ÄòNekt decided that Battle Hill would make the perfect site for a fortified village. The steep sides would allow the homes on top to be easily protected. ‚ÄòNekt built his clan home here, along with that of two other clans. ‚ÄòNekt was an aggressive warrior and led many successful raids against neighboring tribes to capture slaves, food stores, or ritual regalia. In retaliation, those tribes got together and attacked Battle Hill twice but were unsuccessful. ‚ÄòNekt was eventually killed during one of his raids. He is remembered and celebrated by the Gitxsan people as a powerful and great leader.http://onejourneyatatime.com/Site/?tag=/Battle+Hill Village The house poles erected between 1840 and 1842 Gitwangak or Kitwanga, which means People of the Place of Rabbits, is the most western Gitxsan village on the Skeena River, and is approximately 241 kilometres from the coast. The village itself lies on the northern bank of the Skeena River in northern British Columbia. It is about 3 kilometres from the National Historic Site of Taawdzep or Gitwangak Battle Hill (formerly Kitwanga Fort). Legend says that the warrior Chief Nekt built the fortified village, which was occupied during the late 18th century and the early 19th century. It was from here that Chief Nekt was able to rule over the much desired oolichan trade routes along the Kitwanga River. The fort was defended by rolling spiked logs down on attackers. As guns grew more accessible the fort was no longer secure, and around 1835, the fort was burned and abandoned. The inhabitants of the fort moved to another village for a brief period of time before moving to the present-day village of Gitwangak. Following their move from Battle Hill to this village about 1835, members of the Frog-Raven (Ganada), Eagle (Laxskik) and Wolf (Laxgibu) clans commemorated their history in a series of carved house poles. The monuments in the present-day village were erected between 1840 and 1942, and each pertains directly to the families who once lived at Gitwangak Battle Hill. The Fireweed (Gisgast) clan joined the village later. Totem poles continued to be erected at potlatches in this village in spite of federal anti-potlatch laws, from 1874 to 1954. Although the remaining poles have been moved several times to protect them from floods, they represent the oldest collection to be found in their original village context anywhere in British Columbia.

Maryland, 378 U.S. 130 (1964), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the convictions of five African Americans who were arrested during a protest of a privately owned amusement park by a park employee who was also a deputy sheriff.. The Court found that the convictions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Background Five African American college students were part of a June 30, 1960, protest which picketed the racial exclusionary policies of the privately owned and operated Glen Echo Amusement Park located in Montgomery County, Maryland, which had a policy of excluding any blacks who wished to patronize its facilities. There were no signs indicating this exclusionary policy, nor were tickets required for admission. The students used tickets purchased by others and boarded a carousel. A park employee who was also a deputy sheriff saw the students and, after consulting with the park manager, told the students that they were not permitted on any of the rides, and had five minutes to leave the park. After the five minutes had expired, they were arrested for criminal trespass. The five students, William L. Griffin, Marvous Saunders, Michael Proctor, Cecil T. Washington, Jr., and Gwendolyn Greene, were convicted of criminal trespass in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County and ordered to pay a fine of $100. The convictions were upheld in the Maryland Court of Appeals, noting the arrests were \\"an enforcement by the operator of the park of its lawful policy of segregation,\\" and did not constitute any acton by the state.Griffin v. Bell, 225 Md. 422, 431, 171 A.2d 717, 721 Court's decision The Supreme Court had previously found that state action in support of segregation was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors of City Trusts of Philadelphia, 353 U.S. 230 (1957). The Court concluded the arrests by the deputy sheriff, acting under his own authority, constituted state action enforcing a policy of segregation and was therefore in violation of this clause. The concurring opinion of Justice Douglas described the majority opinion as holding, under the particular facts of the case, that the state was a joint participant in the policy of segregation. The dissent by Justice Harlan stated that he did not believe that the participation by the deputy sheriff was any different from if a policeman arrested the students after a complaint had been made by the park, and believed that the principles discussed in the dissent of Justice Black in Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 318 (1964) applied to this case. The dissent in Bell had argued that private actions involving segregation were not within the scope of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Critical response Griffin v. Maryland was one of five cases involving segregation protests decided on June 22, 1964. The other four cases were Barr v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 146 (1964), Robinson v. Florida, 378 U.S. 153 (1964), Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, and Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226 (1964). In none of these cases did the Supreme Court reach the merits of any argument addressing whether private actions of segregation which are enforced by state courts constituted a state action which violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. These decisions were announced two days after the Senate ended a filibuster and passed the bill which would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed segregation in public accommodations. It has been suggested that the Supreme Court refrained from reaching the merits in these cases in consideration of the Act; had it done so it would have eliminated the basis for passage of the Act.

He was Mayor of Newark, New Jersey from 1941 to 1949 and the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Jersey in 1943. Biography Murphy was born on August 1, 1893 in Newark, New Jersey the second eldest of 10 children of Thomas Francis Murphy and Sarah Gaskin. At the age of 15 he became a plumber's apprentice. He joined the Local 24 of the United Association in 1913, serving as the secretary- treasurer from 1920 to 1938. He was named secretary-treasurer of the state American Federation of Labor in 1933.\\"Who's Who in Labor\\" (Dryden Press, 1946). Murphy first entered politics in 1937, competing for a seat on the five-man Newark City Commission with 49 other candidates. Though he bested the field, he was denied the position of Mayor (traditionally awarded to the highest vote-getter) because of the opposition of Democratic political boss Frank Hague. In 1941 he again outpolled all other candidates, and with the support of Hague was named Mayor of Newark by his fellow City Commissioners. In 1943 Murphy ran as the Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey against Republican Walter Evans Edge, who had come out of retirement after serving as United States Senator and United States Ambassador to France, as well as Governor during World War I. Edge warned that a Democratic victory would lead to domination of \\"labor leaders, communists and Hagueism.\\" Murphy was defeated by Edge by a margin of 127,000 votes.Biography of Walter E. Edge (PDF), New Jersey State Library. Murphy was reelected as Mayor of Newark in 1945, but he was defeated in 1949, in a year when the Hague machine was overturned after 32 years of domination. He did not seek political office after the 1949 defeat, returning to his role in labor leadership. When the New Jersey AFL put aside its rivalry with the CIO in 1961, Murphy was named president of the newly formed New Jersey AFL-CIO. He served in this position until his retirement in 1970. In 1976 Murphy died at his home in Spring Lake, New Jersey at the age of 83. ReferencesExternal links *Vincent J.

Bland appears to have commissioned oil portraits of several leading musicians of the day from Hardy, although the details surrounding this are uncertain, and published the resulting engravings based upon them. =Paintings= Joseph Haydn portrait by Hardy, 1792 Thomas Hardy is known for the famous portrait of the composer Joseph Haydn now hanging in the Royal College of Music. The subsequent engraving, also by Hardy and published by Bland, has been widely reproduced and copied since it first appeared in early 1792. He is also known for the noted portrait of the composer and pianist Muzio Clementi. The stippled portrait was published on 31 October 1794 by the London music publisher John Bland No. 45 Holborn which is now at the British Museum. Thomas Hardy also painted the portraits of Johann Peter Salomon, Ignaz Pleyel, Wilhelm Cramer, Samuel Arnold, and William Shield (the last apparently commissioned one of the British music publisher John Bland's business successors, Francis Linley). Hardy exhibited four of these portraits at the Royal Academy: Joseph Haydn and Johann Peter Salomon in 1792, Wilhelm Cramer in 1794, and Samuel Arnold in 1796. Hardy‚Äôs portrait of Wilhelm Cramer is at the National Portrait Gallery, London, and his portraits of Joseph Haydn, Johann Peter Salomon and William Shield are at the Royal College of Music. =Controversy= The date of Thomas Hardy's death had been uncertain until now, but the Gentleman's Magazine of October 1804 states that he died \\"after a long illness\\" on 14 September 1804. His life before attending the Royal Academy Schools was also a mystery. The diary of the topographical artist Joseph Farington (1747‚Äì1821), states that Hardy was born in Derbyshire and that he studied under Wright of Derby. Farington adds that he \\"died aged 47 in consequence of a cold caught at the Academy while painting Copies of the Portraits of the King & Queen for Lawrence\\", which is consistent with the Gentleman's Magazine notice. Painter of the same name The painter Thomas Hardy has sometimes been confused with another Thomas Hardy: the shoemaker, radical, and founder of the London Corresponding Society who lived 1752‚Äì1832. Hardy the artist did paint the politician John Horne Tooke, who was associated with Hardy the radical, and the latter two were both put on trial for high treason in 1794.

He has been called the \\"Father of the South Australian Wine Industry\\". History Thomas Hardy was born in Gittisham in Devon. He and Joanna Holbrook, whom he later married, arrived in South Australia on the British Empire on 14 August 1850. While on the voyage he acted as schoolmaster to the boys on board, while one Mrs. J. Gillard is reported as having taught the girls, however that name does not appear on passenger lists. He soon found work with John Reynell at Reynella Farm, and learned much of winemaking from the German fellow-workers. After two years he left for the goldfields of Victoria, where he was quite successful working with a butcher and droving cattle to the diggings from Yankalilla. He then started work on a station near Normanville. In 1853 he purchased a property of on the River Torrens which he called \\"Bankside\\", now Underdale, near the present Hardys Road. In 1854 he planted of fruit trees, mainly oranges, and of Shiraz vines which he enlarged in 1856, then added an acre of Muscatel table grapes in 1861. He made his first wine in 1857 and exported two hogsheads to England in 1859, one of the first exports of wine from South Australia. By 1863 his vineyards covered of Grenache, Mataro, Muscat, Roussillon, Shiraz and Zante grapes. He also purchased grapes from other vignerons in the Adelaide area. By 1879 his vintage had reached 27,000 gallons (100,000 litres). He purchased \\"Brookside\\" of at Marion, South Australia in April 1862, planted it with grapes and put John Western in charge. Western was followed in 1884 by son-in-law Arthur Quick, who took it over in 1910.Bishop, Geoffrey C. in Dolling, Alison The History of Marion on the Sturt Chapter 8, Peacock Publications, Frewville South Australia, In 1874 Hardy, with A. M. Bickford and Sons, W. N. Crowder and others founded a bottle works in Chief Street, Brompton which began production in 1875, and eventually became the South Australian Glass Works Co. Ltd.Parsons, Ronald Hindmarsh Town Corporation of the Town of Hindmarsh, South Australia The Tintara winery at McLaren Vale was built by Dr. Alexander Charles Kelly and purchased by Hardy in 1877 and was used for wine production until 1927. In 1878 or 1879 he expanded his McLaren Vale holding by purchasing a disused flour mill and the Bellevue Hotel (both of which still stand). He started Adelaide's first wine bar. Mile End Former Thomas Hardy & Sons Ltd Wine Cellars, since 1984 the Mile End campus of Temple Christian College In 1881 he built a four-storey warehouse, head office and bottling cellars \\"Tintara House\\" (demolished 1961) at 87‚Äì89 Currie Street. In 1887 he founded Thomas Hardy and Sons Ltd. with his three sons James J. Hardy, Thomas N. Hardy and Robert B. Hardy, and Joseph Rowe Osborn.J. R. Osborn of Upper Kensington was a noted footballer with the Norwood Club and racehorse fancier (as \\"Mr. Rowen\\") and longtime chairman of Burnside Council Hardy planted specimens of various grape varieties at Adelaide Botanic Gardens, but these were subsequently removed to provide more open space for recreation purposes. He founded a jam manufacturing company with premises at Dequetteville Terrace later occupied by Adelaide Malting and Brewing Company and now a block of luxury apartments. The Mile End cellars were built in 1893. Around this time Thomas Hardy and Sons were South Australia's largest wine producers. The Bankside winery was destroyed by fire in 1904. It was not rebuilt. He oversaw the destruction of a Geelong, Victorian vineyard infected with Phylloxera and was a prime mover in writing the Phylloxera Act of 1879. Later developments Around 1910 management of the company passed to his son Robert, followed in 1928 by Robert's nephew (Thomas' grandson) Thomas Mayfield Hardy. Bankside was sold to F. G. Gill. The homestead was demolished in 1962. In 1976 the company acquired Emu Wines with a high export profile and vineyards in Western Australia. Hardy's had at McLaren Vale and other vineyards at Dorrien, Keppoch and Waikerie.

Envirofit's most significant products have been affordable clean burning stoves for poor consumers. Based in Fort Collins, Colorado, Envirofit was founded in 2003 by Tim Bauer, Nathan Lorenz, Paul Hudnut, and Bryan Willson. History Envirofit International began in 2003 as an adjunct program to the Colorado State University Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory. The program's goal was to bring sustainable clean energy solutions to solve health and energy challenges on a global level. The first product was a retrofit technology to reduce pollution from two-stroke cycle vehicle engines in the Philippines. This project won the Rolex Award for Enterprise in 2008. Clean Cook Stoves In 2007, Envirofit partnered with The Shell Foundation's Breathing Space Program to develop clean cook stoves. Envirofit International's first commercial clean cook stove model was produced in India in 2008. In order to meet the demands of consumers throughout the various markets and the growing health concerns of cooking on a traditional stove, Envirofit started to scale the model in 2010. The stove design was created after engineers studied the flow of heat and smoke in a combustion chamber using computer modeling to determine the best size and shape for the stove. It was found that sheet metal can burn through in a matter of weeks. Therefore, researchers worked to develop a metal and insulation to withstand high temperatures and frequent use at a low cost. The design of the cook stove had to best fit with the consumers using it. Most of the consumers live on $2 to $10 a day and spend several hours preparing food and water for their families to use. The technology of the clean cook stove has been dubbed \\"The Rocket Stove\\" because of the simple yet effective design. The cook stove has a large vertical cylinder that holds a pot and an opening at the bottom to feed the fuel to cook a meal or pasteurize drinking water. The combustion chamber of the Envirofit stoves use up to 60% less fuel than other stoves or open fires to reduce toxic emissions by up to 80%. The Envirofit stoves include the CH-4400 charcoal stove, the CH-5200 charcoal stove, the CH-2200 charcoal stove, the Z-3000 Built-In wood stove, the G-3300 wood stove, and the M-500. Recognition In 2009, Lorenz and Bauer were named Heroes of the Environment by Time Magazine. In 2013, The Economist named the Envirofit founder as innovators of the year.

Clinics are usually directed by clinical professors.Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition, \\"clinical legal studies,\\" (St. Paul, Minn: West Publishing Co., 1990), 254 Legal clinics typically do pro bono work in a particular area, providing free legal services to clients. Legal clinics originated as a method of practical teaching of law school students, but today they encompass also free legal aid with no academic links.M.

Need and importance According to Avani Bansal, in cases where parties cannot afford a lawyer and are provided legal services by the state, the quality of that legal representation is often questionable. Therefore the need for clinical legal education, or establishing legal aid clinics at law schools, where law students can provide legal advice to indigent people. Goals, objectives and methods  Students typically provide assistance with research, drafting legal arguments, and meeting with clients. In many cases, one of the clinic's professors will show up for oral argument before the Court. However, many jurisdictions have \\"student practice\\" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court.Uniform Local Rules Of The United States District Courts For The Eastern, Middle, And Western Districts Of Louisiana, LR83.2.13, Areas of service Legal clinic - case files at Palack√Ω University Faculty of Law Legal Clinic Clinical legal studies exist in diverse areas such as immigration law, environmental law, intellectual property, housing, criminal defense, criminal prosecution, American Indian law, human rights and international criminal law.\\"404 - Universiteit Utrecht\\", University Utrecht School of Law Clinical Programme on Conflict, Human Rights and International Justice, retrieved March 16, 2017. Clinics sometimes sue big companies and government entities, which has led to pushback in courts and legislatures, including attempts to put limits on whom clinics can sue without losing state subsidies. Obstacles While many jurisdictions have \\"student practice\\" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court, in some countries like India law students are still studying at law schools and cannot represent the clients in courts by themselves. According to Avani Bansal in many law schools, clinical legal education is imparted without the support of practical component and lacks policy. Participation in many of these legal clinics lacks academic credits. Lack of resources, lack of trained faculty for the purpose, lack of involvement of Bar Council Members leads to ineffective and weak clinical legal education in countries like India. Communities around are not informed so are not involved. All these aspects frustrate the effective purpose of the Legal clinic in the sense that it neither trains students in practice nor it reaches to the public.

Attaining professional status in the same year, the Latics played in the local Manchester leagues before gaining entry into the Football League Second Division in 1907. Two seasons later, the club gained its first ever promotion, finishing ahead of Hull City by virtue of a superior goal average. In their first ever top flight campaign the Latics finished in seventh position. Oldham reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1913, followed by a top four league placing in the 1913‚Äì14 season. The outbreak of the First World War coincided with the Latics' best ever league season, as the team finished second in the Football League in the 1914‚Äì15 season, missing out on the title by one point. Following the war, however, the team consistently finished near the bottom of the table, culminating in a last-place finish and relegation in 1923. 1923‚Äì1940: Interwar struggles Back in the second division for the first time since 1910, Oldham finished around the top half for several seasons before missing out on promotion by two points in 1930 to Chelsea. Mid-table finishes followed until 1935 when the club finished 21st in table and were relegated to the Third Division (North). Successive top five finishes occurred at the new lower level until the outbreak of the Second World War saw the cancellation of the domestic league programme. 1946‚Äì1970: Postwar plight Manager Jack Rowley led Oldham to promotion in 1963. Again, the outbreak of war hit Oldham hard and, as with the First World War, the club's results deteriorated significantly when the football league resumed finishing in 19th position in the first post-war league season. Disappointing mid-table finishes followed in the subsequent seasons before the signing of former England international George Hardwick as player-manager in 1950 proved the catalyst to a promotion as Third Division (North) champions in 1953. Hopes were again high at Boundary Park but the Latics slumped to relegation after only one season back in the higher tier. Only 25 points were gained from 42 games and 17 of 21 away games ended in defeat. Back in the Third Division (North) after only one season, Oldham found themselves established in midtable in the division until 1958 when the club's 15th-place finish meant that they became founder members of the new nationalized Fourth Division, two years later having the embarrassment of having to apply for re-election to the Football League with only Hartlepools United finishing below them. Promotion to the Third Division was achieved in 1963 under the management of Jack Rowley. Two years later the flamboyant Ken Bates took over as chairman. Despite Bates' financial ability to purchase players, narrow escapes from relegation occurred in 1965 and 1966, before the inevitable relegation back to the basement division finally occurred in 1969. With this, Bates left the club, and the result was a poor financial situation and a low finish in the Fourth Division in 1970. 1970‚Äì1982: Frizzell's Latics Scottish defender Jimmy Frizzell took on a player-manager role during the 1969‚Äì70 season and led the Latics to promotion in 1971. Back in the Third Division, a mid-table finish was achieved in 1972 before the Latics missed out on promotion by just three points the following season. An incredible run of ten consecutive league wins during the 1973‚Äì74 season (still a club record to this day) laid the foundations for Oldham to win the Third Division title and find themselves back in the Second Division for the first time since 1954. Frizzell did an excellent job of keeping the Latics away from relegation danger at this higher level, despite tighter finances and lesser gates than many of their rivals. It was therefore a shock that, in 1982 after twelve highly successful years in charge, the popular Scotsman was sacked. He had, however, laid the foundations for what was to come. The Joe Royle era: 1982 to 19941982‚Äì1989: Pushing for promotion= One of the most successful, and also longest-serving managers in Oldham Athletic's history was Joe Royle, who took over from Jimmy Frizzell just before the start of the 1982‚Äì83 season. Royle's first four seasons in charge resulted in moderate mid-table finishes before the first signs of success arrived during the 1986‚Äì87 season. That season, the club finished third in the Second Division on their new artificial astroturf surface, a position which would have been good enough for automatic promotion in any of the previous thirteen seasons. Unfortunately for Oldham, the 1986‚Äì87 season saw the introduction of the promotion play-offs, and they were eventually defeated by Leeds United on the away goals rule in the play-off semi-final. =1989‚Äì1990: The Latics reach Wembley= In the 1989‚Äì90 season, Oldham reached the final of the Football League Cup. In the second round, striker Frankie Bunn scored six goals, a League Cup record, as Scarborough were thrashed 7‚Äì0. The club were in the Second Division promotion play-off zone by the time the League champions Arsenal arrived in the League Cup third round. More than 15,000 Oldham fans were in the crowd as the champions were beaten 3‚Äì1. The win set up the Latics' first quarter-final appearance in the League Cup, where they were drew 2‚Äì2 away against First Division Southampton, with Andy Ritchie scoring an equaliser in the fourth minute of injury time to set up a replay at Boundary Park. Oldham won this 2‚Äì0, and then beat Second Division promotion rivals West Ham United 6‚Äì0 in the first leg of the semi- finals. The 3‚Äì0 second leg defeat at Upton Park proved irrelevant and Oldham were on their way to Wembley for the first time in their 95-year history. At the same time, Oldham had started another excellent cup run, this time in the FA Cup. Third Division Birmingham City took a 1‚Äì0 lead at their St. Andrews ground in the third round, but a late equalizer from Bunn led to a replay at Boundary Park. In the replay, Rick Holden scored an excellent solo goal to give the Latics a 1‚Äì0 win and set up a fourth round tie at home to Second Division Brighton & Hove Albion. Brighton took a first half lead before two goals in a minute from Scott McGarvey and Ritchie gave Oldham a hard-fought 2‚Äì1 win. First Division Everton were the visitors to Boundary Park for the fifth round tie, and raced into a 2‚Äì0 half time lead thanks to goals from Tony Cottee and future Oldham player/manager Graeme Sharp. A second half fightback saw the underdogs claim a draw thanks to an Ritchie penalty and a late Roger Palmer header. The replay at Goodison Park was again a draw ‚Äì ex-Evertonian Ian Marshall's close range header for Oldham being cancelled out by a disputed Kevin Sheedy penalty. Another replay was required, and this time Oldham prevailed ‚Äì a goal from Palmer and a penalty from Marshall cancelling out Cottee's early strike to give Oldham a 2‚Äì1 win and hand them another home tie, this time against First Division leaders Aston Villa. The Villains were beaten 3‚Äì0 thanks to Holden's effort, Neil Redfearn's close range finish and a Chris Price own goal. The Latics' first FA Cup semi-final appearance since 1913 saw them pitted against old local rivals Manchester United at Manchester City's Maine Road ground. Despite talk in the press of Oldham struggling away from their artificial home surface, the game was a classic. Earl Barrett tapped in from close range to give the Latics the lead after just five minutes, but Bryan Robson equalised before half-time. Neil Webb's goal for United with less than twenty minutes remaining looked to have won the tie, but a volley from Marshall just five minutes later pegged United back. With the game going into extra time, a Danny Wallace goal for United again looked to have won it, before Latics stalwart Palmer scored another equaliser at 3‚Äì3. The replay was just as exciting, although it proved to be controversial. Brian McClair gave United a second half lead before Ritchie stunned his old side with an equaliser ten minutes from time. Sadly for the Latics there was to be no fairytale ending and Mark Robins, born in nearby Ashton-under-Lyne, scored a winner late in extra time for the Manchester side. It was later proved on television replays that a Nick Henry effort in the first half had crossed the line, but referee Joe Worrall failed to award the goal. After their FA Cup semi-final, Oldham succumbed to a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Nottingham Forest in the League Cup Final. =1990‚Äì1994: Promotion and Premier League= The 1990‚Äì91 season culminated with the Latics regaining their top flight status after 68 years. Oldham were never out of the top two in the league all season and guaranteed promotion with a 2‚Äì1 win at Ipswich Town with four games remaining. The last day of the season saw the Latics entertain Sheffield Wednesday at home, themselves already promoted. The Latics still harboured hopes of winning the Second Division title, but for this to happen they needed to beat the Owls at home and hope that rivals West Ham United failed to beat fourth placed Notts County. Wednesday raced into a two-goal lead, but goals from Ian Marshall and 17-year-old debutant Paul Bernard levelled the game and set up a tense finish. In stoppage time, Athletic were awarded a penalty. In extremely tense circumstances, Neil Redfearn scored to clinch the Second Division championship. In the first season of the Premier League (1992‚Äì93), Oldham gained 49 points from 42 fixtures to stay up by the narrowest of margins. With three games remaining, the Latics had attained 40 points and looked doomed, lying second from bottom. To survive relegation, three wins from their final three matches were required, and the Latics had to bank on Crystal Palace gaining no more than one point from their final two matches. Oldham's first game of the final trio was away at second-placed Aston Villa, a side who had to win to have any hope of winning that year's title. In a battling display, Latics stalwart Nick Henry scored the winner midway through the first half, a result that handed Manchester United their first title for 27 years. Three days later, Liverpool were beaten 3‚Äì2 at Boundary Park, while Crystal Palace could only draw at Manchester City. For Oldham to survive, they had to beat fellow strugglers Southampton at home and hope that Crystal Palace were defeated at Arsenal's Highbury ground. Oldham eventually won 4‚Äì3 despite leading 4‚Äì1 at one stage, whilst Palace lost 3‚Äì0 at Arsenal, meaning that the Eagles were relegated on goal difference. Oldham reached another FA Cup semi- final in 1993‚Äì94, again facing Manchester United. The match at Wembley Stadium looked to be going Oldham's way, with Oldham holding a 1‚Äì0 lead until Manchester United's Mark Hughes scored a last gasp equalizer in the penultimate minute of extra time. A poor performance in the replay at Maine Road ended Oldham's hopes, and culminated in a disastrous run of results, with the Latics' failing to win any of their remaining seven fixtures. A month later they were relegated from the Premier League after three seasons in the top flight. 1994‚Äì98: Royle departs and the Latics slump Joe Royle was lured to Everton in October 1994 and 34-year-old striker Graeme Sharp was appointed Oldham's player-manager, however he resigned in February of the 1996‚Äì97 season. Relegation to the third tier for the first time in 23 years was confirmed three months later following a defeat at Reading. Sharp's replacement, Neil Warnock, left after 15 months in charge. 1998‚Äì2001: Disappointment under Andy Ritchie Former striker Andy Ritchie took over from Warnock in the summer of 1998 but he too was unable to turn things around and Ritchie's first season in charge almost proved to be disastrous. After losing a number of key players during the weeks after his reign began, Ritchie's squad of free transfers and youth team players struggled throughout the 1998‚Äì99 season, only avoiding being dragged into the relegation fight by winning their final two matches at home to Stoke City and Reading. The signing of the highly talented veteran Irish international midfielder John Sheridan proved to be the season's only high point. Hopes were high at the start of the 2000‚Äì01 season after a 4‚Äì1 opening day win at home to newly relegated Port Vale, but a run of 11 games without a win saw the club slump to second bottom in the league, making relegation look a real possibility. The signings of veteran winger David Eyres and midfielder Tony Carss gave the side added impetus and the Latics recovered well to again finish comfortably mid-table. 2001‚Äì2003: Financial uncertainty During the 2001 close season, local businessman Chris Moore purchased Oldham Athletic, with the promise of providing Premiership football within the next five years. After a whirlwind start to the 2001‚Äì02 season, the Latics lost three consecutive matches and slipped to eighth position, and manager Andy Ritchie was sacked after guiding the Latics to first in the league earlier in the season. Ritchie was offered an alternative role as director of football but declined the offer. His replacement was Mick Wadsworth, a nomadic manager, and several Moore funded big money signings followed. The result was a disappointing ninth-placed finish at the end of the season, although there were high hopes for the following campaign. Wadsworth was also sacked however, and was replaced by his assistant Iain Dowie. Dowie's expensive side began the 2002‚Äì03 season with a narrow home defeat to Cardiff City but recovered well to lose only seven more games for the rest of the season, just two of them away games. The Latics narrowly missed out on automatic promotion, gaining 82 points from their 46 league games to gain entry into the end of season play-offs. The play-off campaign ended in heartbreaking disappointment for Oldham, with Queens Park Rangers winning a tense battle with a late goal at their Loftus Road ground. Worse was to come for the club, with chairman Moore deciding to end his interest in the club, refusing to finance reported losses of ¬£50,000 a week. The club was forced into administration in October 2003, and was reportedly close to folding when American businessmen Danny Gazal, Simon Blitz and Simon Corney bought it in February 2004. 2003‚Äì2007: Relegation dog fighters Dowie left the club to join Crystal Palace in December 2003, and in March 2004 Brian Talbot took over as manager and the team lost only one of his first thirteen games in charge, against bottom club Wycombe Wanderers, the result being the Latics finishing comfortably in mid-table. In the 2004‚Äì05 season the Latics defeated Premier League club Manchester City in the FA Cup, but manager Talbot left the club the following month. Former Rotherham United manager Ronnie Moore took charge, and the club just avoided relegation, winning their final game of the season at home in a derby with Bradford City. Moore was sacked on 1 June 2006 and immediately replaced by reserve team coach John Sheridan. In the 2006‚Äì07 season Oldham finished in sixth place, but for the second time in five seasons lost in the play-offs.  2007‚Äì  In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Oldham finished in 8th place, nine points below the play-off positions. Oldham started the 2008‚Äì09 season well, going unbeaten in their first 8 games. After two years with the club, manager John Sheridan was sacked on 15 March 2009, immediately being replaced by former manager Joe Royle. After being offered the job on a permanent basis, Royle rejected the offer and announced that he would be leaving the club after the final game of the season. Darlington F.C. boss Dave Penney was announced as Royle's successor on 30 April 2009, though Royle still was in charge until season's end. Oldham finished in tenth place at the close of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Dave Penney was dismissed as Oldham manager on 6 May 2010, with his assistant, Martin Gray, taking over as caretaker manager for the final game of season 2009‚Äì10. During June 2010, Paul Dickov was named as Oldham Athletic player-manager signing a one-year contract. On 3 February 2013, he left his role as manager despite having recently knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup the previous week. On 18 March, the club hired Lee Johnson to become the newest manager and, at the time of his appointment, was the youngest manager in the Football League at 31 years old. The club narrowly avoided relegation for the 2012‚Äì13 season, finishing 19th and just three points above the drop zone. The club fared better in Johnson's second season, finishing mid-table at 15th. In January 2015, it was reported that Oldham was attempting to sign Ched Evans, an accused rapist. The move faced a significant public backlash, even from politicians, while a petition against the signing gained 60,000 signatures and Verlin Rainwater Solutions withdrew club sponsorship. Oldham ultimately decided not to sign Evans due to \\"unbearable pressure\\" while condemning the \\"vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff\\". In January 2018, Moroccan football agent Abdallah Lemsagam agreed a deal with the club's majority shareholder Simon Corney, which ended Corney's 14-year association with Oldham Athletic. Corney had bought the club, along with Danny Gazal and Simon Blitz, in 2004, saving it from potential liquidation. Gazal and Blitz had left in 2010, with Corney staying as the majority shareholder. Lemsagam currently owns 97 per cent of the football club, while the Supporters Trust maintain their 3 per cent stake. The takeover did not include Boundary Park's North Stand, which the club does not own but has use of on match days. In the two years prior to the Lemsagam deal, Oldham had faced a number of winding-up orders for non-payment of their tax bills, and saw their ground raided by HMRC in November 2017. Oldham Athletic were relegated to League Two on 5 May 2018. ReferencesExternal links *History at OldhamAthletic.co.uk Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C.

It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ‚áí means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn't necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party. Introduction The first political party in Southern Rhodesia to name designate itself as \\"liberal\\" was the Southern Rhodesia Liberal Party, founded by Jacob Smit as an opposition party against the then-dominant United Federal Party; however, besides its promotion of economic liberalism, it continued to support the white minority rule in the colony. It eventually lost representation in parliament and merged with what eventually became the conservative Rhodesian Front. During the bush War of the 1960s and 1970s, the only centrist party that pushed for majority rule and integration of the black African majority while not veering toward militant opposition was the United African National Council, led by (Zimbabwe Rhodesia) Prime Minister Rev. Abel Muzorewa; James Chikerema, a militant leader of FROLIZI, merged his party with Muzorewa's ANC coalition, and would later become the first vice-president of Muzorewa's UANC. The reformist prime minister of Southern Rhodesia, Garfield Todd, also advocated against the Ian Smith government, for which he was detained (he also advocated against the Mugabe government, which stripped him of citizenship shortly before his death in 2002). When black majority rule began in 1980, parliament was dominated by the ZANU-PF, a Marxist party with illiberal tendencies, with the former Rhodesian Front (renamed the Republican Front and, finally, the Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe) representing the seats allocated to the white minority until the seats were abolished in 1987. In 1992, the CAZ met with members of other opposition parties, including the UANC and ZANU-Ndonga to form a united opposition to ZANU-PF; what resulted was the Forum Party of former Chief Justice Enoch Dumbutshena, which, while not gaining any seats by the time it fizzled out, was the first post-independence multiracial opposition party. Non-conservative whites who had previously been forced to vote for either the nationalist socialist majority or conservative minority parties since independence for convenience purposes, in the meantime, backed non-political, multiracial civil society groups that had pressed against the land reforms and other policies pushed by ZANU-PF. These groups, galvanized by the 2000 referendum, soon organized into a political party, the Movement for Democratic Change. Led by Morgan Tsvangirai with a short-lived faction led by Arthur Mutambara, the MDC, which presses for social and political liberalism and is backed by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions and the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa, soon usurped the opposition position in Parliament against the ZANU-PF. By 2008, it had achieved the majority in both houses of parliament. Liberals in Zimbabwe have experienced persecution from the government during Mugabe's reign.

History The first Super 1 meeting was held in 1983 at Snetterton where only four classes were run as part of the championship. At the time, the championship was not officially recognised as being the \\"British Championship\\" as the RAC national titles were decided over a one-weekend event. This continued up till 1990 when Super 1 secured the rights to decide the British champion over the course of the series. Over the years, the Super 1 series has produced champions that have gone on to race in Formula 1 such as David Coulthard, Will Stevens, Allan McNish, Jenson Button, Anthony Davidson, Paul di Resta, Ralph Firman and Lewis Hamilton. Other drivers who have won a Super 1 championship and who have gone on to professional motor racing include Gary Paffett, Mike Conway, Dan Wheldon, Ben Hanley , Oliver Jarvis and Billy Monger.

Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC, though it did not expand outside of the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC.Christopher Kelly, The Roman Empire: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 4ff.Claude Nicolet, Space, Geography, and Politics in the Early Roman Empire (University of Michigan Press, 1991, originally published in French 1988), pp. 1, 15T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 605 et passimClifford Ando, \\"From Republic to Empire,\\" in The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World (Oxford University Press, pp. 39‚Äì40. Civil war engulfed the Roman state in the mid 1st century BC, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and finally between Octavian and Mark Antony. Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian imperator (\\"commander\\") thus beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history usually dated from 27 BC to AD 284; they later awarded him the name Augustus, \\"the venerated\\". The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs: the Julio- Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors‚ÄîTiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero‚Äîbefore it yielded in AD 69 to the strife-torn Year of Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, to be followed by the Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty which produced the \\"Five Good Emperors\\": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius. In the view of the Greek historian Dio Cassius, a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor Commodus in AD 180 marked the descent \\"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\\"Dio Cassius 72.36.4, Loeb edition translated E. Cary‚Äîa famous comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire. In 212, during the reign of Caracalla, Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire. But despite this gesture of universality, the Severan dynasty was tumultuous‚Äîan emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution‚Äîand following its collapse, the Roman Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a period of invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and plague.Brown, P., The World of Late Antiquity, London 1971, p. 22. In defining historical epochs, this crisis is typically viewed as marking the start of the Late Roman Empire, and also the transition from Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity. Diocletian (reigned 284‚Äì305) brought the Empire back from the brink, but declined the role of princeps and became the first emperor to be addressed regularly as domine, \\"master\\" or \\"lord\\".Adrian Goldsworth, How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower (Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 405‚Äì415. Diocletian's reign also brought the Empire's most concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity, the \\"Great Persecution\\". The state of absolute monarchy that began with Diocletian endured until the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire in 1453. Diocletian divided the empire into four regions, each ruled by a separate Emperor (the Tetrarchy).Potter, David. The Roman Empire at Bay. 296‚Äì98. Confident that he fixed the disorders plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed. Order was eventually restored by Constantine, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinianic dynasties, the Empire was divided along an east‚Äìwest axis, with dual power centers in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of Julian, who under the influence of his adviser Mardonius attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in AD 395 after making Christianity the official religion of the Empire.Chester G. Starr, A History of the Ancient World, Second Edition. Oxford University Press, 1974. pp. 670‚Äì678. The Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century as Germanic migrations and invasions overwhelmed the capacity of the Empire to assimilate the migrants and fight off the invaders. Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer.Isaac Asimov. Asimov's Chronology of the World. Harper Collins, 1989. p. 110. By placing himself under the rule of the Eastern Emperor, rather than naming himself Emperor as other Germanic chiefs had done, Odoacer ended the Western Empire by ending the line of Western Emperors. The eastern Empire exercised diminishing control over the west over the course of the next century. The empire in the east‚Äîknown today as the Byzantine Empire, but referred to in its time as the \\"Roman Empire\\" or by various other names‚Äîended in 1453 with the death of Constantine XI and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks.Asimov, p. 198. 27 BC‚ÄìAD 14: Augustus The Battle of Actium, by Laureys a Castro (1672) Octavian, the grandnephew and adopted son of Julius Caesar, had made himself a central military figure during the chaotic period following Caesar's assassination. In 43 BC at the age of twenty he became one of the three members of the Second Triumvirate, a political alliance with Marcus Lepidus and Mark Antony.Eck, Werner; translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider; new material by Sarolta A. Tak√°cs. (2003) The Age of Augustus. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. p. 12 Octavian and Antony defeated the last of Caesar's assassins in 42 BC at the Battle of Philippi, although after this point, tensions began to rise between the two. The triumvirate ended in 32 BC, torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members: Lepidus was forced into exile and Antony, who had allied himself with his lover Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt, committed suicide in 30 BC following his defeat at the Battle of Actium (31 BC) by the fleet of Octavian. Octavian subsequently annexed Egypt to the empire.Paul K. Davis, 100 Decisive Battles from Ancient Times to the Present: The World‚Äôs Major Battles and How They Shaped History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 63. Now sole ruler of Rome, Octavian began a full-scale reformation of military, fiscal and political matters. The Senate granted him power over appointing its membership and several successive consulships, allowing Augustus to operate within the existing constitutional machinery and thus reject titles that Romans associated with monarchy, such as rex (\\"king\\"). The dictatorship, a military office in the early Republic typically lasting only for the six-month military campaigning season, had been resurrected first by Sulla in the late 80s BC and then by Julius Caesar in the mid-40s; the title dictator was never again used. As the adopted heir of Julius Caesar, Augustus had taken Caesar as a component of his name, and handed down the name to his heirs of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. With Vespasian, one of the first emperors outside the dynasty, Caesar evolved from a family name to a formal title. Augustus created his novel and historically unique position by consolidating the constitutional powers of several Republican offices. He renounced his consulship in 23 BC, but retained his consular imperium, leading to a second compromise between Augustus and the Senate known as the Second Settlement. Augustus was granted the authority of a tribune (tribunicia potestas), though not the title, which allowed him to call together the Senate and people at will and lay business before it, veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, preside over elections, and it gave him the right to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus's tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate. No tribune of Rome ever had these powers, and there was no precedent within the Roman system for consolidating the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of Censor. Whether censorial powers were granted to Augustus as part of his tribunician authority, or he simply assumed those, is a matter of debate. In addition to those powers, Augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome itself; all armed forces in the city, formerly under the control of the prefects, were now under the sole authority of Augustus. Additionally, Augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maius (power over all proconsuls), the right to interfere in any province and override the decisions of any governor. With maius imperium, Augustus was the only individual able to grant a triumph to a successful general as he was ostensibly the leader of the entire Roman army. The Senate re-classified the provinces at the frontiers (where the vast majority of the legions were stationed) as imperial provinces, and gave control of those to Augustus. The peaceful provinces were re-classified as senatorial provinces, governed as they had been during the Republic by members of the Senate sent out annually by the central government.Eck, Werner; translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider; new material by Sarolta A. Tak√°cs. (2003) The Age of Augustus. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. p. 40. Senators were prohibited from so much as visiting Roman Egypt, given its great wealth and history as a base of power for opposition to the new emperor. Taxes from the Imperial provinces went into the fiscus, the fund administrated by persons chosen by and answerable to Augustus. The revenue from senatorial provinces continued to be sent to the state treasury (aerarium), under the supervision of the Senate. The Augustus of Prima Porta The Roman legions, which had reached an unprecedented 50 in number because of the civil wars, were reduced to 28. Several legions, particularly those with members of doubtful loyalties, were simply demobilised. Other legions were united, a fact hinted by the title Gemina (Twin). Augustus also created nine special cohorts to maintain peace in Italia, with three, the Praetorian Guard, kept in Rome. Control of the fiscus enabled Augustus to ensure the loyalty of the legions through their pay. Augustus completed the conquest of Hispania, while subordinate generals expanded Roman possessions in Africa and Asia Minor. Augustus' final task was to ensure an orderly succession of his powers. His stepson Tiberius had conquered Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and temporarily Germania for the Empire, and was thus a prime candidate. In 6 BC, Augustus granted some of his powers to his stepson, and soon after he recognized Tiberius as his heir. In AD 13, a law was passed which extended Augustus' powers over the provinces to Tiberius, so that Tiberius' legal powers were equivalent to, and independent from, those of Augustus. Attempting to secure the borders of the empire upon the rivers Danube and Elbe, Augustus ordered the invasions of Illyria, Moesia, and Pannonia (south of the Danube), and Germania (west of the Elbe). At first everything went as planned, but then disaster struck. The Illyrian tribes revolted and had to be crushed, and three full legions under the command of Publius Quinctilius Varus were ambushed and destroyed at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9 by Germanic tribes led by Arminius. Being cautious, Augustus secured all territories west of Rhine and contented himself with retaliatory raids. The rivers Rhine and Danube became the permanent borders of the Roman empire in the North. In AD 14 Augustus died at the age of seventy- five, having ruled the empire for forty years, and was succeeded as emperor by Tiberius. =Sources= The Augustan Age is not as well documented as the age of Caesar and Cicero. Livy wrote his history during Augustus's reign and covered all of Roman history through 9 BC, but only epitomes survive of his coverage of the late Republican and Augustan periods. Important primary sources for the Augustan period include: *Res Gestae Divi Augusti, Augustus's highly partisan autobiography, *Historiae Romanae by Velleius Paterculus, the best annals of the Augustan period, *Controversiae and Suasoriae of Seneca the Elder. Works of poetry such as Ovid's Fasti and Propertius's Fourth Book, legislation and engineering also provide important insights into Roman life of the time. Archaeology, including maritime archaeology, aerial surveys, epigraphic inscriptions on buildings, and Augustan coinage, has also provided valuable evidence about economic, social and military conditions. Secondary ancient sources on the Augustan Age include Tacitus, Dio Cassius, Plutarch and Lives of the Twelve Caesars by Suetonius. Josephus's Jewish Antiquities is the important source for Judea,which became a province during Augustus's reign. 14‚Äì68: Julio-Claudian Dynasty The Great Cameo of France, a cameo five layers sardonyx, Rome, c. AD 23, depicting the emperor Tiberius seated with his mother Livia and in front of his designated heir Germanicus, with the latter's wife Agrippina the Elder; above them float the deceased members of their house: Augustus, Drusus Julius Caesar, and Nero Claudius Drusus The Portland Vase, AD 5‚Äì25, cameo glass Augustus had three grandsons by his daughter Julia the Elder: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar and Agrippa Postumus. None of the three lived long enough to succeed him. He therefore was succeeded by his stepson Tiberius. Tiberius was the son of Livia, the third wife of Octavian, by her first marriage to Tiberius Nero. Augustus was a scion of the gens Julia (the Julian family), one of the most ancient patrician clans of Rome, while Tiberius was a scion of the gens Claudia, only slightly less ancient than the Julians. Their three immediate successors were all descended both from the gens Claudia, through Tiberius' brother Nero Claudius Drusus, and from gens Julia, either through Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter from his first marriage (Caligula and Nero), or through Augustus' sister Octavia Minor (Claudius). Historians thus refer to their dynasty as \\"Julio-Claudian\\". =14‚Äì37: Tiberius= The early years of Tiberius's reign were relatively peaceful. Tiberius secured the overall power of Rome and enriched its treasury. However, his rule soon became characterized by paranoia. He began a series of treason trials and executions, which continued until his death in 37.Pliny the Elder, Natural Histories XXVIII.5.23. He left power in the hands of the commander of the guard, Lucius Aelius Sejanus. Tiberius himself retired to live at his villa on the island of Capri in 26, leaving administration in the hands of Sejanus, who carried on the persecutions with contentment. Sejanus also began to consolidate his own power; in 31 he was named co-consul with Tiberius and married Livilla, the emperor's niece. At this point he was \\"hoist by his own petard\\": the emperor's paranoia, which he had so ably exploited for his own gain, turned against him. Sejanus was put to death, along with many of his associates, the same year. The persecutions continued until Tiberius' death in 37. =37‚Äì41: Caligula= At the time of Tiberius's death most of the people who might have succeeded him had been killed. The logical successor (and Tiberius' own choice) was his 24-year-old grandnephew, Gaius, better known as \\"Caligula\\" (\\"little boots\\"). Caligula was a son of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder. His paternal grandparents were Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, and his maternal grandparents were Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder. He was thus a descendant of both Augustus and Livia. Marble bust of Caligula, the Louvre Caligula started out well, by putting an end to the persecutions and burning his uncle's records. Unfortunately, he quickly lapsed into illness. The Caligula that emerged in late 37 demonstrated features of mental instability that led modern commentators to diagnose him with such illnesses as encephalitis, which can cause mental derangement, hyperthyroidism, or even a nervous breakdown (perhaps brought on by the stress of his position). Whatever the cause, there was an obvious shift in his reign from this point on, leading his biographers to label him as insane. Most of what history remembers of Caligula comes from Suetonius, in his book Lives of the Twelve Caesars. According to Suetonius, Caligula once planned to appoint his favourite horse Incitatus to the Roman Senate. He ordered his soldiers to invade Britain to fight the Sea God Neptune, but changed his mind at the last minute and had them pick sea shells on the northern end of France instead. It is believed he carried on incestuous relations with his three sisters: Julia Livilla, Drusilla and Agrippina the Younger. He ordered a statue of himself to be erected in Herod's Temple at Jerusalem, which would have undoubtedly led to revolt had he not been dissuaded from this plan by his friend king Agrippa I. He ordered people to be secretly killed, and then called them to his palace. When they did not appear, he would jokingly remark that they must have committed suicide. In 41, Caligula was assassinated by the commander of the guard Cassius Chaerea. Also killed were his fourth wife Caesonia and their daughter Julia Drusilla. For two days following his assassination, the senate debated the merits of restoring the Republic. =41‚Äì54: Claudius= Claudius was a younger brother of Germanicus, and had long been considered a weakling and a fool by the rest of his family. The Praetorian Guard, however, acclaimed him as emperor. Claudius was neither paranoid like his uncle Tiberius, nor insane like his nephew Caligula, and was therefore able to administer the Empire with reasonable ability. He improved the bureaucracy and streamlined the citizenship and senatorial rolls. He ordered the construction of a winter port at Ostia Antica for Rome, thereby providing a place for grain from other parts of the Empire to be brought in inclement weather. Claudius ordered the suspension of further attacks across the Rhine,Goldsworthy, In the Name of Rome, p. 269. setting what was to become the permanent limit of the Empire's expansion in that direction.Luttwak, The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, p. 38. In 43, he resumed the Roman conquest of Britannia that Julius Caesar had begun in the 50s BC, and incorporated more Eastern provinces into the empire. In his own family life, Claudius was less successful. His wife Messalina cuckolded him; when he found out, he had her executed and married his niece, Agrippina the Younger. She, along with several of his freedmen, held an inordinate amount of power over him, and although there are conflicting accounts about his death, she may very well have poisoned him in 54.Scramuzza, Vincent (1940). The Emperor Claudius Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p. 29. Claudius was deified later that year. The death of Claudius paved the way for Agrippina's own son, the 17-year-old Lucius Domitius Nero. =54‚Äì68: Nero= Nero ruled from 54 to 68. During his rule, Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade, and increasing the cultural capital of the empire. He ordered the building of theatres and promoted athletic games. His reign included the Roman‚ÄìParthian War (a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire (58‚Äì63)), the suppression of a revolt led by Boudica in Britannia (60‚Äì61) and the improvement of cultural ties with Greece. However, he was egotistical and had severe troubles with his mother, who he felt was controlling and over-bearing. After several attempts to kill her, he finally had her stabbed to death. He believed himself a god and decided to build an opulent palace for himself. The so-called Domus Aurea, meaning golden house in Latin, was constructed atop the burnt remains of Rome after the Great Fire of Rome (64). Because of the convenience of this many believe that Nero was ultimately responsible for the fire, spawning the legend of him fiddling while Rome burned which is almost certainly untrue. The Domus Aurea was a colossal feat of construction that covered a huge space and demanded new methods of construction in order to hold up the golden, jewel-encrusted ceilings. By this time Nero was hugely unpopular despite his attempts to blame the Christians for most of his regime's problems. A military coup drove Nero into hiding. Facing execution at the hands of the Roman Senate, he reportedly committed suicide in 68. According to Cassius Dio, Nero's last words were \\"Jupiter, what an artist perishes in me!\\" 68‚Äì69: Year of the Four Emperors Since he had no heir, Nero's suicide was followed by a brief period of civil war, known as the \\"Year of the Four Emperors\\". Between and , Rome witnessed the successive rise and fall of Galba, Otho and Vitellius until the final accession of Vespasian, first ruler of the Flavian dynasty. The military and political anarchy created by this civil war had serious implications, such as the outbreak of the Batavian rebellion. These events showed that a military power alone could create an emperor. Augustus had established a standing army, where individual soldiers served under the same military governors over an extended period of time. The consequence was that the soldiers in the provinces developed a degree of loyalty to their commanders, which they did not have for the emperor. Thus the Empire was, in a sense, a union of inchoate principalities, which could have disintegrated at any time. Through his sound fiscal policy, the emperor Vespasian was able to build up a surplus in the treasury, and began construction on the Colosseum. Titus, Vespasian's successor, quickly proved his merit, although his short reign was marked by disaster, including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Pompeii. He held the opening ceremonies in the still unfinished Colosseum, but died in 81. His brother Domitian succeeded him. Having exceedingly poor relations with the Senate, Domitian was murdered in September 96. 69‚Äì96: Flavian dynasty Roman trade with India according to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, 1st century AD The Flavians, although a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on its knees. Although all three have been criticised, especially based on their more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their background as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate, and a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor. =69‚Äì79: Vespasian= Vespasian was a remarkably successful Roman general who had been given rule over much of the eastern part of the Roman Empire. He had supported the imperial claims of Galba, after whose death Vespasian became a major contender for the throne. Following the suicide of Otho, Vespasian was able to take control of Rome's winter grain supply in Egypt, placing him in a good position to defeat his remaining rival, Vitellius. On December 20, 69, some of Vespasian's partisans were able to occupy Rome. Vitellius was murdered by his own troops and, the next day, Vespasian, then sixty years old, was confirmed as Emperor by the Senate. Although Vespasian was considered an autocrat by the Senate, he mostly continued the weakening of that body begun in the reign of Tiberius. The degree of the Senate's subservience can be seen from the post-dating of his accession to power, by the Senate, to July 1, when his troops proclaimed him emperor, instead of December 21, when the Senate confirmed his appointment. Another example was his assumption of the censorship in 73, giving him power over the make up of the Senate. He used that power to expel dissident senators. At the same time, he increased the number of senators from 200 (at that low level because of the actions of Nero and the year of crisis that followed), to 1,000; most of the new senators came not from Rome but from Italy and the urban centres within the western provinces. Vespasian commissioned the Colosseum in Rome. Polyphemus hears of the arrival of Galatea, ancient Roman fresco painted in the \\"Fourth Style\\" of Pompeii (AD 45‚Äì79) Vespasian was able to liberate Rome from the financial burdens placed upon it by Nero's excesses and the civil wars. To do this, he not only increased taxes, but created new forms of taxation. Also, through his power as censor, he was able to carefully examine the fiscal status of every city and province, many paying taxes based upon information and structures more than a century old. Through this sound fiscal policy, he was able to build up a surplus in the treasury and embark on public works projects. It was he who first commissioned the Amphitheatrum Flavium (Colosseum); he also built a forum whose centrepiece was a temple to Peace. In addition, he allotted sizeable subsidies to the arts, and created a chair of rhetoric at Rome. Vespasian was also an effective emperor for the provinces, having posts all across the empire, both east and west. In the west he gave considerable favouritism to Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal) in which he granted Latin Rights to over three hundred towns and cities, promoting a new era of urbanisation throughout the western (formerly barbarian) provinces. Through the additions he made to the Senate he allowed greater influence of the provinces in the Senate, helping to promote unity in the empire. He also extended the borders of the empire, mostly done to help strengthen the frontier defenses, one of Vespasian's main goals. The crisis of 69 had wrought havoc on the army. One of the most marked problems had been the support lent by provincial legions to men who supposedly represented the best will of their province. This was mostly caused by the placement of native auxiliary units in the areas they were recruited in, a practice Vespasian stopped; he mixed auxiliary units with men from other areas of the empire or moved the units away from where they were recruited. Also, to reduce further the chances of another military coup, he broke up the legions and, instead of placing them in singular concentrations, spread them along the border. Perhaps the most important military reform he undertook was the extension of legion recruitment from exclusively Italy to Gaul and Hispania, in line with the Romanisation of those areas. =79‚Äì81: Titus= Roman fresco with a banquet scene from the Casa dei Casti Amanti, Pompeii Titus, the eldest son of Vespasian, had been groomed to rule. He had served as an effective general under his father, helping to secure the east and eventually taking over the command of Roman armies in Syria and Iudaea, quelling a significant Jewish revolt at the time. He shared the consulship for several years with his father and received the best tutelage. Although there was some trepidation when he took office because of his known dealings with some of the less respectable elements of Roman society, he quickly proved his merit, even recalling many exiled by his father as a show of good faith. However, his short reign was marked by disaster: in 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted in Pompeii, and in 80, a fire destroyed much of Rome. His generosity in rebuilding after these tragedies made him very popular. Titus was very proud of his work on the vast amphitheater begun by his father. He held the opening ceremonies in the still unfinished edifice during the year 80, celebrating with a lavish show that featured 100 gladiators and lasted 100 days. Titus died in 81 at the age of 41 of what is presumed to be illness; it was rumoured that his brother Domitian murdered him in order to become his successor, although these claims have little merit. Whatever the case, he was greatly mourned and missed. =81‚Äì96: Domitian= All of the Flavians had rather poor relations with the Senate due to their autocratic rule; however, Domitian was the only one who encountered significant problems. His continuous control as consul and censor throughout his rule‚Äîthe former his father shared in much the same way as his Julio- Claudian forerunners, the latter presented difficulty even to obtain‚Äîwere unheard of. In addition, he often appeared in full military regalia as an imperator, an affront to the idea of what the Principate-era emperor's power was based upon: the emperor as the princeps. His reputation in the Senate aside, he kept the people of Rome happy through various measures, including donations to every resident of Rome, wild spectacles in the newly finished Colosseum, and the continuation of the public works projects of his father and brother. He also apparently had the good fiscal sense of his father; although he spent lavishly, his successors came to power with a well-endowed treasury. Toward the end of his reign Domitian became extremely paranoid, which probably had its roots in the treatment he received by his father: although given significant responsibility, he was never trusted with anything important without supervision. This flowered into the severe and perhaps pathological repercussions following the short-lived rebellion in 89 of Lucius Antonius Saturninus, a governor and commander in Germania Superior. Domitian's paranoia led to a large number of arrests, executions, and seizures of property (which might help explain his ability to spend so lavishly). Eventually it reached the point where even his closest advisers and family members lived in fear. This led to his murder in 96, orchestrated by his enemies in the Senate, Stephanus (the steward of the deceased Julia Flavia), members of the Praetorian Guard and the empress Domitia Longina. 96‚Äì180: Five Good Emperors Trajan's Column, marble with stone-carved reliefs that show various scenes depicting events of Trajan's Dacian Wars The next century came to be known as the period of the \\"Five Good Emperors\\", in which the succession was peaceful and the Empire prosperous. The emperors of this period were Nerva (96‚Äì98), Trajan (98‚Äì117), Hadrian (117‚Äì138), Antoninus Pius (138‚Äì161) and Marcus Aurelius (161‚Äì180), each one adopted by his predecessor as his successor during the former's lifetime. While their respective choices of successor were based upon the merits of the individual men they selected rather than dynastic, it has been argued that the real reason for the lasting success of the adoptive scheme of succession lay more with the fact that none but the last had a natural heir. The last 2 of the \\"Five Good Emperors\\" and Commodus are also called Antonines. = 96‚Äì98: Nerva = After his accession, Nerva set a new tone: he released those imprisoned for treason, banned future prosecutions for treason, restored much confiscated property, and involved the Roman Senate in his rule. He probably did so as a means to remain relatively popular and therefore alive, but this did not completely aid him. Support for Domitian in the army remained strong, and in October 97 the Praetorian Guard laid siege to the Imperial Palace on the Palatine Hill and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Nerva then adopted Trajan, a commander of the armies on the German frontier, as his successor shortly thereafter in order to bolster his own rule. Casperius Aelianus, the Guard Prefect responsible for the mutiny against Nerva, was later executed under Trajan. =98‚Äì117: Trajan= Situation of Eurasia in 2nd Century AD Upon his accession to the throne, Trajan prepared and launched a carefully planned military invasion in Dacia, a region north of the lower Danube that had long been an opponent to Rome. In 101, Trajan personally crossed the Danube and defeated the armies of the Dacian king Decebalus at Tapae. The emperor decided not to press on towards a final conquest as his armies needed reorganisation, but he did impose very hard peace conditions on the Dacians. At Rome, Trajan was received as a hero and he took the name of Dacicus, a title that appears on his coinage of this period. Decebalus complied with the terms for a time, but before long he began inciting revolt. In 105 Trajan once again invaded and after a yearlong invasion ultimately defeated the Dacians by conquering their capital, Sarmizegetusa Regia. King Decebalus, cornered by the Roman cavalry, eventually committed suicide rather than being captured and humiliated in Rome. The conquest of Dacia was a major accomplishment for Trajan, who ordered 123 days of celebration throughout the empire. He also constructed Trajan's column in Rome to glorify the victory. The maximum extent of the Roman Empire under Trajan (117) In 112, Trajan was provoked by the decision of Osroes I of Parthia to put his own nephew Axidares on the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia. The Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia was a branch of the Parthian royal family, established in 54. Since then, the two great empires had shared hegemony of Armenia. The encroachment on the traditional Roman sphere of influence by Osroes ended the peace which had lasted for some 50 years.Statius Silvae 5.1; Dio Cassius 68.17.1.; Arrian Parthica frs 37/40. Trajan first invaded into Armenia. He deposed the king and annexed it to the Roman Empire. Then he turned south into Parthia itself, taking the cities of Babylon, Seleucia and finally the capital of Ctesiphon in 116, while suppressing a Jewish uprising across the region. He continued southward to the Persian Gulf, whence he took Mesopotamia as a new province of the empire and lamented that he was too old to follow in the steps of Alexander the Great and continue his invasion eastward. But he did not stop there. In 116, he captured the great city of Susa. He deposed the Osroes I and put his own puppet ruler Parthamaspates on the throne. Never again would the Roman Empire push so far to the east. During his rule, the Roman Empire reached its greatest extent; it was quite possible for a Roman to travel from Britain to the Persian Gulf without leaving Roman territory. =117‚Äì138: Hadrian= Parts of Hadrian's Wall in Britain remain to this day. Despite his own excellence as a military administrator, Hadrian's reign was marked more by the defense of the empire's vast territories, rather than major military conflicts. He surrendered Trajan's conquests in Mesopotamia, considering them to be indefensible. There was almost a war with Vologases III of Parthia around 121, but the threat was averted when Hadrian succeeded in negotiating a peace. Hadrian's army crushed the Bar Kokhba revolt, a massive Jewish uprising in Judea (132‚Äì135). Hadrian was the first emperor to extensively tour the provinces, donating money for local construction projects as he went. In Britain, he ordered the construction of a wall, the famous Hadrian's Wall as well as various other such defences in Germania and Northern Africa. His domestic policy was one of relative peace and prosperity. =138‚Äì161: Antoninus Pius= Antoninus Pius's reign was comparatively peaceful; there were several military disturbances throughout the Empire in his time, in Mauretania, Judaea, and amongst the Brigantes in Britain, but none of them are considered serious. The unrest in Britain is believed to have led to the construction of the Antonine Wall from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde, although it was soon abandoned. =161‚Äì180: Marcus Aurelius= Marcus Aurelius Green Roman glass cup unearthed from an Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 25‚Äì220) tomb, Guangxi, China Germanic tribes and other people launched many raids along the long north European border, particularly into Gaul and across the Danube‚ÄîGermans, these in turn, may have been under attack from more warlike tribes farther east, driving them into the empire. His campaigns against them are commemorated on the Column of Marcus Aurelius. In Asia, a revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its assault. Marcus Aurelius sent his co-emperor Lucius Verus to command the legions in the East. Lucius was authoritative enough to command the full loyalty of the troops, but already powerful enough that he had little incentive to overthrow Marcus. The plan succeeded‚ÄîVerus remained loyal until his death, while on campaign, in 169. In 175, while on campaign in the northern Germany in the Marcomannic Wars, Marcus was forced to contend with a rebellion by Avidius Cassius, a general who had been an officer during the wars against Persia. Cassius proclaimed himself Roman Emperor and took the provinces of Egypt and Syria as his part of the empire. It is said that Cassius had revolted as he had heard word that Marcus was dead. After three months Cassius was assassinated and Marcus restored the eastern part of the empire. In the last years of his life Marcus, a philosopher as well as an emperor, wrote his book of Stoic philosophy known as the Meditations. The book has since been hailed as Marcus' great contribution to philosophy. When Marcus died in 180 the throne passed to his son Commodus, who had been elevated to the rank of co-emperor in 177. This ended the succession plan of the previous four emperors where the emperor would adopt his successor, although Marcus was the first emperor since Vespasian to have a natural son that could succeed him, which probably was the reason he allowed the throne to pass to Commodus and not adopt a successor from outside his family. It is possible that an alleged Roman embassy from \\"Daqin\\" that arrived in Eastern Han China in 166 via a Roman maritime route into the South China Sea, landing at Jiaozhou (northern Vietnam) and bearing gifts for the Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146‚Äì168), was sent by Marcus Aurelius, or his predecessor Antoninus Pius (the confusion stems from the transliteration of their names as \\"Andun\\", Chinese: ÂÆâÊï¶).Y√º, Ying-shih. (1986). \\"Han Foreign Relations,\\" in Denis Twitchett and Michael Loewe (eds), The Cambridge History of China: Volume I: the Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 B.C. ‚Äì A.D. 220, 377‚Äì462, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 460‚Äì461, . The embassy was perhaps simply a group of Roman merchants, not official diplomats.de Crespigny, Rafe (2007), A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (AD 23‚Äì220), Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, p. 600, . Other Roman embassies of the 3rd century supposedly visited China by sailing along the same maritime route. These were preceded by the appearance of Roman glasswares in Chinese tombs, the earliest piece found at Guangzhou (along the coast of the South China Sea) and dating to the 1st century BC.An, Jiayao. (2002), \\"When Glass Was Treasured in China,\\" in Annette L. Juliano and Judith A. Lerner (eds), Silk Road Studies VII: Nomads, Traders, and Holy Men Along China's Silk Road, 79‚Äì94, Turnhout: Brepols Publishers, , p. 83. The earliest Roman coins found in China date to the 4th century AD and appear to have come by way of the Silk Road through Central Asia.Hansen, Valerie (2012), The Silk Road: A New History, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 97, . However, Roman golden medallions from the reign of Antoninus Pius, and possibly his successor Marcus Aurelius, have been discovered at √ìc Eo (in southern Vietnam), which was then part of the Kingdom of Funan near Chinese-controlled Jiaozhi (northern Vietnam) and the region where Chinese historical texts claim the Romans first landed before venturing further into China to conduct diplomacy.Gary K. Young (2001), Rome's Eastern Trade: International Commerce and Imperial Policy, 31 BC ‚Äì AD 305, London & New York: Routledge, , p. 29.For further information on the Kingdom of Funan and discoveries at Oc Eo, see Milton Osborne (2006), The Mekong: Turbulent Past, Uncertain Future, Crows Nest: Allen & Unwin, revised edition, first published in 2000, , pp. 24‚Äì25. Furthermore, in his Geography (c. AD 150), Ptolemy described the location of the Golden Chersonese, now known as the Malay Peninsula, and beyond this a trading port called Kattigara. Ferdinand von Richthofen assumed this as Hanoi, yet the Roman and Mediterranean artefacts found at √ìc Eo suggest this location instead.Ferdinand von Richthofen, China, Berlin, 1877, Vol.I, pp. 504‚Äì510; cited in Richard Hennig, Terrae incognitae : eine Zusammenstellung und kritische Bewertung der wichtigsten vorcolumbischen Entdeckungsreisen an Hand der daruber vorliegenden Originalberichte, Band I, Altertum bis Ptolem√§us, Leiden, Brill, 1944, pp. 387, 410‚Äì411; cited in Z√ºrcher (2002), pp. 30‚Äì31. 180‚Äì193: Commodus and the Year of the Five EmperorsCommodus= A bust of Commodus, depicting him as the legendary Heracles (i.e. Hercules) wearing the skins of the Nemean lion The period of the \\"Five Good Emperors\\" was brought to an end by the reign of Commodus from 180 to 192. Commodus was the son of Marcus Aurelius, making him the first direct successor in a century, breaking the scheme of adoptive successors that had worked so well. He was co- emperor with his father from 177. When he became sole emperor upon the death of his father in 180, it was at first seen as a hopeful sign by the people of the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, as generous and magnanimous as his father was, Commodus was just the opposite. In The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon, it is noted that Commodus at first ruled the empire well. However, after an assassination attempt, involving a conspiracy by certain members of his family, Commodus became paranoid and slipped into insanity. The Pax Romana, or \\"Roman Peace\\", ended with the reign of Commodus. One could argue that the assassination attempt began the long decline of the Roman Empire. When Commodus' behaviour became increasingly erratic throughout the early 190s, Pertinax is thought to have been implicated in the conspiracy that led to Commodus' assassination on 31 December 192. The plot was carried out by the Praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus, Commodus' mistress Marcia, and his chamberlain Eclectus.Bowman, pg. 1 =Pertinax= After the murder had been carried out, Pertinax, who was serving as urban prefect at this time, was hurried to the Praetorian Camp and proclaimed emperor the following morning. His short reign (86 days) was an uneasy one. He attempted to emulate the restrained practices of Marcus Aurelius, and made an effort to reform the welfare program for poor children but he faced antagonism from many quarters.Gibbon, Ch. 4 His monetary reform was far-sighted, but would not survive his death. He attempted to impose stricter military discipline upon the pampered Praetorians.Zosimus, 1:8 In early March he narrowly averted one conspiracy by a group to replace him with the consul Quintus Sosius Falco while he was in Ostia inspecting the arrangements for grain shipments.Dio, 74:8 The plot was betrayed; Falco himself was pardoned but several of the officers behind the coup were executed. On 28 March 193, Pertinax was at his palace when a contingent of some three hundred soldiers of the Praetorian Guard rushed the gates (two hundred according to Cassius Dio).Dio, 74:9. Sources suggest that they had received only half their promised pay. Neither the guards on duty nor the palace officials chose to resist them. Pertinax sent Laetus to meet them, but he chose to side with the insurgents instead and deserted the emperor. Although advised to flee, he then attempted to reason with them, and was almost successful before being struck down by one of the soldiers.Dio, 74:10. The Praetorian Guards auctioned off the imperial position, which Senator Didius Julianus won and became the new Emperor. =Didius Julianus= Bust of Clodius Albinus (d. 197), a Roman usurper who was proclaimed emperor after the assassination of Pertinax Upon his accession, Julianus immediately devalued the Roman currency by decreasing the silver purity of the denarius from 87% to 81.5%.Tulane University \\"Roman Currency of the Principate\\" After the initial confusion had subsided, the population did not tamely submit to the dishonor brought upon Rome.Herodian, ii.7.3 Whenever Julianus appeared in public he was saluted with groans, imprecations, and shouts of \\"robber and parricide.\\" The mob tried to obstruct his progress to the Capitol, and even threw stones. When news of the public anger in Rome spread across the Empire, the generals Pescennius Niger in Syria, Septimius Severus in Pannonia, and Clodius Albinus in Britain, each having three legions under his command, refused to recognize the authority of Julianus. Julianus declared Severus a public enemy because he was the nearest of the three and, therefore, the most dangerous foe. Deputies were sent from the Senate to persuade the soldiers to abandon him; a new general was nominated to supersede him, and a centurion dispatched to take his life. The Praetorian Guard, lacking discipline and sunk in debauchery and sloth, were incapable of offering any effectual resistance. Julianus, now desperate, attempted negotiation and offered to share the empire with his rival. Herodian, ii.12.3 Severus ignored these overtures and pressed forward, all Italy declaring for him as he advanced.Herodian, ii.11.6 At last the Praetorians, having received assurances that they would suffer no punishment ‚Äì provided they surrendered the actual murderers of Pertinax ‚Äì seized the ringleaders of the conspiracy and reported what they had done to Silius Messala, the consul, by whom the Senate was summoned and informed of the proceedings. Julianus was killed in the palace by a soldier in the third month of his reign (1 June 193). Severus dismissed the Praetorian Guard and executed the soldiers who had killed Pertinax. According to Cassius Dio, who lived in Rome during the period, Julianus's last words were \\"But what evil have I done? Whom have I killed?\\" His body was given to his wife and daughter, who buried it in his great- grandfather's tomb by the fifth milestone on the Via Labicana. 193‚Äì235: Severan dynastySeptimius Severus (193‚Äì211)= The empire under Septimius Severus (210) Lucius Septimius Severus was born to a family of Phoenician equestrian rank in the Roman province of Africa proconsularis. He rose through military service to consular rank under the later Antonines. Proclaimed emperor in 193 by his legionaries in Noricum during the political unrest that followed the death of Commodus, he secured sole rule over the empire in 197 after defeating his last rival, Clodius Albinus, at the Battle of Lugdunum. In securing his position as emperor, he founded the Severan dynasty. Severus fought a successful war against the Parthians and campaigned with success against barbarian incursions in Roman Britain, rebuilding Hadrian's Wall. In Rome, his relations with the Senate were poor, but he was popular with the commoners, as with his soldiers, whose salary he raised. Starting in 197, the influence of his Praetorian prefect Gaius Fulvius Plautianus was a negative influence; the latter was executed in 205. One of Plautianus's successors was the jurist Papinian. Severus continued official persecution of Christians and Jews, as they were the only two groups who would not assimilate their beliefs to the official syncretistic creed. Severus died while campaigning in Britain. He was succeeded by his sons Caracalla and Geta, who reigned under the influence of their mother, Julia Domna. =Caracalla (198‚Äì217)= Caracalla and Geta, Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1907). The eldest son of Severus, Caracalla was born Lucius Septimius Bassianus in Lugdunum, Gaul. \\"Caracalla\\" was a nickname referring to the Gallic hooded tunic he habitually wore even when he slept. Upon his father's death, Caracalla was proclaimed co-emperor with his brother Geta. Conflict between the two culminated in the assassination of the latter. Reigning alone, Caracalla was noted for lavish bribes to the legionaries and unprecedented cruelty, authorizing numerous assassinations of perceived enemies and rivals. He campaigned with indifferent success against the Alamanni. The Baths of Caracalla in Rome are the most enduring monument of his rule. His reign was also notable for the Antonine Constitution (Latin: Constitutio Antoniniana), also known as the Edict of Caracalla, which granted Roman citizenship to nearly all freemen throughout the Roman Empire. He was assassinated while en route to a campaign against the Parthians by the Praetorian Guard. =Geta (209‚Äì211)= Severan dynasty family tree The younger son of Severus, Geta was made co-emperor with his older brother Caracalla upon his father's death. Unlike the much more successful joint reign of Marcus Aurelius and his brother Lucius Verus in the previous century, relations were hostile between the two Severid brothers from childhood. Geta was assassinated in his mother's apartments by order of Caracalla, who thereafter ruled as sole Augustus. =Interlude: Macrinus (217‚Äì218)= M.M. Opelius Macrinus was born in 164 at Caesarea. Although coming from a humble background that was not dynastically related to the Severan dynasty, he rose through the imperial household until, under the emperor Caracalla, he was made Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. On account of the cruelty and treachery of the emperor, Macrinus became involved in a conspiracy to kill him, and ordered the Praetorian Guard to do so. On April 8, 217, Caracalla was assassinated traveling to Carrhae. Three days later, Macrinus was declared Augustus. His most significant early decision was to make peace with the Parthians, but many thought that the terms were degrading to the Romans. However, his downfall was his refusal to award the pay and privileges promised to the eastern troops by Caracalla. He also kept those forces wintered in Syria, where they became attracted to the young Elagabalus. After months of mild rebellion by the bulk of the army in Syria, Macrinus took his loyal troops to meet the army of Elagabalus near Antioch. Despite a good fight by the Praetorian Guard, his soldiers were defeated. Macrinus managed to escape to Chalcedon but his authority was lost: he was betrayed and executed after a short reign of just 14 months. M. Opelius Diadumenianus was the son of Macrinus, born in 208. He was given the title Caesar in 217, when his father became Emperor. After his father's defeat outside Antioch, he tried to escape east to Parthia, but was captured and killed before he could achieve this. =Elagabalus (218‚Äì222)= Roman aureus depicting Elagabalus. The reverse commemorates the sun god Elagabal. Born Varius Avitus Bassianus on 16 May 205, known later as M. Aurelius Antonius, he was appointed at an early age to be priest of the sun God, Elagabalus, represented by a large, dark rock called a baetyl, by which name he is known to historians (his name is sometimes written \\"Heliogabalus\\"). He was proclaimed emperor by the troops of Emesa, his hometown, who were instigated to do so by Elagabalus's grandmother, Julia Maesa. She spread a rumor that Elagabalus was the secret son of Caracalla. This revolt spread to the entire Syrian army (which, at the time, was swollen with troops raised by the Emperor Caracalla, and not fully loyal to Macrinus), and eventually they were to win the short struggle that followed by defeating Macrinus at a battle just outside Antioch. Elagabalus was then accepted by the Senate, and he began the slow journey to Rome. His reign in Rome has long been known for outrageousness, although the historical sources are few, and in many cases not to be fully trusted. He is said to have smothered guests at a banquet by flooding the room with rose petals; married his male lover ‚Äì who was then referred as the 'Empress's husband'; and married one of the Vestal Virgins. Some say he was transgender, and one ancient text states that he offered half the empire to the physician who could give him female genitalia. The running of the Empire during this time was mainly left to his grandmother and mother (Julia Soamias). Seeing that her grandson's outrageous behavior could mean the loss of power, Julia Maesa persuaded Elagabalus to accept his cousin Alexander Severus as Caesar (and thus the nominal Emperor-to-be). However, Alexander was popular with the troops, who viewed their new Emperor with dislike: when Elagabalus, jealous of this popularity, removed the title of Caesar from his nephew, the enraged Praetorian Guard swore to protect him. Elagabalus and his mother were murdered in a Praetorian Guard camp mutiny. =Alexander Severus (222‚Äì235)= Bust of Alexander Severus, the last Emperor of the Severan dynasty Born Marcus Julius Gessius Bassianus Alexianus, Alexander was adopted as heir apparent by his slightly older and very unpopular cousin, the Emperor Elagabalus at the urging of the influential and powerful Julia Maesa ‚Äî who was grandmother of both cousins and who had arranged for the emperor's acclamation by the Third Legion. On March 6, 222, when Alexander was just fourteen, a rumour went around the city troops that Alexander had been killed, triggering a revolt of the guards that had sworn his safety from Elegabalus and his accession as emperor. The eighteen-year-old Emperor Elagabalus and his mother were both taken from the palace, dragged through the streets, murdered and thrown in the river Tiber by the Praetorian Guard, who then proclaimed Alexander Severus as Augustus. Ruling from the age of fourteen under the influence of his able mother, Julia Avita Mamaea, Alexander restored, to some extent, the moderation that characterized the rule of Septimius Severus. The rising strength of the Sasanian Empire (226‚Äì651) heralded perhaps the greatest external challenge that Rome faced in the 3rd century. His prosecution of the war against a German invasion of Gaul led to his overthrow by the troops he was leading, whose regard the twenty-seven-year-old had lost during the campaign. 235‚Äì284: Crisis of the Third Century The situation of the Roman Empire became dire in AD 235, when the emperor Alexander Severus was murdered by his own troops. Many Roman legions had been defeated during a campaign against Germanic peoples raiding across the borders, while the emperor was focused primarily on the dangers from the Sassanid Persian Empire. Leading his troops personally, Alexander Severus resorted to diplomacy and the paying of tribute in an attempt to pacify the Germanic chieftains quickly. According to Herodian this cost him the respect of his troops, who may have felt they should be punishing the tribes who were intruding on Rome's territory.\\" Herodian says \\"in their opinion Alexander showed no honourable intention to pursue the war and preferred a life of ease, when he should have marched out to punish the Germans for their previous insolence\\" (Herodian vi.7.10). In the years following the emperor's death, generals of the Roman army fought each other for control of the Empire and neglected their duties in preventing invasions. Provincials became victims of frequent raids by foreign tribes, such as the Carpians, Goths, Vandals, and Alamanni, along the Rhine and Danube Rivers in the western part of the Empire, as well as attacks from Sassanids in the eastern part of the Empire. Additionally, in 251, the Plague of Cyprian (possibly smallpox) broke out, causing large-scale mortality which may have seriously affected the ability of the Empire to defend itself. An Antoninianus coin depicting Zenobia, showing her diadem and draped bust on a crescent with the reverse showing a standing figure of Iuno Regina By 258, the Roman Empire broke up into three competing states. The Roman provinces of Gaul, Britain and Hispania broke off to form the Gallic Empire and, two years later in 260, the eastern provinces of Syria, Palestine and Aegyptus became independent as the Palmyrene Empire, leaving the remaining Italian-centered Roman Empire-proper in the middle. An invasion by a vast host of Goths was beaten back at the Battle of Naissus in 269. This victory was significant as the turning point of the crisis, when a series of tough, energetic soldier-emperors took power. Victories by the emperor Claudius II Gothicus over the next two years drove back the Alamanni and recovered Hispania from the Gallic Empire. When Claudius died in 270 of the plague, Aurelian, who had commanded the cavalry at Naissus, succeeded him as the emperor and continued the restoration of the Empire. Aurelian reigned (270‚Äì275) through the worst of the crisis, defeating the Vandals, the Visigoths, the Palmyrenes, the Persians, and then the remainder of the Gallic Empire. By late 274, the Roman Empire was reunited into a single entity, and the frontier troops were back in place. More than a century would pass before Rome again lost military ascendancy over its external enemies. However, dozens of formerly thriving cities, especially in the Western Empire, had been ruined, their populations dispersed and, with the breakdown of the economic system, could not be rebuilt. Major cities and towns, even Rome itself, had not needed fortifications for many centuries; many then surrounded themselves with thick walls. Finally, although Aurelian had played a significant role in restoring the Empire's borders from external threat, more fundamental problems remained. In particular, the right of succession had never been clearly defined in the Roman Empire, leading to continuous civil wars as competing factions in the military, Senate and other parties put forward their favored candidate for emperor. Another issue was the sheer size of the Empire, which made it difficult for a single autocratic ruler to effectively manage multiple threats at the same time. These continuing problems would be radically addressed by Diocletian, allowing the Empire to continue to survive in the West for over a century and in the East for over a millennium. Late Roman Empire As a matter of historical convention, the late Roman Empire emerged from the Roman Principate (the early Roman Empire), with the accession of Diocletian in 284, following the Third Century Crisis of AD 235‚Äì284. The end of the late Empire is usually marked in the west with the collapse of the Western Empire in AD 476, while in the east its end is disputed, as either occurring at the close of the reign of Justinian I (AD 565)Lee, A.D., From Rome to Byzantium AD 363 to 565: The Transformation of Ancient Rome (2013) p. xiii. or of Heraclius (AD 641).Mitchell, S., A History of the Later Roman Empire, AD 284-641 (2014), Chapter 1. =284‚Äì301: Diocletian and the Tetrarchy= porphyry sculpture sacked from a Byzantine palace in 1204, Treasury of St Mark's, Venice The transition from a single united empire to the later divided Western and Eastern empires was gradual. In July 285, Diocletian defeated rival Emperor Carinus and briefly became sole emperor of the Roman Empire. Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marked the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. Diocletian appointed a co- emperor in 286 and delegated further with two junior-emperors. Diocletian secured the empire's borders and purged it of all threats to his power. He defeated the Sarmatians and Carpi during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the Alamanni in 288, and usurpers in Egypt between 297 and 298. Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against Sassanid Persia, the empire's traditional enemy. In 299 he sacked their capital, Ctesiphon. Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favorable peace. Diocletian separated and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most bureaucratic government in the history of the empire. He established new administrative centers in Nicomedia, Mediolanum, Antioch, and Trier, closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome had been. Building on third-century trends towards absolutism, he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates. Diocletian saw that the vast Roman Empire was ungovernable by a single emperor in the face of internal pressures and military threats on two fronts. He therefore split the Empire in half along a northwest axis just east of Italy, and created two equal Emperors to rule under the title of Augustus. Diocletian himself was the Augustus of the eastern half, and he made his long-time friend Maximian Augustus of the western half. In doing so, he effectively created what would become the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. On the reverse of this argenteus struck in Antioch under Constantius Chlorus, the tetrarchs are sacrificing to celebrate a victory against the Sarmatians. On March 1, 293, authority was further divided. Each Augustus took a junior Emperor called a Caesar to aid him in administrative matters, and to provide a line of succession. Galerius became Caesar for Diocletian and Constantius Chlorus Caesar for Maximian. This constituted what is called the Tetrarchy (in Greek: \\"leadership of four\\") by modern scholars, as each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire. After Rome had been plagued by bloody disputes about the supreme authority, this finally formalised a peaceful succession of the emperor: in each half a Caesar would rise up to replace the Augustus and select a new Caesar. On May 1, 305, Diocletian and Maximian abdicated in favour of their Caesars. Galerius named the two new Caesars: his nephew Maximinus for himself, and Flavius Valerius Severus for Constantius. The arrangement worked well under Diocletian and Maximian and shortly thereafter. The internal tensions within the Roman government were less acute than they had been. In The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon notes that this arrangement worked well because of the affinity the four rulers had for each other. Gibbon says that this arrangement has been compared to a \\"chorus of music\\". With the withdrawal of Diocletian and Maximian, this harmony disappeared. After an initial period of tolerance, Diocletian, who was a fervent pagan and was worried about the ever-increasing numbers of Christians in the Empire, persecuted them with zeal unknown since the time of Nero; this was to be one of the greatest persecutions the Christians endured in history. Not all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), his attempt to curb inflation via price controls, was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's tetrarchic system collapsed after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of Maxentius and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The Diocletianic Persecution (303‚Äì11), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of Christianity, did not destroy the empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324 Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, Constantine. In spite of his failures, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another hundred years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate the position (John VI retired to a monastery in the 14th century). He lived out his retirement in his palace on the Dalmatian coast, tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of Split. =305‚Äì363: Constantinian dynasty= Constantine and his sons The empire under Constantine (337) The Tetrarchy would effectively collapse with the death of Constantius Chlorus on July 25, 306. Constantius's troops in Eboracum immediately proclaimed his son Constantine the Great as Augustus. In August 306, Galerius promoted Severus to the position of Augustus. A revolt in Rome supported another claimant to the same title: Maxentius, son of Maximian, who was proclaimed Augustus on October 28, 306. His election was supported by the Praetorian Guard. This left the Empire with five rulers: four Augusti (Galerius, Constantine, Severus and Maxentius) and one Caesar (Maximinus). The year 307 saw the return of Maximian to the rank of Augustus alongside his son Maxentius, creating a total of six rulers of the Empire. Galerius and Severus campaigned against them in Italy. Severus was killed under command of Maxentius on September 16, 307. The two Augusti of Italy also managed to ally themselves with Constantine by having Constantine marry Fausta, the daughter of Maximian and sister of Maxentius. At the end of 307, the Empire had four Augusti (Maximian, Galerius, Constantine and Maxentius) and a sole Caesar. Map of Rome in 350 In 311 Galerius officially put an end to the persecution of Christians, and Constantine legalised Christianity definitively in 313 as evidenced in the so-called Edict of Milan. Constantine defeated his brother- in-law Licinius in 324, unifying the Empire under his control. He would rule until his death on 22 May 337. The Empire was parted again among his three surviving sons. The Western Roman Empire was divided among the eldest son Constantine II and the youngest son Constans. The Eastern Roman Empire along with Constantinople were the share of middle son Constantius II. Constantine II was killed in conflict with his youngest brother in 340. Constans was himself killed in conflict with the army-proclaimed Augustus Magnentius on January 18, 350. Magnentius was at first opposed in the city of Rome by self- proclaimed Augustus Nepotianus, a paternal first cousin of Constans. Nepotianus was killed alongside his mother Eutropia. His other first cousin Constantia convinced Vetriano to proclaim himself Caesar in opposition to Magnentius. Vetriano served a brief term from March 1 to December 25, 350. He was then forced to abdicate by the legitimate Augustus Constantius. The usurper Magnentius would continue to rule the Western Roman Empire until 353 while in conflict with Constantius. His eventual defeat and suicide left Constantius as sole Emperor. Constantius's rule would however be opposed again in 360. He had named his paternal half-cousin and brother-in-law Julian as his Caesar of the Western Roman Empire in 355. During the following five years, Julian had a series of victories against invading Germanic tribes, including the Alamanni. This allowed him to secure the Rhine frontier. His victorious Gallic troops thus ceased campaigning. Constantius sent orders for the troops to be transferred to the east as reinforcements for his own currently unsuccessful campaign against Shapur II of Persia. This order led the Gallic troops to an insurrection. They proclaimed their commanding officer Julian to be an Augustus. Both Augusti readied their troops for another Roman Civil War, but the timely demise of Constantius on 3 November 361 prevented this war from occurring. 361‚Äì364: Julian and Jovian bikini girls\\" mosaic from the Villa Romana del Casale, Roman Sicily, 4th century AD Julian would serve as the sole Emperor for two years. He had been raised by the Gothic slave Mardonius, a great admirer of ancient Greek philosophy and literature. Julian had received his baptism as a Christian years before, but no longer considered himself one. His reign would see the ending of restrictions and violence against paganism introduced by his uncle and father-in-law Constantine I and his cousins and brothers-in-law Constantine II, Constans and Constantius II. He instead placed similar restrictions on Christianity, and some unofficial violence against Christians occurred. His edict of toleration in 362 ordered the reopening of pagan temples and the reinstitution of alienated temple properties, and, more problematically for the Christian Church, the recalling of previously exiled Christian bishops. Returning Orthodox and Arian bishops resumed their conflicts, thus further weakening the Church as a whole. Julian himself was not a traditional pagan. His personal beliefs were largely influenced by Neoplatonism and Theurgy; he reputedly believed he was the reincarnation of Alexander the Great. He produced works of philosophy arguing his beliefs. His brief renaissance of paganism would, however, end with his death. Julian eventually resumed the war against Shapur II of Persia. He received a mortal wound in battle and died on June 26, 363. According to Gibbon in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, upon being mortally wounded by a dart, he was carried back to his camp. He gave a farewell speech, in which he refused to name a successor. He then proceeded to debate the philosophical nature of the soul with his generals. He then requested water and, shortly after drinking it, died. He was considered a hero by pagan sources of his time and a villain by Christian ones. Gibbon wrote quite favourably about Julian. Contemporary historians have treated him as a controversial figure. Julian died childless and with no designated successor. The officers of his army elected the rather obscure officer Jovian emperor. He is remembered for signing an unfavourable peace treaty with Persia, ceding territories won from the Persians, dating back to Trajan. He restored the privileges of Christianity. He is considered a Christian himself, though little is known of his beliefs. Jovian himself died on February 17, 364. =364‚Äì392: Valentinianic dynasty= Valentinian and Valens The role of choosing a new Augustus fell again to army officers. On February 28, 364, Pannonian officer Valentinian I was elected Augustus in Nicaea, Bithynia. The army had been left leaderless twice in less than a year, and the officers demanded Valentinian choose a co-ruler. On March 28 Valentinian chose his own younger brother Valens and the two new Augusti parted the Empire in the pattern established by Diocletian: Valentinian would administer the Western Roman Empire, while Valens took control over the Eastern Roman Empire. The election of Valens was soon disputed. Procopius, a Cilician maternal cousin of Julian, had been considered a likely heir to his cousin but was never designated as such. He had been in hiding since the election of Jovian. In 365, while Valentinian was at Paris and then at Rheims to direct the operations of his generals against the Alamanni, Procopius managed to bribe two legions assigned to Constantinople and take control of the Eastern Roman capital. He was proclaimed Augustus on September 28 and soon extended his control to both Thrace and Bithynia. War between the two rival Eastern Roman Emperors continued until Procopius was defeated. Valens had him executed on May 27, 366. On August 4, 367, the eight-year-old Gratian was proclaimed as a third Augustus by his father Valentinian and uncle Valens, a nominal co-ruler and means to secure succession. In April 375 Valentinian I led his army in a campaign against the Quadi, a Germanic tribe which had invaded his native province of Pannonia. During an audience with an embassy from the Quadi at Brigetio on the Danube, Valentinian suffered a burst blood vessel his brain while angrily yelling at the people gathered, resulting in his death on November 17, 375. Succession did not go as planned. Gratian was then a 16-year-old and arguably ready to act as Emperor, but the troops in Pannonia proclaimed his infant half-brother emperor under the title Valentinian II. Gratian acquiesced in their choice and administered the Gallic part of the Western Roman Empire. Italy, Illyria and Africa were officially administrated by his brother and his stepmother Justina. However the division was merely nominal as the actual authority still rested with Gratian. 378: Battle of Adrianople Barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire, showing the Battle of Adrianople Meanwhile, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its own problems with Germanic tribes. The Thervingi, an East Germanic tribe, fled their former lands following an invasion by the Huns. Their leaders Alavivus and Fritigern led them to seek refuge in the Eastern Roman Empire. Valens allowed them to settle as foederati on the southern bank of the Danube in 376. However, the newcomers faced problems from allegedly corrupted provincial commanders and a series of hardships. Their dissatisfaction led them to revolt against their Roman hosts. Conflicts continued for the following two years. Valens led a campaign against them in 378. Gratian provided his uncle with reinforcements from the Western Roman army. However, this campaign proved disastrous for the Romans. The two armies approached each other near Adrianople. Valens was apparently overconfident of the numerical superiority of his own forces over the Goths. Some of his officers advised caution and to await the arrival of Gratian, others urged an immediate attack and eventually prevailed over Valens, who, eager to have all of the glory for himself, rushed into battle. On August 9, 378, the Battle of Adrianople resulted in the crushing defeat of the Romans and the death of Valens. Contemporary historian Ammianus Marcellinus estimated that two-thirds of the Roman army were lost in the battle. The battle had far-reaching consequences. Veteran soldiers and valuable administrators were among the heavy casualties. There were few available replacements at the time, leaving the Empire with the problem of finding suitable leadership. The Roman army also started to face recruiting problems. In the following century much of the Roman army would consist of Germanic mercenaries. For the moment, however, there was another concern. The death of Valens left Gratian and Valentinian II as the sole Augusti. Gratian was now effectively responsible for the whole of the Empire. He sought a replacement Augustus for the Eastern Roman Empire. His choice was Theodosius I, son of formerly distinguished general Count Theodosius. The elder Theodosius had been executed in early 375 for unclear reasons. The younger was named Augustus of the Eastern Roman Empire on January 19, 379. His appointment would prove a deciding moment in the division of the Empire. =379‚Äì457: Theodosian dynasty= 383: Disturbed peace in the West Detail of one of the carved reliefs on the Obelisk of Theodosius in Istanbul (Constantinople), showing Roman emperor Theodosius I surrounded by members of his court and receiving tributary gifts from foreign emissaries, late 4th century AD Gratian governed the Western Roman Empire with energy and success for some years, but he gradually sank into indolence. He is considered to have become a figurehead while Frankish general Merobaudes and bishop Ambrose of Milan jointly acted as the power behind the throne. Gratian lost favour with factions of the Roman Senate by prohibiting traditional paganism at Rome and relinquishing his title of Pontifex Maximus. The senior Augustus also became unpopular with his own Roman troops because of his close association with so- called barbarians. He reportedly recruited Alans to his personal service and adopted the guise of a Scythian warrior for public appearances. Meanwhile, Gratian, Valentinian II and Theodosius were joined by a fourth Augustus. Theodosius proclaimed his oldest son Arcadius an Augustus in January 383 in an obvious attempt to secure succession. The boy was still only five or six years old and held no actual authority. Nevertheless, he was recognised as a co- ruler by all three Augusti. The increasing unpopularity of Gratian would cause the four Augusti problems later that same year. Magnus Maximus, a general from Hispania, stationed in Roman Britain, was proclaimed Augustus by his troops in 383 and, rebelling against Gratian, he invaded Gaul. Gratian fled from Lutetia (Paris) to Lugdunum (Lyon), where he was assassinated on August 25, 383, at the age of 25. Maximus was a firm believer of the Nicene Creed and introduced state persecution on charges of heresy, which brought him into conflict with Pope Siricius who argued that the Augustus had no authority over church matters. But he was an Emperor with popular support, as is attested in Romano- British tradition, where he gained a place in the Mabinogion, compiled about a thousand years after his death. Following Gratian's death, Maximus had to deal with Valentinian II, at the time only twelve years old, as the senior Augustus. During the first few years, the Alps would serve as the borders between the respective territories of the two rival Western Roman Emperors. Maximus controlled Britain, Gaul, Hispania and Africa. He chose Augusta Treverorum (Trier) as his capital. Maximus soon entered negotiations with Valentinian II and Theodosius, attempting to gain their official recognition. By 384, negotiations were unfruitful and Maximus tried to press the matter by settling succession as only a legitimate Emperor could do: proclaiming his own infant son Flavius Victor an Augustus. The end of the year found the Empire having five Augusti (Valentinian II, Theodosius I, Arcadius, Magnus Maximus and Flavius Victor) with relations between them yet to be determined. Theodosius was left a widower in 385, following the sudden death of Aelia Flaccilla, his Augusta. He was remarried, to the sister of Valentinean II, Galla, and the marriage secured closer relations between the two legitimate Augusti. In 386 Maximus and Victor finally received official recognition by Theodosius but not by Valentinian. In 387, Maximus apparently decided to rid himself of his Italian rival. He crossed the Alps into the valley of the Po and threatened Milan. Valentinian and his mother fled to Thessaloniki from where they sought the support of Theodosius. Theodosius indeed campaigned west in 388 and was victorious against Maximus. Maximus himself was captured and executed in Aquileia on July 28, 388. Magister militum Arbogast was sent to Trier with orders to also kill Flavius Victor. Theodosius restored Valentinian to power and through his influence had him converted to Orthodox Catholicism. Theodosius continued supporting Valentinian and protecting him from a variety of usurpations. Final partition of the Empire The division of the empire after the death of Theodosius I, c. 395, superimposed on modern borders. In 392 Valentinian II was murdered in Vienne. Arbogast arranged for the appointment of Eugenius as emperor. However, the eastern emperor Theodosius refused to recognise Eugenius as emperor and invaded the West, defeating and killing Arbogast and Eugenius at the Battle of the Frigidus. He thus reunited the entire Roman Empire under his rule. Theodosius had two sons and a daughter, Pulcheria, from his first wife, Aelia Flacilla. His daughter and wife died in 385. By his second wife, Galla, he had a daughter, Galla Placidia, the mother of Valentinian III, who would be Emperor of the West. Theodosius was the last Emperor who ruled over the whole Empire. After his death in 395, he gave the two halves of the Empire to his two sons Arcadius and Honorius; Arcadius became ruler in the East, with his capital in Constantinople, and Honorius became ruler in the West, with his capital in Milan and later Ravenna. The Roman state would continue to have two different emperors with different seats of power throughout the 5th century, though the Eastern Romans considered themselves to be the only ones who were fully Roman. Latin was used in official writings as much as, if not more than, Greek and the two halves were nominally, culturally and historically, if not politically, the same state. =395‚Äì476: Decline of the Western Roman Empire= The Western and Eastern empires under Majorian and Leo (460) The Roman Empire in 476 After 395, the emperors in the Western Roman Empire were usually figureheads, while the actual rulers were military strongmen who took the title of magister militum, patrician or both‚ÄîStilicho from 395 to 408, Constantius from about 411 to 421, A√´tius from 433 to 454 and Ricimer from about 457 to 472. The year 476 is generally accepted as the formal end of the Western Roman Empire. That year, Orestes, having stolen power from the emperor Julius Nepos the year before, refused the request of Germanic mercenaries in his service for lands in Italy. The dissatisfied mercenaries, including the Heruli, revolted. The revolt was led by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer. Odoacer and his men captured and executed Orestes; weeks later they captured Ravenna and deposed Orestes' usurper son, Romulus Augustus. This event has been traditionally considered the fall of the Roman Empire in the west. Odoacer quickly conquered the remaining provinces of Italy. Odoacer returned the western imperial regalia to the eastern emperor, Zeno. Zeno soon received two deputations. One was from Odoacer requesting that his control of Italy be formally recognised by the empire, in which case he would in turn acknowledge Zeno's supremacy. The other deputation was from Julius Nepos, requesting support to regain the throne. Zeno granted Odoacer the title Patrician. Zeno told Odoacer and the Roman Senate to take Nepos back; however, Nepos never returned from Dalmatia, even though Odoacer issued coins in his name. Upon Nepos's death in 480, Zeno claimed Dalmatia for the East; J. B. Bury considers this the real end of the Western Roman Empire. Odoacer attacked Dalmatia, and the ensuing war ended with Theodoric the Great, King of the Ostrogoths, conquering Italy under Zeno's authority.

The ferry was operating between Phuket and the Phi Phi Islands in southern Thailand when she hit a submerged collection of rocky pinnacles at the dive site of Anemone Reef, 10 miles off Phi Phi Island. The impact tore a large hole in the hull, and the vessel sank within two and a half hours. All 561 passengers ‚Äì including both Thai locals and foreign tourists ‚Äì were rescued. They were picked up by the two police patrol boats and four or five fishing boats which had raced to the rescue in response to an emergency call. One elderly woman sustained a broken back and several others suffered shock.  Causes of the sinking  The ferry was on a regular crossing in normal conditions, and the Anemone Reef was charted and well known by captains in the area. This has led to various unproven theories as to why the accident occurred. Theories include insurance fraud due to the owners experiencing financial difficulties on the unprofitable route, and also that local dive companies paid the captain to sink the vessel as, up until that time, there was no wreck dives around Phuket. The captain was found to be negligent.  Recreational dive site The vessel is now a popular recreational dive site and acts as an artificial reef to complement the Anemone Reef. The vessel sits upright on a sandy bottom in around 30m of water. Originally the shallowest part of the wreck rose to ~10m, but today most of the superstructure is collapsed making the shallowest part of the wreck currently deeper than 18m. The wreck remains largely in one piece, although all of the upper deck has collapsed. The simplest and safest point of entry is through the vessel's stern, where divers can explore the once active car decks. Machinery still sits on the deck. Inside the car-deck are a couple of vehicle tyres and an engine trolley. Rows of passenger seats and low coffee tables fill the inner recesses. The collapsed foredeck is at 18 metres, where there is often surrounded by a cloud of snappers. The upper deck is split from front to back. Within and around the wreck there is much coral growth and an abundance of fish. Soft corals can be found growing along the sides and top of the wreck. Schools of bigeye trevally are often spotted circling above the captain's cabin. Large schools of yellow snapper hang around the entrances to the car deck and along the remains of the upper deck, with many Scorpionfish particularly lionfish can be seen dotted around the wreck. There are also occasional encounters with zebra sharks and bamboo sharks, barracuda and turtles.

Waterworks The full name of the company was The Governor and Company for raising the Thames Water at York Buildings. The undertaking was established in 1675 and incorporated in 1690 with a capital of ¬£4,800 (), but obtained a private act in 1691 to increase its capital and enable it to buy lands. As might be expected this provided the company with a steady, but unspectacular income from the rents paid by the householders supplied with water.Scott, 418-21. Water supply was its sole business until 1719. The company was technologically advanced for its time. It tried the steam pump of Thomas Savery, a precursor of the steam engine, though this proved a failure. In 1726, a Newcomen engine was installed at York Buildings but when the company fell into financial difficulties in 1732 the engine was broken up, cylinders being sold to the London Lead Company and Sir James Lowther. However the company continued to operate its waterworks for many years, becoming the final asset of the company, just as it was the first. However the business had been injured as far back as 1731, by the establishment of a rival Chelsea Waterworks Company. The works were leased out in 1746, and the lease was renewed periodically until 1818. Forfeited estates By 1719, procuring the incorporation of a company had become difficult, with the result that it was cheaper for speculators to buy up the patent of an existing company than to obtain a new one. In that year, its new proprietors resolved to raise a joint stock of ¬£1,200,000 to buy forfeited and other estates in Great Britain. The new capital was immediately taken up and a 10% call was paid. This fund and borrowings then enabled the company to buy estates costing over ¬£300,000, with a rental of ¬£15,000. The estates purchased were estates, mainly in Scotland, forfeited after the Jacobite rising of 1715, when the rebels were stripped of their lands. In January 1720, it proposed to undertake life assurance, though the Attorney-General advised them that this was ultra vires. The company's stock rose in price during the year, reaching its peak in mid August, but the threat of a writ of scire facias depressed the price, which collapsed to the point where the shares became almost unsaleable. In September, the company agreed to 'proceed only according to ancient known and regular methods, agreeable to their constitution and of the encouragement given them by Parliament'. They promised to make a call on their proprietors and did so, but gave each proprietor the option of surrendering half their stock to the company. Most proprietors took this option, with the result that the capital was little increased. The directors were left with ¬£675,000 of stock (10% paid) which they had difficulty in selling. The result was that the company was crippled, and had difficulty in meeting its obligations. In 1721, it raised money by conducting lotteries, the prizes including stock in the company and annuities secured on its estates. The company undertook various ventures to exploit its estates, including mining copper and lead ores in the Panmure estates in Forfarshire, starting an ironworks at Abernethy and shipping timber from there. However these works were not profitable. It also obtained illegal advances from the Charitable Corporation. Various financial strategems were undertaken to enable it to stay in business. Eventually, in 1732 its annuitants petitioned Parliament. A new court of directors was elected and supported this. A call was made on shareholders, who were given the ¬£95,000 stock remaining in the hands of the company. This was followed further stock manipulation.Scott, 422‚Äì31. On 3 April 1732 George Robinson, the Member of Parliament for Great Marlow, was expelled from Parliament for diverting ¬£356,000 of funds of the Charitable Corporation into buying York Buildings Company stock; the profits of the sale were given to him.Murray Liquidation In 1740, the affairs of the court became subject to court proceedings, partly in the Court of Chancery and partly in Scotland.vide The National Archives C78/2075, no. 1 In 1756, an agreement was made as to the respective priorities of various classes of creditor for payment. This was followed by an Act of Parliament in 1764 for the sale of the company's estates, enabling some of the debts to be paid. The sale of further estates was authorised by another Act in 1777, the sale taking place in 1783. An agreement with creditors was made in 1786, but only led to more litigation until a further agreement was made in 1792, though this was not approved by the court until 1802. This left the company with ¬£10,000, some government stock and its waterworks. The waterworks had been in lease for over 50 years. It was sold in 1818 to the New River Company in exchange for an annuity of ¬£250. The company was finally dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1829.Scott, 431‚Äì34 The estates Among the forfeited estates handed over to the York Buildings Company were: *Edzell Castle *Belhelvie Kirk, part of the estate of James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure *Callendar House, Falkirk *Widdrington Castle estate of William Widdrington, 4th Baron Widdrington in Nortumberland.Scott, 431.

For many years, she owned a major horse breeding operation located in Ireland, France and other countries and was Chairperson of the Irish National Stud for over a decade. She is the wife of former media and industrial magnate Tony O'Reilly, and is heavily involved with The Ireland Funds. Life She was born in the United States to John Goulandris, a wealthy member of a Greek family of ship owners and operators, and Maria Lemos, from another Greek shipping dynasty. The family lived at the time in the Savoy Palace Hotel, with homes also in Greece, Connecticut, Switzerland and the Bahamas. She grew up primarily in America (on Fifth Avenue, New York), with holidays spent in Greece, chiefly on the family's ancestral home island, Andros. Her father died when she was three, and her only brother, Peter, recently born. She studied French civilisation and art history at the Sorbonne in Paris, then returned to New York, working in the family offices, her business activities ranging from silver futures trading to horse breeding.London, UK: The Racing Post, 15 July 2001, Michael Clower, \\"Lady O'Reilly Interview: Rebel line flies the flag for O'Reilly's worldwide empire\\" She met Tony O'Reilly briefly, with her brother, in Manhattan in 1989, at the Pierre Hotel, his usual base when staying in New York; he was in New York seeking funding for Waterford Wedgwood. They next met in 1990, after O'Reilly invited her to the Heinz 57 race in Dublin that year (she knew Ireland because of horse racing and breeding and was already considering buying a stud farm there), and a relationship developed, with the two becoming a couple in Lyford Cay the following Easter. On September 14, 1991, they were married in the Bahamas, Goulandris's first marriage and O'Reilly's second. At the time, O'Reilly was said to be worth around $520 million and Goulandris $450 million, though some reports said the latter was worth more than the former. In 1996, Tony O'Reilly bid $2.6 million for the diamond engagement ring of Jacqueline Onassis, to give as a gift to Goulandris, who had known the Onassis family, and she, with some Heinz executives, made a naming gift in her husband's honor in 1999 with the O'Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh. Homes Goulandris shares a range of residences with her husband. Although not tax resident in Ireland, one of her main homes is Castlemartin House and Estate near Kilcullen, County Kildare, which includes a horse stud facility and a Charolais cattle breeding operation. She managed the restoration of the Georgian house's upper floor and roof. Her official main residence is a house in the closed executive development of Lyford Cay near Nassau, the Bahamas; othera are a complex on the southern coast of Ireland at Shorecliffe, Glandore, County Cork, and a Georgian townhouse on Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, and a chateau in Deauville, France. She also owns property in New York. Horse breeding Goulandris owns, breeds, trains and races horses under a number of house names, including at least Castlemartin Stud (shared with her husband), Petra Bloodstock Agency, Skymarc Farm. Castlemartin Stud is situated on the estate around one of her principal homes, with operations in multiple countries, and her horses are trained in Ireland, England, Normandy in France and in the USA at a stud called Matagorda, with many trainers employed across the various locations. Two of her uncles were involved in racing, one, George, winning the English Oaks in 1962 and another, Constantin, owning the La Louviere Stud in France. She bought her first racing horse, a yearling filly, in 1976, and in 1978, following her uncle Constantin's death, took over La Louviere Stud. At the end of October 2006, she had around 100 horses in training, and 128 brood mares. Her operations have a policy of selling male foals, and one of those sold was Helissio who won the 1996 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, while one retained was European champion miler in 1991. In all, she has bred 11 Group 1 winners, including two wins at Royal Ascot. =National Stud= In 1993, Goulandris was appointed to the board of the Irish National Stud by the Minister for Agriculture, and in early June 1998, she was made its chairperson by Joe Walsh, in succession to David Shubotham,London, UK: The Racing Post, \\"O'Reilly in Chair\\" a post she continues to hold. Wealth Estimates of her personal wealth have varied greatly, but have exceeded 400 million USD since the early 1990s. In June 2004, it was reported that she would be a major beneficiary of the sale of a family-owned unit of land in New York, assembled in the 1970s at a cost of about 25 million USD, for around 400 million USDLondon, UK: The Times, June 7, 2004, Finance, \\"Talking Points\\" ‚Äì par. 2, \\"Talk of the Day\\" and in 2005, her personal wealth was estimated at 442 million UK pounds.London, UK: The Sunday Times, April 3, 2005: Colm Murphy, 'The Rich List 2005: Ireland's richest 250' Other activities In June 1994, she was appointed a non-executive director of Waterford Wedgwood plc, with special responsibility for organizing commemorative events for the bicentenary of the death of Josiah Wedgwood.London, UK: The Independent, June 18, 1994, Alison Eadie, \\"Job in china for Mrs O'Reilly\\" She resigned this role in January 2009.

Some of the route was replaced by SR 51 and US 20A. SR 107 was extended in the 1960s, when US 20A was rerouted onto SR 15\\\\. Route description SR 107 heads east from its western terminus as a two-lane rural highway passing through farmland with some houses. The route crosses the St. Joseph River and enters the downtown business district of Montpelier. The road has a traffic signal and begins a concurrency with SR 576\\\\. The concurrency heads east leaving the business district and ending residential areas. In the residential area the concurrency with SR 576 ends, with SR 576 turning south. The highway becomes a four-lane undivided highway passing through commercial properties, with some houses. The road leaves Montpelier and enters rural Williams County, passing through farmland with a few houses. East of Montpelier the highway has a bridge over a set of Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks and the roadway narrows to a two-lane highway. The road heads towards its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 20A and SR 15. SR 107 is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways important to the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). ODOT's 2008 annual average daily traffic (AADT) calculations showed that lowest traffic levels were the 1,260 vehicles which used the highway daily on a section at its western terminus; the peak traffic volumes were 8,980 vehicles AADT along a section of SR 107 at the eastern end of the SR 576 concurrency. History The first time SR 107 was signed was in 1923 and went to the Michigan state line on what is now SR 49\\\\. At this time the eastern terminus was at SR 66, east of West Unity. In 1925 the north‚Äìsouth section was renumber to SR 51. In 1932 US 20S was commissioned in Ohio and replace SR 107 east of Montpelier. US 20S was changed to US 20A in 1935. By 1964 US 20A was reroute north concurrent with SR 15 and SR 107 was extended east of Montpelier to SR 15.

Skatin, the official new name, reverts to the traditional pre- colonial/pre-Columbian name. The alternate past name still commonly used by outsiders, Skookumchuck, is the St'at'imcets version of the Chinook Jargon Skookumchuck, meaning Strong Waters, i.e. rapids. The town site is 4 km south of T'sek Hot Spring (alt. spelling T'sik Hot Spring), formerly named both Saint Agnes Well and Skookumchuck Hot Springs. The community is 28 km south of the outlet of Lillooet Lake on the east side of the Lillooet River. It is approximately 75 km south of the town of Pemberton and the large reserve of the Lil'wat branch of the St'at'imc at Mount Currie, British Columbia. See Skatin First Nations for details about the complicated Band(s) structure. Skatin is geographically an extension of both the Pemberton and Harrison Valleys, but by legal fiction is officially part of the Fraser Valley for Provincial and Federal administrative purposes. Population Skatin community includes about 30 houses, a church, band office, fire hall, a new school and gymnasium built in 2003. The population living at Skatin is 65 at the town site, which varies according to season; 74 on other Reserves; and 275 off Reserves; the majority living in the Fraser Valley and lower mainland, including Vancouver. =Language= The Skatin First Nations speak Ucwalm√≠cwts/Lower StÃì√°tÃìimc: fluent speakers: 7, understand or speak somewhat: 51, learning speakers: 51. =European Contact= The town church was built by members of the Douglas, Skatin and Samahquam Bands between 1895 and 1906. The Oblate Fathers established a mission there and demanded the native people in the surrounding wilderness to settle there. The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate instructed the natives in Christianity, and to this day the Church of the Holy Cross, Skatin, stands as a stunning example of the North American architectural style known as Carpenter Gothic/Wood Gothic. In 1981, the church was designated as a National Historic Site by Heritage Canada. A community- based group, Ama Liisaos Heritage Trust Society, is working on conservation of the church. Prominent features are the simple but elegant stained glass windows, consisting of a checkerboard pattern of bright red mercuric glass and alternating bright blue cobalt glass squares. The glass was imported from Europe and brought in by mule, by a gold prospector who had struck it rich in the Cariboo Gold Rush, on his return to the goldfields. =The Gold Rush Era= In 1858 the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush began and some 30,000 miners began the trek through traditional Lil'wat and upper St'at'imc territory to the goldfields at Lillooet, then known as Cayoosh Flat Trail. =Flood control= In 1947 the Pemberton Dyking District, for flood control in the adjacent Pemberton Valley, lowered Lillooet Lake, permanently altering the character of the rapids and the water level in the Lillooet River. Conversely, Little Lillooet Lake earlier was raised by the Royal Engineers in their improvements to the route to the gold fields, turning it into a lower arm of Lillooet Lake proper, eliminating the portage and resulting in moving south the former Port Lillooet - down to what had been the south end of Little Lillooet Lake. =Telephone service= There are no landlines or cellular service in the area; radio telephones and satellite phones only. First Nations, loggers, roadbuilders and government officials all rely extensively on the use of VHF radios. =Electricity= Ironically, though adjacent to high tension power lines for more than half a decade, Skatin was not connected to the grid until January 2011, when BC Hydro crews disconnected the community diesel generating station. =LoggingAgriculture= There were several native and European homesteads with mixed farms with livestock, small orchards, groves of nut trees including hazels (C. avellana and C. sieboldiana) and filberts (C. maxima), walnuts and Northern pecans, and small vineyards ranging from three to 15 acres. These farms were very abundant because of rich alluvial soils in a sheltered valley system that runs in a general East-West direction, so the north shore of the river and lake have full sun year round and minimal shading. The waters also moderate the climate toward more temperate conditions with warm summer nights: i.e. able to grow tree fruits: peaches and apricots as the Okanagan Valley and Niagara Peninsula, and traditionally almonds such as fleshy almond/Northern almond/Hungarian almond var. Balaton/sweet kernel apricot (Prunus armeniaca var. Balaton). Oral tradition holds that BC Hydro removed (or stole) the soil from all the farms along and south of Lillooet Lake, for building the service road used to install the high tension power lines to feed California. Several raised vegetable beds have been successfully started at the nearby hot springs. Discussions have been begun about using the geothermal source for district heating and greenhouses. The area has the potential to supply all temperate fruit and hothouse needs extending to Whistler. =Transportation= There are no rail or public transit buses, though there is a daily school bus for children. The Band maintains mini-buses for transport of seniors and others needing medical and other services in and beyond Pemberton. =Roads= Work is slowly proceeding on the 7 Nations Highway re-connecting Harrison Hot Springs with Pemberton. The last 20 miles at the head of Harrison Lake leading to Port Douglas are in very poor repair ever since the sawmill closed at Port Douglas, around 1995. Work on the Harrison Lake section was disrupted by the Wood Lake Wildfire in summer 2015. The westernmost section of road was improved in the spring of 2015; In-SHUCK- ch Forest Service Road/FSR was widened from 1 to 1¬Ω lanes to 2 lanes and two ¬Ω-lane shoulders (3 lanes in toto) for the length of Lillooet Lake. Drivers are advised to take a basic back-roads tool kit including flares, flashlights, shovel, jacks, tire iron, at least 1 spare tire (2 is better), water for people and vehicle, refillable water cans, and several cans of run flat aerosols to re-inflate tires. In the winter, add an axe, shovel, studs and/or chains/other traction devices to the list. Check latest updates before heading out. =Air= There are charter helicopter flights, weather/visibility permitting. The closest airport is Pemberton Regional Airport. Seaplanes can be chartered out of Whistler/Green Lake Water Aerodrome and \\"land\\" nearby at the south end of Lillooet Lake. =Education= The elementary and junior high school (grades K-9), formerly known as the Head of the Lake School, now called Skatin Community School, is for the children of In-SHUCK-ch members, the majority of which are from Skatin and Tipella. 44 students currently attend this school. The Xit'olacw School in Xit'olacw Village (Mount Currie New Site) has 244 students, grades K-12. School District 48 Sea to Sky operates public schools in Pemberton.

The house is set in an elevated position overlooking the Gade Valley and is said to enjoy one of the finest views in the Home Counties. History The Halseys moved to Great Gaddesden in 1458 and later became lessees of the Rectory of Gaddesden until March 12, 1545. When King Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries during the Reformation, he granted the estate of King's Langley Priory to William Hawes (or Halsey, also Chambers). The Halsey family residence was at the Golden Parsonage, a sixteenth-century mansion situated in Gaddesden Row. Thomas Halsey (1731-1788) MP erected a new mansion, Gaddesden Place, to Wyatt's design, about a mile south-west of the Golden Parsonage. In 1774 the family moved to Gaddesden Place, and the Golden Parsonage was partially demolished. In 1788 Thomas Halsey died, leaving the estate to his only surviving daughter, Sarah. She married Joseph Thompson Whately, and he adopted took the Halsey name and coat of arms. (British History Online) Gaddesden Place was gutted by fire, on the 1 February 1905, and was subsequently rebuilt in 1908 by Cole A Adams. The quadrant links and north and south pavilions were demolished in 1955 and 1963 because of dry rot. The building was purchased in 1984 by the technology entrepreneur Charles Moir, founder of the software company Computer Concepts, now known as Xara. Since then, Gaddesden Place has been the headquarters of Xara Group Ltd. In 2007, Xara was acquired by the German software company Magix. Architecture The north side of Gaddesden Place with the main entrance and east wing Gaddesden Place gatehouse Gaddesden Place is a Grade II* listed building and is a noted example of Palladian architecture. It is said to be Wyatt's first country work and represents his conformity at the start of his active career to the English Palladian tradition. It features an entrance surrounded by a 19th-century porte-coch√®re. On the south side, overlooking the valley, there is a large central portico of five bays (rebuilt 1905) supported by ionic columns. A distinctive semicircular single-storey conservatory, added in 1891, links to an outer wing which has Venetian windows. At the entrance to the grounds on Red Lion Lane there is an 1870 half-timbered brick and Bath stone gatehouse lodge, which is Grade II listed. The landscaped gardens, which feature a pair of Atlas cedars were laid out by Edward Kemp in 1872.  In popular culture  Gaddesden Place and its grounds have been frequently used as film locations. The house was used as the location for Villa Diodati in Ken Russel's 1986 horror film, Gothic, in which Lord Byron (Gabriel Byrne) entertains Mary Shelley (Natasha Richardson) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (Julian Sands). It has also appeared in the TV series Lewis;'Lewis' production notes in \\"The Once and Future Ex\\" episode of Jeeves and Wooster (1993), as Lord Worplesdon's New York residence; and in the Foyle's War episode, \\"A Lesson in Murder\\".Foyle's War (TV Series 2002‚Äì2015) - Filming Locations - IMDb Other productions that have shot at Gaddesden Place have included Fanny by Gaslight (1944), A Kiss Before Dying (1991), Little Britain (2000‚Äì07), The Legend of Tarzan (2016), The Current War (2018), Slaughterhouse Rulez (2018), and Holby City (s21e01 2019).

The name is onomatopoeic, and comes from the sound of waves crashing against the rocks below the village. It was initially romanised as \\"Keeshan\\", but was redesignated \\"Kiix-in (Former First Nation Village)\\" in line with the Maa- nulth Treaty. Huu-ay-aht histories identify the village as being occupied \\"since time began\\", and an archaeological assessment found that the site had been in use for thousands of years. At some point the Huu-ay-aht were attacked by the Klallam, who drove them from the village; it was later reclaimed some point before 1850. An 1874 census found 246 residents. The village was abandoned in the 1880s or 1890s, with the Huu-ay-aht moving to the Deer Group Islands. The village was made a National Historic Site of Canada in 1999 or 2000, and is noted as containing \\"the best preserved remains of any Nuu-chah- nulth traditional village\\". With the permission of the Huu-ay-aht, a team of researchers conducted a pioneering dendroarchaeological survey in 2002 on one of the houses, named Quaksweaqwul.

Plot Leonard Hill and Wesley Bruckner are seen being loaded into a paddy wagon to face life sentences in prison for the Iowa murder of Ellie Banner. Their mothers, Helen Hill (Shelley Winters) and Adelle Bruckner (Debbie Reynolds) fight a crowd to their car. In the car, Helen reveals that someone in the crowd cut the palm of her left hand. Soon at home and tending to her wound, Helen receives an anonymous phone call from a man, \\"I'm the one who cut you...I wanted to see you bleed.\\" This caller threatens to make the mothers pay for the sins of their sons. Helen and Adelle change their names, leave Iowa, and head to Hollywood, where they open a dance academy for little girls who want to be the next Shirley Temple. Soon after arriving, Hamilton Starr (Miche√°l MacLiamm√≥ir), an elocution teacher, offers his services to Helen and Adelle's school, and Adelle takes him up on his offer, much to Helen's chagrin, as Helen is frightened of the menacing man. Soon, the phone calls resume and Helen believes a strange man is watching their home. She has hallucinations, especially at a show where she think she sees Starr with a knife. Adelle falls in love with Lincoln Palmer (Dennis Weaver), the father of a student (Sammee Lee Jones), and Helen grows jealous of the budding relationship. Helen takes solace in her faith, listening to a radio show hosted by evangelist Sister Alma (Agnes Moorehead). Helen's jealousy of Adelle's romance with Lincoln leads to a fight, at which point Adelle demands that Helen move out. Adelle then heads for her date with Lincoln. As Helen readies herself to move out, a mysterious intruder enters the house, walks up the staircase, and calls her real name. Helen reacts by pushing him down the stairs. When he lands at the bottom, his head is gashed open, blood is seeping onto the floor, and Helen envisions her late husband, who was mutilated by a plow, and the dead Ellie Banner. Adelle arrives home to find the dead stranger and, fearing publicity, decides to dispose of the body. As the rain pours, she and Helen drag the dead man into the street and dump his body into an open hole, adjacent to their home, where crews had been doing construction. The body is discovered the next morning and it is presumed that the man fell into the hole to his death. Helen's guilt builds and she visits the church to see Sister Alma and to atone for her sins. Sister Alma offers her forgiveness, but an irrational Helen creates a spectacle and is dragged away by Adelle. Helen is later ordered to take bedrest by her doctor. Adelle goes to a miniature golf course with Lincoln, where he proposes. He drives her home to make preparations to elope that evening. Arriving home, Adelle notices that Helen is not in her room and follows a trail of blood out the back door and down to a rabbit cage, where she finds Helen's pet rabbits slaughtered. Helen steps out of the shadows and reveals that she killed them and that she pushed her husband off a plow to his death. Adelle leads Helen into the house and is phoning Sister Alma when she lets it slip that she plans to wed Lincoln. Helen then pulls a knife from her robe and stabs Adelle in the back. As Adelle falls dead, the doorbell chimes. Helen answers the door, finding a detective who shows her a photo of the man she pushed down the staircase. When she claims not to recognize him, the detective reveals that the man was Ellie Banner's boyfriend, who came to California with plans to murder the two women. Later, Lincoln arrives, expecting to whisk Adelle away. From the street, he can hear someone pounding out \\"Goody Goody\\" on the piano. He enters the house, calling Adelle's name, and follows the sound of the piano up to the rehearsal hall. There, he finds Helen giddily playing the song with Adelle's corpse, dressed in her signature dance costume, tied to a ladder on stage. Helen laughs, completely unhinged. CastProduction Director Curtis Harrington and producer George Edwards approached writer Henry Farrell soon after What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? was a hit, hoping to get a screenplay.Curtis Harrington Interview, Scarlet Street Magazine, No. 11, Summer 1993 p. 59 Farrell told them of a story outline titled \\"The Box Step\\", the story of two contemporary ladies who ran a dance studio. The story was optioned by another studio before Harrington and Edwards could get it. Eventually the story wound up with Harrington and Edwards, who had input on the screenplay. It was their idea to change the setting to a 1930s dance academy for little girls. After the screenplay was developed under the title The Best of Friends, Universal Studios, where Harrington worked, turned it down because they could not find a name star to take a role. Eventually, Debbie Reynolds took the role of Adelle. She had a contract with NBC to be an uncredited producer of a film, so she chose this, taking no salary.A Touch of Glamour: Debbie Reynolds, Scarlet Street (magazine), No. 50, 2004 \\"They put up $750,000 and hired Marty Ransohoff to be on the set, but I actually produced it,\\" said Reynolds. Harrington asked Shelley Winters if she would take the lead role, and Winters agreed without reading the script.Chilling Winters: Shelley Winters Talks About 'What's the Matter With Helen?', Scarlet Street Magazine, No. 11, Summer 1993 Winters recounted how she took the role saying, \\"I wrote a play called One Night Stands of a Noisy Passenger... The previews caused such anxiety that I decided I shouldn't be there for opening night. I tried to figure out what to do, and Curtis Harrington called me about What's the Matter with Helen?\\" Winters changed her mind about missing opening night when she talked to The New York Times' Guy Flatley. \\"Three and a half years on those plays, and I'm not even going to be there for the opening!\\" she said. \\"If it weren't for the actors' strike, we would have opened weeks ago. But now I've got this movie... It's about two women during the thirties who run a school to turn out Shirley Temples, and in my next scene I have to stab Debbie Reynolds to death. Poor Debbie ‚Äî they'd better not give me a real knife.\\" The night before her death scene was to be filmed, Reynolds dreamed that the prop knife was replaced with a real one. She checked the next morning, and discovered the knife had been switched and found herself arguing with the prop master, who did not initially believe her. \\"Who changed it? Well, that's up for grabs,\\" Reynolds said with a laugh. Shelley Winters as Helen Hill According to Reynolds, Winters's psychiatrist advised her not to portray \\"a woman having a nervous breakdown because she was having a nervous breakdown!\\" \\"But nobody knew that, and so all through the film she drove all of us insane! She became the person in the film.\\" Reynolds witnessed Winters's questionable mental status off of the set. The two had been friends many years before, and Reynolds offered to chauffeur Winters to and from the set. \\"I was driving one morning on Santa Monica Boulevard and ahead of me was a woman, wearing only a nightgown, trying to flag down a ride,\\" recalled Reynolds. It was Winters, who claimed, \\"I thought I was late.\\" According to a Los Angeles Times article published while the film was in production, Winters was so difficult on the set that the studio threatened to replace her with Geraldine Page.Notes for \\"What's the Matter With Helen? at TCM.com.

The film began work under the title The Best of Friends, but Otto Preminger protested to the Motion Picture Association because he had registered the similar title Such Good Friends. \\"I wanted Best of Friends,\\" said Reynolds. \\"It was a battle; it cost money...\\" There was little meddling from the studio during the production, though executives wanted Winters to tone down the latent lesbian aspect of her character. \\"They didn't want me to play [the lesbianism] too directly, but I did\\", said Winters. \\"I guess you could interpret it either way, but I played it very clearly. I hope I did, anyway.\\" Additional problems arose in post- production. After Adelle and Helen disposed of the body, Winters had the idea that she should \\"let the lesbian thing come out for a moment\\" by kissing Reynolds on the lips.Curtis Harrington Interview, Scarlet Street Magazine, No. 11, Summer 1993 p. 61 Harrington agreed and the opening of the scene was shot with this moment, but it was cut to keep the film from attaining an R-rating. A similar cut came during the murder of Adelle. Harrington wanted the moment to be \\"as harrowing and brutal as the shower scene in Psycho,‚Äù but the studio made him cut the moment down because the violence would have guaranteed the film an R-rating. The film was liked by critics and audiences, but film historians said it was given the worst advertising campaign for the time, as it featured a murdered Adelle in the ad and TV commercial, minimizing the shock value and giving away the ending. Studios were careful after this to keep end stills and other similar sentences about horror films out of these ads. In September 1972, Helene Winston and Samee Lee Jones reunited on an episode of Love American Style entitled \\"Love and the Amateur Night\\". Essentially reprising their roles as a brash stage mother and a precocious Shirley Temple wannabe (named Debbie after star Debbie Reynolds), Winston and Jones interrupt the honeymoon of a TV personality and hold an impromptu audition, with Jones again performing Animal Crackers in My Soup. Critical reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 44% based on , with a weighted average rating of 5.07/10. Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, calling it a \\"menopausal metaphysical mystery movie\\", and writing \\"The whole movie is very 1930s, right down to the phony studio streets and the 20-foot shadow that comes around the corner five seconds before the actor does.\\" Vincent Canby from The New York Times wrote, \\"This new movie is so perfunctory, it's likely to give misogyny a bad name.\\" Variety wrote in their review of the film \\"What's the Matter with Helen? is an okay exploitation shocker starring Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters as two Hollywood types of the early sound era caught up in mayhem and mutual suspicion. The good red-herring script is hindered from maximum impact by director Curtis Harrington, who raises the interest and excitement level too early and lets the film coast to less-than-tense resolution.\\" Time Out gave the film a positive review, favorably comparing Harrington's direction to that Josef von Sternberg, writing, \\"directed by Curtis Harrington. ... He films this as Sternberg might have, with a great emphasis on masks and facades, underpinned with gorgeous fairytale motifs. Plus he stages the best tango since The Conformist.\\" Eric Henderson from Slant offered similar praise, writing, \\"The layers of pastiche that fuel What‚Äôs the Matter with Helen? multiply like Shelly [sic] Winters's titular character‚Äôs fat white rabbits.\\" Home video The film was released on Blu-ray by Scream Factory Official Trailer on YouTube on March 28, 2017.

No names are given to the 14 divided album tracks, on the jacket or the LP label, and one track has a four-second gap of silence, as if its two tracks jammed into one groove. During post- production, the film underwent additional editing, so portions of the score were truncated and removed. The LP \\"presents the music as it was originally conceived and recorded\\", with two tracks that do not appear in the film, and several that are considerably longer than the versions in the film. =Book version= A novelization, written by Richard Deming, was published by Beagle Books \\"What's the Matter With Helen?\\": RICHARD DEMING:Amazon.com and rushed into bookstores to coincide with the release of the film. Based on Farrell's screenplay, the book follows the script fairly closely but deviates from the film on several occasions, most often in backstories. Both Helen and Adelle are described as \\"slim and attractive\\" and as \\"women in their mid-thirties\\"; Helen's character is blonde and Adelle's is brunette.

Most of the route is a rural two- lane highway and passes through both farmland and residential properties. For some of its path, SR 111 runs generally parallel to the north of the Auglaize River. The highway was first signed in 1923 on much the same alignment as today. A few realignments of the route have happened; the first in 1927 removed a section of highway west of SR 49\\\\. This section was later extended due west of SR 49 to the Indiana state line. Another realignment happened in 1983 with the route heading north out of Paulding concurrent with U.S. Route 127 (US 127). Route description SR 111 begins at an intersection with Woodburn Road and State Line Road on the Indiana state line. The road heads north along the state line passing through farmland as a two-lane highway. The road turns due east and heads away from the state line. The highway has an intersection with SR 49 in rural Paulding County. The route enters the village of Paulding and has an intersection with SR 500\\\\. After the intersection with SR 500 the route passes through a mix of residential and commercial properties. The route makes a sharp curve and heads north towards downtown Paulding. In downtown Paulding, the road has a traffic signal at US 127 and the two routes head north concurrent. The concurrency passes the Paulding County Court House and head north out of downtown Paulding. On the north side of the village the highway passes through mostly residential properties, with some commercial properties. The two highways leave Paulding and passes through farmland, with a few houses. North of Paulding, in rural Paulding County, SR 111 turns east towards Defiance, with US 127 still heading north. The highway heads east passing through farmland, with some houses. The route begins a concurrency with SR 637 west of Junction. The concurrency enters Junction and the concurrency ends with SR 637 heading east and SR 111 heading northeast. The highway leaves Junction heading northeast with the Auglaize River close to the south side of the roadway, resulting in that side of the highway becoming primarily wooded, while the northside of the highway remains bounded by farmland. The road enters Defiance on the southwest side of town, passing through residential properties. At Deatrick and Downs streets, SR 111 intersects SR 66 Truck and SR 111 Truck, a bypass for a low-clearance railroad bridge. The highway passes under the aforementioned railroad bridge (carrying CSX Railroad tracks) and enters downtown Defiance. In the city's downtown, SR 111 reaches a signalized intersection with Third Street, the northern end of the SR 66 and 111 truck routes (also formerly SR 424). An end SR 111 sign assembly is present at this intersection but Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) records continue SR 111 one block north concurrent with SR 66 Truck to end at SR 15, SR 18, and SR 66. SR 111 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of routes important to the nation's economy, mobility and defense. The highway is maintained by ODOT. ODOT's 2009 annual average daily traffic (AADT) calculations showed that the lowest traffic levels were the 2,663 vehicles which used the highway daily on the section that is between the Indiana state line and SR 49; the peak traffic volumes were 12,220 vehicles AADT along a section of SR 111 near its eastern terminus, in downtown Defiance. History SR 111 was first signed and paved in 1923 from the Indiana state line west of Payne to Defiance. The route from Indiana to Payne is now SR 613 and SR 111 was concurrent with SR 108, now SR 49, north of Payne. In 1927 the route from Payne west became SR 113, leaving SR 111 only between SR 49 and Defiance. The highway was extended to Indiana state line heading due west from SR 49 towards Indiana in 1935. In 1983 the route was moved to its current route between Paulding and Defiance. No significant changes have taken place to this state route since 1983. Major intersectionsSR 111 Truck SR 111 Truck is a truck route which bypasses a low railroad bridge along SR 111 in southwestern Defiance. Beginning at a signalized intersection with South Clinton Street (SR 111) and Downs Street (SR 66 Truck), it and SR 66 Truck head northwest along Deatrick Street passing a supermarket and three sets of railroad tracks at-grade. At Baltimore Street (former SR 424), the two truck routes turn northeast onto Holgate Avenue paralleling the Maumee River. After heading through a residential neighborhood of the city, the road bends to the east and transitions to West Third Street. After passing under a railroad bridge, it passes numerous businesses and city facilities before ending at the intersection of Third Street and Clinton Street (SR 111).

History The Conservative Synagogue of Riverdale was founded in 1954 with Rabbi Max Kadushin serving as its first rabbi. Significantly, the first building to be erected by the new congregation was its Hebrew school. In 1962, a new sanctuary, designed by renowned architect Percival Goodman, was dedicated and the community started to grow. In 1973, the Conservative Synagogue merged with Adath Israel of the Grand Concourse, one of New York City's greatest Conservative institutions.

Graham and party's ascent of the Dent du G√©ant in 1882.Alpine history Whilst the golden age of alpinism (1854‚Äì1865) was characterised by the first ascents of many of the Alps's most dominant mountains, the subsequent silver age may be seen as consisting of the first ascents of the many worthwhile peaks left unclimbed, although these peaks were ‚Äì and remained ‚Äì largely unknown to the wider public in Great Britain. Once these peaks had been climbed, many ambitious alpinists turned their attention to more distant and often loftier ranges, such as the Caucasus, the Andes, the Rockies and, latterly, the Himalayas. Prominent alpinists and guides of the period include Christian Almer, Melchior Anderegg, Hermann von Barth, Alexander Burgener, W. A. B. Coolidge, Henri Cordier, Clinton Thomas Dent, James Eccles, D.

A member of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, she is a former advisor to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and former Principal Secretary to Doug Ford. Once referred to as \\"the most powerful woman in Ottawa,\\" she currently operates her own consulting firm, Jenni Byrne + Associates. Personal lifeFamily= Byrne was born to Jerry and Julie Byrne in 1976 in Fenelon Falls, Ontario. Her mother was a teacher, who died in 2010 at the age of 58. Her father is a carpenter who joined the Reform Party in the 1990s to protest the Liberals' long-gun registry. Her sister, Jerra Kosick (nee Byrne), is also involved with the Conservative Party of Canada, most recently serving as the chief of staff to Minister Michelle Rempel. Byrne is not married and does not have children. =Education= Byrne was a nursing student at Georgian College, but did not graduate. She later attended the University of Ottawa, where she organized campus clubs for the Reform Party of Canada and did not graduate. Political career Byrne became involved in politics at age 16, when she joined the Reform Party. Byrne's father, Jerry, had joined the same party to protest the Liberals' long-gun registry. She eventually became the President of the student Reform Party Club at the University of Ottawa. In a media interview, Byrne cited her concerns over debt reduction and tax cuts and how they were more important to her generation than to her parents' generation: \\"It's great for them to say don‚Äôt cut here or there, but they won't be the ones affected by (the debt). They‚Äôre in their late 40s and they will probably still benefit from government programs. But Canada looks like a bleak place for me by the time I'm their age.\\" Byrne has been called Prime Minister Harper's \\"single best political organizer\\", a dedicated Harper loyalist who believed in the party during its darkest days. She is also known for her tenacity and possesses \\"a single-minded unwillingness to put up with people screwing around.\\" = Conservative Party = In 2009, she became the Director of Political Operations for the Conservative Party of Canada following the appointment of Doug Finley to the Senate of Canada. Byrne was the deputy national campaign manager in the 2006, 2008, and 2011 federal elections, serving under Doug Finley. Between elections, Byrne served in several roles in the Prime Minister's Office, including advisor to Chief of Staff Ian Brodie and Director of Issues Management, and at the headquarters of the Conservative Party of Canada. In the 2011 campaign she was promoted to national campaign manager due to the ill health of Doug Finley. She served as campaign manager of the machine designed and largely still run by Finley, taking the pressure off him to allow his pursuit of cancer treatment. Byrne's responsibilities were overseeing the day-to-day operations of Finley‚Äôs campaign, what The Hill Times called \\"one the most efficient, richest, and iron-disciplined campaign machines in Canadian political history.\\" =Return to Prime Minister's Office= In August 2013, Byrne left her job as the Conservative Director of Political Operations and returned to the Prime Minister's Office as co-Deputy Chief of Staff. =Campaign manager for 2015 election= In October 2014 the Conservative Party announced that Byrne would lead the campaign in the 42nd Canadian federal election. Shortly before the election, Byrne was reported to have left the Conservative Party's campaign office in Ottawa and returned to Calgary. The Conservative government lost power to the Liberals, who won a majority of the seats. After the election, a number of Conservatives blamed Byrne for her role in the party's defeat and criticized her management style. Byrne's contract expired after the election. =Ontario Provincial Politics= Following Doug Ford's election as leader of the Ontario PC Party in March 2018, Byrne took over as Director of Field Operations for the 2018 Provincial Election. After the election, Byrne was selected to be Ford's first Principal Secretary. In January 2019 she left the Premier‚Äôs office to accept an appointment to the Ontario energy board. In February 2020 she launched Jenni Byrne + Associates, a government relations firm based in Toronto. Media Byrne is a frequent political commentator on Canadian television networks, most frequently featured on CBC‚Äôs Power and Politics with Vassy Kapelos.

The club is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Ospreys. Early history Crynant RFC was believed to have been founded in 1898 and played their first recorded game on Christmas Day that year against Ystradgynlais. 1904 saw the great religious revivalFields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp120 throughout South Wales led by the lay preacher, Evan Roberts. Like many teams in South Wales the vast number of players who quit rugby to follow, or show to follow, a more godly morale code resulted in the eventual dissolution of the club in 1904. The club reformed in 1908 with games being played at Maesmawr field and the Red Lion Hotel used as a clubhouse. In 1912 Crynant RFC joined the Swansea and District League and moved clubhouse to the Star Hotel which they used until the 1960s. At the outbreak of World War I club rugby in Wales ceased and the club disbanded for the second time in their history. 1919-1960 After the First World War, Crynant RFC reformed and joined the Neath and District League, a league they would win five times between 1922 and 1926 In 1928 the club gained membership to the Welsh Rugby Union. One of the proudest moments in the club's history came in 1939 when former club player, Cyril Challinor, now playing for Neath, was chosen to represent Wales against England. Wales lost the game and Cyril was dropped from the national squad making this his one and only cap.Rothamans Rugby Yearbook 1981-82, Vivian Jenkins (1982) pg213 The club disbanded for a third time in 1939 with the outbreak of World War II, though the team reformed again with the end of the war. During the 1940s a second team formed in Crynant, the Crynant Harlequins, but despite local rivalry the clubs merged in May 1950. In 1956 the club gained a new pitch adjacent to Maesmawr field and soon after gained ownership of an old shop and billiard hall which was converted into the club's first permanent clubhouse. During the 1950s Crynant saw two more former players capped for Wales, Roy John and C.C. Meredith. Both men, at the time of being picked to play for Wales, were members of Neath RFC. 1961 - present Though Crynant saw little success on the pitch during the sixties, they did see a fourth former player go on to represent Wales. In 1967 former Crynant player Ron Jones was selected to face England, though at the time he played club football for English team Coventry. He would represent Wales a further four times between 1967 and 1968. The 1968/69 season saw the introduction of a youth side, which would allow the growth of local talent to help strengthen future senior teams. In 1971, Crynant's secretary since 1927, Rhys Emlyn Williams, was elected to the post of Welsh Rugby Union President. As was laid out in WRU rules he would hold the post for a single year. In 1983 the clubhouse was badly damaged by a fire. The damage was extensive and the club was under insured; it took until 2003 for the club to finally relieve themselves of the debts built to repair the damage. During the club's centenary season in 1995/96 they were visited by top level Welsh clubs as part of the celebrations; these included Llanelli, Neath and Swansea. Club badge The emblem of Crynant Rugby Club includes a picture of a white horse which is believed to relate to the mountain of March Hywel that overlooks the village. The horse is Hywel's Horse which is linked back to an ancient battle that took place on the mountain between local tribes. The badge also contains a picture of a star that represents the original clubhouse of Crynant RFC, The Star Hotel. On the opposite side is a picture of what can only be described as an M with two circles placed over the points of the M. To this day nobody within the village is able to determine what this symbol means and since the designer of the badge is no longer alive, the final symbolism is lost.

It was the final battle of the Buffalo Hunters' War, and was the last major fight involving the United States and Native Americans on the High Plains of Texas.Handbook of Texas Online - YELLOW HOUSE CANYON, BATTLE OFhttp://lubbockonline.com/stories/112707/lif_112707026.shtml Background The 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty reserved the area between the Arkansas River and Canadian River as Indian hunting grounds. Yet, since 1873, several buffalo hunting parties operated in the Texas Panhandle, supplied out of Adobe Walls, Texas by Charlie Mayer and Charlie Rath. These incursions already led to the Second Battle of Adobe Walls in 1874. In December 1876, a group of Comanche under Black Horse received a permit, through the Indian agent at Fort Sill, to allow them to hunt in Texas. But Black Horse had other interests in mind; he was angry that overhunting by settlers had radically thinned herds of American bison (buffalo), and planned to camp in Yellow House Canyon and attack whatever hunters he saw. Earlier in the winter of 1876, buffalo hunter Marshall Sewell had, along with a group of skinners, set up camp below the Caprock in Garza County, near the head of the Salt Fork Brazos River. On February 1, 1877, Sewell discovered a herd of buffalo, and after setting up station, picked the animals off one-by-one with his rifle before running out of ammunition. Black Horse witnessed this, and with his warriors, surrounded the hunter on his way back to camp. They tortured and double-scalped him before cutting open his stomach and placing pieces of his rifle tripod in the wounds. The action was witnessed by the three skinners who had accompanied Sewell and by another hunter, all of whom were close to a mile away. They hurried to Rath City, the nearest settlement of any size, to report the murder. Sewell appears to have been popular among local buffalo hunters, and as a result, reaction came quickly; about 40 men rode to the site of the murder and buried the hunter, after which they picked up the Comanches' trail. The two parties met in a brief skirmish, in which a half-breed hunter named Spotted Jack was wounded by the Texans, who then returned to Rath City. Black Horse took close to 170 warriors, among whom was captive Herman Lehmann, and began plundering hunters' camps in the region. Among those targeted were Pat Garrett and Willis Glenn. Needless to say, the affair caused great consternation among buffalo hunters, and they demanded action be taken. Battle A group of 46 men set out from Rath City on March 4, with the express purpose of finding Black Horse and his men. Jim White was elected captain; a former comanchero from New Mexico, named Jos√©, acted as guide. Twenty-six of the men rode horses; the others came by wagon. Two nights into the journey, White began to suffer from bleeding in his lungs, and he was required to turn back to Rath City; one of his lieutenants, Jim Smith, was elevated to captain. The band found the site where Sewell had been captured and there picked up the Comanche's trail, following it westward to just northwest of the present-day city of Post; here, the guide predicted Black Horse and his Comanches would be found in Yellow House Canyon. They did, and they entered the canyon at the site of Buffalo Springs Lake, where they killed a sentry. Scouts sighted the Comanche camp later that same day, and the band began an overnight march to reach it, in the process leaving provisions and wagons at the spring. The Texans reached the canyon fork, today in Mackenzie State Recreation Area, sometime in the early hours of March 18; for a time, they mistakenly followed the north fork before turning south. Moving west, they found a combined Comanche and Apache camp in Hidden Canyon, a site now marked by Lubbock Lake. By then, much of the day was gone, but the buffalo hunters nevertheless decided to mount an attack. They divided themselves into three groups, two mounted and one not; the mounted men went to the sides of the canyon, on the plain, while the hunters on foot followed the creek in the center. When they were within shooting distance, a charge was ordered. This frightened the natives for a moment, and they started for their horses before discovering how small was the force attacking them. Consequently, they rallied - women ran towards the horsemen discharging pistols, while the warriors set up a defensive position. The spirited defense surprised the Texans, who withdrew. One Joe Jackson was shot in the abdomen; some two months later the wound proved fatal, rendering him one of 12 fatalities on the Texans' side. Several others, including the guide, were wounded, as were a number of natives; most notably among the latter, Herman Lehmann was shot in the thigh, and his companion was killed. At one point during the fighting, a group of hunters, including John R. Cook, managed to repel a flanking movement from the natives; even so, the outnumbered Texans were forced to withdraw down the canyon. The Comanche then set a grass fire to use it as a smoke screen. At midafternoon, a retreat was ordered, and the hunters set out towards Buffalo Springs. The natives trailed them briefly before breaking off. The Texans used a bonfire as a decoy before pulling out altogether during the night; they set fires behind them to obscure their tracks. They finally returned to Rath City on March 27. Aftermath Although the battle itself was a failure, it marked the beginning of the end of the war. Word of the fight soon reached Fort Griffin, and Captain P. L. Lee responded by going after the hostiles with 72 soldiers of the 10th Cavalry. At Lubbock Lake, they turned north, and on May 4 overtook the natives at Quemodo Lake in Cochran County. A brief skirmish erupted, in which one Ekawakane and his wife were killed. As a result, the remaining natives surrendered and returned to Fort Sill. By the winter of 1878-1879, the main herd of buffalo on the South Plains had been destroyed, bringing an end to organized buffalo hunting. Several accounts of the battle exist, told from different points of view. Two of the Texan participants, John Cook and Willis Glenn, left descriptions of the action in their memoirs. Herman Lehmann, too, gave an account of the affair in his autobiography, telling it from the Indian point of view.Lehmann, H., 1927, 9 Years Among the Indians, 1870-1879, Austin: Von Beockmann-Jones Company, pp. 171-172 The site of the battle is today located in the Canyon Lake Project in Lubbock. Monuments mark a number of sites within the area associated with the battle. Some accounts place the frontiersman Charles \\"Buffalo\\" Jones, the cofounder of Garden City, Kansas, and a leader in the efforts to prevent the extinction of the buffalo, at the battle site.

She was the founding chief executive of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and was credited with the successful completion of the museum, considered the largest international museum project of the 1990s. Early life and education Sotheran was born on 11 October 1945 into a large Roman Catholic family in Stratford, a farming town in the Taranaki province. She was educated at St Mary's College in Auckland. She graduated from secondary teachers' college in 1968 and completed a Masters of Arts in English at the University of Auckland in 1969, then undertook further study in the Art History department at the university.

Tihomir was appointed the Grand Prince of Serbia (1166) by Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus though he ruled jointly with his brothers. The lands were divided: Stracimir ruled West Morava, Miroslav ruled Zahumlje and Travunia Stefan Nemanja was given Toplica, Ibar, Rasina and Reke. Nemanja was also a vassal to Manuel I, through his appanage of Duboƒçica. Tihomir‚Ä≤s younger brother Nemanja aided the Imperial army against the Hungarians in Srem in 1164. The tie between Nemanja and Manuel I was most likely seen as a threat to Tihomir. Stefan Nemanja built the Monastery of Saint Nicholas in Kur≈°umlija and the Monastery of the Holy Mother of Christ near Kosanica-Toplica, without the approval of Tihomir. Nemanja had felt that he had the free will of doing so, Tihomir disagreed, Nemanja was, or Tihomir thought that he was trying to assert independence through his relation to Manuel I. Tihomir had Nemanja chained and thrown into jail, his lands were annexed. Nemanja's supporters convinced the Church that Tihomir had done all this because of his disapproval of church building, thus the Church turned against Tihomir, and Nemanja managed to escape the jail and returned to his province. Stefan Nemanja mobilized an army, possibly with Byzantine help, and headed for the crownland. Manuel I might have been displeased with Tihomir's actions. Nemanja was triumphant; Tihomir and Miroslav and Stracimir were expelled to Byzantium in 1167. Stefan Nemanja quickly became a powerful figure, and Manuel I subsequently turned to Tihomir and his brothers. The Byzantine Empire wanted to see Serbia divided by several princes to keep it weak. Manuel I provided Tihomir with an army, coming in from Skopje. In 1171, Nemanja raised a large army and defeated Tihomir's forces at the Battle of Pantina near Zveƒçan. Tihomir drowned in the River of Sitnica. Nemanja captured his other brothers and made peace, giving them rule in their former lands by recognizing him as the only ruler of Serbia. The Nemanjiƒá dynasty was named after Stefan Nemanja who ruled Serbia until 1371.

This page discusses a more abstract concept of models of product lines of product lines (PL**2) called metamodels, and product lines of product lines of product lines called meta-metamodels (PL**3), and further abstract concepts.  Metamodels  A metamodel is a model whose instances are models. A GenVoca model of a product line is a tuple whose components are features (0-ary or 1-ary functions). An extension (a.k.a. delta or refinement) of a model is a \\"meta-feature\\", which is a tuple of deltas that can modify an existing product line by modifying existing features and adding new features. As a simple example, consider GenVoca model M that contains three features a-c: M = [ a, b, c ] Suppose meta-model MM contains three meta-features AAA-CCC, each of which is a tuple with a single non- identity feature: \\\\begin{array}{lcl}MM = [ AAA, BBB, CCC ] \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ = [ [a,0,0], [0,b,0], [0,0,c] ]\\\\end{array} where 0 is the null feature.

This was one of the first events which brought the issue of scientific misconduct to the attention of the scientific community and the American public. Scientific misconduct Rosenfeld was a Harvard undergraduate (Class of 1975) doing research on transfer factor in the laboratory of Dr. David Dressler. His research showed that a subcellular fraction prepared from cells of the immune system of an animal having cell-mediated immunity to the hapten dinitrochlorobenzene could transfer that specific immunity to a second, previously non-immune animal. Further it showed that the active component of this transfer factor appeared to be RNA. It was soon discovered that Rosenfeld had forged various letters of recommendation for himself and signed Dressler's name to them. This led to re-examination of Rosenfeld's experiments, which could not be successfully repeated by other scientists. Two articles describing Rosenfeld's research on transfer factor had been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Subsequently, Dressler published an Authors' Statement \\"about the existence and nature of 'transfer factor'\\" in this same journal, making a \\"statement of uncertainty and potential retraction with our sincere apologies\\". Similarly, an article published in Annals of Internal Medicine was withdrawn. This incident, along with the contemporary falsification of data by William Summerlin at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, was one of the first events which brought the issue of scientific misconduct to the attention of the scientific community and the American public.

United States, 360 U.S. 109 (1959), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the actions of the House Un- American Activities Committee did not violate the First Amendment and, thus, the Court upheld Barenblatt's conviction for contempt of Congress. The Court held that the congressional committee had authority to compel a college professor to answer questions about his Communist Party membership.  Background  On February 25th, 1953, the House Committee on Un-American Activities began a series of investigations to determine \\"the character, extent and objects of Communist Party activities ‚Ä¶ carried on by [teachers] who are subject to the directives and discipline of the Communist Party.\\" Francis Crowley was brought before the committee and testified that while he was a graduate student at the University of Michigan in 1950 he and Lloyd Barenblatt - with whom he had shared an apartment - had participated in a student club with ties to the Communist Party. Lloyd Barenblatt was subpoenaed in June 1954. Since his time as a teaching fellow at the University of Michigan, Barenblatt had been a social psychology instructor at Vassar. When he was subpoenaed to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the college refused to renew his contract. Although Barenblatt admitted that he had been at Michigan at the time and knew Crowley he refused to answer five questions: # Are you now a member of the Communist Party? # Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? # Did you know Francis Crowley to be a member of the Communist Party? # Were you ever involved with a student organization affiliated with the Communist Party while at the University of Michigan? # Were you a member while a student of the University of Michigan Council of Arts, Sciences, and Professions? Barenblatt objected to these questions on the basis that they concerned his personal and private political and religious beliefs, as well as his associative activities. He did not invoke the 5th Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. He argued that the committee was not authorized to compel testimony, he was given insufficient information about his testimony's relevance to the committee's legislative tasks, and his objections were protected by the First Amendment. The House of Representatives held him in contempt of Congress to refusing to answer these questions, and a U.S. attorney obtained conviction against him. On appeal to the Supreme Court, Barenblatt was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. Decision of the Court The Court, in a 5-4 decision, held that HUAC did not violate Barenblatt's First Amendment rights. Justice Harlan's opinion stated that \\"Where First Amendment rights are asserted to bar governmental interrogation, resolution of the issue involves a balancing of the competing private and public interests.\\" Harlan then struck a balance in favor of the government: \\"That Congress has wide power to legislate in the field of Communist activity in this Country, and to conduct appropriate investigations in aid thereof, is hardly debatable. This power rests on the right of self-preservation, the ultimate value of any society.\\" This governmental interest was found to outweigh Professor Barenblatt's First Amendment interest in studying, discussing, and associating with those interested in the theories of Communism. Professor Barenblatt claimed he never sought to overthrow the government through his discussions of Communism. Nevertheless, the Court deferred to Congress's power to investigate for legislative purposes. =Dissenting opinions= Two dissenting opinions were presented. Justice Hugo Black's dissent was concurred with by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William O. Douglas. Black dissented on these grounds: First, that the term \\"Un-American\\" in the committee's mission was so vague as to make the committee's mandate void under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Second, the Court's \\"balancing test\\" as to the applicability of First Amendment rights was not the way to determine the scope of freedom of speech, and if it were, the Court should have balanced the interest of society in \\"being able to join organizations, advocate causes and make political 'mistakes'\\" against the government's limited interest in making laws in the area of free speech...\\" Third, \\"the chief aim, purpose, and practice of the HUAC... is to try witnesses and punish them because they are or have been Communists or because they refuse or admit or deny Communist affiliations.\\" Justice William J. Brennan, also dissenting, wrote, \\"...no purpose for the investigation of Barenblatt is revealed by the record except exposure purely for the sake of exposure. This is not the purpose to which Barenblatt's rights under the First Amendment can validly be subordinated. An investigation in which the processes of law-making and law-evaluating are submerged entirely in exposure of individual behavior-in adjudication, of a sort, through the exposure process-is outside the constitutional pale of congressional inquiry.\\" Justice Black rejected the Court's balancing test: \\"I do not agree that laws directly abridging First Amendment freedoms can be justified by a balancing process... [The balancing test] completely leaves out the real interest in Barenblatt's silence, the interest of the people as a whole in being able to join organizations, advocate causes and make political 'mistakes' without later being subjected to governmental penalties for having dared to think for themselves.\\" See also *Wilkinson v.

As of 2007 the population was 10,289 in a total area of 318 km¬≤. It became a municipality in 1962. Location Planura belongs to the statistical micro-region of Frutal. It is located in the center of the rich region of western Minas Gerais known as the Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro at an elevation of 492 meters. The Rio Grande, dammed to form the Represa de Porto Col√¥miba, forms the southern boundary. Neighboring municipalities are: *West: Frutal *North: Pirajuba *East: Concei√ß√£o das Alagoas *South: Col√¥mbia in the state of S√£o Paulo Important distances are: *Belo Horizonte: 578 km *Pirajuba: 30 km *Frutal: 37 km *Uberaba: 110 km Highway map History The first settlement began on lands belonging to Jo√£o Janu√°rio da Silva e Oliveira, on the banks of the Rio Grande. The first group of houses was known as Porto do Cemit√©rio, later changing the name to Esplanada. In 1938 it became a district of Frutal with the name Nova Esplanada. In 1962 it became a municipality. The growth of the town has been due to the building of the Usina Hidrel√©trica de Porto Col√¥mbia, in the 1970s. The name is due to the flat lands of the region.Planura informa√ß√µes Economic activities The most important economic activities are cattle raising, commerce, royalties from the Porto Col√¥mba hydroelectric station, and agriculture. The GDP in 2005 was R$433 million, half of which came from industry. Planura is in the top tier of municipalities in the state with regard to economic and social development. As of 2007, there was one banking agency in the town. There was a small retail infrastructure serving the surrounding area of cattle and agricultural lands. There were 1,106 automobiles in all of the municipality, about one for every 10 inhabitants.IBGE In the rural area there were 75 establishments occupying 76,000 hectares. About 300 persons were employed in agriculture. 41 of the farms had tractors, a ratio of one in two. There were 6,000 head of cattle in 2006, of which 2,500 head were dairy cows. In permanent crops there were 8,000 ha planted, while in perennial crops 8,300 ha were planted (in 2006). The crops with a planted area of more than 1,000 hectares were sugarcane, corn, and soybeans. The production of vegetables is aided by the abundance of water in the region, available from the Usina de Porto Col√¥mbia. Planura is one of the largest producers of cucumber, red pepper and tomatoes in the state. Health and education In the health sector there were 03 health clinics and no hospital. In the educational sector there were 04 primary schools and 02 middle schools. *Municipal Human Development Index: 0.779 (2000) *State ranking: 121 out of 853 municipalities as of 2000 *National ranking: 1,088 out of 5,138 municipalities as of 2000 *Literacy rate: 89% *Life expectancy: 73 (average of males and females) The highest ranking municipality in Minas Gerais in 2000 was Po√ßos de Caldas with 0.841, while the lowest was Setubinha with 0.568.

Please read the Feature Oriented Programming page that explains how an FOSD model of a domain is a tuple of 0-ary functions (called values) and a set of 1-ary (unary) functions called features. This page discusses multidimensional generalizations of FOSD models, which are important for compact specifications of complex programs. Origami A fundamental generalization of metamodels is origami. The essential idea is that a program's design need not be represented by a single expression; multiple expressions can be used. This involves the use of multiple orthogonal GenVoca models. :: Example: Let T be a tool model, which has features P (parse), H (harvest),D (doclet), and J (translate to Java). P is a value and the rest are unary-functions. A tool T1 that parses a file written in a Java dialect language and translates it to pure Java is modeled by: T1 = J‚Ä¢P. And a javadoc-like tool T2 parses a file in a Java dialect, harvests comments, and translates harvested comments into an HTML page is: T2 = D‚Ä¢H‚Ä¢P. So tools T1 and T2 are among the products of the product line of T. :: A language model L describes a family (product line) of Java dialects. It includes the features: B (Java 1.4), G (generics), S (State machines). B is a value, and the rest are unary functions. So a dialect of Java L1 that has generics (i.e., Java 1.5) is: L1 = G‚Ä¢B. And a dialect of Java L2 that has language support for state machines is: L2 = S‚Ä¢B. So dialects L1 and L2 are among the products of the product line of L. :: To describe a javadoc like tool (E) for the dialect of Java with state machines requires two expressions: one that defines the tool functionality for E (using the T model) and its Java dialect (using the L model): E = D‚Ä¢H‚Ä¢P -- tool equation E = S‚Ä¢B -- language equation :: Models L and T are orthogonal GenVoca models: one expresses the feature-based structure of the E tool, and the other the feature-based structure of its input language. Note that models T and L really are abstract in the following sense: the implementation of any feature of T really depends on the tool's dialect (expressed by L), and (symmetrically) the implementation of any feature of L really depends on the tool's functionality (expressed by T). So the only way one could implement E is by knowing both T and L equations. Let U=[U1,U2,...,Un] be a GenVoca model of n features, and W=[W1,...Wm] be a GenVoca model of m features. The relationship between two orthogonal models U and W is a matrix UW, called an Origami matrix, where each row corresponds to a feature in U and each column corresponds to a feature in W. Entry UWij is a function that implements the combination of features Ui and Wj. : Note: UW is the tensor product of U and W (i.e., UW=U√óW). UW = U \\\\times W = \\\\begin{bmatrix} UW_{11} & UW_{12} & \\\\cdots & UW_{1n}  \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  UW_{m1} & UW_{m2} & \\\\cdots & UW_{mn} \\\\end{bmatrix} :: Example. Recall models T=[P,H,D,J] and L=[B,G,S]. The Origami matrix TL is: TL = T \\\\times L = \\\\begin{bmatrix} PB & PG & PS  HB & HG & HS  DB & DG & DS  JB & JG & JS \\\\end{bmatrix} :: where PB is a value that implements a parser for Java, PG is a unary-function that extends a Java parser to parse generics, and PS is a unary-function that extends a Java parser to parse state machine specifications. HB is a unary-function that implements a harvester of comments on Java code. HG is a unary-function that implements a harvester of comments on generic code, and HS is a unary-function that implements a harvester of comments on state machine specifications, and so on. To see how multiple equations are used to synthesize a program, again consider models U and W. A program F is described by two equations, one per model. We can write an equation for F in two different ways: referencing features by name or by their index position, such as: F = U_1 \\\\cdot U_2 \\\\cdot U_4 = \\\\sum_{i=1,2,4} U_i ‚ÄîU expression of F F = W_1 \\\\cdot W_3 = \\\\sum_{j=1,3} W_i‚ÄîW expression of F The UW model defines how models U and W are implemented. Synthesizing program F involves projecting UW of unneeded columns and rows, and aggregating (a.k.a. tensor contraction): F = UW_{11} \\\\cdot UW_{21} \\\\cdot ... \\\\cdot UW_{33} = \\\\sum_{i=1,2,3} \\\\sum_{j=1,3} UW_{i,j} = \\\\sum_{j=1,3} \\\\sum_{i=1,2,3} UW_{i,j} A fundamental property of origami matrices, called orthogonality, is that the order in which dimensions are contracted does not matter. In the above equation, summing across the U dimension (index i) first or the W dimension (index j) first does not matter. Of course, orthogonality is a property that must be verified. Efficient (linear) algorithms have been developed to verify that origami matrices (or tensors/n-dimensional arrays) are orthogonal. The significance of orthogonality is one of view consistency. Aggregating (contracting) along a particular dimension offers a 'view' of a program. Different views should be consistent: if one repairs the program's code in one view (or proves properties about a program in one view), the correctness of those repairs or properties should hold in all views. In general, a product of a product line may be represented by n expressions, from n orthogonal and abstract GenVoca models G1 ... Gn. The Origami matrix (or cube or tensor) is an n-dimensional array A: A = G_1 \\\\times ... \\\\times G_n = \\\\prod_{k=1}^n G_k A product H of this product line is formed by eliminating unnecessary rows, columns, etc. from A, and aggregating (contracting) the n-cube into a scalar: H = \\\\sum_{i_1} \\\\sum_{i_2} ... \\\\sum_{i_n} G_{i_1,i_2...i_n} :: Example. Recall program E and model T=[P,H,D,J]. E=D‚Ä¢H‚Ä¢P=T2‚Ä¢T1‚Ä¢T0. Similarly, E's representation in model L=[B,G,S] is E=S‚Ä¢B=L2‚Ä¢L0. Synthesizing E given Origami model TL is evaluating the following expression: E = \\\\sum_{i=2,0} \\\\sum_{j=2,0} TL_{i,j} = \\\\sum_{j=2,0} \\\\sum_{i=2,0} TL_{i,j}. Applications There are several of product line applications developed using Origami. Among them include: * AHEAD Tool Suite and Extensible Java Preprocessors * Expression Problem or the Extensibility Problem * Refinements and Multi-Dimensional Separation of Concerns More applications to be supplied.

Yuly Aikhenvald's daughter and Viktor Vinogradov's favourite disciple, Shvedova was elected into the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1997. After Sergei Ozhegov's death in 1964, Shvedova was responsible for updating and correcting his immensely popular explanatory dictionary of the Russian language. Among her later projects was the first semantic dictionary of the language (vol. 1, 1998; vol. 2, 2000).  Life and career  Natalia Shvedova was born in 1916 in Moscow. In 1940 she graduated from Moscow State Pedagogical University, Faculty of Language and Literature. From 1940 to 1944 she occupied the post of senior lecturer at Mordovian State University and Mordovian State Pedagogical University. In 1946 she became a Candidate of Sciences and started working for Russian Language Institute. In 1958 Natalia Shvedova acquired the rank of Doktor nauk.  Academic work  Natalia Yulievna Shvedova is the author of many fundamental works which compose an integral part of the classical fund of Russian studies. Among them, such major studies as the monograph \\"Essays on the syntax of Russian colloquial speech\\" (1960); book \\"Changes in the system of simple sentences\\" as part of the monographic study \\"Essays on the historical grammar of the Russian literary language of the XIX century\\" (1964); monograph \\"Active Processes in Modern Russian Syntax\\" (1966); sections \\"Syntax of a simple sentence\\" in the \\"Grammar of the Modern Russian Literary Language\\" (1970), in the two-volume academic \\"Russian Grammar\\" (1980), and in the \\"Brief Overview of Russian Grammar\\" (1989). Natalia Shvedova is the author of the concept of the \\"Russian Semantic Dictionary\\", the theoretical foundations of which were formulated by her in the \\"Preface\\" to this dictionary (vol. I, 1998) and other works. Shvedova developed the theoretical program titled \\"Russian grammar of meanings\\", the conceptual foundations of which are set forth in her article \\"The semantic structure of language as the basis of its functioning\\" (1991), in the book \\"The system of pronouns as the source of the semantic structure of language and its semantic categories\\" (in collaboration with A.S. Belousova, 1995), in the monograph \\"Pronoun and meaning\\" (1998), as well as in the cycle of studies on the semantics of the Russian verb (2000‚Äì2001). In \\"Russian Grammar\\" (1980), the syntax is innovatively defined as the central part of the grammatical system of the language, encompassing the various constructions that form the message. The system-forming factors of the syntax are distinguished, first of all, the types of syntactic units and the corresponding sections of the syntactic system: 1) the syntax of the word; 2) the syntax of the phrase; 3) the syntax of the simple sentence; 4) the syntax of the complex sentence; 5) the syntax of the word form,presented in the four above-mentioned areas. Natalia Shvedova has participated in creation of numerous collective works, such as 'Bibliographic index of literature on Russian linguistics from 1925 to 1980', 'Grammar of the Modern Russian Literary Language' (1970), 'Russian Grammar' (1980), 'Brief Grammar of the Russian Language' (1989), grammatical volume of 'Selected Works' of academic Viktor Vinogradov and 'Word and grammatical laws of language' (1989). Shvedova is widely known in Russia as one of the prominent lexicographers, co-author and editor of the explanatory Dictionary of the Russian Language (Ozhegov).

The theory of evolution by natural selection is now scientific orthodoxy, but when it was unveiled it caused a storm of controversy, from fellow scientists as well as religious people. They criticised it for being short on evidence and long on assertion and Darwin, being the honest scientist that he was, agreed with them. He knew that his theory was riddled with 'difficulties', but he entrusted future generations to complete his work and prove the essential truth of his vision, which is what scientists have been doing for the past 150 years. Evolutionary biologist Professor Armand Marie Leroi charts the scientific endeavour that brought about the triumphant renaissance of Darwin's theory. He argues that, with the new science of evolutionary developmental biology (evo devo), it may be possible to take that theory to a new level - to do more than explain what has evolved in the past, and start to predict what might evolve in the future.

The mural was painted by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze in 1861 and symbolizes Manifest Destiny, the belief that the United States was destined for Western exploration and expansion originating from the initial colonies along the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean. A study measuring hangs in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The darkness turning into light represents the greatness that was believed to lie in the future West.  Content  Leutze combined pioneer men and women, mountain guides, wagons, and mules to suggest a divinely ordained(1 of, relating to, or characterizing God or a deity. 2 godlike. 3 of, relating to, or associated with religion or worship. the divine liturgy. 4 of supreme excellence or worth) pilgrimage to the Promised Land of the western frontier. Within the left half of the picture is a depiction of the entrance to the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate, which is being pointed to by the pilgrim seated atop the rock in the foreground. Within the right hemisphere of the painting is a depiction of a valley, representing the Valley of Darkness and symbolic of the troubles faced by explorers. The imagery is familiar imperial iconography and is regarded as a symbol of American exceptionalism and the realization of Manifest Destiny, ultimately leading to the evolution of the American Empire.  Literary reference  The painting takes its inspiration from the closing lines of George Berkeley's Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America: Westward the course of empire takes its way; The first four Acts already past, A fifth shall close the Drama with the day; Time's noblest offspring is the last.  Influences  The imagery of the pilgrim gesturing on a high rock is very similar to the 5 cent postage stamp, Fremont in the Rocky Mountains, that was part of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Issue and reprinted a century later. A Currier and Ives print from 1868 uses the same title and theme for a very different print, showing a railroad crossing a new settlement as the train goes west. A photographic print and a stereograph by Alexander Gardner,[https://www.kshs.org/km/items/view/153 Stereograph both of an 1867 end-of-track frontier construction train, were titled Westward The Course of Empire Takes Its Way.  In popular culture  David Foster Wallace named one of his short stories \\"Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way\\" in his 1989 collection Girl with Curious Hair. Early revisions of the 1995 computer game Oregon Trail II depict the study version of this painting on the title screen.

The larvae of the members of Glyptapanteles sp. are distinguished by their ability to manipulate their hosts into serving as bodyguards. Reproduction Glyptapanteles phytometrae and host left Female Glyptapanteles oviposit into caterpillar hosts. The caterpillar continues to grow and feed normally until the 4th or 5th instar, whereupon up to 80 fully grown larvae emerge from its body to pupate. Some species parasitized by Glyptapanteles include Lymantria dispar, Chrysodeixis chalcites, Thyrinteina leucocerae (both pictured), and Acronicta rumicis. According to a study done in South Korea on the species G. liparidis, the parasitoid tends to prefer to feed on the second-instar A. rumicis larva, indicating that the stage of caterpillar life may have significant role in maximizing nutrient intake. Behavior alteration After the larvae of Glyptapanteles sp. emerge, the caterpillar takes up position near the cocoons of the pupae, arches its back, and ceases to move or feed. It will occasionally spin silk over the pupae. However, when disturbed, it begins to thrash violently. No longer inclined to eat, the affected caterpillar eventually dies. It has been demonstrated in experimental research (Grosman, et al.) that this behavior is to strike at and repel possible predators of the pupae, such as the shield bug Supputius cincticeps, thus improving their survival odds. Only about one in twenty non- parasitized caterpillars responded in this fashion. In 60% of cases, the parasitized caterpillars successfully warded off these potential predators. Mortality rates for pupae not guarded by parasitized caterpillars were significantly higher. That it is of no demonstrated benefit to the caterpillar indicates that this is an adaptation on the part of Glyptapanteles. =Mechanism= In the course of Grosman's research, it was discovered that not all larval Glyptapanteles emerge from their caterpillar host; one or two remain behind. Grosman has theorized that these larvae manipulate the host, foregoing their own chance at pupating in order to protect the brood. Biocontrol G. flavicoxis, G. porthetriae and G. militaris have been evaluated by the USDA as possible bio-control agents for containing the invasive gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) population in the United States. Research has indicated that Pseudaletia unipuncta hosts fed fresh perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) leaves are optimal for the mass-breeding of G. militaris.

United States, 365 U.S. 431 (1961), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the conviction of the petitioner, Carl Braden, based on his refusal to answer questions posed to him by the House Un- American Activities Committee, did not violate his First Amendment rights and was constitutional. Background The House Un-American Activities Committee (also called HUAC) was a committee within the United States House of Representatives dedicated to identifying agents of Fascism or Communism, ideologies deemed \\"un-American\\". With the end of World War II and the rise of the Cold War, HUAC, now a standing committee, became more narrowly focused on Communist activities. While HUAC was a political asset to some of its members, its activities were highly controversial, to the point where former President Harry S. Truman called it the \\"most un-American thing in the country today\\"Stephen J. Whitfield. The Culture of the Cold War. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996 in 1959. By 1975 it would be disbanded. Despite the controversy, the HUAC was still very active in 1961, when it was investigating allegations of \\"Communist infiltration into basic industries in the South and Communist Party propaganda activities in the South\\".. Among the witnesses called in this investigation was Carl Braden. However, when Braden was questioned by the committee, he refused to answer, based on his assertion that the questions were not relevant to the committee, and that the questions also violated his First Amendment rights. He was then convicted under 2 U.S.C. ¬ß 192, which makes it a misdemeanor offence to refuse to answer \\"pertinent\\" questions posed by the committee. Opinion of the Court Braden's conviction was sustained and held that the conviction was based on his refusal to answer questions posed to him by the HUAC and did not violate his First Amendment rights and was therefore constitutional.

Suitports present advantages over traditional airlocks in terms of mass, volume, and ability to mitigate contamination by‚Äîand of‚Äîthe local environment. Operation In a suitport system, a rear-entry space suit is attached and sealed against the outside of a spacecraft, space habitat, or pressurized rover, facing outward. To begin an extra-vehicular activity (EVA), an astronaut in shirt-sleeves first enters the suit feet-first from inside the pressurized environment, and closes and seals the space suit backpack and the vehicle's hatch (which seals to the backpack for dust containment). The astronaut then unseals and separates the suit from the vehicle, and is ready to perform an EVA. To re-enter the vehicle, the astronaut backs up to the suitport and seals the suit to the vehicle, before opening the hatch and backpack and transferring back into the vehicle. If the vehicle and suit do not operate at the same pressure, it will be necessary to equalize the two pressures before the hatch can be opened. Advantages and disadvantagesAdvantages= Suitports carry three major advantages over traditional airlocks. First, the mass and volume required for a suitport is significantly less than that required for an airlock. Launch mass is at a premium in modern chemical rocket-powered launch vehicles, at an estimated cost of US$60,000 per kilogram delivered to the lunar surface. Secondly, suitports can eliminate or minimize the problem of dust migration. During the Apollo program, it was discovered that the lunar soil is electrically charged, and adheres readily to any surface with which it comes into contact, a problem magnified by the sharp, barb-like shapes of the dust particles. Lunar dust may be harmful in several ways: *The abrasive nature of the dust particles may rub and wear down surfaces through friction. *The dust may damage coatings used on gaskets, optical lenses, solar panels, windows, and wiring. *The dust may cause damage to an astronaut's lungs as well as nervous and cardiovascular systems, leading to conditions such as pneumoconiosis. During the Apollo missions, the astronauts donned their space suits inside the Apollo Lunar Module cabin, which was then depressurized to allow them to exit the vehicle. Upon the end of EVA, the astronauts would re-enter the cabin in their suits, bringing with them a great deal of dust which had adhered to the suits. Several astronauts reported a \\"gunpowder\\" smell and respiratory and/or eye irritation upon opening their helmets and being exposed to the dust. When the suit is attached to the vehicle, any dust which may have adhered to the backpack of the suit is sealed between the outside of the backpack and the vehicle-side hatch. Any dust on the suit that is not on the backpack remains sealed outside the vehicle. Likewise, the suitport prevents contamination of the external environment by microbes carried by the astronaut. Additionally, the suitports significantly reduce the ingress and egress time, and virtually remove the need of pumpdown of the airlock, which normally is either associated with air loss, or requires heavy and complex pumping machinery as the only space that needs to be pressurized is the area between the vehicle hatch and the life- support backpack, and even that only in case of need for repairs, decontamination and refitting of the suit. =Disadvantages= Disadvantages of suitports include the additional mass of the interface on the rear of the space suit which may be more than , and increased mechanical complexity, potentially reducing the overall reliability of the EVA system. According to NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, disadvantages of suitports also include: * A lower technology readiness level (TRL) than airlocks * Greater difficulty for incapacitated crewmembers to ingress * Possible requirement for suit donning at with relaxed man-loads * Likely requirement for some back-mounted Primary Life Support System components, introducing challenges for achieving an optimal center of mass. Development and use Space suit docked to rover with suitport Suitport concept being tested with the Z-1 prototype spacesuit in 2012 The first EVA rear entry space suit was developed at NPP Zvezda in 1962. The suitport concept was suggested for use in the Soviet manned Moon program. A patent for a suitport was first filed in 1980 in the Soviet Union, by Isaak Abramov of Zvezda and Yuri Nazarov of CKBM. A US patent for a suitport was first filed in 1987 by Marc M. Cohen of NASA's Ames Research Center. Further patents were filed in 1996 by Philip Culbertson Jr., and in 2003 by Joerg Boettcher, Stephen Ransom, and Frank Steinsiek. As of 1995, suitports have found a practical, terrestrial application as part of a NASA Ames hazardous materials vehicle, where the use of the suitport eliminates the need to decontaminate the hazmat suit before doffing. A suitport prototype built by Brand Griffin has been used in a simulated lunar gravity test on board NASA Johnson's C-135 aircraft. Suitports may find use as part of future NASA projects aimed at achieving a return to the Moon and manned exploration of Mars. NASA's conceptual Space Exploration Vehicle has two suitports on the back of the craft. Testing has been taking place in combination with the Z-1 prototype spacesuit inside NASA's human-rated thermal vacuum chamber B at the Johnson Space Center. Early unmanned tests of the suitport were conducted in June 2012. The first manned tests of the suitport occurred on 16 and 18 July 2012; during these tests the spacesuit was kept at a pressure of , with the chamber pressure at approximately , equivalent to an altitude of . Future tests were planned for September and August 2012, where NASA planned to keep the spacesuit at a pressure of , and the vacuum chamber at roughly . Suitports may eventually be tested on the International Space Station.

Stations may air shows at other times at their preference. =Monday-Friday= { class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:80%\\" !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" colspan=\\"2\\" !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"7:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"7:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"8:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"8:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"9:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"9:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"10:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"10:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"11:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"11:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"noon !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"12:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"1:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"1:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"2:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"2:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"3:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"3:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"4:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"4:30 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"5:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"5:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:00 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:30 pm - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"colspan=\\"2\\"ABC bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"ABC World News This Morning bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Good Morning America bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"yellow\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The View bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"All My Children bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"One Life to Live bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"General Hospital bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"ABC World News Tonight - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"colspan=\\"2\\"CBS bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"CBS Morning News bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"4\\"The Early Show bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"pink\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The Price is Right bgcolor=\\"white\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The Young and the Restless bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\"The Bold and the Beautiful bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"As the World Turns bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Guiding Light bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"CBS Evening News - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"colspan=\\"2\\"NBC bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Early Today bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"6\\"Today bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"6\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Days of Our Lives bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Passions bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"7\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"NBC Nightly News - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" rowspan=\\"7\\"The WB !

The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series canceled after the 2004‚Äì05 season. Affiliates fill time periods not occupied by network programs with local or syndicated programming. PBS ‚Äì which offers daytime programming through a children's program block, PBS Kids ‚Äì is not included, as its member television stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Also not included are UPN (as the network did not offer any daytime programs this season), and i: Independent Television, as its schedule was composed mainly of syndicated reruns. Legend * New series are highlighted in bold. Schedule * All times correspond to U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time scheduling (except for some live sports or events). Except where affiliates slot certain programs outside their network-dictated timeslots, subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska, and Hawaii-Aleutian times. * Local schedules may differ, as affiliates have the option to pre-empt or delay network programs. Such scheduling may be limited to preemptions caused by local or national breaking news or weather coverage (which may force stations to tape delay certain programs in overnight timeslots or defer them to a co-operated or other contracted station in their regular timeslot) and any major sports events scheduled to air in a weekday timeslot (mainly during major holidays). Stations may air shows at other times at their preference. =Monday-Friday= { class=wikitable style=\\"font- size:80%\\" !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" colspan=\\"2\\" !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"7:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"7:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"8:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"8:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"9:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"9:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"10:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"10:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"11:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"11:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"noon !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"12:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"1:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"1:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"2:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"2:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"3:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"3:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"4:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"4:30 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"5:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"5:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:00 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:30 pm - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"colspan=\\"2\\"ABC bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"ABC World News This Morning bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Good Morning America bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"yellow\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The View bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"All My Children bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"One Life to Live bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"General Hospital bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"ABC World News Tonight - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"colspan=\\"2\\"CBS bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"CBS Morning News bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"4\\"The Early Show bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"pink\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The Price is Right bgcolor=\\"white\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The Young and the Restless bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\"The Bold and the Beautiful bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"As the World Turns bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Guiding Light bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"CBS Evening News - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"colspan=\\"2\\"NBC bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Early Today bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"6\\"Today bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"6\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Days of Our Lives bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Passions bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"7\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"NBC Nightly News - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" rowspan=\\"4\\"The WB !

Category:United States weekday network television schedules Category:2005 in American television Category:2006 in American television ","title":"2005‚Äì06 United States network television schedule (daytime)"},{"id":"17959632","text":"The 2006‚Äì07 daytime network television schedule for the five major English- language commercial broadcast networks in the United States in operation during that television season covers the weekday daytime hours from September 2006 to August 2007. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series canceled after the 2005‚Äì06 season. Affiliates fill time periods not occupied by network programs with local or syndicated programming. PBS ‚Äì which offers daytime programming through a children's program block, PBS Kids ‚Äì is not included, as its member television stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Fox does not offer daytime network programming nor network news on weekdays; as such, schedules are only included for Saturdays and Sundays. Also not included are MyNetworkTV (as the programming service also does not offer daytime programs of any kind), and Ion Television (as its schedule is composed mainly of syndicated reruns). Legend * New series are highlighted in bold. Schedule * All times correspond to U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time scheduling (except for some live sports or events). Except where affiliates slot certain programs outside their network-dictated timeslots, subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska, and Hawaii-Aleutian times. * Local schedules may differ, as affiliates have the option to pre-empt or delay network programs. Such scheduling may be limited to preemptions caused by local or national breaking news or weather coverage (which may force stations to tape delay certain programs in overnight timeslots or defer them to a co-operated or other contracted station in their regular timeslot) and any major sports events scheduled to air in a weekday timeslot (mainly during major holidays). Stations may air shows at other times at their preference. =Monday-Friday= { class=wikitable style=\\"font- size:80%\\" !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" colspan=\\"2\\" !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"7:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"7:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"8:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"8:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"9:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"9:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"10:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"10:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"11:00 am !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"11:30 am !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"noon !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"12:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"1:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"1:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"2:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"2:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"3:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"3:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"4:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"4:30 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"5:00 pm !width=\\"14%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"5:30 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:00 pm !width=\\"13%\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"6:30 pm - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"colspan=\\"2\\"ABC bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"America This Morning bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Good Morning America bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"yellow\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The View bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"All My Children bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"One Life to Live bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"General Hospital bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"World News with Charles Gibson - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"colspan=\\"2\\"CBS bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"CBS Morning News bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"4\\"The Early Show bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"pink\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The Price is Right bgcolor=\\"white\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The Young and the Restless bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\"The Bold and the Beautiful bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"As the World Turns bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Guiding Light bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"CBS Evening News with Katie Couric - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\"colspan=\\"2\\"NBC bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Early Today bgcolor=\\"gold\\" colspan=\\"6\\"Today bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"6\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Days of Our Lives bgcolor=\\"chartreuse\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Passions bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"7\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"gold\\"NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams - !bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" colspan=\\"2\\"The CW bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"18\\"Local and/or syndicated programming bgcolor=\\"lightgray\\" What I Like About You bgcolor=\\"lightgray\\" What I Like About You bgcolor=\\"lightgray\\" Reba bgcolor=\\"lightgray\\" Reba bgcolor=\\"white\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Local and/or syndicated programming } NBC note: Passions aired its final episode on NBC on September 7, 2007; it moved to The 101 beginning with the September 17 episode.

Biography  Braden was born in New Albany, Indiana, and died in Louisville, Kentucky. He worked for the Louisville Herald-Post, The Cincinnati Enquirer (1937‚Äì1945), The Louisville Times, and The Courier-Journal (1950‚Äì1954). He also wrote for other news services including The Harlan Daily Enterprise, the Knoxville Journal, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Newsweek, and the Federated Press. In 1948, while working as a reporter in Kentucky, he met and married fellow journalist Anne Gambrell McCarty. The Bradens had three children. James, born September 15, 1951, has lived and practiced law for over 25 years in San Francisco, California, and was a 1972 Rhodes Scholar at New College of University of Oxford and 1980 graduate of Harvard Law School, where he preceded Barack Obama as editor of the Harvard Law Review. Anita, born in 1953, died of a pulmonary disorder at the age of 11. Elizabeth, born in 1960, has worked as a teacher in many countries around the world, serving as of 2006 in that capacity in rural Ethiopia. The Bradens dedicated their lives to impelling whites into the cause of justice for all people, and especially fought racism. After Carl's death, Anne Braden remained active in networks of anti-racist work. While raising their children, Carl and his wife Anne Braden remained deeply involved in the civil rights cause and the subsequent social movements it prompted from the 1960s to the 1970s, because of this they were frequent targets for attacks from southern white supremacists. Early activism In 1948, Carl Braden along with his wife Anne involved themselves in Henry Wallace's run on the Progressive Party for the presidency. Soon after Wallace's defeat, they left mainstream journalism to apply their talent as writers to the interracial left wing of the labor movement through the FE (Farm and Equipment Workers) Union, representing Louisville's International Harvester employees.Catherine Fosl, Subversive Southerner (Palgrave, 2002). The Wade incident of 1954 In 1954, directly confronting the practice of rigid racial segregation of residential neighborhoods, the Bradens assisted an African-American couple, Andrew and Charlotte Wade, who wanted to buy a suburban home but had been unable to do so due to housing discrimination. The Bradens purchased a house on behalf of the Wades in Shively, an all-white neighborhood in the Louisville metropolitan area, and deeded it over to the Wade family. White segregationists immediately lashed out initially by throwing rocks through the windows of the house, burning a cross in front of it, and firing gunshots into the home and then bombed the house (setting off explosives under the bedroom of the Wades' young daughter while the home was occupied), driving the Wades out and destroying the home. As a result of their actions, Carl Braden was charged with sedition, since working for racial integration was interpreted as a clear act of communist subversion of society. A friend of the Wades was charged with bombing the house to make it appear to have been done by others. Braden denied the accusations that his purchase of the house and its subsequent bombing were all part of a \\"communist plot\\", and denied that he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. He was convicted on December 13, 1954, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Immediately upon his conviction, he was fired from the Courier-Journal, and he served seven months of his sentence before he was released on a $40,000 bond pending appeal the highest bond ever set in Kentucky up to that time. His conviction was then overturned. Carl's wife, Anne, carefully chronicled the ordeal and used it as the basis for her book The Wall Between, published in 1958. 1961 U.S. Supreme Court case When compelled to appear before the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC), Braden refused to answer questions posed to him, saying the questions were not relevant to the mandate of the committee and violated his First Amendment rights. The case was heard before the Supreme Court of the United States as Braden v. United States, 365 U.S. 431 (1961). The court ruled against Braden, saying his conviction was constitutional. Braden was sentenced to a year in prison, and a drive for clemency in his case was led by Martin Luther King Jr. He was released after serving nine months of the sentence. Later activism In 1967, the Bradens were again charged with sedition for protesting the practice of strip-mining in Pike County, Kentucky. They used this case to test the Kentucky sedition law, which was ruled unconstitutional in federal court. The Bradens were blacklisted from local employment in Kentucky. They took jobs as field organizers for the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF), developing their own media attention through SCEF's monthly newspaper, The Southern Patriot, and through numerous pamphlets and press releases publicizing major civil-rights campaigns. The Bradens were acclaimed by young student activists of the 1960s and among the Civil Rights Movement's most dedicated white allies.

History  The relatively large church, which predated the nunnery, had its beginnings about 1090 as a parish church dedicated to Saint Margaret of Antioch during the reign of King Olaf I of Denmark, sometimes called Olaf Hunger. It functioned as the cathedral of Viborg until the new cathedral at Viborg was finished in 1133. It was constructed of granite and limestone in the Romanesque style with rounded arches and few windows. The church was of an irregular shape with a nave, one side-aisle with an apse, and a square choir also with an apse. The most significant event in the history of the church was the murder of Bishop Eskild of Viborg in front of the main altar of the Asmild church in 1133. The murder according to the Roskilde Chronicle was to be laid directly at the feet of King Eric II of Denmark nicknamed Erik Emune of Denmark. Bishop Eskild was a supporter of King Niels of Denmark, who was defeated and killed in the Battle of Fodevig by Erik Emune in 1134. Construction began on Asmild Abbey in 1165 just to the south of Asmild church, which was put at the disposal of the Augustinian nuns. The abbey consisted of three ranges and the church functioned as a disconnected north range, in a quadrilateral layout. The abbey was west of the bishop's residence (Danish:bispeg√•rd) as evidenced by the excavations done in the 1950s. The work of the canonesses under the abbess of the abbey was in daily prayers and meditation and education of young women of noble birth. They were assisted in the day-to-day life by lay men and women who did much of the house and farm work required to keep the abbey going. It may be assumed that there was a small school on the premises, much like a religious boarding school. It is unclear whether the nuns at Asmild were regular or secular canonesses. Expansion of the abbey in the 13th century changed the architectural style of parts of the building to Gothic with pointed windows and arches. Apparently, there was a fire which destroyed the 'old' cathedral and abbey in the mid-14th century. The church was replaced on a smaller scale. The abbey was rebuilt though on a smaller scale, perhaps because of the strictness of the rule, and the lack of income producing properties. Most abbeys maintained an archive of letters of gift (Danish: ) but Asmild's has been lost. There remains only a single 1346 letter offering a gift for continued prayers for a deceased relative. The abbey is last mentioned in a letter of 1461, and then nothing until the 1536 dissolution of the abbey. The lack of information on the last decades of the abbey may be perhaps in part attributed to the local rumors about the immoral behavior of some of the nuns and Augustinian canons at the cathedral. Local tradition has it that a brick tunnel or walkway connected the abbey with the monastery near the cathedral, though no empirical evidence has been located that such a connection existed. If people lost confidence in the abbey's ability to keep a strict rule, no noble family would entrust a daughter or sister to the nuns at Asmild. =Dissolution= The Reformation brought about the end of Asmild Abbey when Denmark became a Lutheran state in October 1536. The nuns were permitted to live at the abbey until their death, though without income. The abbey estate came under crown control and Asmild was given to the former Bishop of B√∏rglum, Stygge Krumpen (Rosencrantz) as an income property once he was released from prison. The buildings were turned into an estate farm called Asmild Kloster Farm which passed into private ownership in 1673. The abbey burned down in 1713, but was rebuilt. The buildings called Asmild Kloster became the property of Viborg County in 1906. In 1907 the buildings burned down except for one wing which survived but was eventually torn down in 1958. The only remnants of the abbey today are the stone-lined well, Asmild Church, and one of its bells, cast by an anonymous artist in the 15th century which still rings from the low bell tower.

In 2007, UBC effectively sold them back for ¬£3.95m to GCap Media - the company created from the merger of GWR Group and Capital Radio Group. In July 2006, as part of UBC's move away from owning radio stations, it sold its share in Digital News Network (DNN) for ¬£66k. In December 2007, UBC bought the remaining 51% stake in Oneword Radio from Channel Four Television for ¬£1, and then closed the loss-making speech DAB radio station one month later. In May 2008, UBC announced its Commercial Division was being bought by the American company, GTN for ¬£15 million. The deal was expected to complete around the end of July 2008; a definitive agreement was announced in February 2009. In June 2008, UBC announced it was closing down its loss-making venture Cliq, a service which allowed DAB listeners to download music onto their mobile phones. The system was designed to be implemented on DAB-enabled mobile phones, but few manufacturers have been interested in adding DAB to their handsets. Two years on, and the company pulled out of DAB by selling its 7.5% stake in MXR Digital. The stake was bought by fellow shareholder Guardian Media Group for ¬£136,000 plus a one-off cash dividend payment from MXR of ¬£52,000. The move is part of UBC's strategy to focus on the production of content and the development of interactive software. As part of the agreement, UBC was also released from its spectrum contracts that were due to run until 2015 with MXR. This enabled UBC to release circa ¬£400,000 of provision which had been made to cover this contract.

Predominantly specialising in music and live music production, Smooth Operations also produces BBC events such as The Radio 2 Folk Awards and The Radio Academy's annual industry conference The Radio Festival. Along with BBC Commissioned programming, they produce TV content for Sky Arts, covering live music events such as Cambridge Folk Festival and Celtic Connections. They also produce commissioned radio programming for RT√â 2fm.

The battle took place in the Szczecin Lagoon () between Neuwarp and Usedom, and is named after an ambiguous earlier name for the Lagoon, Frisches Haff, which later exclusively denoted the Vistula Lagoon.Erhard Riemann, Alfred Schoenfeldt, Ulrich Tolksdorf, Reinhard Goltz, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur (Germany), Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz, Preussisches W√∂rterbuch: Deutsche Mundarten Ost- und Westpreussens, 6th edition, Wachholtz, 1974, p.595, Swedish naval forces consisting of 28 vessels and 2,250 men under Captain Lieutenant Carl Rutensparre and Wilhelm von Carpelan destroyed a Prussian force of 13 vessels and 700 men under captain von K√∂ller.√Öselius, Gunnar (2003). Svenska slagf√§lt. Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand. pp. 366‚Äî373. The consequence of the battle was that the small fleet Prussia had at its disposal ceased to exist. The loss of naval supremacy meant also that the Prussian positions at Usedom and Wollin became untenable and were occupied by Swedish troops. Background At the outbreak of the conflict, Sweden was led by a government dominated by the pro-French Caps party, which felt that this war (mainly aimed against Prussia) was the chance for Sweden to recapture territories lost to Prussia in the past in Pomerania and restore the mouth of the Oder to Swedish control. The chancellor and head of the Caps party, baron Anders Johan von H√∂pken, sent an army of 14,500 men to Stralsund, capital of Swedish Pomerania, under field-marshal Ungern-Sternberg, with his main mission being the capture of Stettin (today in Poland), which controls the mouths of the Oder. The Swedes launched a first offensive but were beaten back in Stralsund by the Prussian army under marshal Lehwaldt. Ungern-Sternberg was replaced by count von Rosen, who took no risks and left himself blockaded in Stralsund. However, a Russian offensive in west Prussia forced Lehwaldt to leave Swedish Pomerania on 27 June 1758. Sweden sent reinforcements and a new commander-in-chief, count Hamilton, who profited from Prussian difficulties by going back on the offensive. Although Prussian troops in the area had been heavily denuded to face the Russian threat, they put up a tenacious resistance to the Swedes and battles and skirmishes came one after the other without either of the belligerents able to gain a decisive advantage over the other. The conflict took a naval turn when the Prussians built a fleet at Stettin, by the more or less fortunate transformation of fishing or transport boats into warships, to defy a Swedish squadron supporting their land offensive. Informed of these preparations, the Swedes decided to destroy this fleet. Battle At the start of August 1759, the Swedish squadron under Ruthensparre moved into the Oder, moving towards the Stettin lagoon. On 8 August it forced the defences of Peenem√ºnde and penetrated the western half of the lagoon (called Kleines Haff, or Little Lagoon, by the Germans). On 22 August the Swedes won an initial engagement against a fleet under captain von K√∂ller off Anclam. On 10 September, the two fleets again faced each other, near Neuwarp. The Swedish ships commanded by Wilhelm von Carpellan were ranged in 4 lines - in the first were the most powerful ships (four 13-gun galleys armed), then four 5-gun demi-galleys (with mixed sail and oar propulsion), then 3 sloops and 1 ship with howitzers, and finally a line of 13 gunboats. For their part, the Prussians had four galiots and four galleys with 12 cannon each as well as 5 canonni√®res. Once within range, the Swedes placed themselves in a single line. However, the three Swedish demi-galleys and 9 gunboats sailed towards the south where unidentified sailing vessels had appeared - these turned out to be neutral ships, but this meant these Swedish ships did not take part in the start of the four-hour battle. The battle ended in a heavy Prussian defeat, with their main ships sunk or captured and more than 600 of their sailors captured, for smaller losses (13 killed and 14 wounded) on the Swedish side. Aftermath The victory guaranteed Swedish control of the lagoon, which they exploited by capturing the island of Wollin. However, their ultimate goal of Stettin remained in Prussian hands. Undaunted, the Prussians began to build a new fleet. The Battle of Frisches Haff was thus a short-lived victory for the Swedes and the Russian retreat from the war of 1762 placed them in a very difficult situation. Realising they did not have a large enough force to hold off the redoubtable troops under king Frederick II of Prussia on their own, the Swedes proposed a peace settlement to him based on a return to the pre-war status quo. Frederick accepted the proposal and formalised it by signing the treaty of Hamburg on 22 May 1762.

Life He was chapel master of the church of Santa Maria del Mar (Barcelona) until 1564; then he became the first chapel master of the cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, appointment which he held until his death in 1609. According to the cathedral's records, he was \\"primatxer\\" or main singer of the cathedral's choir. The same documents show that among his duties he had to compose and teach music, as well as oversee the general education of the choir boys. His total extant musical output is compiled in the so-called Llibre d'Atril or Choir Book, which is now kept at the Arxiu Capitular de Mallorca. The small size of the handwritten volume and the fact that sometimes a third voice is copied in the back of several folios seem to indicate that the manuscript was not an actual choir book, but rather a compilation of the composer's music. The first page of the book reads \\"Es de m[estre] Pau Villa Llonga\\" (Is by m[aster] Pau Villa Llonga), a phrasing that indicates that the book belonged to and was by the composer. Besides all of the known works by Villalonga, the Llibre d'atril includes unidentified works possibly by other composers (although most of the folios are unreadable). Villalonga's compositions have received high appraisal from Felipe Pedrell‚Äîcomparing them to those of Victoria and Palestrina‚ÄîGeorges Jean-Aubry, and Manuel de Falla.

The bay was separated from the Great Salt Lake in 1964, and has since served as a source of irrigation, drinking water, and recreation for the northern Wasatch Front metro area.  Geography  Willard Bay is a freshwater reservoir located in eastern Box Elder County, Utah, north-west of the city of Ogden, on the north-eastern floodplains of the Great Salt Lake. The reservoir is operated by the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District and recreation activities are administered by Utah State Parks and Recreation. Fish in Willard Bay include black crappie, walleye, wiper, smallmouth bass, channel catfish, bluegill, and gizzard shad (which are unlawful to possess).Air Charter At an elevation of about , the area around Willard Bay features cottonwood and other high desert trees. In winter, the area is a wildlife area for watching nesting eagles. left  History  In 1949, U.S. Senator Arthur Vivian Watkins, a Republican from Utah who served from 1946 to 1959, passed through Congress the Weber Basin Project. This project called for the creation of a reservoir to store surplus water from the Ogden and Weber rivers that could later be accessed for use on farmland. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation designed and constructed a -high earth-filled dike to create the enclosure. The dike, which impounds of water, was completed in 1964 by the W.W. Clyde Company, and was named the Arthur V. Watkins Dam. The resulting reservoir was then drained of salt water and refilled with fresh, directly from the Weber River.http://www.waterquality.utah.gov/watersheds/lakes/WILLARD.pdf The bay was named after the nearby town of Willard, which itself was named after the LDS apostle Willard Richards. A bill in Congress, H.R. 839 and S. 512, The Arthur V. Watkins Dam Enlargement Act, was introduced in the 2007 session to authorize a feasibility study to enlarge the dam.H.R. 839: Arthur V. Watkins Dam Enlargement Act (GovTrack.us) While the bill passed the House of Representatives, it was suspended in the Senate and never became law. 250px  Willard Bay State Park  Willard Bay State Park is located on the eastern shore of Willard Bay. It features two state-owned facilities. The north marina is north of Ogden. It has 62 campsites, restrooms, showers, full RV hook-ups, and seasonal/transient boat slip rentals.

Two companies contained men from the border counties of Maryland. History The regiment was initially assigned to guarding the upper Potomac and was attached to the command of Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson in the Valley. In the spring of 1862 the regiment took part in Jackson's Valley Campaign, where the exploits of the unit and its commander, Turner Ashby, became famous on both sides of the war. Near the conclusion of the campaign, Ashby was mortally wounded and Col. Richard Henry Dulany took command of the regiment, which had swelled to 29 companies. The regiment was reorganized at the end of the campaign, with the original 10 companies remaining and the excess 19 forming the 12th Regiment and 17th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry. Together with these two regiments, the 7th would become the nucleus of the famed Laurel Brigade. As part of the brigade, the 7th saw major action during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863 and was at the famed cavalry Battle of Brandy Station that same year. They took part in Jubal A. Early's ill-fated Valley Campaigns of 1864 and were at Appomattox Courthouse, though much of the unit escaped through federal lines and returned home to disband rather than taking parole with the rest of the Army of Northern Virginia.

The history of St. Louis, Missouri, and its near suburbs is significant in the development of private places. Most were laid out by Prussian-born surveyor and planner Julius Pitzman, who conceived the idea around 1868 as a way for residential landowners to control real estate speculation and maintain property standards, in an era before the protections of zoning. Pitzman designed 47 of these developments over a 50-year period.David T. Beito, From Privies to Boulevards: The Private Supply of Infrastructure in the United States during the Nineteenth Century in Jerry Jenkins and David Sisk, eds., Development by Consent: The Voluntary Supply of Public Goods and Services, San Francisco: ICS Press, 1993, 23-48; and The Formation of Urban Infrastructure through Non- Governmental Planning: The Private Places of St. Louis, 1869-1920, Journal of Urban History 16 (May 1990), 263-301. The first of these, Lucas Place, dates from 1851 and no longer exists as such. But the growth of these developments began in earnest with Benton Place, in 1868, a 12-house development adjacent to Lafayette Square, St. Louis, and is in more-or-less original condition today. Vandeventer Place, opened in 1870 and included a house design by H.H. Richardson. Vandeventer Place has been replaced by urban development, with the exception of the east gate, which was removed to Forest Park. In the 1920s, the idea was extended west into the county, particularly Ladue, by developers such as Meier and Comfort. These privately controlled single-family housing communities in the midst of the city are legally organized somewhat similarly to condominiums, co-ops or homeowners associations. In 1982, the St. Louis metropolitan area had more than 427 street associations administering private places. Although often associated with high-end communities, neighborhoods of various socio-economic natures have been structured as private places.

Specialized beaters used on some other percussion instruments, such as the metal beater or wand used with a triangle, and particularly beaters or mallets used with tuned percussion such as xylophone and timpani, are not normally referred to as drumsticks. Drumsticks generally have all of the following characteristics: * They are normally supplied and used in pairs. * They are held in the hands, most often one in each hand. * They may be used to play at least some sort of drum (as well as other instruments). * They are normally used only for unpitched percussion. Construction The parts of a simple drumstick The archetypical drumstick is turned from a single piece of wood, most commonly of hickory, less commonly of maple, and least commonly but still in significant numbers, of oak.http://www.rockdrummingsystem.com/underground/drum-articles/choosing-the- right-drumsticks.php retrieved 9/02/2012 Drumsticks of the traditional form are also made from metal, carbon fibre and other modern materials. The tip or bead is the part most often used to strike the instrument. Originally and still commonly of the same piece of wood as the rest of the stick, sticks with nylon tips have also been available since 1958. In the 1970s, an acetal tip was introduced. Tips of whatever material are of various shapes, including acorn, barrel, oval, teardrop, pointed and round. The shoulder of the stick is the part that tapers towards the tip, and is normally slightly convex. It is often used for playing the bell of a cymbal. It can also be used to produce a cymbal crash when applied with a glancing motion to the bow or edge of a cymbal, and for playing ride patterns on china, swish and pang cymbals. The shaft is the body of the stick, and is cylindrical for most applications including drum kit and orchestral work. It is used for playing cross stick and applied in a glancing motion to the rim of a cymbal for the loudest cymbal crashes. The butt is the opposite end of the stick to the tip. Some rock and metal musicians use it rather than the tip. Conventional numbering Plain wooden drumsticks are most commonly described using a number to describe the weight and diameter of the stick followed by one or more letters to describe the tip. For example, a 7A is a common jazz stick with a wooden tip, while a 7AN is the same weight of stick with a nylon tip, and a 7B is a wooden tip but with a different tip profile, shorter and rounder than a 7A. A 5A is a common wood tipped rock stick, heavier than a 7A but with a similar profile. The numbers are most commonly odd but even numbers are used occasionally, in the range 2 (heaviest) to 9 (lightest). The exact meanings of both numbers and letters differ from manufacturer to manufacturer, and some sticks are not described using this system at all, just being known as jazz (typically a 7A, 8A or 8D) or heavy rock (typically a 5B) for example. The most general purpose stick is a 5A. However, there is no one stick for any particular style of music. Techniques Traditional grip \\"Fire-sticks\\" used by Top Secret Drum Corps =Grip= There are two main ways of holding drumsticks: * Traditional grip, in which right and left hands use different grips. * Matched grip, in which the two hand grips are mirror-image. Traditional grip was developed to conveniently play a snare drum while riding a horse, and was documented and popularised by Sanford A. Moeller in The Art of Snare Drumming (1925). It was the standard grip for kit drummers in the first half of the twentieth century and remains popular, and the standard grip for most snare drummers. Matched grips are standardized for most other instruments, and became popular towards the middle of the twentieth century, threatening to displace the traditional grip for kit drumming. However the traditional grip has since made a comeback, and both types of grip are still used and promoted by leading drummers and teachers.

Produced by Mohammad Aslam and Parag Sanghvi. It was released on 19 August 2011. The film is based on the novel Chalaak Jasoos and the 2006 Hollywood film, The Pink Panther. The film was a critical and commercial failure as it received negative reception from both critics and cinema-goers. Plot Bumbling cop Chatur Singh (Sanjay Dutt) is sent on a special mission to South Africa to solve a high-profile case involving the murder of a politician and a cache of diamonds. But before he can redeem his botched-up career he must deal with a bunch of loonies which includes a crazy mafia don (Satish Kaushik), a weird taxi driver (Sanjay Mishra), a hysterical boss (Anupam Kher), and a pretty damsel in distress (Ameesha Patel).

They consist of a transparent, water-filled case housing a thumb-sized figure, and a base with a microchip, microphone, and speaker to register and respond to sounds made by kids or by other Aquapets. Each character has its own look, sounds and songs and responds with movement and melody. The more a child plays with their Aquapets, the more songs they will perform and the livelier they will become. History The first three characters of the original Aquapets (Miku, also referred to as Kiko; Puku and Tu) were sold exclusively at Toys R Us stores starting in February 2004. By April of that year, the initial three figures were joined by three new characters (Kadet, Bunni and Stinga) to complete \\"Wave 1\\" which were available in mass and specialty stores across the country. In October 2004, six new characters were released. \\"Wave 2\\" consisted of: Lugi, Fanga, Bebe, Pizzazz, Tabi and Blotto. In January 2005, \\"Wave 3\\" was released which included Floptopus, Snorkl, Squirt, Fuego, Likabee, and Peegee. \\"Wave 4\\" was released in August 2005, and it included Bertie, Purkle, Spangle, Dilly, Skinker, and Fizzie. \\"Wave 5\\" was the final \\"wave\\" of Aquapets.

The poem is of quiet grief and thanksgiving in remembrance of those who died in the achievement of victory. In the event, the song introduced \\"A Pageant of Heroes\\". The song starts after a short introduction, pensively, in a minor key, with the solo voice which is joined by a simple ostinato-like bass line.

Reflecting this origin, it is sometimes called the Russian Orloff or simply Russian. For most of its history, the Orloff was considered to be a product of Russia and Orlov, but modern research has discovered that the breed first appeared in Persia, and was distributed across Europe and Asia by the 17th century. However, Count Orlov was a key promoter of the breed in the 19th century, and the breed became known in the West following his efforts. Orloffs were first introduced to Great Britain in the 1920s, and were also refined a good deal in Germany; Germans created the first miniaturized bantam Orloff by 1925. The breed was once included in the American Poultry Association's breed standard, the Standard of Perfection, but it was removed due a lack of interest from breeders. In the 21st century, the Orloff remains a rare breed in the West. The Livestock Conservancy lists the breed as critically endangered. The Orloff is a tall, well-feathered chicken with a somewhat game-like appearance. The head and neck are very thickly feathered. They appear in several recognized color varieties: Black, White, Spangled, Black-tailed Red, Mahogany, and Cuckoo. Their plumage, combined with their tiny walnut comb, small earlobes and minuscule wattles, makes the Orloff a very cold hardy breed. Males generally weigh and hens about . Orloffs are primarily suited to meat production, but hens are reasonable layers of light brown eggs and do not usually go broody. In general temperament, they are known to be relatively calm birds.

It encompasses the historic junction point of the two major branches of the Santa Fe Trail, a major 19th-century frontier settlement route between St. Louis, Missouri and Santa Fe, New Mexico. La Junta, marked this junction point, as well as the first major indications of civilization before westbound travelers reached Santa Fe. The district includes a large area west of the modern community of Watrous, encompassing the confluence of the Mora and Sapello Rivers. Surviving buildings include the houses of early ranchers, as well as a stagecoach mailstop and inn. The district was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963. and Description and history The Santa Fe Trail was one of the major routes by which the American West was settled. It had two major branches: the Mountain Branch, which skirted north of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and crossed southward at Raton Pass, and the Cimarron Cutoff, which ran a more direct route south of mountains but across desert that was also populated by hostile Native Americans. These two routes came together to the west of the confluence of the Mora and Sapello Rivers, which is just north of present-day Watrous. The Santa Fe Trail remained in use until the 1870s, when it was supplanted by Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, whose route roughly follows the Cimarron Cutoff route. The railroad established the present-day community of Watrous east of the trail junction, after which the small community there was largely abandoned. The community at the trail junction was known as La Junta (\\"the junction\\" in Spanish), Tiptonville, or Watrous, the latter two based on the names of two early ranchers in the area, Samuel Watrous and William Tipton. There are 21 surviving structures or foundational remains in the district, most of which were built before 1870. Important surviving structures include the ranch house and store of Samuel Watrous (now on the Watrous Valley Ranch), a similar building belonging to William Tipton, and the rancho house of William Koenig. The Koenig House, built in the 1860s on what is now known as the Phoenix Ranch, is one of the state's finest examples of Territorial architecture. There are also three small cemeteries, and the remains of three structures associated with a horse corral managed by Fort Union.

As the main retail street of downtown Kingston, it is lined by many historic limestone buildings in the city's downtown core. Princess Street begins at Kingston's current western city limits in Westbrook (continuing from Main Street, Odessa) and ends at the downtown waterfront east of Ontario Street. Eastbound traffic is then carried by Ontario Street across the Lasalle Causeway to Barriefield. All of Princess Street and most of Ontario Street formed part of the Provincial Highway (formerly Highway 2), the main highway from Windsor/Toronto to Montr√©al until a Kingston Bypass, today a part of Highway 401, was constructed at the end of 1954. In the outlying western sections of the city, the road was formerly just Highway 2, with the Princess Street name gradually adopted as the urban area expanded west.  Overview  The street was originally called Store Street due to a large government store at the lower end.The Cloud of War It was renamed Princess Street in honour of the birth of the Princess Royal in approximately 1840.After The War The portion west of Highway 33, originally well outside the city limits, appears on maps as York Road at least until 1908Illustrated Chronology of the Williamsville Study Area, Jennifer McKendry, City of Kingston, November 2011 and is historically part of the original 1817 Kingston Road from Toronto (which ends in name today in Ajax). An 1839 toll road, one of the first to be macadamized in the region, retained this same path between Kingston and Napanee; some of this road's stone markers remain visible on the western portion of Princess Street today.Kingston-Napanee Toll Road Milestone, Princess Street near Collins Bay Road - N XVIII K V - Kingston, Ontario A horse-drawn Street Railway had operated on Princess from Concession Street to the foot of downtown from 1877 to 1905; electric streetcars replaced this on an abbreviated route (Princess from Alfred Street to downtown) until 1930, when the streetcars were destroyed and the system converted to buses. St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, founded 1820 and rebuilt in 1889 at Princess and Clergy Street, served as first meeting place of the Board of Trustees of Queen's College (which was granted a Royal Charter in 1841).Chronology of the History of Kingston , Kingston Historical Society, 2000 (revised) Princess Street, Kingston The Commercial Mart Building (Princess and Ontario streets), designed and built in 1817 by architect George Browne, housed the John C. Fox piano factory in 1862, was sold to John Stevenson in 1864 and continued piano manufacturing under different names (Weber, Wormwith, Stevenson) and owners until 1939. A four-storey Kingston limestone structure with archways on the ground floor and a prominent location at the foot of downtown, it has served as an army barracks, a public works building and a store. It is best known locally as the location of the S & R Department Store (1959‚Äì2009) and is now divided into retail and office space. The Grand Theatre opened on Princess Street in 1879 as Kingston's Opera House and remains in use today, serving as the home of the Kingston Symphony. From 1942‚Äì74, Princess Street intersected with Bath Road and Concession Street at a traffic circle, which was removed and replaced with traffic signals as volumes increased and the circle's capacity was exceeded. The general area is still sometimes referred to as the \\"traffic circle\\" by long-time residents. A shopping centre constructed just west of the traffic circle in 1955 served as Kingston's largest indoor mall until 1982. The Kingston Centre (1100 Princess Street) went into decline in 1999 after losing key anchor tenant Sears to rival Cataraqui Town Centre (Princess at Gardiners Road) and was demolished in 2004 to make way for new retail development anchored by Loblaws. Much of the western growth of the suburban area around Kingston in the 1960s and 1970s followed the more southerly Bath Road (Highway 33) from the traffic circle westward into the former Kingston Township; major retailers were Sears (Kingston Centre, 1100 Princess at Bath), Woolco (Frontenac Mall, Bath Road) and Kmart (Bath at Gardiners Road). Highway 2 west of the old Kingston city limits and east of Westbrook/Odessa was largely rural until the early 1980s, with the exception of Sentry Plaza (established January 1962, chain defunct early 1980s, site demolished 2012) at what is now the corner of Princess and Centennial Streets. New suburbs in the city, such as Polson Park (1957) and Calvin Park (1962), were planned and built on what was once farmland south of Highway 33. Subsequent expansion tended to follow Highway 33 westward into what was then Kingston Township. By the 1970s and 1980s, west-end development was being pushed northward (into what is now Bayridge) due to lack of vacant land elsewhere; in 1982, the open rural fields at Princess Street and Gardiners Road (then one block east of old Highway 38, now Midland Avenue) were chosen by Cadillac-Fairview as the location for a major shopping mall, the Cataraqui Town Centre (945 Gardiners at Princess), which would draw away merchants and commercial activity from the then-existing K-Mart Plaza (defunct, now self- storage) and Frontenac Mall (established 1967, semi-dead mall, kept alive by discount anchors). By the turn of the millennium, the entire length of the former Ontario Highway 2 from Collins Bay Road to downtown Kingston would be filled by commercial development, with only Westbrook village retaining its original rural character. The construction of a stand-alone Walmart at Princess and Midland Avenue (replacing the former Woolco at Frontenac Mall) has only hastened the exodus of merchants from the old Bath Road onto outer Princess Street. In the downtown core, Princess Street operates one-way eastbound from Division Street to Ontario Street; westbound traffic is diverted to Queen Street. West of the former traffic circle, Princess Street is a four-lane divided highway until Bayridge Drive, becoming two lanes where it leaves the urban area at Collins Bay Road. A milestone from an 1836 macadam gravel toll road from Kingston to Napanee still stands at the north east corner of Princess and Collins Bay Road.

Plans began in the 1970s. The hall was originally supposed be located at the end of the Karlav√§gen esplanade but was moved further along the water. The site was selected to allow the hall to merge with nature and was positioned in the rock so it would not look too large. The interior hexagonal shape was partly for acoustic reasons, but the hall had to be acoustically adjusted several times subsequently.

They formed in 1990 in Perth and disbanded in 1997. They released two studio albums, D.e.s.t.i.t.u.t.i.o.n (1994) and Skinman (1996). According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they \\"gained international acclaim and interest from several key figures in the heavy metal world. [Their] tight sound mixed the heavy riffs and complexities of San Francisco Bay Area thrash bands like Metallica, Testament, Slayer and Exodus with a touch of Sepultura.\\" History 1990‚Äì94: Formation and early EPs = Allegiance were formed in Perth in 1990 as a thrash metal group by Tony Campo on guitar, Dave Harrison on bass guitar, Steve Hidden on guitar, Conrad Higson on drums and John Mihos on lead vocals. After a few months of performing Mihos left and Higson switched to lead vocals, Glenn Butcher replaced Dave Barry on drums and Jason Stone replaced Hidden on guitar. In 1991 the group recorded a four-track extended play, Make the Pledge, as a music cassette, which was self-funded: with $250 from their live shows. It was released in October, its straight forward thrash metal sound helped it to sell 2000 copies. In the next month Allegiance won the Most Popular Band category at the West Australian Music Industry Awards (WAMI Awards) for that year. In February 1992 Allegiance played at the annual Bindoon Rock outdoor concert festival for the first time to a crowd of 10 000 people. In March they released their second EP, Torn Between Two Worlds, on a seven-track cassette. The recording featured improved production and song writing, which demonstrated the band's progress. The EP sold 3500 copies, won the 1992 local industry award for most popular WA cassette. It was praised as one of the most impressive tapes of 1992 by magazines, fanzines and radio shows in places like Japan, Argentina, Poland, Greece, Cyprus, Lithuania, Germany, Canada, United States and the United Kingdom. In July 1992 Allegiance won the state final of the Yamaha Rock competition and flew to Melbourne to represent their state in the national final, where they received the Juke Magazine-sponsored Encouragement Award. They competed against seven other unsigned acts; the final was broadcast nationally on MTV. The band headed to ABC studios in August 1992 to record five tracks live-in-the-studio: in one take with few overdubs. These were released as their third EP in October, Studio Live. It was limited to 500 copies, which sold out in one day and became a sought after collectors item. In September 1992 the group performed at the Australian Metalfest at the Hordern Pavilion, Sydney and provided the track, \\"Twisted Minds\\", for a CD sampler. Reviews stated Allegiance to be the most impressive bands on the bill which helped to establish their reputation as a live act outside their home state. At the end of the year, some of their tracks were selected for inclusion on the Def Records Australia Metal compilation and local talent showcase, The Western Front, compilation CDs. Allegiance was voted the ninth best Australian band and fifth best new band in Hot Metal Magazines annual readers poll. The band again ended the year by winning the Most Popular Band category at the 1992 WAMI Awards. In 1993 Allegiance continued touring including a second appearance at the annual, Bindoon Rock festival, performing in front of 15,000 people at the national Big Day Out festival as well as touring nationally supporting Kreator and Fear Factory which furthered their reputation as a thrash metal band. Allegiance had tracks included on the Roadrunner records Australasian compilation RedRum and Studio 52's While My Guitar Gently Kills Your Mother and Polygram heavy metal promotional cassette. Ex-Judas Priest front man, Rob Halford, took an interest in the band. He made statements in the international metal press claiming Allegiance to be a dynamite band. His company, Entertainment Management Advisory Services (EMAS), were managing the band to increase international exposure. = 1994‚Äì97: From D.e.s.t.i.t.u.t.i.o.n to Skinman = In March 1994 Allegiance toured nationally with Halford's new band, Fight. Allegiance placed in ten different categories in the HM Magazine readers' poll, including tenth best band of all time. In April the group secured a deal with the ID Phonogram label. Their debut album, D.e.s.t.i.t.u.t.i.o.n, was recorded in Australia by American producer, Dave Pinsky. They had met Pinsky whilst supporting the Beastie Boys with whom he was working. The album was mastered in the Netherlands by Attie Bauw who has worked with both Fight and Judas Priest. Campo later reflected \\"when Rob Halford's EMAS got interested that's when we thought we were going places... [He] did nothing really for us, I think he just wanted to prop up his Fight tour of Australia. We were recording D.e.s.t.i.t.u.t.i.o.n at the time. His company said it was a bit heavy for them to do anything with. Although when it charted in Oz he was quick to take credit... Before he came to Oz he did press saying he couldn't wait to meet us. When we toured together he never even watched the band or talked to us. When he returned to the States he never contacted us again.\\" In May D.e.s.t.i.t.u.t.i.o.n was released and although it received no mainstream radio or video exposure, it went straight into the W.A. mainstream ARIA chart at No. 1 and remained in the top 5 for 3 weeks. The band continued touring with their own headlining Destitution Tour across state capitals and then touring nationally with Australian hard rock band, The Poor. The D.e.s.t.i.t.u.t.i.o.n album topped local metal charts in the country and has been one of the best selling, home grown, hard music releases in many years. In July Allegiance appeared on the cover of HM magazine. D.e.s.t.i.t.u.t.i.o.n started to receive positive reviews in the overseas metal press including a rating of KKKK by UK publication, Kerrang!. They shot two music videos which aired on several music video programs. In November the band recorded Time To React ‚Äì Live!, a special live recording at the ABC's JJJ studios to an audience of die hard Allegiance fans. It contains no overdubs and shows the uncompromising raw power of the band in the live environment. 1995 was a busy year for Allegiance with the release of Time To React ‚Äì Live! and touring big names such as Slayer, Biohazard, Machine Head and Channel Zero. They also appeared at the Big Day Out concert festivals in both Australia and New Zealand. At this stage, Allegiance were the undisputed biggest metal band in the country. In 1996 the band started work on their next album, Skinman. The album title was inspired by the tragic suicide of a member of Allegiance's road crew whose nickname was \\"Skinman\\". It was recorded in Western Australia on 48 track digital and was produced by John Villani who handled their debut. The album showed a progression in Allegiance's sound but still retaining raw power that made them popular in the first place. It was released in November through the Mercury label and debuted on the ARIA charts at No. 11\\\\. In 1997 the band was continuing to tour, playing shows and festivals with many big name international bands. However, tension between band members began to arise and while shooting a video for the track \\"Give Yourself\\" from the Skinman album in late '97, Dave Harrison left the group. Allegiance disbanded soon after. = After the break-up = Fans were not happy with the break-up of the band so the legacy of Allegiance continues on to this day. In November 2000, Allegiance did a massive \\"one-off\\" reunion concert in Perth and showed that the band's popularity had not dipped over the years. In 2003 Allegiance returned with another re-union for the 'NYE Kikstart' concert and were also inducted into the Western Australian music hall of fame. Then in 2004 Allegiance re-united once again to play with KISS at the WACA.

She was launched in 1811 and was one of twenty- seven s. She was cut down to a 24-gun sixth rate in 1845, converted to a training ship in 1860, and sold for breaking up in 1905. War service Havannahs first captain was George Cadogan, who commissioned her into the Channel Fleet. Havannah was rapidly involved in operations against French coastal shipping off the Channel Islands. On 6 September 1811, the boats of Havannah, under the command of her first lieutenant, William Hamley, landed a party that spiked the three 12-pounder guns of a battery on the south-west side of the Penmarks. They then brought out several coasting vessels that had taken refuge under the guns, all without taking any losses. * Schooner Aimable Fanny, laden with wine and brandy, and several chasse marees: * St. Jean, laden with salt; * Petit Jean Baptiste, laden with wine and brandy; * Buonaparte, laden with wine and brandy; * Voltigeur, laden with wine and brandy; and * lastly, one of unknown name, laden with wine and brandy, dismantled and set on fire but later extinguished. On 25 December Havannah sailed for the Mediterranean. In 1812, Cadogan took Havannah to join the squadron operating in the Adriatic from the island of Lissa. On 24 April 1812 , and Havannah landed Lieutenant-colonel George Duncan Robertson, his staff and a garrison at Port St. George on Lissa.Pocock (1977), p. 184. The British had defeated a French naval force on 13 March at the Battle of Lissa and wanted to establish a base there with Robertson as its first Governor. Memorial dedicated to Late Masters Mate Edward Percival who fell during the operation on 6 January 1813 In early 1813 Havannah was detached to the Northern Italian coast where she conducted a five-month campaign against the shipping and shore facilities of Vasto and its environs. On 6 January 1813 Havannahs boats cut out Gunboat No. 8, armed with one long 24-pounder gun. She had a crew of 35 men under the command of M. Joseph Floreus, enseigne de vaisseau. Despite meeting a superior force and coming under small arms fire from the shore, the boats, under Lieutenant Hamley, captured the gunboat and three merchant vessels, their original target, as well. The British had one man killed and two men wounded in the operation. In May 1821, prize money for the gunboat, the three merchant vessels St Antonio No. 1, St Antonio No. 2 and St Antonio No. 3 was awarded, as well as prize money for two other vessels taken that day, Madona del Rosario and the settee Euphemia. On 14 January Havannah and captured two small trabaccolos. Three weeks later, on 7 February, Havannah destroyed four gunboats at Manfredonia. In numerous actions, she seized dozens of ships and destroyed coastal batteries. For instance, on 22 March 1813 the ship's boats captured at Vasto one trabaccolo, armed with three 9-pounder guns and destroyed another. Then on 26 March, her boats brought out five armed trabacolos and five feluccas laden with salt that had been run up on the beach near the town of Fortore. In both actions the enemy lost at least one man killed, while the British had only two men wounded in all. In May 1821 prize money for ten trabaccolos, one parenza, five feluccas, and their cargoes, captured between 22 March and 5 May, was paid. On 18 July, while off Manfredonia, Havannah, with the sloop , attacked a small convoy and captured or destroyed all the vessels. They captured one Neapolitan gunboat armed with one 18-pounder gun, and burnt another. They also destroyed a pinnace armed with one 6-pounder gun. Lastly, they captured two trabaccolos armed with three guns each and laden with salt, and destroyed two others of the same strength and cargo. In November 1813, Havannah was attached to Thomas Fremantle's squadron that blockaded and besieged Trieste. She was then detached to take the port of Zara with the assistance of (or Weazle). Cadogan used the ships' guns to establish batteries armed with two 32-pounder carronades, eight 18-pounder guns and seven long 12-pounder guns. He then attacked the city and captured it with the aid of some Austrian troops. In all, they captured 110 guns and 18 howitzers, 350 men, 100 dismounted guns and 12 gunboats. Cadogan was later instructed to hand over all prizes and spoils of war to the Austrians. (This order cost the crews of Havannah and Weazle an estimated ¬£300,000 in prize money.) The Emperor of Austria, however, awarded Lieutenant Hamley the Imperial Austrian Order of Leopold for his services at Zara. On 9 December Havannah and Weazel destroyed 17 gunboats. In 1814 Havannah came under the command of Captain James Black (acting. On 6 February 1814, Apollo and Havannah were anchored outside Brindisi while the French frigate Uranie was inside the port, on fire. had chased her into the port some weeks earlier while awaiting the officials of the port, which belonged to the Kingdom of Naples, to respond to the presence of the French vessel. When Apollo appeared on the scene and made signs of being about to enter the port, Uranies captain removed the powder from his ship and set her on fire. On 15 April 1814, days before the end of the war, Havannah, under the command of (temporary) Captain Edward Sibly, captured the French privateer schooner Grande Isabelle off Corfu, together with the schooner's prize. The schooner carried four guns and 64 men and had sailed from Corfu on 9 April, before capturing a vessel sailing from Trieste to Messina. Captain Gawen Hamilton recommissioned Havannah in April 1814 at Portsmouth. On 19 July 1815, Havannah was in company with , , , and Ferret when they captured the French vessels Fortune, Papillon, Marie Graty, Marie Victorine, Cannoniere, and Printemis. One was a naval brig of 12 guns and one a cutter of ten guns; two were schooners and three were chasse marees.Lloyd's List, No.4990, - accessed 2 February 2014. Havannah also shared in the prize money for the ship Abeona and the schooners Franklin and Saucy Jack, which other ships had captured between 21 October and 6 November in the Chesapeake. Similarly Havannah shared in the prize money for the schooner Mary and the goods from the transports Lloyd and Abeona, captured in the Chesapeake between 29 November and 19 December. Peacetime service In 1815 Havannah sailed for North America, but by 12 August 1815 she was part of the squadron accompanying , which was carrying Napoleon to exile in Saint Helena.Lloyd's List, no. 4996, - accessed 2 February 2014. In 1816 Havannah sailed to the Cape of Good Hope. By 1819 Havannah was laid up at Sheerness. She underwent repairs between April 1819 and October 1822. From November 1821 she was again in commission and then was based in the Mediterranean. In 1830 she was in Sheerness again.

During his 27-year career in the NBA, Hollins officiated 19 NBA Finals games and five NBA All-Star Games. He is notable for working the Finals every year during the 1990s and for a notorious call during a 1994 NBA Playoffs game between the Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks. Hollins was probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over the 2007 NBA betting scandal involving former referee Tim Donaghy. PersonalEarly life= Hollins grew up in Waco, Texas. He was involved in sports, playing basketball and baseball throughout his childhood, while focusing on baseball during high school. Following high school, Hollins was offered a contract to join the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, but declined and opted to join the military. Spending four years in the United States Navy, Hollins enrolled at California State University, Dominguez Hills. He graduated from the school with a double major in sociology and psychology and was later hired as a high school counselor. Officiating career1994 NBA Playoffs= Hollins was one of the referees assigned to officiate Game 5 of the 1994 NBA Playoffs series between the Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks; the resulting incident was described as the most controversial moment of Hollins' career by Referee magazine. With 2.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Knicks' Hubert Davis attempted a 23-foot shot which was defended by the Bulls' Scottie Pippen. Pippen was called for a personal foul by Hollins, who determined that Pippen made contact with Davis. Television replays indicated that contact was made after Davis had released the ball. Davis successfully made both free throw attempts to assist in the Knicks victory, 87-86, and gave the Knicks a three to two games advantage in the series. Hollins defended the call after the game saying, \\"I saw Scottie make contact with his shooting motion. I'm positive there was contact on the shot.\\" Darell Garretson, the league's supervisor of officials and who also officiated in the league, agreed with Hollins and issued a statement, \\"The perception is that referees should put their whistles in their pockets in the last minutes. But it all comes down to what is sufficient contact. There's an old, old adage that refs don't make those calls in the last seconds. Obviously, you hope you don't make a call that will decide a game. But the call was within the context of how we had been calling them all game.\\" Garretson later changed his stance of the call the next season. Speaking to a Chicago Tribune reporter, Garretson described Hollins' call as \\"terrible\\". Chicago head coach Phil Jackson, upset over the outcome of the game, was fined US$10,000 for comparing the loss to the gold medal game controversy at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The Knicks went on to win the Bulls-Knicks series in seven games, and proceeded all the way to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Houston Rockets, also in seven games.

Diving Gary Gentile is a wreck diver. It has been suggested that Gary Gentile may be the most experienced wreck diver in the world.In the book Deep Descent: Adventure and Death Diving the Andrea Doria by Kevin McMurray () the view is expressed: \\"Of all aboard the Wahoo, [Gary] Gentile was by far and away the most experienced deep-wreck diver in the group, if not in the world. Gentile had been diving the [Andrea] Doria since 1974 and had more dives logged on the ocean liner than anyone else.\\" He has dived on the wreck of the SS Andrea Doria (sometimes referred to as the \\"Mount Everest\\" of SCUBA diving) over 190 times,Gary Gentile, The Advanced Wreck Diving Handbook, . This was a record at the time, although this was surpassed by Dan Crowell in 1999; Kevin McMurray, Deep Descent, , at page 269. and was the first diver to penetrate the first class dining room of the vessel. He was also part of the team of divers, along with Bill Nagle, who recovered the ship's bell in 1985. In the book, Shadow Divers, Robert Kurson indicates that the team had a \\"last man standing\\" arrangement, whereby the last one of them left alive would keep the bell. During the early 1990s, Gentile pioneered the use of mixed gases in wreck diving. He has also participated in expeditions to the SMS Ostfriesland (at a depth of 380 feet), which would serve as the impetus for greater exploration of deep-water shipwrecks, and the RMS Lusitania (at a depth of 300 feet). He achieved fame within the diving community with his publication of The Advanced Wreck Diving Guide in 1988.Much of the material was subsequently republished in The Advanced Wreck Diving Handbook in 2007. In the latter book he commented that he eventually had to approach a non-diving publisher to publish the original Guide, as reputable diving publishers were afraid to publish a book which talked openly about decompression diving techniques. He also published the first book on technical diving, The Technical Diving Handbook, and the field began to gain recognition as a separate stratum of the sport from conventional recreational diving. In many of his books Gentile notes that before technical diving was recognised as a sub-stratum of the sport, divers who consciously engaged in planned decompression diving were shunned by major diver training agencies as \\"gorilla divers\\". Author Gary Gentile has self-published 45 books. He has written several technical books relating to diving, as well as extensive documentation of the shipwrecks of North America. He has also published a number of futuristic fantasy fictional works, although none of these have been a notable commercial success to date. Shadow Divers controversy The publication of the 2004 book Shadow Divers, a New York Times bestseller, brought a huge amount of publicity to the North East American wreck diving community, and turned the two divers featured in the book, John Chatterton and Richie Kohler into media stars. Although the book only referred to Gary Gentile once (referring to him, at page 313 as \\"legendary wreck diver, Gary Gentile\\"Although the compliment was in the context of Gary Gentile telling John Chatterton that it would be impossible to confirm the identity of the wreck believed to be the freighter Texel from the name on the bow, only for Chatterton to prove him wrong.), he published a stinging rebuttal to the book entitled Shadow Divers Exposed in which he challenges the version of events in the original book and level of credit given to Kohler and Chatterton, and puts forward an alternative hypothesis for the sinking of U-869. Gentile's book divided the diving community between those who regarded it as a cheap shot, motivated by jealousy of the fame which Chatteron and Kohler had enjoyed as a result of the book, and those who believed it was a fair attempt to set the record straight and ensure that credit was given to others who had played a key role in identifying the submarine.The customer reviews on Amazon.com give an excellent flavour of the dramatically different views taken of Gentile's book. Other Gary Gentile served in the 25th Infantry Division during the Vietnam War where he was severely wounded. A number of his non-fiction works refer to his experiences in Vietnam.

As such, transtensional regions are characterised by both extensional structures (normal faults, grabens) and wrench structures (strike-slip faults). In general, many tectonic regimes that were previously defined as simple strike-slip shear zones are actually transtensional. It is unlikely that a deforming body will experience 'pure' extension or 'pure' strike-slip. Transtensional shear zones are characterized by the co-existence of different structures, related to both strike-slip shear and extension.

First Nations The first humans to come to the area were probably Paleo-Indians between 9000 and 7000 BCE.; see also Archaeological Services, Inc., \\"Town of Richmond Hill Official Plan: Archaeological and First Nations Policy Study ,\\" October 2009; \\"The Stage 4 Salvage Excavation of the Orion Site ,\\" Dec. 2008. The first archaeological evidence of their presence found was a single scraper found at the Mortson site near Leslie Street and Elgin Mills Road. A few more artifacts were later found east of Lake Wilcox at the Esox site and as of 1988, fourteen sites in Richmond Hill have produced Paleo-Indian artifacts. The people in southern Ontario at this time were organized in nomadic bands, and would have migrated through the area, establishing camps then moving on. The Silver Stream site, which is located on a tributary of the Rouge River west of Leslie Street, between Elgin Mills Road and Major Mackenzie Drive, has yielded 27 artifacts that come from peoples of the Paleo-Indian cultures, one of which was dated to 1800 BCE. Eventually the regional cultural transitioned from Paleo-Indian to Archaic, and then from Archaic to Early Iroquoian. The oldest known Iroquoian site in Richmond Hill is the Wilcox Lake Site, on the east side of Lake Wilcox, which has been dated to 1300 CE. The site covers 12,000 square metres. Human habitation of the area became permanent settlements around this time, where it had previously been nomadic. Well studied is the Boyle-Atkinson Site, a Late Iroquoian settlement southwest of the intersection of Yonge Street and Major Mackenzie Drive. The location was first identified as the remains of an old settlement by David Boyle in the late 1860s. The site was occupied from about 1450 to 1500 CE and was a large village in the area, with at least nine longhouses identified as well as two other buildings. Several other sites in Richmond Hill are known to be from Iroquoian peoples who lived in the area between 1300 and 1550 CE, including the McGaw, Murphy-Goulding, Orion, Reuben Heise and Watford sites. The arrangement of the sites suggest they represent a single community periodically relocating. Around 1550 tensions between the Iroquois of southern Ontario and the Five Nations Iroquois in New York led to their emigration en masse to the Huron Confederacy between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay, and the archaeological evidence suggests the Iroquois inhabitants of Richmond Hill left the area about that time. The area was uninhabited for at least 100 years after the exodus of the Iroquois. Sometime in the late 17th or early 18th century, the Mississauga Indians moved into the area from the north. The Mississaugas had a nomadic lifestyle, and moved seasonally across much of what is now York Region and the Golden Horseshoe. Toronto purchase and early settlement John Graves Simcoe and Augustus Jones, supervising the Queen's Rangers of York cutting trees during the construction of Yonge Street, 1795. The Toronto Purchase took place on September 23, 1787 between the British and the Mississauga Indians. The purchase was understood by David Smith, the Surveyor General for Upper Canada to include the Richmond Hill area. The Mississauga Indians had a different understanding of the northern limit of the purchase. Conflicts arose between the Europeans that began to move into the area and the Mississaugas. The area was first surveyed by Augustus Jones for Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1794 while he was constructing Yonge Street. By 1797, the Mississaugas in the area had left for the regions of Niagara and Peterborough. A meeting between British officials and Mississauga chiefs in 1805 clarified the northern border placing Richmond Hill within the land of the Toronto Purchase. At this time, the land that later became Richmond Hill was divided between Vaughan township west of Yonge Street, and Markham township east of Yonge Street. The first European settlers to arrive in Richmond Hill were Balsar and Katharine Munshaw, accompanied by their children: John, George, Jacob, Betsy and Polly, who arrived in Richmond Hill in the spring of 1794 from Pennsylvania. They cleared a plot of land in the Elgin Mills area. That summer, their sixth child, a daughter named Susan Munshaw was born. She was the first European settler born in Richmond Hill, and the oldest recorded birth. The Munshaws soon found their location too isolated from other European settlers in the area, and resettled themselves on the south-west corner of Yonge Street and Highway 7, outside of Richmond Hill. In 1794, the present day Bayview Avenue and Leslie Street were also laid out and planned, and sometime in the late part of 1794 the first settlers arrived in the area. Some two hundred people led by William Berczy arrived in Markham township from western New York and Pennsylvania after being promised land grants in Markham township in exchange for working on the construction of Yonge Street, in an arrangement Berczy made with the Executive Council of Upper Canada. The surveyor assigned to the area known as Markham township was Abraham Iredell, he was able to begin settling the followers of Berczy in Markham township by November 1794. Some were settled in the second and third concessions which today are part of Richmond Hill, others were settled further east in what would become Markham. Arriving in November, the settlers spent the first winter in miserable conditions, unable to grow any crops before winter. Some supplies were made available to them by the German Land Company of New York and the government of Upper Canada. Crop failures occurred with these settlers in 1795 and 1796, and soon a third of them had left their homesteads. In 1796 it was decided that deeds for these lots would not be issued to Berczy and his associates, as they were not naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom. The German Land Company of New York stopped supporting the settlers and Berczy left, but some settlers stayed on. The presence of these German speaking settlers in Markham township would attract other German speakers in the coming years. The next settler to try his hand at the Vaughan township part of Richmond Hill was John C. Stooks, who arrived there with his wife in June 1797. Arriving in York, the Stooks travelled north along Yonge Street and settled on lot 47 of Vaughan township, on the west side of Yonge Street one lot north of Major Mackenzie Drive. The Stooks too found the life a difficult one, they cleared little land and built only a modest house before abandoning the area and moving on. The first settlers to come to Richmond Hill and remain there for more than a few years were Hugh and Ann Shaw who arrived in 1798 and occupied lot 46 on the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Major Mackenzie Drive. Other lots along Yonge Street quickly became occupied, with Thomas Kinnear in lot 48, William Jarvis in lot 49 and William McLennan in lot 50 east of Yonge Street. West of Yonge street, Abner Miles occupied lot 46 and Samuel Heron on lot 49. The first settlers of the area received land grants either by the Lieutenant Governor directly or by the Executive Council of Upper Canada, typically either as a reward for previous military service to the British Empire or because they were believed to be good settlers who would contribute substantially to the development. Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe developed a special plan for the settlement of Yonge Street that excluded the usual crown reserves and clergy reserves and opened every lot along Yonge Street to permanent settlement. Other concessions in Vaughan township and Markham township allocated two of every seven lots as reserves, with one for the crown and one for the Protestant clergy. Simcoe felt it was important to develop Yonge Street as a route to Georgian Bay and the upper Great Lakes, which motivate his Yonge Street plan. Each lot was open to any settler who arrived on the land and developed it to meet certain conditions. In 1794, this condition was merely that a dwelling be erected on the plot of land and it be occupied within one year. In 1798, this condition was increased so that the dwelling had to measure at least by , and no less than of land had to be cleared and fenced. Such settlers were additionally responsible for clearing their part of the Yonge Street right of way of brush. This plan proved ineffective, and lots on Yonge Street were slower to become occupied than the other lots in Vaughan township. In 1802, thirteen of Yonge Street's 25 concessions in Vaughan township were occupied, while in the next concession twenty of the twenty five lots were occupied by that time. Development of Richmond Hill was also slow because of the lack of mills in the area. Starting with forty-one people in 1798, French royalist settlers led by Joseph- Genevi√®ve Comte de Puisaye, began settling along Yonge Street from today's Elgin Mills Road north to Stouffville Road. The Legislative Council of Upper Canada had some misgivings about the suitability of these settlers for the land, but the French Royalist officers who had left France after the French Revolution were given land grants comparable to those given to United Empire Loyalists who had come to Upper Canada after the American Revolution. Their community was named Windham to honour William Windham the British official who had arranged for their settlement there, but was locally referred to as Puisaye Town. De Puisaye and Augustus Jones went to survey the area in December 1798 while the other settlers remained in York, supported by government supplies. The de Puisaye settlers soon went north, and by January 1799 trees were being cleared from lots. On February 14, 1799 eighteen log cabins had been constructed, but not finished. The settlers work slowed as 1799 dragged on, and individuals began leaving Windham for more developed areas: Montreal, New York and even Europe. De Puisaye soon moved to the Niagara region, although he continued to work for the betterment of Puisaye Town. Of all the settlers who came to Markham township with de Puisaye, only Le Chevalier Michel Saigeon seems to have stayed and prospered. Laurent Quetton St. George, a settler who arrived in Windham in 1799 also stayed in Upper Canada and prospered, making a career as a fur trader. Miles' Hill: The nineteenth century dawns At the start of the 19th century, English speaking and German speaking settlers were trickling into the areas of Vaughan township and Markham township that would later become Richmond Hill. By 1801 the area was known as Miles' Hill after Abner Miles and his son James Miles, who were prominent settlers.; see also Isabel Champion, ed., Markham: 1793-1900 (Markham, ON: Markham Historical Society, 1979), pp. 280-285; 97; 100-103; 141. See also: cf. C. Mulvany et al., \\"The Village of Richmond Hill,\\" History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario (Toronto: C. Blackett Robinson, 1885), 191-195. Miles had arrived in the area in 1800 from York, Upper Canada where he had run a general store on King Street. He opened a general store on Lot 45 on the east side of Yonge Street, and started a potash plant on Lot 45 on the west side of Yonge Street. That same year, he was elected tax assessor and tax collector for the townships of Vaughan, Markham, King and Whitchurch. He soon opened a tavern on the south-east corner of Yonge Street and Major Mackenzie Drive. After Abner Miles' death in 1806, his son James took over his father's businesses and role in the community. James Miles fit well into the role of a community leader. He was a local magistrate and justice of the peace. He was also a lieutenant in the York Militia during the War of 1812. During the War of 1812, General Isaac Brock ordered all available men in Miles' Hill to form a company. The men assembled at the farm of United Empire Loyalist James Fulton, and Brock came to personally inspect them. They were formed into a company of the 1st Regiment of York Militia. The company spent the fall and winter of 1812/1813 in York, Upper Canada waiting for an attack, but it never came. In 1817, James Miles and fellow resident of Miles' Hill Robert Marsh invited Presbyterian cleric William Jenkins to come to Miles' Hill and establish a congregation. Previous to this, religious services in the area had been conducted by travelling preachers. Jenkins was a popular preacher in New York state at the time. He accepted the invitation and founded congregations in both Miles' Hill and the township of Scarborough, Ontario. Jenkins preached on Miles' land, with a tree stump for a pulpit until 1821, when a church was constructed on land James Miles had donated. This small church was built on the west side of Yonge Street would later be named Richmond Hill Presbyterian Church. Miles' Hill becomes Richmond Hill Sometime in the 1820s, Miles' Hill was renamed Richmond Hill. The oft repeated story is that it was so named after a visit to the area by Governor General of British North America Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond on July 13, 1819. However, another well repeated story is that the area's first schoolteacher, Benjamin Barnard, was from a Richmond Hill in England, and taught all his classes the folk song The Lass of Richmond Hill because he was nostalgic for his old home. The popularity of the song with locals may account for the new name. Most authorities, including the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names report the honouring of Charles Lennox as the origin of the name. The Richmond Hill settlement continued to expand and mature as a farming community, especially with the improving condition of Yonge Street that led to daily stagecoaches coming to Richmond Hill from York and Holland Landing. By 1828, Richmond Hill featured a general store, schoolhouse, church, tavern, blacksmith's and carpenter's shop along Yonge Street. The population at this time was growing by nine percent a year. On January 6, 1836 James Sinclair was appointed postmaster for Richmond Hill. This established the name \\"Richmond Hill\\" in a government approved way, and the name began to appear on maps. The newer immigrants and new generations increased land values and built larger houses with more elaborate and better finished estates. Anna Jameson came through the area in the fall of 1837 and remarked that the area had \\"some of the finest land and most prosperous estates in Upper Canada\\" Rebellion in Upper Canada David Bridgeford. The political climate of the 1820s and 1830s divided the residents of Richmond Hill into two groups: the Reformers and the Tories. Many of the newer immigrants came from well off British families that got along well with the elite society of Upper Canada. These settlers were Tories, allied with the establishment, usually members of the Church of England. The Reformers tended to be long settled people of lower classes, often United Empire Loyalists or American immigrants. The 1828 election to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada elected two Reformers from the York riding, which included Richmond Hill. The two elected were William Lyon Mackenzie and Jesse Ketchum. Subsequent elections in 1830, 1834 and 1836 for the Legislative Assembly returned mostly Reform candidates. The crops of 1836 and 1837 did not do well, and Upper Canada was experiencing economic recession. Farmer suffered under the banks' reducing the credit available and calling in outstanding loans. Farmers in Richmond Hill and the other outlying areas around Toronto became increasing sympathetic to talk of revolt. William Lyon Mackenzie issued a letter on 1 December 1837 calling the citizens of Upper Canada to revolt while the militia was in Lower Canada suppressing revolt there. On December 4, 1837 those swayed to his cause, and began moving south from the settlement in the north towards Toronto, where they planned to seize a weapon cache. They came through Richmond Hill in the afternoon, and caught the attention of Captain Hugh Stewart who was in a tavern just north of Richmond Hill. Loyalist residents of Richmond Hill began to assemble on the farm of \\"Colonel Moodie\\", a proud supporter of the Empire whose house made a natural gathering place for loyalists. Richmond Hill resident William Crew set out for Toronto to warn the government there of the oncoming rebels. When word reached Colonel Moodie that Crew had been detained by the rebels, Moodie set out with fellow Richmond Hill residents David Bridgeford and Hugh Stewart to head to Toronto and give warning. They encountered a road blockade by the rebels at Montgomery's Tavern. They charged the blockage and Moodie was shot. The company of men less Bridgeford were taken prisoner, and Moodie died later that night, the first casualty of the Upper Canada Rebellion. Bridgeford met up with John Powell and headed to Toronto, where he was able to warn lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada Francis Bond Head of the impending rebellion. Riding north afterwards to secure further volunteers, Bridgeford was captured by the rebels. On December 5, 1837 Mackenzie and some five hundred poorly equipped rebels marched south but were quickly rebuffed by sheriff William Jarvis and some twenty other men. They regrouped at Montgomery's Tavern, where the last battle of the rebellion was fought on December 7. The rebels were routed and Bridgeford and the other loyalist prisoners were freed. The rebellion left a simmering feud in Richmond Hill between Tories and Reformers that lasted a generation. The local meeting on October 15, 1838 to make statements for Lord Durham's Report ended in a brawl. In the end, the Tories gained control of the political and culture life of Richmond Hill and maintained it for many years. Richmond Hill in the middle of the nineteenth century The local preacher William Jenkins died in 1843. In 1847, the old log cabin schoolhouse of Richmond Hill Public School was replaced with a brick one. Reverend James Dick came to Richmond Hill in 1847 and took up a position as minister at the Richmond Hill Presbyterian Church. The same year Reverend Robert Campbell took up the same position at the still under construction Methodist Church. Both men were far more moderate than Jenkins, who had preached both political and religious radicalism. The community began to develop in earnest. The first Richmond Hill Spring Fair was sponsored by the Yonge Street Agricultural Society and held on May 24, 1849. Unlike most of the farming towns in the region, which developed around a main intersection, or \\"four corners\\", Richmond Hill began to stretch out along Yonge Street with no real downtown area. The little town had two to three hundred residents around this time, and in 1851 it boasted eight commercial stores, five inns, three blacksmiths, six woodworkers, three wagonmakers, a distiller and three doctors. Several Mills were located on creeks and streams nearby. In 1851, the first secondary school in Richmond Hill opened, the Richmond Hill Grammar School. Initial run in a private residence, the school obtained their own building in 1853, adjacent to the primary school. The Richmond Hill Library Association first met in December 1852, electing James Dick, the Presbyterian Minister as their president. The Richmond Hill post office, with postmaster Matthew Teefy and his three daughters. Through this time, travel up and down Yonge Street became increasingly important to the business of Richmond Hill. Inns and taverns opened and closed with some regularity. Richmond Hill found itself an ideal distance from Toronto, with the condition of Yonge Street meaning that travellers who departed from Toronto in the morning typically arrived in Richmond Hill hungry and looking for a rest. Continued attempts to improve the condition of Yonge Street through the area met with little success. The tolls collected on the road proved inadequate to even service the debt accumulated in its building. On May 16, 1853 the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway opened a line from Toronto to Collingwood, which provided an alternate means of travelling north out of Toronto. Although it had a stop in Richmond Hill, the station was located some six kilometers east of Yonge Street on Major Mackenzie Drive, a long travel from the built-up area of Richmond Hill along the unpaved road. The ease of railway travel also impacted the traffic on Yonge Street. Between 1852 and 1854, the tolls collected on Yonge Street dropped twenty six percent. Although this hurt business in town, there remained a need for stagecoaches, especially among local residents, and the post office in town provided reason to travel to Richmond Hill. Neighbouring communities like Langstaff Corners, Dollar, Headford, Oak Ridges, North Gormley and Temperanceville threatened to eclipse Richmond Hill, but none ever succeeded. As the town continued to grow more and more businesses and institutions sprang up. A Roman Catholic church was opened in 1857. 1857 also saw the founding of the town's first newspaper, the York Ridings Gazette and Richmond Hill Advertiser which published its first edition on June 12, 1857. The newspaper reformed as the York Herald on March 25, 1859 due to financial pressures. An Anglican church opened in 1871. Richmond Hill incorporated Trench's Carriage Works In 1872, a movement to incorporate Richmond Hill as a village began to pick up steam, led by the York Herald. Previous attempts in 1853 and 1857 had failed, the first because Richmond Hill had less than half the needed 1000 people to qualify for incorporation under provincial law, and the latter because their inclusion of the Elgin Mills area to meet the 750 needed under newer legislation was felt to be \\"too expansionistic\\". The community at the time was split between Vaughan township west of Yonge Street, and Markham township east of Yonge Street. This division of the community made it hard for either township to effectively meet the needs of the community. The village of Richmond Hill was incorporated by act of the York County Council on June 18, 1872, coming into effect January 1, 1873. The boundaries of the new village were set at Markham-Vaughan Road (today's Major Mackenzie Drive) in the south, around today's Levendale Road in the north, just beyond Mill Pond in the east and the CNR tracks in the west. An election was held on January 6, 1873 to elect a reeve and four councillors. Abraham Law was elected the first reeve of Richmond Hill, in a campaign that centred on the need for a new high school. The new high school was built, and opened to students in November 1873. The town continued to grow slowly after incorporation. One of the first services offered by the newly incorporated town was a fire department. On April 15, 1866, a large fire had destroyed four buildings in Richmond Hill and seriously damaged two others. After two less serious fires that year, a volunteer fire department had been organised. The town recognised the volunteer fire department, but tried not to interfere in their affairs. The volunteer fire department disbanded in 1877 when the town council refused to buy them a new fire engine. Richmond Hill founded its own fire department in 1880 which incorporated in 1881. The village purchased a second-hand fire truck for the department that year. Nineteenth century draws to a close The Richmond Hill Presbyterian Church, with its preacher on the lawn of the adjacent home. In the 1880s, the churches replaced the taverns as the centre of the social scene in Richmond Hill. An August 1881 edition of The Liberal remarked \\"Few villages of equal size or importance within the Province, have manifested so much activity and energy in church enterprise as our own.\\" Richmond Hill in 1881 had a large Presbyterian church, adjacent to St Mary's Anglican Church. Across Yonge Street stood a Methodist church and a smaller Roman Catholic church was also found in Richmond Hill. An investigation by The Liberal found that over $25 000 had been spent on church projects in 1880 while Richmond Hill's population stood at less than one thousand souls. On 21 December 1879 the Methodist church had burnt down. The congregation soon funded a new building which was opened in October 1881. The construction of this new church spurred the Presbyterians to also commission a new church to replace their old one that dated to 1821. Their new church opened May 24, 1881. The new churches had tall spires that dominated the skyline of Richmond Hill. The Anglicans responded in kind to this with the construction of their own spire to draw prestige to the church. The official \\"Town Bell\\" was moved from the Robin Hood Hotel to the new Methodist church in 1883, a reflection of their changing importances in the town. The parishioners at the more modest St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church built a new, larger building at Yonge Street and Dunlop Street in 1894. With this, the four large churches of Richmond Hill were the four largest buildings in Richmond Hill, defining its skyline. The 1880s and 1890s were economically bad for Richmond Hill. The Patterson brothers firm, a manufacturing of farming implements and a major employer in Richmond Hill moved their operation to Woodstock after the town council there offered a $35 000 bonus if they would, which allowed their growing operation to construct a much needed rail spur. The Patterson brothers factory moved to Stratford in the winter of 1886/1887. The community experienced the economic decline that was occurring all across Ontario at the time, although perhaps not as strongly. The Trench Carriage Works and Newton Tanning Company remained major employers. The population declined, from 850 in 1890 to 650 in 1900. But many of the main stores along Yonge Street stayed open. Electric rail arrives On November 19, 1896, the first electric train of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company arrived in Richmond Hill from Toronto. The line ran along Yonge Street from Toronto to Richmond Hill. The electric cars shortered the time to travel from Toronto's northern limit to Richmond Hill to forty-five minutes from the previous three- hour rides by stagecoach. The electric train brought immediate change to Richmond Hill. John Thompson's stagecoach line was soon out of business. Other businesses fared much better, with general trade going up thirty-five percent from 1896 to 1898. The electric rail line was quickly extended north, reaching Newmarket in 1899, but Richmond Hill was now connected to Toronto, with the Toronto World predicting Richmond Hill would become a suburb of Toronto, and The Liberal repeating their thoughts. The Metropolitan Street Railway Company bought some land adjacent to Bond Lake, then a short journey north of Richmond Hill. Bond lake was the first electric park (a park lit with electric lights) built in Ontario. The park featured a baseball diamond, a display pavilion and the lake for swimming, fishing and boating. It drew tourists to the area with its own stop on the Metropolitan Street Railway Company line. In 1904, the Metropolitan Street Railway Company was acquired by the Toronto and York Radial Railway Company, which led to more tracks being laid across southern Ontario, and more trains passing through Richmond Hill. 1904 also saw the construction of a second railway through Richmond Hill. The James Bay Railway built a railway station in Richmond Hill on its line from Toronto to Sudbury. The new station Centre Street East was much closer to the centre of Richmond Hill. It opened in November 1906 and soon was the main route for shipping freight, although the electric line along Yonge Street remain the dominant method of passenger travel. Richmond Hill made a deal with the Toronto and York Radial Railway Company in 1912 to buy electrical power from them as they were generating a surplus from their Bond Lake generator. The system was set into place and on December 30, 1912 the electric streetlights on Richmond Hill were lit up for the first time. Some commercial stores began using electric lighting that same day and the next. Other shops, factories and homes began to connect to the network. Greenhouse industry arrives Industrial development of the core of Richmond Hill had not progressed during the first decade of the 20th century. The outlying areas of Lake Wilcox and Gormley were fast growing and welcoming new industries, and the Richmond Hill council set up a committee to encourage industries to locate in Richmond Hill. The first to do so was William Lawrence's greenhouse, which was constructed in the summer of 1912. Harold Mills built a greenhouse the same year. Lawrence was a Toronto florist and president of the Canadian Horticultural Society. Lawrence also persuaded fellow Toronto florist and former president of the Canadian Horticultural Society John Dunlap to build a greenhouse in Richmond Hill. Dunlop began a large flower-growing operation in Richmond Hill. In August 1913 he had two operation greenhouses and six more planned. Dunlop's roses quickly won acclaim. In March 1914 his roses were awarded first prize at the International Rose Show in New York City. In April 1916, his flowers garnered three first places and two second places at the National Flower Show in Philadelphia. The greenhouse industry in Richmond Hill was competitive but friendly. The various greenhouses often worked together to fill large orders. Together with interested local residents they founded the Richmond Hill Horticultural Society in April 1914. The society worked to both increase local interest in fruit, vegetable and flower growing, and to enhance the town's aesthetics. They planted trees on village property and awarded prizes to local residents for their flower gardens. The Great War A cenotaph in Richmond Hill. The Richmond Hill Women's Institute's was formed on January 27, 1913 holding their first meeting in the masonic hall. Their meetings usually focused on domestic matters, but they did support the \\"Votes for Women\\" campaigns run by the national and provincial women's institutes, and help establish local women in more prominent places in society. Their efforts put two women on the village's Fair Board in 1917. The first woman elected to any position in Richmond Hill was Mrs. O.L. Wright, a member of the Women's Institute elected to the Richmond Hill School Board as a trustee in 1932. The onset of World War I also pushed women into leading roles in the community. Eighty nine men from Richmond Hill served in Canada's armed forces. Six men from Richmond Hill would be killed. The absent men opened many opportunities for women in the workforce, the volunteer agencies and areas of public service. With the blossoming of the flower industry, the city's population began to rise rapidly. New homes were being built, with The Liberal counting 27 new homes in 1918. Williams Lawrence sold the unused parts of his greenhouse property as lots and began developing the subdivision of Roseview Gardens, around Roseview Avenue and Major Mackenzie Drive. The village council hired local carriage maker William Ashford Wright to design a crest for Richmond Hill in 1919. Wright patterned his designed after the 4th Duke of Richmond's crest, and included his motto as well: \\"En la Rose Je Fleuris\\", French for \\"Like the Rose, I flourish\\", which the town retains. The Roaring 20s The 1920s were a time of growth and prosperity in Richmond Hill. In 1921 Richmond Hill built a pumping station and a water tower on Mill Pond to supply the city with public water. The Orange Home, a boarding school, opened on Yonge Street on July 2, 1923. Run by the Orange lodge, the building contained dormitory rooms, a chapel, an infirmary, a dining hall, lounges, and three classrooms. The school would soon house 150 children. The growing population, combined with the elimination of tuition fees in the 1920s led to increased enrollment in Richmond Hill High School, which moved to a new building on December 5, 1924, on the site of the modern building. In 1924, the volunteer fire department was replaced by a semi-professional force, headed by Harold Mills. The town purchased a motorised fire truck for the brigade, and Mills hired many of the men in his greenhouses to be firemen. Great Depression The collapse of the stock market in 1929 and the ensuing depression changed the economic and social direction of Richmond Hill. Construction of new homes and workplaces stopped and municipal affairs turned strongly towards dealing with the unemployed and the homeless. Make work projects were begun, such as a water main extension along Benson Avenue. Salaries of civic employees were cut by ten percent in January 1932. Teachers of the Richmond Hill Board of Education saw their salaries cut five percent in May 1932, and principals eight percent. The village of Richmond Hill, together with North York, Markham and Vaughan purchased the radial railway run by the Toronto Transit Commission along Yonge Street in 1930, after the transit commission had planned to close the line due to sagging ridership. The service was renamed North Yonge Railways. The Rose business remained successful through the 1930s, however. Four large greenhouse companies operated in Richmond Hill during the 1930s: H.J. Mills' greenhouses, Richmond Roses John H. Dunlop's greenhouses and Bedford Park greenhouses. The greenhouse rose growing business was labour-intensive, but sales also stayed high through the depression. John H. Dunlop's greenhouses were purchased by H.J. Mills in April 1934, consolidating the rose business in three companies. The David Dunlap Observatory was opened in May 1935. The observatory housed the world's second largest telescope at the time, surpassed only by the Mount Wilson Observatory in collecting area. The cost of the observatory was $500 000 and was funded by Jessie Donalda Dunlap, the widow of David A. Dunlap. The telescope was run by the University of Toronto, and was used for spectra until the mid 1980s, but due to light pollution, it's abilities have been reduced and is no longer used for scientific research. It is now operated by the Royal Astronomical Society Of Canada for educational purposes. The Richmond Hill Lions Club was formed in April 1938. Their main activity was serving the needs of the poor. They provided people on relief with food and clothing, such as milk and cod liver oil to poor children. They organised annual street dances to raise funds for the medical needs of impoverished children. World War II The local chapter of the Red Cross had been disbanded after World War I, but reformed on September 8, 1939, two days before Canada declared war on Germany. Around 150 men from Richmond Hill served in Canada's armed forces during World War II. The first resident of Richmond Hill killed in battle was Sergeant Gunner Don Graham, for whom flags in Richmond Hill were flown at half mast on July 10, 1941. With many men overseas, manpower shortages on farms became so severe that local businessmen and professionals formed groups know colloquially as \\"Commandos\\" and volunteered time to work on farms. Support for the war effort ran high in Richmond Hill. In the April 27, 1942 plebiscite on conscription six hundred eighteen voters were in favour of conscription, while only twenty three were opposed. Various social organisations in Richmond Hill garnered donations for the war effort. School children trick or treating on Halloween collected change for the war effort, rather than candy. Post-war growth A new six hundred person movie theatre opened in Richmond Hill in 1948, named The Richmond. The same year a drastic shortage of hydroelectric power in Ontario forced the rationing of power to municipalities. The North Yonge railways consumed huge amounts of power, so the trains were temporarily replaced with diesel-burning buses, starting October 10, 1948. Although a local outcry arose over the buses, once in operation they proved popular and profitable, with ridership in the first quarter of 1949 up 128 000 riders over the previous year. A vote in September 1949 did away with the old railway, which was sold off. Richmond Hill's first catholic school opened in 1948, adjacent to St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church. Some sixty students were in attendance during its first year of operation. The Richmond Hill Business Men's Association was formed, and held its first meeting in February 1950. The village grew fast through the 1950s. On 1 January 1953 Richmond Hill annexed some of land from Markham Township, tripling the village's size, and increasing the population from 2300 to 3300. The village's new boundaries extended to Bayview Avenue in the east, Elgin Mills Road in the north and Harding Boulevard in the south. In 1954, the village council took an important step towards Richmond Hill's growth. The council approved the construction of subdivisions, in which the homebuilder would be responsible for paving roads, providing sewage and water hookups and paying the municipality $300 towards to construction of new schools for each home built. This enable the rapid building of new homes. In the summer and fall of 1954, four new subdivisions were built in Richmond Hill, at Richmond Acres, Pleasantville, Tyndall and Glenbrae. This growth triggered the construction of a new municipal structure, and the establishment of a separate police force for Richmond Hill. During the 1950s, some five new elementary schools opened in Richmond Hill in response to the population growth. Richmond Hill annexed a second parcel of land in 1956, of Vaughan Township covering Richmond Heights. In September 1956, the Ontario Municipal Board approved its elevation to Town status, effective January 1, 1957. 1957 also saw the opening of Richmond Hill's first radio station, CJRH. In 1958, a branch of the Victorian Order of Nurses was set up in Richmond Hill to provide home nursing service. The same year the Richmond Hill Senior Citizen's Club was formed. An additional of Vaughan Township, just north of Richmond Heights, were annexed in February 1959. A community in bloom The first woman to serve on the Richmond Hill Town Council, Margaret Southwell, began her term in 1960. Bayview Secondary School opened in 1960, providing Richmond Hill with a second high school. Construction began on Richmond Hill's first hospital, named York Central Hospital in 1961. The hospital opened on November 28, 1963 under the directorship of James Langstaff. The 1960s also saw the opening of many recreation facilities Richmond Hill was lacking after the rapid growth of the 1950s. Several new public parks were opened in the 1960s, and Richmond Hill's first public pool, dubbed Centennial Pool after Canada's Centennial, was opened in June 1965. In 1968, the town expanded its borders again, annexing north of Elgin Mills Road. The problematic lack of recreation facilities continued however. The town's Social Planning Council convened in April 1968 and blamed increasing youth vandalism, drug use and truancy on the town's lack of recreation facilities. Social Planning Council member Pierre Burton was quoted as saying: \\"All we insist on are paved roads and sewers ... no one cares about a community hall or swimming pool or any other kind of recreation for adults or children.\\" The same year, a new large ice rink was opened. The next year the town opened its first day care facility at the urging of the Social Planning Council and local women like Helen Sawyer Hogg who publicly spoke about the lack of such facilities holding back professional women. 1969 also saw the town's first winter carnival, held at Mill Pond. Richmond Hill's explosive growth continued during the 1990s, fueled in significant part by immigration. In the early 90s, Statistics Canada named Richmond Hill as Canada's fastest-growing community. On March 25, 2019, the Richmond Hill Town Council passed a motion to change the title of Richmond Hill from 'town' to 'city'.

Intended to replace the earlier The Saint detective series, the first film took its title from the lead character, Gay Laurence. George Sanders was cast in the title role; he had played The Saint in the prior RKO series. He was teamed again with Wendy Barrie who had been with him in three previous Saint films. The first four films starred Sanders as Gay Lawrence and the balance featured Tom Conway, Sanders' real-life brother, as \\"Tom Lawrence\\", brother of Gay.https://catalog.afi.com/Film/26713-THE-GAY- FALCON?sid=eabd5def-e054-413b-9737-3c2d10a716b0&sr;=3.438889&cp;=1&pos;=0 Plot Ladies' man and amateur crime solver Gay Laurence (George Sanders), the \\"Gay Falcon\\", reluctantly agrees to give up both habits to mollify his fianc√©e, Elinor Benford (Nina Vale). He and his uncouth sidekick, Jonathan \\"Goldie\\" Locke (Allen Jenkins), become unenthusiastic stockbrokers. When Elinor asks him to attend a party given by Maxine Wood (Gladys Cooper) to mingle with potential clients, he refuses to go to that much trouble. However, when Wood asks for his help via pretty assistant Helen Reed (Wendy Barrie), he cannot resist. It seems that Wood's soir√©es have been plagued by jewel thefts, and she is particularly worried about the diamond of her guest, Vera Gardner (Lucile Gleason). At the party, Elinor becomes annoyed when she figures out why Gay changed his mind about attending, and retaliates by dancing with Manuel Retana (Turhan Bey). In frustration, she grabs the flower from Retana's lapel and flings it at Gay. He calmly picks it up and attaches it to his lapel. Vera Gardner then insists on dancing with Gay; she hands him her diamond secretly, much to his puzzlement, then leaves the room. Moments later, a shot rings out, and she is dead. The killer is seen by Goldie as he makes his getaway. Police Detectives Bates (Edward Brophy) and Grimes (Eddie Dunn) take Goldie to the police station on suspicion of murder. Gay persuades Inspector Mike Waldeck (Arthur Shields) to release Goldie so he can flush out the real murderer. Then he and Helen go to see Maxine, leaving Goldie in the car. While they are gone, Goldie is abducted by Noel Weber (Damien O'Flynn), Gardner's killer. Weber orders Goldie to call Gay to offer to trade Goldie's life for the diamond. However, Weber is shot, and once again, Goldie is found by the police near a dead body. By this point, Gay suspects Gardner arranged to have her diamond \\"stolen\\" so she could collect on the insurance. The flower was a signal, indicating to whom Gardner was to give the jewel. It should have been Retana. Gay and Helen break into his apartment, but have to hide when the owner enters. He realizes someone has been there and opens a secret compartment to check if it has been found. Relieved, he leaves the room. Gay sneaks in and takes a gun he finds in the compartment, fairly certain it was used to shoot Weber. The police confirm it is the murder weapon. Meanwhile, Gay calls Elinor to warn her to stay away from the killer, but she believes he is lying out of jealousy and tells Retana so. Forewarned, Retana goes to Gay's apartment, ties up his servant Jerry (Willie Fung), and demands the diamond at gunpoint when Gay returns. He is frightened off when he mistakes Helen at the door for the police. Now certain about his theory, Gay goes to see Maxine, taking Inspector Waldeck along. She tells them she has been receiving threats, so they stand guard in the living room while she sleeps. Retana enters through her bedroom window, but when he lunges at her, Gay and Waldeck charge in. They are puzzled when Retana collapses and dies. Then Gay finds a hypodermic needle on the floor. Gay stops Maxine from stepping on it and destroying the incriminating fingerprints. He reveals that she, her husband Weber, and Retana were responsible for the thefts. The Webers decided to betray Retana, but he found out. Gay realized she must be involved when Goldie was kidnapped; nobody else knew where Goldie was at the time.

After RKO decided to replace the \\"Saint\\" series, the studio began to search for a new mystery character similar to the \\"Saint\\". George Sanders, on loan to RKO from Twentieth Century-Fox, was retained in the lead role. In March 1941, the studio bought the rights to Michael Arlen's story \\"The Gay Falcon\\", saying they intended Sanders and Wendy Barrie to star. They assigned Lynn Root and Frank Fenton to work on the script, resulting in Charteris suing RKO on the grounds that \\"the Falcon was the Saint in disguise.\\"\\"Notes: 'The Gay Falcon'.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: September 4, 2016. Filming started May 1941. At one stage RKO considered calling the film Meet the Falcon before reverting to The Gay Falcon. In June 1941 RKO announced the Falcon would be a series. In July, Sanders, Barrie and Allen Jenkins were announced for the second film. In September 1941 RKO officially dropped the Saint series. In November 20 Century Fox gave RKO the right to make three more Falcon films with Sanders. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 1 review.

Early life  Ferguson was born Manie Payne in 1850 in the town of Carlow in County Carlow, 84 km from Dublin, in the south-east of Ireland. On 7 June 1883, she married Theodore Pollock Ferguson (born January 10, 1853 in Mansfield, Ohio in Richland County, Ohio; died July 12, 1920 in Los Angeles), a former minister in the United Presbyterian Church (Jones, Guide 628; Hunt 285), who had been converted in 1875 in Oberlin, Ohio through the preaching of evangelist Charles Finney(Clark 1949:79). After relocating to Santa Barbara, California in 1879, he was entirely sanctified in a holiness revival meeting in 1880 in California. (Frankiel 106). Initially TP became an itinerant preacher, before moving with Manie to Los Angeles during the boom of 1885-1886. (Frankiel in Holland, 22)  Peniel Mission  Ferguson, along with her husband, Theodore, founded the Los Angeles Mission on November 11, 1886. This was eventually renamed the Peniel Mission. According to Piepkorn, \\"The name Peniel was chosen from Genesis 32: 24-30, and is meant to connote spiritual triumph.\\" (Piepkorn 27) According to Frankiel, Peniel means \\"Face of God\\". (107) From the outset, the Peniel Mission was undenominational and nonsectarian. In 1894, the Fergusons received a significant anonymous financial donation (from former English cricketer George Studd). With this funding the Fergusons were able to plan to expand the ministry of the Peniel Mission. They invited former Methodist presiding elder Dr Phineas Bresee to join them in their endeavour, and constructed a 900-seat auditorium and ministry centre at 227 South Main Street, Los Angeles. It was decided that there would be four superintendents: Theodore and Manie Ferguson, George Studd and Phineas F. Bresee. On Sunday 21 October 1894 the 900-seat Peniel Hall was dedicated. University of Southern California president Dr. Joseph Pomeroy Widney led the 9.30am Praise Service, while Bresee preached in the 11.00am service \\"from the text, \\"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\\"(Smith, 40). In the initial issue of the Peniel Herald, it was announced > Our first work is to try to reach the unchurched. The people from the homes > and the street where the light from the churches does not reach, or > penetrates but little. Especially to gather the poor to the cross, by > bringing to bear upon them Christian sympathy and helpfulness.... It is also > our work to preach and teach the gospel of full salvation; to show forth the > blessed privilege of believers in Jesus Christ, to be made holy and thus > perfect in love. (Smith 40) As Timothy Smith explains: > Here were holiness and humanitarianism working hand in hand, as in the days > of Wesley. And sectarian feeling was rejected: \\"Peniel Mission is thoroughly > evangelical but entirely undenominational,\\" the Herald declared. Its > superintendents would welcome help from all \\"earnest souls . . . who have > any time over and above the work in their churches that they desire to > give\\". (Smith 40) After Bresee and Widney separated from the Peniel Mission in September 1895 to form the Church of the Nazarene, Manie Ferguson provided primary leadership of the Peniel Mission. According to Schwanz, > Manie Ferguson was more outgoing than Theodore and was the guiding force for > the expansion of the ministry. ... Under Manie's direction, the Peniel > Missions sought to provide a ministry for single women. This appears to have > been a primary motivation in the growth of the movement. The women usually > lived in rented rooms near the rented hall where they conducted evangelistic > services. They boldly testified on street corners and in bars and houses of > prostitution. All workers were unsalaried, but the local mission paid for > most of their expenses. Even the Fergusons were not paid by the mission, but > lived on the rental income from three small houses they > owned.Wesleyan/Holiness Women Clergy at www.whwomenclergy.org According to Sandra Frankiel, > Together with his wife Manie, he offered street-corner meetings in the > afternoons and evangelistic services nightly, with a meal afterwards. Their > entire work, like that of most of the city holiness missions, was oriented > toward soul saving and the promotion of holiness. The mission was not a > church, however; converts were supposed to join one of the regular > denominations. It was, rather, a holiness revival station spreading the > message of Christian perfection. (Frankiel 106-107) \\"The Peniel Mission used some of the same methods as the Salvation Army, including street-corner meetings followed by parades back to the mission hall.\\"(Taiz 185) After her husband's death in 1920, \\"Mother Ferguson\\" continued to direct the work until her own death on 8 June 1932.\\"CO-FOUNDER OF PENIEL MISSIONS DIES OF ILLNESS\\", Los Angeles Times (9 June 1932):a16. In 1947 the Peniel Mission became a part of the present-day World Gospel Mission.Nineteenth Century Holiness at www.novelguide.com In 1998, the West Coast USA Peniel Missions experienced a significant change when the majority of Peniel Missionaries resigned from Peniel Mission and went to work for City Team Ministries leaving the Peniel Mission in Stockton, California the remaining American Peniel Mission affiliated with the World Gospel Mission.  Poet and hymn writer  Manie Ferguson wrote many poems and hymns. The song for which she is still remembered is \\"Blessed Quietness\\" (\\"Joys are flowing like a river / Since the Comforter has come\\") (1897).Bless√®d Quietness at The Cyber Hymnal Other hymns she wrote include: \\"That Man of Calvary\\"That Man of Calvary at The Cyber Hymnal and \\"Christ in the Storm\\" (1904).Christ in the Storm at The Cyber Hymnal  Writings  *Echoes From Beulah.

Where contextual advertising is keyword based, editorial-related advertising is able to also take in the content of the whole article and match on a conceptual level, rather than simply looking for the existence of pre-selected words. For example, there is no chance that an auto mechanic could advertise next to an article about the Detroit Pistons. It has many different ways to go and one would be to not. This specificity also ensures that: * Advertisers do not advertise next to defamatory articles (or they can create content that will offer a right of reply) * Advertisers do not advertise next to inappropriate content such as obituaries or negative news articles * Advertisers can appear next to articles in the general subject area of interest, for example for keywords that are not actually included in the on page text. Advertisers can supply a number of specifically targeted pages, each with their own message to attract users to their 'microsite'. This 'microsite' is housed within a publication on a searchable vertical directory. Advertisers who are not completely related to the publication will not be considered for the program. This creates a directory resource of related suppliers within the publication's website that is also optimized for search engine traffic.

It is located in St. Clair County, Michigan, on the peninsula formed by the St. Clair and Belle rivers. The plant was built across M-29 from the St. Clair Power Plant in East China, Michigan, and shares the coal delivery terminal with it. The Belle River plant shares cooling water from the St. Clair River with its sister plant. Five oil-fueled internal combustion generators (named IC1, IC2, 3, 4, and 5) were built in 1981, with the total output 13.75 megawatt. Coal-fired unit 1 of the Belle River plant was completed in 1984, followed by a similar unit 2 in 1985. Each unit has a nameplate capacity of 697.5 MWe, however the coal-fired plant as a whole generates 1260 MWe all year around. In 1999, three peaker natural-gas fired turbines (named 12-1, 12-2, and 13-1) were added, with the total name-plate capacity of 256 MWe. Belle River is Detroit Edison's third largest producer of electricity. The power plant has a significant impact on the local economy, employing many residents. The Lansing Board of Water and Light owns a small portion of the power plant and buys electricity from DTE during peak demand periods.http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/22806 Connection to the grid The plant is connected to the power grid via numerous 345 kV transmission lines, both operated and maintained by ITC Transmission. There are 3 double-circuit 345kV Transmission Lines. Two of the three head west and one goes north to west and there it crosses Interstate 94 and goes north to west again where it connects to a 345kV line heading north to the Greenwood Energy Center, also owned by Detroit Edison. Another 345 kV transmission line interconnects with Hydro One. Environmental impact All of the waste heat generated by the plant (about twice its electrical output) is released into the St. Clair River.
