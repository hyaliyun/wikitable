There are about 3000, mostly Catholic families living there. It boasts of some of the best Prawn hatcheries and Salt Pans in Tamil Nadu. It falls under the Roman Catholic diocese of Thoothukudi and the feast of St.Michael is a popular religious festival. Geography and Location Tharuvaikulam is located 10 km from the town Thoothukudi in sea shore of Bay of Bengal in Tamil Nadu, Ottapidaram Taluk. Catholic settlement is believed to have started as early as 1750. At that time the village was attached to Kaamanaikanpatti Parish and then to Vembar and finally separate Taruvaikulam Parish came into existence in the year 1907. In the olden days the people living here were fully depended on the palm tree and fishing. Later in 1974 a match factory have been started by Rev. Fr. Ambrose which provided jobs and income to thousands of villagers. Mathar Sangam developed in these days. They did much social work. A primary health center is run by state government benefiting the villagers. Places of interest = Church of St. Michael= The first stone built church was built in the year 1875 and the present church was built in the year 1922. The 85 ft tower was built in the year 1960 by Rev.Fr.Maria Manikam by receiving contributions from the villagers. This Roman Catholic church, with its towering steeple, was built in 1922 and symbolizes the faith of the people living there. From 20 to 29 September (10 days) the church attracts a huge crowd for the feast of St. Michael, which is celebrated with religious pomp and gaiety. = Church of St. Nicholas= Famous for its 10-day festival, around Thoothukudi district this is the church for St. Nicholas. It resides at the center of the Tharuvaikulam village. The festival commence at the last Friday of January. = Church of St. Antony= Famous for its 13-day festival, traditionally, newlyweds visit this church for blessings. People nowadays give traditional \\"Assanam\\" i.e., Thanks to St. Antony for his prayer to God for the people who blessed. = Other Churches and Shrines= Apart from this, there are churches of Our Lady of Health, Church of St. Xavier, Church of St Theresa, Shrine of St George. = Beach= Calm and sandy beach. In olden days people walked all the way to Thoothukudi by the shore. A modern-day beach is built with a small pavement into the sea as decided in 2012. A children's park is adjacent to the Beach. Two numbers of Beach Volleyball Court has been built. Plans have been devised to conduct state level and national level tournament. A Sports Stadium is proposed to be built adjacent to the beach. = Statue of Kamaraj= It has the most realistic look and feel than any other Kamaraj statues. It is situated in Tharuvaikulam Bus Stand. This statue always remember the Rev. Fr. Navamani Ex. Parish Priest of Tharuvaikulam called/known as Guru Kamaraj. Economy Fishing is the major industry. Tharuvai fishermen use both mechanized and non-mechanized country boats for fishing. Prized catch include Tiger prawns and lobsters which are mostly exported. Coral mining and diving for conches is also found here, though mostly the trade is declining. The government actively discourages these activities as Tharuvaikulam falls under the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park. Rajiv Gandhi prawn culture units are being developed. A number of prawn hatcheries had sprouted up since 1990, but most shut down by 2000. However, still there are a few profitable hatcheries operating here. Salt mining is another lucrative industry. Production is mostly for industrial use. In olden times there was a flourishing trade in palm tree products which has gradually declined over a period of time. Agriculture is practiced on a small scale. Tharuvaikulam tomatoes are quite popular in the region. Red chilies are another favorite from the region. The vagaries of weather, however do not permit regular cultivation.

The common name, cabbage moth, is a misnomer as the species feeds on many fruits, vegetables, and crops in the genus Brassica (i.e. cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts). Other notable host plants include tobacco, sunflower, and tomato, making this pest species particularly economically damaging. The moth spans a wide geographic range encompassing the entire Palearctic region. Due to this wide geographic region and the presence of various populations globally, local adaptations have resulted in a species with high variability in life history and behavior across different populations. Geographic range The cabbage moth has a wide geographic distribution across parts of Europe and Asia ranging from about 30¬∞N to 70¬∞N in latitude. This geographic range is within the Palearctic region, which includes parts of Europe, Asia north of the Himalayan Mountains, and Africa north of the Sahara Desert. As many host plants are both endemic or domesticated in various parts of this region, the moth is able to successfully thrive in nearly all parts of this region due to local adaptation (Masaki). While the moth is generally limited to this range, there is a threat that it could be introduced to new regions through global food trade industries involving live plant imports.  Taxonomy  The cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae, should not be confused with the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) or the white cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) which share similar names but occupy different taxonomies. Mamestra brassicae belongs to the order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). Within this order, the species belongs to the clade Ditrysia, which contains 98% of the Lepidoptera species and indicates that the female has two separate openings for mating and laying eggs. The species belongs to the family Noctuidae, the second largest family in Lepidoptera. Within this family, the cabbage moth falls within the subfamily Hadeninae. The genus Mamestra is home to many pest species and has a global distribution. Technical description and variation B. brassicae L. (= albicolon Stph., nec Hbn., ochracea Tutt) Forewing grey-brown varied with fuscous: lines pale, dark-edged; orbicular stigma rounded, reniform large, white-spotted, or filled in with white; hindwing brownish, with a paler mark near end of vein 2. - The insect varies in opposite directions; - ab. albidilinea Haw. is a blackish form with the reniform stigma and submarginal line white, occurring occasionally in Europe as well as in Britain; ‚Äî scotochroma Rob., a local German form, is melanic, with both wings blackish, much like albidilinea, but without the white submarginal line; ‚Äî unicolor Tutt has all the markings, dark and light , more or less lost in the fuscous suffusion , the reniform edged only with whitish ; ‚Äî on the other hand andalusica Stgr. from Spain (? = straminea Failla-Ted., from Sicily and Italy) is pale grey- brown with a faint ochreous flush, darker grey in female, with all markings obscured except the 3 stigmata which are strikingly pale, with partial blackish outline, especially on their lower edge, the claviform sometimes grey; ‚Äî decolorata Stgr. from Issykkul and other localities in Central Asia is pale greyish brown, with the stigmata as in andalusica, but with the markings, especially the submarginal ones, not obsolete; ‚Äî canescens Moore from Yarkand, which I have not seen, is, judging from the figure, very close to, if not identical with, decolorata which it antedates by 10 years. Larva polyphagous, varying in ground colour from green to brown and blackish, with broad pale spiracular line; a dorsal hump on segment 11. Warren. W. in Seitz, A.

Some populations are able to fit two to three generations within one calendar year. Other populations, in less favorable climates, may have only one generation in a given year. Diapause is this species' most variable life stage, lasting anywhere from 80 days to six months if needed over the winter. = Eggs = Upon oviposition, the eggs are pale white, oblong, hemispherical, and ribbed. The eggs also develop a brown marking at their center. The egg typically measures 1.2 mm in diameter and hatch within six to ten days. = Caterpillars = thumb The caterpillar progresses through six instars of development. In the first instar, the caterpillar has a light green body with three pairs of legs along the thorax and an anal appendage at the end of the abdomen. The caterpillars remain relatively the same in color until the fourth instar, in which the dorsal region darkens. The dorsal region now appears brown while the ventral region turns yellow. There is some variability in coloring at this stage. There is also a dark stripe that appears to run down the length of the caterpillar with light yellow stripes flanking the sides. The head is a copper color. At the sixth and final instar, the head remains copper and the body and develop a dorsal hump. The total time for this larval development is four to six weeks and the final body length ranges from 40‚Äì50 mm. Larvae can be found feeding on plant leaves during the night. They are typically located on the underside of the leaves of the host plant close to the ground. Larvae are gregarious feeders in their initial stages. In the fourth instar, the larvae may disperse to the other areas of the original host plant and may migrate to other host plants. When forming into pupae, the larvae will burrow into the soil where they will remain until they emerge as adults. = Pupae = The pupae are brown and glossy. Pupae can develop once or twice during the year, with pupation typically taking place over winter. Pupae develop within cocoons that are found in the soil. The pupae are generally 20 mm long. The pupae can be found in the ground anywhere from 2‚Äì10 mm deep into the soil. = Adults = Adult moths emerge from the pupae in soil during the months of May and June. Their appearance is similar to many moths within the same family; they are gray, black, green, or brown with delicate patterning of lines and spots across the entire adult body. The forewings tend to be darker than the hindwings in color. Characteristic markings of the species include a kidney shaped spot enclosed in a white border on the forewing of the adult. There is also a thin white border that goes around the entirety of the forewing. The wingspan ranges between 34‚Äì50 mm. Adult wingspan and body size are correlated with the nutritive status of the developing moth. Curved dorsal spurs located on the tibia of the forelegs distinguish this species from others very similar to it.  Adult behavior  Adults emerge from the end of April through the beginning of June. Shortly after emerging, the adult moths mate, as discussed in more detail in the mating section. The moth is most active at night, when it flies between plants and feeds. During the day, the adult moth seeks cover under the foliage of surrounding plants.  Mating  Mating in M. brassicae occurs among recently emerged adult moths. In one controlled observation, adults began mating the first night of emergence. In this observation, mating behavior started at ten in the evening, with most mating activity occurring after midnight. Mating pairs remained associated for upwards of twelve hours, with females covering male wings with the posterior of their body during this time. The pattern of mating is as follows: = Calling position = The females initiated the mating sequence. She does so by calling for the male which entails positioning her antennae forward, raising her wings horizontally, and flapping her wings quickly. If there is no male response to this call, the female relocates and repeats the calling behavior until she is able to successfully attract a male mate. = Reaction of the male = Upon hearing the call of the female, the male similarly points his antennae forward and begins to flap his wings rapidly. Then, the male takes off in flight to search for the calling female. = Approach of male = When the male locates the calling female, he approaches her and touches his antennae to her body as the first point of contact. This allows the male to confirm the identity of the calling female as belonging to the same species as itself. The male then moves towards the female and begins to flap its wings aggressively again. It then positions its abdomen towards the female's and opens his claspers to begin copulation. = Copulation = The female continues the calling as the male copulates with the female. The male must position his abdomen under the wing of the female during copulation. After copulation, the female will continue to mate. On average, a female will copulate 2.5 times.  Oviposition  The female moth lays eggs singly, but clusters many of them onto the same surface. A female may group upwards of 350 eggs together on the underside of a leaf. Females lay around 2500 eggs after copulation. Eggs are generally laid from May to June, but there is variation between populations of the moth. The eggs hatch within five to twelve days. The incubation period is highly dependent on environmental factors, mainly temperature. The incubation ranges from six days at 25 ¬∞C to 12 days at lower temperatures. Oviposition behavior has been studied comparing three different host plants: cabbage, tomatoes, and chrysanthemums. Females landed most often on tomato plants, but spent the most time on cabbage plants. Further, females were able to lay eggs more rapidly on cabbage plants and spent more time dragging their ovipositors on the leaves of the tomatoes before depositing their eggs. While the significance of these findings may not be fully understood, it demonstrates a keenness towards cabbage plants as preferred hosts for oviposition and that females must gauge host plant quality before depositing eggs on a given leaf. Preferences for plant species is also demonstrated, since few eggs were laid on chrysanthemums. Another study was conducted to understand the influence of host plant damage on the host-finding behavior of female moths. Surprisingly, female moths of this species tend to preferentially select for damaged host plants for oviposition. This finding is rather surprising given that it would be expected that females would select for undamaged plants to help her offspring avoid resource competition with whatever species had already fed on the plant. However, researchers hypothesize that this may be due to the release of volatiles, to which females are attracted.  Migration  A study of M. brassicae in East Asia demonstrated that the species is migratory. Researchers found that annual migration across a 40‚Äì60 km strait. Data also indicates that females migrate more than males, with a significantly higher proportion of captures being female compared to the population sex ratio during the months of May to September. Coupled with the finding that these migratory females had high ovarian development and mating rate during this time, researchers concluded that this migration promoted female sexual maturation prior to mating. This would allow females to mate and oviposit in their newly arrived upon territories.  As a pest  The caterpillars are particularly damaging from the first to the fourth instars. During the first three instars, the larvae feed gregariously and may skeletonize the leaves upon with they were laid and migrate to. During the fourth instar, the larvae tend to burrow into the core of many fruits, vegetables, and plants rendering them unfit to sell commercially. Further, larvae leave waste excrements on the leaves of their chosen host plants which may devalue the plant even more by transmitting fungal and bacterial infection to the plant. Because of the irreparable damage to their host plants, these moths are treated largely as pests and species control practices are undertaken by those within the agricultural industry. While there are limited means of chemically controlling the species, one method of population reduction has been the use of wasp species that parasitize the eggs of the cabbage moth. Various wasp species are known to parasitize cabbage moths at different stages of its life cycle, from egg to pupa. Controlled introduction of wasp species to fields has been able to effectively increase the rate of parasitism from just 15% to 93%, significantly reducing the population of cabbage moths in the field.

Some AHU components shown are 1 ‚Äì Supply duct 2 ‚Äì Fan compartment 3 ‚Äì Vibration isolator ('flex joint') 4 ‚Äì Heating and/or cooling coil 5 ‚Äì Filter compartment 6 ‚Äì Mixed (recirculated + outside) air duct A rooftop packaged unit or RTU An air handler, or air handling unit (often abbreviated to AHU), is a device used to regulate and circulate air as part of a heating, ventilating, and air- conditioning (HVAC) system. An air handler is usually a large metal box containing a blower, heating or cooling elements, filter racks or chambers, sound attenuators, and dampers. Air handlers usually connect to a ductwork ventilation system that distributes the conditioned air through the building and returns it to the AHU. Sometimes AHUs discharge (supply) and admit (return) air directly to and from the space served without ductwork Small air handlers, for local use, are called terminal units, and may only include an air filter, coil, and blower; these simple terminal units are called blower coils or fan coil units. A larger air handler that conditions 100% outside air, and no recirculated air, is known as a makeup air unit (MAU) or fresh air handling unit (FAHU). An air handler designed for outdoor use, typically on roofs, is known as a packaged unit (PU), heating and cooling unit (HCU), or rooftop unit (RTU). Construction The air handler is normally constructed around a framing system with metal infill panels as required to suit the configuration of the components. In its simplest form the frame may be made from metal channels or sections, with single skin metal infill panels. The metalwork is normally galvanized for long term protection. For outdoor units some form of weatherproof lid and additional sealing around joints is provided. Larger air handlers will be manufactured from a square section steel framing system with double skinned and insulated infill panels. Such constructions reduce heat loss or heat gain from the air handler, as well as providing acoustic attenuation. Larger air handlers may be several meters long and are manufactured in a sectional manner and therefore, for strength and rigidity, steel section base rails are provided under the unit. Where supply and extract air is required in equal proportions for a balanced ventilation system, it is common for the supply and extract air handlers to be joined together, either in a side-by-side or a stacked configuration. Components The major types of components are described here in approximate order, from the return duct (input to the AHU), through the unit, to the supply duct (AHU output). =Filters= diffusers and return vent (center right) Air filtration is almost always present in order to provide clean dust-free air to the building occupants. It may be via simple low-MERV pleated media, HEPA, electrostatic, or a combination of techniques. Gas-phase and ultraviolet air treatments may be employed as well. Filtration is typically placed first in the AHU in order to keep all the downstream components clean. Depending upon the grade of filtration required, typically filters will be arranged in two (or more) successive banks with a coarse-grade panel filter provided in front of a fine-grade bag filter, or other \\"final\\" filtration medium. The panel filter is cheaper to replace and maintain, and thus protects the more expensive bag filters. The life of a filter may be assessed by monitoring the pressure drop through the filter medium at design air volume flow rate. This may be done by means of a visual display using a pressure gauge, or by a pressure switch linked to an alarm point on the building control system. Failure to replace a filter may eventually lead to its collapse, as the forces exerted upon it by the fan overcome its inherent strength, resulting in collapse and thus contamination of the air handler and downstream ductwork. =Heating and/or cooling elements= Air handlers may need to provide heating, cooling, or both to change the supply air temperature, and humidity level depending on the location and the application. Such conditioning is provided by heat exchanger coils within the air handling unit air stream, such coils may be direct or indirect in relation to the medium providing the heating or cooling effect. Direct heat exchangers include those for gas-fired fuel-burning heaters or a refrigeration evaporator, placed directly in the air stream. Electric resistance heaters and heat pumps can be used as well. Evaporative cooling is possible in dry climates. Indirect coils use hot water or steam for heating, and chilled water or glycol for cooling (prime energy for heating and cooling is provided by central plant elsewhere in the building). Coils are typically manufactured from copper for the tubes, with copper or aluminium fins to aid heat transfer. Cooling coils will also employ eliminator plates to remove and drain condensate. The hot water or steam is provided by a central boiler, and the chilled water is provided by a central chiller. Downstream temperature sensors are typically used to monitor and control \\"off coil\\" temperatures, in conjunction with an appropriate motorized control valve prior to the coil. If dehumidification is required, then the cooling coil is employed to over-cool so that the dew point is reached and condensation occurs. A heater coil placed after the cooling coil re-heats the air (therefore known as a re-heat coil) to the desired supply temperature. This process has the effect of reducing the relative humidity level of the supply air. In colder climates, where winter temperatures regularly drop below freezing, then frost coils or pre-heat coils are often employed as a first stage of air treatment to ensure that downstream filters or chilled water coils are protected against freezing. The control of the frost coil is such that if a certain off-coil air temperature is not reached then the entire air handler is shut down for protection. =Humidifier= Humidification is often necessary in colder climates where continuous heating will make the air drier, resulting in uncomfortable air quality and increased static electricity. Various types of humidification may be used: *Evaporative: dry air blown over a reservoir will evaporate some of the water. The rate of evaporation can be increased by spraying the water onto baffles in the air stream. *Vaporizer: steam or vapor from a boiler is blown directly into the air stream. *Spray mist: water is diffused either by a nozzle or other mechanical means into fine droplets and carried by the air. *Ultrasonic: A tray of fresh water in the airstream is excited by an ultrasonic device forming a fog or water mist. *Wetted medium: A fine fibrous medium in the airstream is kept moist with fresh water from a header pipe with a series of small outlets. As the air passes through the medium it entrains the water in fine droplets. This type of humidifier can quickly clog if the primary air filtration is not maintained in good order. =Mixing chamber= In order to maintain indoor air quality, air handlers commonly have provisions to allow the introduction of outside air into, and the exhausting of air from the building. In temperate climates, mixing the right amount of cooler outside air with warmer return air can be used to approach the desired supply air temperature. A mixing chamber is therefore used which has dampers controlling the ratio between the return, outside, and exhaust air. =Blower/fan= Air handlers typically employ a large squirrel cage blower driven by an AC induction electric motor to move the air. The blower may operate at a single speed, offer a variety of set speeds, or be driven by a variable-frequency drive to allow a wide range of air flow rates. Flow rate may also be controlled by inlet vanes or outlet dampers on the fan. Some residential air handlers in USA (central \\"furnaces\\" or \\"air conditioners\\") use a brushless DC electric motor that has variable speed capabilities. Air handlers in Europe and Australia and New Zealand now commonly use backward curve fans without scroll or \\"plug fans\\". These are driven using high efficiency EC (electronically commutated) motors with built in speed control. Multiple blowers may be present in large commercial air handling units, typically placed at the end of the AHU and the beginning of the supply ductwork (therefore also called \\"supply fans\\"). They are often augmented by fans in the return air duct (\\"return fans\\") pushing the air into the AHU. =Balancing= Un-balanced fans wobble and vibrate. For home AC fans, this can be a major problem: air circulation is greatly reduced at the vents (as wobble is lost energy), efficiency is compromised, and noise is increased. Another major problem in fans that are not balanced is longevity of the bearings (attached to the fan and shaft) is compromised. This can cause failure to occur long before the bearings life expectancy. Weights can be strategically placed to correct for a smooth spin (for a ceiling fan, trial and error placement typically resolves the problem). Home / central AC fans or other big fans are typically taken to shops, which have special balancers for more complicated balancing (trial and error can cause damage before the correct points are found). The fan motor itself does not typically vibrate. =Heat recovery device= A heat recovery device heat exchanger may be fitted to the air handler between supply and extract airstreams for energy savings and increasing capacity. These types more commonly include for: * Recuperator, or Plate Heat exchanger: A sandwich of plastic or metal plates with interlaced air paths. Heat is transferred between airstreams from one side of the plate to the other. The plates are typically spaced at 4 to 6mm apart. Heat recovery efficiency up to 70%. * Thermal Wheel, or Rotary heat exchanger: A slowly rotating matrix of finely corrugated metal, operating in both opposing airstreams. When the air handling unit is in heating mode, heat is absorbed as air passes through the matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and released during the second half rotation into the supply airstream in a continuous process. When the air handling unit is in cooling mode, heat is released as air passes through the matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and absorbed during the second half rotation into the supply airstream. Heat recovery efficiency up to 85%. Wheels are also available with a hydroscopic coating to provide latent heat transfer and also the drying or humidification of airstreams. * Run around coil: Two air to liquid heat exchanger coils, in opposing airstreams, piped together with a circulating pump and using water or a brine as the heat transfer medium. This device, although not very efficient, allows heat recovery between remote and sometimes multiple supply and exhaust airstreams. Heat recovery efficiency up to 50%. * Heat Pipe: Operating in both opposing air paths, using a confined refrigerant as a heat transfer medium. The heat pipe uses multiple sealed pipes mounted in a coil configuration with fins to increase heat transfer. Heat is absorbed on one side of the pipe, by evaporation of the refrigerant, and released at the other side, by condensation of the refrigerant. Condensed refrigerant flows by gravity to the first side of the pipe to repeat the process. Heat recovery efficiency up to 65%. =Controls= Controls are necessary to regulate every aspect of an air handler, such as: flow rate of air, supply air temperature, mixed air temperature, humidity, air quality. They may be as simple as an off/on thermostat or as complex as a building automation system using BACnet or LonWorks, for example. Common control components include temperature sensors, humidity sensors, sail switches, actuators, motors, and controllers. =Vibration isolators= The blowers in an air handler can create substantial vibration and the large area of the duct system would transmit this noise and vibration to the occupants of the building. To avoid this, vibration isolators (flexible sections) are normally inserted into the duct immediately before and after the air handler and often also between the fan compartment and the rest of the AHU. The rubberized canvas-like material of these sections allows the air handler components to vibrate without transmitting this motion to the attached ducts. The fan compartment can be further isolated by placing it on spring suspension, neoprene pads, or hung on spring hangers, which will mitigate the transfer of vibration through the structure. =Sound Attenuators= The blower in the air handler also generates noise, which should be attenuated before ductwork enters a noise-sensitive room. To achieve meaningful noise reduction in a relatively short length, a sound attenuator is used. The attenuator is a specialty duct accessory that typically consists of an inner perforated baffle with sound-absorptive insulation. Sound attenuators may take the place of ductwork; conversely, inline attenuators are located close to the blower and have a bellmouth profile to minimize system effects.

This list spans from the issue dated January 1, 1955 to the present. Prior to the creation of the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard published four weekly singles charts: \\"Best Sellers in Stores\\", \\"Most Played by Jockeys\\", \\"Most Played in Jukeboxes\\" and \\"The Top 100\\" (an early version of the Hot 100). The Hot 100 began with the issue dated August 9, 1958, and is currently the standard music popularity chart in the United States. List inclusions *All acts are listed alphabetically, solo artists by last name, groups by group name excluding \\"A\\", \\"An\\", and \\"The\\". *Each act's total of number-one hits is shown after their name. *All artists who are officially namechecked in song credits are listed here; this includes one-time pairings of otherwise solo artists and those appearing as \\"featuring\\". Exceptions to this rule: # Paul McCartney's hits with Wings are credited to \\"Wings\\" even though many of them were released as \\"Paul McCartney & Wings\\". McCartney's total is only from hits not attributed to Wings nor the Beatles. If entries from The Beatles, Wings and McCartney were combined, his total of number one hits would be 29, making him the most successful artist in the history of the chart. # Diana Ross, as some number-one hits credited to \\"Diana Ross and the Supremes\\", are attributed to The Supremes only. If Ross's solo entries here were combined with those of The Supremes, it would bring her total of number one hits to 18, tying her with Mariah Carey as most successful female artist in the history of the chart. # \\"That's What Friends Are For\\" charted as \\"Dionne & Friends\\". All vocalists on the recording (Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder) are given credit for a number-one song. * Both Wham! and George Michael get one credit for \\"Careless Whisper\\". Technically the song is a solo recording and was released as such in many parts of the world except the U.S., where it charted as \\"Wham! featuring George Michael\\". * \\"We Are the World\\" is credited to \\"USA for Africa\\", and not the individual artists who participated in the recording. *Double A-sides are counted as one number-one single. *Artists associated with a group who reached number one, yet have their own solo page in Wikipedia, are not listed here unless they hit number one as a solo artist. *Artists who hit number one prior to the start of the Hot 100 are included here. *A song that topped multiple pre-Hot 100 charts is counted only once towards the artist's total. *The ¬∞ symbol indicates that all or part of an artist's total includes number-ones occurring on any of the pre-Hot 100 chart(s) listed above (January 1, 1955 through July 28, 1958). 0-9 *21 Savage (1) *24kGoldn (1) *50 Cent (4) *6ix9ine (1) A *Aaliyah (1) *ABBA (1) *Gregory Abbott (1) *Paula Abdul (6) *Ace of Base (1) *Bryan Adams (4) *Adele (4) *Aerosmith (1) *Afrojack (1) *Christina Aguilera (5) *a-ha (1) *Clay Aiken (1) *Air Supply (1) *Akon (2) *Ali (1) *All-4-One (1) *Herb Alpert (2) *America (2) *The Angels (1) *The Animals (1) *Paul Anka (3)¬∞ *The Archies (1) *Louis Armstrong (1) *Ashanti (2) *The Association (2) *Rick Astley (2) *Atlantic Starr (1) *Patti Austin (1) *Frankie Avalon (2) *Average White Band (1) *Iggy Azalea (1) B *Baauer (1) *Bachman-Turner Overdrive (1) *Bad Bunny (1) *Bad English (1) *J Balvin (1) *Bananarama (1) *The Bangles (2) *Barenaked Ladies (1) *Toni Basil (1) *Les Baxter (2)¬∞ *Bay City Rollers (1) *The Beach Boys (4) *The Beatles (20) *Bee Gees (9) *Archie Bell & the Drells (1) *The Bellamy Brothers (1) *Regina Belle (1) *Lauren Bennett (1) *Berlin (1) *Chuck Berry (1) *Beyonc√© (7) *Justin Bieber (6) *Mr. Acker Bilk (1) *The Black Eyed Peas (3) *BLACKstreet (1) *Mary J.

The first eight editions were organized by GameParty.net. Duh-Events took over organizing CampZone in 2009. British software house Codemasters (2003-2008), Getronics PinkRoccade (2007-2008) are known for being the main sponsors of the event. Since CampZone 2012, Rabobank has been the main sponsor. Location =2001‚Äì2006= From its beginning in 2000, until 2006, CampZone was held on the festival grounds surrounding the Walibi World amusement park. These grounds were originally created to accommodate the 18th World Scout Jamboree. Since then the terrain has been used for several large-scale events, such as the annual Lowlands music festival. These fields are fully drained, so they could be used for camping in the relatively wet Dutch climate. The festival grounds are subdivided into smaller fields separated by a thin treeline. CampZone used two of these fields: one for entry, car parking and sports activities, the other for the event itself. The fields used are approximately , about nine soccer fields in size. Due to the nearby presence of a hostel for terminally ill children (the Colombinehuis), strict rules pertaining to sound were enforced during the event. The sections of the field used during CampZone nearest to this hostel were reserved for participants generating only moderate noise levels. People bringing sound systems capable of generating over 100 watts of output were required to use the sections of the field furthest away from the Colombinehuis. =2007‚Äì2015= In 2007 CampZone moved to Oirschot, near Eindhoven, the Netherlands. This is easily accessible from Eindhoven Airport, to draw more visitors from outside the Netherlands. The new location received a lot of criticism, due to the bad road leading to it and because the extreme amounts of rainwater did not drain well during CampZone 2007. The 2009 and 2010 editions of the event continued the success of the previous editions, although the organization of the events was more difficult than before due to the financial crisis. Over time the event changed from an outdoor LAN party to something more like a festival. This change is mostly visible in the growing amount of non-computer related extra activities. In the past years the organization has teamed up with the Dutch Army to provide some of those activities, which range from running obstacle courses to shooting simulations. As of 2012, CampZone has booked several music groups to play during the event. The 2013 edition featured a new field layout, to make the field more centered on the central activities field and the main-tent. The parking was moved further from the main road to make it less accessible for non-visitors.

The basic structure of the CampZone organisation is as follows: * Main organisation (5 persons), responsible for the event. They are addressed with all problems and take care of agendas, structure, information etc. ** Network team (9 persons since the formation of the Campzone Community Network team, CCN), responsible for the network. ** Server team (6 persons), responsible for the servers and services needed for a network. ** Webteam (‚âà10 persons), responsible for the intranet and internet site. They also maintain order on the sites. ** Competitions team (8 persons), responsible for gaming competitions during the event. ** Activities team (9 persons), responsible for extra activities during the event, such as sports. ** Power team (4 persons), responsible for the power at CampZone. They take care of the power, the power- distribution, monitoring of the power and mainly all heavy machinery. They also take care of the sanitary (warm showers, running water and such). ** Field admins (30 persons), administer the giving out of network ports and power for their field, and keep directly in touch with the main organisation and technical teams. They are the first to address for visitors who are experiencing problems, and make sure that only the structural or global problems reach the main organisation or technical teams. ** Main security (3 persons), responsible for security. They make sure security runs in shifts, problems are swiftly addressed and global order and rules are maintained. They make the final decisions when problems occur. *** security (20 persons), voluntary visitors who see to safety and order on the event. They work in shifts and keep notes of events and troubles. ** First aid (7 persons), responsible for applying first aid to visitors who need it. ** Gate-crew (10 persons), watching the gate of the event. They also upgrade payment cards, a money system Campzone uses so visitors do not have to go around carrying real money. ** Casemod-crew, supervise the casemodding on CampZone. Casemodding is quite popular among LAN party visitors, but since it uses dangerous tools and machinery, CampZone supplies with a special section for this practise. Four people supervise this, helping the visitors who are modifying their cases, but also making sure that it is done safely to prevent injuries and broken computer parts. Network Until CampZone 7, the network was based around a central high-speed glass fiber switch, with cables to sub-switches on each field. Those field switches are operated and supervised by the field admins for that particular field. Connected computers needed to manually configure a fixed IP address for the network. The core of the network, as well as many servers brought by visitors, resided in the Network Heardquarters (NHQ), a temporary air-conditioned building. Wireless network access and Internet were also available at CampZone 7 (although limited). For the next edition, an entirely new network has been designed. The new network is a routed network. Each field gets its own high-speed switch (HP Procure 9300 series) which are interconnected using 8 to 20 gigabit links. Every end-user switch has its own subnet so that network issues remain local problems and do not affect the entire network, as well as limiting unneeded broadcast traffic. Also, DHCP is used, removing the need to manually configure IP addresses. In order to allow for certain types of broadcast traffic, a custom-built system is used that relays certain packets (such as gameserver discovery packets) across the entire network. In addition, thanks to the high speeds at which fields are connected, every participant can use gigabit ethernet to connect their own PC to the network. Previously gigabit connections were available in few numbers and reserved for people who shared the link with several others. Altogether this should prove for a much more advanced, faster, more stable network. Power Since there is no normal power source at the location of CampZone, the power has to be generated there. The entire event greatly depends on trustworthy stable power, because computers and other hardware can very easily damage when the current fluctuates, or is not properly aligned or consequent. Some power usage facts of CampZone 7 (2007): ** 4x 250 kVA generators, which are linked together. ** The generators were configured so that the next one automatically starts when the other ones are at 80% capacity. ** 30.000 litre (7925 US gallon) diesel was used by the generators. ** A total of about 250 16 amp groups available for visitors (each shared by ‚âà5 people). ** power cable in various diameters. Competitions and activities During the event, many official and unofficial competitions are held. The official PC competitions are organized by the CampZone crew. All official competitions offer prizes for at least the winner, most of which are provided by sponsors. The official outdoor competitions are organized by the activities team of Duh-Events. Most competitions are announced long before the start of the event, but some outdoor competitions are announced during the event. Examples of outdoor competitions held during previous editions of CampZone are riding a mechanical bull and playing soccer on a field of soap. Unofficial competitions can be organized by visitors and vary from playing old-fashioned board or card games, to sports and a \\"strongest man\\" competition. Notable groups on CampZone The following groups are amongst the biggest on CampZone. They vary from 10 to 30+ people in each group. * Better than the Devil * Clan Badjas * Feestjuh Online * Fus1on * HMO * LAM * LDT * New Army on the Block * Tent Jeroen * Tweakers @ Campzone * WallyLan * Clan Trappist * Thor  References  External links *Official CampZone website (Dutch/English) *Official GameParty website (Dutch) *Official Duh-Events website (Dutch) *Official video channel CC-TV.nl (Dutch) Category:LAN parties Category:Culture of North Brabant Category:Dronten Category:Oirschot ","title":"Campzone"},{"id":"2369718","text":"Frederic Charles Smerlas (born April 8, 1957) is a former American football nose tackle who was a five-time NFL Pro Bowl selection during a 14-year career as a nose tackle with the Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots. Smerlas, of Greek-American descent, graduated from Waltham High School in 1975, where he was a star football player and wrestler. He became a defensive lineman for Boston College before embarking on an NFL career. Smerlas' 1990 autobiography, By a Nose, recounts his 11 years with the Bills and their climb from cellar-dwellers to Super Bowl contenders. Smerlas currently resides in Massachusetts and is a part-time co-host during football season on sports radio WEEI-FM, NBC Sports Boston - The New England Tailgate Show, as well as a contributor to western New York radio station WHAM (AM) in Rochester. In 2018, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Smerlas to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2018 Fred & Steve's Steakhouse Smerlas, along with friend and colleague Steve DeOssie, opened an award-winning steakhouse at the Twin River Casino in Lincoln, Rhode Island in March 2007 called Fred & Steve's Steakhouse.

It states that reasonable efforts to minimise potential risks should be taken when the actual magnitude of the risks is unknown. The principle was proposed by Prof. Granger Morgan of Carnegie Mellon University in 1989 in the context of electromagnetic radiation safety (in particular, fields produced by power lines). A report for the Office of Technology Assessment of the US Congress described prudent avoidance of power line fields as: The principle has been adopted in a number of countries, for example Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Australia and New Zealand. While not adopted by any regulatory body at the national level in the USA, the principle has been adopted in some form by a number of local regulatory bodies, for example the public utility commissions in California, Colorado, Connecticut and Hawaii. The Colorado Public Commission states: The prudent avoidance principle is seen as a better alternative than other proposed approaches to risk management, such as ALARP, because it makes reasonable efforts to reduce possible risk without creating a specific numeric standard that is not supported by strong scientific evidence.

Freeth was referred to in his day as the first white person to become expert at wave surfing. He and fellow Hawaiian surfer Duke Kahanamoku introduced the sport to the United States.  Biography  Freeth was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1883, his mother was part-Hawaiian while his father, George Freeth Sr., was an Irish sea captain. Further information taken from various descendants mentions that his mother was Elizabeth Kailikapuolono Green, daughter of William Lothian Green and Elizabeth \\"Lepeka\\" Kahalaunani, a Hawaiian woman. Lepeka also conceived three daughters with Archibald Cleghorn, a well-known businessman of Honolulu. Cleghorn later fathered the well-known Princess Kaiulani with Hawaiian royalty Miriam Likelike, a sister to King David Kalakaua and Queen Liliuokalani. While vacationing in Hawaii, industrialist Henry Huntington, saw Freeth surfing and quickly brought him to Redondo Beach, California in 1907 as an attraction showing off \\"the man who walked on water\\". According to the 1910 Census, Freeth rented a room at 106 Pacific Avenue in Redondo Beach. Freeth died at the age of 35 as a result of the global flu pandemic in 1919 while living and working in San Diego. According to his draft registration card a year earlier, Freeth was living at 1940 Abbott Street in San Diego and working as a lifeguard for the City of San Diego. Upon his death, he was buried in Oahu Cemetery in a grave with his sibling, A.R. Freeth.  Lifeguard contributions  Freeth is credited by some with developing the rescue paddleboard and the rescue can, tools commonly used by lifeguards. However, the United States Lifesaving Association asserts that the rescue can was designed by Captain Henry Sheffield in 1897. In 1910, Freeth was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for rescuing seven fishermen off Venice Beach during a winter storm in December 1908. The obverse of the medal shows rescuers in a small, storm- tossed boat pulling a man from the water, and the legend reads: UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACT OF CONGRESS JUNE 20, 1874 The legend on the reverse reads: IN TESTIMONY OF HEROIC DEEDS IN SAVING LIFE FROM THE PERILS OF THE SEA And in the reverse center is inscribed: TO GEORGE FREETH FOR HEROICALLY RESCUING SEVEN FISHER-MEN  Theft of bust  On August 7, 2008, it was reported that a bronze bust of Freeth was stolen from the Redondo Beach Pier where it was on display. Police had no leads at the time, but suspected that the bust was stolen to be sold for scrap metal because of its copper content. On November 7, 2010, George Freeth's bust was replaced in Redondo Beach, CA. Freeth's life and his contributions to surfing and lifeguarding is a significant part of the documentary film Waveriders.

Examples of hyperoartians from early in their fossil record are Endeiolepis and Euphanerops (which possessed a calcified branchial basket), fish-like animals with hypocercal tails that lived during the Late Devonian Period. Some paleontologists still place these forms among the \\"ostracoderms\\" (jawless armored fishes) of the class Anaspida, but this is increasingly considered an artificial arrangement based on ancestral traits. Placement of this group among the jawless vertebrates is a matter of dispute. While today enough fossil diversity is known to make a close relationship among the \\"ostracoderms\\" unlikely, this has muddied the issue of the Hyperoartia's closest relatives. Traditionally the group was placed in a superclass Cyclostomata together with the Myxini (hagfishes). More recently, it has been proposed that the Myxini are more basal among the skull- bearing chordates, while the Hyperoartia are retained among vertebrates. But even though this may be correct, the lampreys represent one of the oldest divergences of the vertebrate lineage, and whether they are better united with some \\"ostracoderms\\" in the Cephalaspidomorphi, or not closer to these than to e.g. to other \\"ostracoderms\\" of the Pteraspidomorphi, or even the long-extinct conodonts, is still to be resolved. Even the very existence of the class Hyperoartia is disputed, with some analyses favoring a treatment of the \\"basal Hyperoartia\\" as a monophyletic lineage Jamoytiiformes that may in fact be very close to the ancestral jawed vertebrates. The only hyperoartians surviving today are lampreys, classified in the Petromyzontiformes. The discovery of the fossil Priscomyzon pushed back the oldest known occurrence of true lampreys to the Late Devonian. The evidence of phylogeny, however, suggests the lamprey lineage diverged much earlier from other vertebrates, rather than arising from among the \\"ostracoderms\\". The origin of Hyperoartia may therefore extend back to the early Paleozoic, if not earlier.

The Victory Arch was established as a memorial to those who served in the American armed forces during periods of war. It is located on 25th Street and West Avenue in downtown Newport News, near the Jessie M. Rattley Municipal Center.  Building the arch  Newport News served as a Port of Embarkation for the American armed forces during World War I. Following the Armistice, almost half a million American troops were set to return to America via the ports of the city. Public desire to build an arch was high, mimicking the erection of similar arches elsewhere in the country. While many wished the structure to be permanent, the rate at which soldiers were already returning made this unfeasible. It was then decided to build a temporary arch, and to revisit the idea of a permanent arch at a later date. Funding was achieved through public subscription drives, and work on the arch began quickly. The original building was hollow - the framework was made of brick and wood, with stucco making up the exterior. The arch was completed (mostly with volunteer labor) in April 1919. As troops returned to American soil, they were marched under the arch. Initial crowds were small, but with the help of the city's Welcome Home Committee, soon every ship full of soldiers was met by a large crowd of local citizens.  Maintenance of temporary edifice  The structure as built in 1919 was not expected to stand for more than two years -- the time it would take for Newport News to see its last returning soldier. The arch ended up standing for over forty years. During that period, the City Council for Newport News ended up appropriating more money for maintenance of the arch -- approximately seven thousand dollars -- than it took to build it originally. Although Newport News served as a Port of Embarkation again during World War II, returning troops did not march under the arch, in part because of its fragile condition. The arch also suffered from the development of the city around it. The area became subject to commercial development, so much so that at one point each side of the arch sat on the property of a different gas station. Passersby were subject to falling stucco and dangers from the traffic pattern surrounding the arch that made it into a 50-foot tall blind spot. Parts of the structure began to collapse after rotting through.  A new, permanent structure  Calls to replace the \\"temporary\\" monument with a more permanent structure came almost immediately. Attempts at securing federal funding to construct a new arch proved unsuccessful. As a committee of veterans and volunteers began to make fund- raising plans, there was some concern from others in the community that they were attempting to replace a \\"dead monument,\\" and that a park, civic center, school, or hospital would prove to be more functional and useful to the city's citizens. Despite these protests, the necessary funds were collected to complete the new arch, made of stone, and it was rededicated on May 30, 1962. On Memorial Day, 1969, an eternal flame was donated by the American Legion to the arch site. Standing fourteen feet high the eternal flame which sits under the arch was cast in bronze by Womack Foundry, Inc. (of Newport News) in the 1960s, and was hand crafted by the Foundry's founder and president, Ernest D. Womack.  Eternal flame controversy  In 1973, the flame that had been established was ordered to be turned off by then-City Manager William Lawson. The call to extinguish the flame came during the oil shortage of that year. As one would expect, this met with severe criticism and protest, especially from veterans' groups. The solution provided by the city was to replace the flame with a flashing light, which has been described as looking \\"absurd.\\" The flame remained unlit until Memorial Day, 1978. The flame was threatened again the next year, when the new City Manager, Frank Smiley, was looking for ways to cut expenses. The flame's cost (five hundred dollars per month) was seen as a potential savings. Eventually, a compromise was reached, and a new fuel line that burned less gas was installed. The bill was reduced to sixty-five dollars a month. This led Charlie Covington, the city treasurer, to remark, \\"Since there are 670 names on Victory Arch plaques, that works out to about one third of a penny per day per person. I'd hate like hell to come back and look down and see Smiley has cut off the flame for a third of a penny per day per person.\\"  Further reading  * * Category:Buildings and structures in Newport News, Virginia Category:Tourist attractions in Newport News, Virginia Category:Monuments and memorials in Virginia Category:1919 sculptures Category:1919 establishments in Virginia Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1919 Category:1962 sculptures Category:1962 establishments in Virginia Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1962 Category:Stucco sculptures Category:Stone sculptures in Virginia Category:Triumphal arches in the United States ","title":"Newport News Victory Arch"},{"id":"2369847","text":"Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson (born 19 March 1967), known internationally as Thor Bjorgolfsson, and colloquially in Iceland as Bj√∂ggi, is an Icelandic businessman and entrepreneur, and former chairman of Straumur-Bur√∞ar√°s and chairman of Novator Partners.

Bravo Brewery became the fastest-growing brewery in Russia at the time, primarily through the production of the premium beer Botchkarov. Heineken bought the brewery for $325m in 2002. (citing a maximum of $400m for the transaction). In 2000, Russia opened an honorary consulate in Iceland. Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson was appointed Consul and Magn√∫s √ûorsteinsson was appointed Honorary Vice-Consul. The opening ceremony was held on March 10, 2000.

Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor chronicles his time in St Petersburg, detailing how criminal elements tried to intimidate him into giving them access to his business and explaining which security measures he relied on to prevent them from doing so.  Businesses in Iceland  After leaving Russia, Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor started investing in several Icelandic firms in 2002. By 2006, he was a celebrity for his business success, with an eight-page-long profile in the Sunday supplement of the Icelandic newspaper Morgunbla√∞i√∞ written about him. Novator Partners Novator Partners, which was founded and is managed by Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor, is a private equity firm with headquarters in London and offices in Luxembourg. Preferring to take a board seat in its portfolio companies, the firm tends to invest in companies in the telecommunications, generic pharmaceuticals, information technology, natural resources, and financial services sectors. Landsbanki Late in 2002, Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor and Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Gu√∞mundsson's holding company Samson ehf. gained a 45% controlling share of Landsbanki, Iceland's second largest bank, for about ISK12m in a controversial privatization. The board was announced in February 2003, with the chairman being Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor's father.Gu√∞mundur Magn√∫sson, Thorsararnir: au√∞ur ‚Äì v√∂ld ‚Äì √∂rl√∂g (Reykjav√≠k: Almenna b√≥kaf√©lagi√∞, 2005), p. 354 Straumur Investment Bank Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor was the main owner as well as the chairman of the Straumur Investment Bank. = Financial crisis = Two of Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson's companies, Landsbanki and Straumur, went bankrupt following the 2008‚Äì11 Icelandic financial crisis and the government of Iceland decided to assume responsibility for the banks. He has been heavily criticized for his actions leading to the crisis. However, he has claimed that he urged the government of Iceland not to take over the bank and that he did his utmost to prevent Icelanders and the state of Iceland from having to assume responsibility. He also has asserted that as a large shareholder in a bank, one does not have as much influence as many believe and that it is the job of the bank's management and board to formulate good policy. He said that he was not a member of the board or a managing director of the bank and that his policy suggestions were ignored by the government of Iceland. Two days after the publication of the Icelandic government report on the financial crisis on 12 April 2010, Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson issued a public apology in the Icelandic newspaper, Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞, for his role in the crisis: > I the undersigned, Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor, request forgiveness from all Icelanders > for my role in the asset- and debt-bubble that led to the collapse of the > Icelandic banking system. I request your forgiveness for my complacency > towards the danger signs which arose. I request forgiveness for having not > succeeded in following my instincts when I realised the danger. I request > your forgiveness. = Business after the crisis = Although Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor's fortunes were reduced by the financial crisis, leading him to cancel the construction of a ¬£100m luxury yacht, he has continued to prosper overall. He has defended his reputation by disputing government and journalistic criticisms of his role in the 2008 financial crisis on his website, through letters to newspapers, and through legal action. In December 2013, the website \\"The Automatic Earth\\" reported: Mr Bjorgolfsson still leads Novator Partners, a London-based investment firm, sits on several boards and holds shares in companies including Actavis, a Swiss drugmaker, and CCP, an Icelandic computer games company. His representative says any dividends from his shares, or future gains from their sale, will go towards settling debts to creditors following Landsbanki's decline. In 2015, Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor and his father were mentioned in the Panama Papers as having connections to at least 50 offshore companies in tax havens established through Mossack Fonseca. In November 2017, Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor was named in the Paradise Papers together with G√≠sli Hj√°lmt√Ωsson, R√≥bert Gu√∞finnsson, and a number of Iceland's National Power Company employees. The listed companies connected to Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson were registered in Bermuda. Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor was one of the lead investors in Atai Life Sciences AG's 2018 funding rounds. Atai Life is a healthcare investment firm that backs studies of magic mushrooms to treat depression. According to a Bloomberg report, the round Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor participated in raised $25 million. = Appearances in popular culture = Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson is the inspiration for the main character of Bjarni Har√∞arson's satirical novel about the 2008‚Äì11 Icelandic financial crisis, Sigur√∞ar saga f√≥ts: √çslensk riddarasaga, where his counterpart is the main character, Sigur√∞ur frits ('f√≥tur') Bjarnh√©√∞insson. He is also the inspiration for the main character of Bjarni Bjarnason's novel Mannor√∞ ('reputation'), Starka√∞ur Lev√≠, who pays for the identity (and the life) of a well respected writer.

More generally in harmonic analysis, Bochner's theorem asserts that under Fourier transform a continuous positive-definite function on a locally compact abelian group corresponds to a finite positive measure on the Pontryagin dual group. The theorem for locally compact abelian groups Bochner's theorem for a locally compact abelian group G, with dual group \\\\widehat{G}, says the following: Theorem For any normalized continuous positive-definite function f on G (normalization here means that f is 1 at the unit of G), there exists a unique probability measure Œº on \\\\widehat{G} such that : f(g) = \\\\int_{\\\\widehat{G}} \\\\xi(g) \\\\,d\\\\mu(\\\\xi), i.e. f is the Fourier transform of a unique probability measure Œº on \\\\widehat{G}. Conversely, the Fourier transform of a probability measure on \\\\widehat{G} is necessarily a normalized continuous positive-definite function f on G. This is in fact a one-to-one correspondence. The Gelfand‚ÄìFourier transform is an isomorphism between the group C*-algebra C*(G) and C0(GÃÇ). The theorem is essentially the dual statement for states of the two abelian C*-algebras. The proof of the theorem passes through vector states on strongly continuous unitary representations of G (the proof in fact shows that every normalized continuous positive-definite function must be of this form). Given a normalized continuous positive- definite function f on G, one can construct a strongly continuous unitary representation of G in a natural way: Let F0(G) be the family of complex- valued functions on G with finite support, i.e. h(g) = 0 for all but finitely many g. The positive-definite kernel K(g1, g2) = f(g1 ‚àí g2) induces a (possibly degenerate) inner product on F0(G). Quotiening out degeneracy and taking the completion gives a Hilbert space : (\\\\mathcal{H}, \\\\langle \\\\cdot, \\\\cdot\\\\rangle_f), whose typical element is an equivalence class [h]. For a fixed g in G, the \\"shift operator\\" Ug defined by (Ug)(h) (g') = h(g ‚àí g), for a representative of [h], is unitary. So the map : g \\\\mapsto U_g is a unitary representations of G on (\\\\mathcal{H}, \\\\langle \\\\cdot, \\\\cdot\\\\rangle_f). By continuity of f, it is weakly continuous, therefore strongly continuous. By construction, we have : \\\\langle U_g [e], [e] \\\\rangle_f = f(g), where [e] is the class of the function that is 1 on the identity of G and zero elsewhere. But by Gelfand‚ÄìFourier isomorphism, the vector state \\\\langle \\\\cdot [e], [e] \\\\rangle_f on C*(G) is the pull-back of a state on C_0(\\\\widehat{G}), which is necessarily integration against a probability measure Œº. Chasing through the isomorphisms then gives : \\\\langle U_g [e], [e] \\\\rangle_f = \\\\int_{\\\\widehat{G}} \\\\xi(g) \\\\,d\\\\mu(\\\\xi). On the other hand, given a probability measure Œº on \\\\widehat{G}, the function : f(g) = \\\\int_{\\\\widehat{G}} \\\\xi(g) \\\\,d\\\\mu(\\\\xi) is a normalized continuous positive-definite function. Continuity of f follows from the dominated convergence theorem. For positive-definiteness, take a nondegenerate representation of C_0(\\\\widehat{G}). This extends uniquely to a representation of its multiplier algebra C_b(\\\\widehat{G}) and therefore a strongly continuous unitary representation Ug. As above we have f given by some vector state on Ug : f(g) = \\\\langle U_g v, v \\\\rangle, therefore positive- definite. The two constructions are mutual inverses.  Special cases  Bochner's theorem in the special case of the discrete group Z is often referred to as Herglotz's theorem (see Herglotz representation theorem) and says that a function f on Z with f(0) = 1 is positive-definite if and only if there exists a probability measure Œº on the circle T such that : f(k) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{T}} e^{-2 \\\\pi i k x} \\\\,d\\\\mu(x). Similarly, a continuous function f on R with f(0) = 1 is positive-definite if and only if there exists a probability measure Œº on R such that : f(t) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}} e^{-2 \\\\pi i \\\\xi t} \\\\,d\\\\mu(\\\\xi). Applications In statistics, Bochner's theorem can be used to describe the serial correlation of certain type of time series. A sequence of random variables \\\\\\\\{f_n\\\\\\\\} of mean 0 is a (wide-sense) stationary time series if the covariance : \\\\operatorname{Cov}(f_n, f_m) only depends on n ‚àí m. The function : g(n - m) = \\\\operatorname{Cov}(f_n, f_m) is called the autocovariance function of the time series. By the mean zero assumption, : g(n - m) = \\\\langle f_n, f_m \\\\rangle, where ‚ü®‚ãÖ, ‚ãÖ‚ü© denotes the inner product on the Hilbert space of random variables with finite second moments. It is then immediate that g is a positive-definite function on the integers ‚Ñ§. By Bochner's theorem, there exists a unique positive measure Œº on [0, 1] such that : g(k) = \\\\int e^{-2 \\\\pi i k x} \\\\,d\\\\mu(x). This measure Œº is called the spectral measure of the time series. It yields information about the \\"seasonal trends\\" of the series. For example, let z be an m-th root of unity (with the current identification, this is 1/m ‚àà [0, 1]) and f be a random variable of mean 0 and variance 1. Consider the time series \\\\\\\\{z^n f\\\\\\\\}. The autocovariance function is : g(k) = z^k. Evidently, the corresponding spectral measure is the Dirac point mass centered at z. This is related to the fact that the time series repeats itself every m periods. When g has sufficiently fast decay, the measure Œº is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and its Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative f is called the spectral density of the time series. When g lies in ‚Ñì1(‚Ñ§), f is the Fourier transform of g.  See also  * Positive-definite function on a group * Characteristic function (probability theory) References * * M.

It measured the Sagnac effect due to Earth's rotation, and thus tests the theories of special relativity and luminiferous ether along the rotating frame of Earth. Experiment The aim, as it was first proposed by Albert A. Michelson in 1904 and then executed in 1925, was to find out whether the rotation of the Earth has an effect on the propagation of light in the vicinity of the Earth. The Michelson-Gale experiment was a very large ring interferometer, (a perimeter of 1.9 kilometer), large enough to detect the angular velocity of the Earth. Like the original Michelson-Morley experiment, the Michelson-Gale- Pearson version compared the light from a single source (carbon arc) after travelling in two directions. The major change was to replace the two \\"arms\\" of the original MM version with two rectangles, one much larger than the other. Light was sent into the rectangles, reflecting off mirrors at the corners, and returned to the starting point. Light exiting the two rectangles was compared on a screen just as the light returning from the two arms would be in a standard MM experiment. The expected fringe shift in accordance with the stationary aether and special relativity was given by Michelson as: :\\\\Delta=\\\\frac{4A\\\\omega\\\\sin\\\\phi}{\\\\lambda c} where \\\\Delta is the displacement in fringes, A the area in square kilometers, \\\\phi the latitude (41¬∞ 46'), c the speed of light, \\\\omega the angular velocity of Earth, \\\\lambda the effective wavelength used. In other words, this experiment was aimed to detect the Sagnac effect due to Earth's rotation. Result The outcome of the experiment was that the angular velocity of the Earth as measured by astronomy was confirmed to within measuring accuracy. The ring interferometer of the Michelson-Gale experiment was not calibrated by comparison with an outside reference (which was not possible, because the setup was fixed to the Earth). From its design it could be deduced where the central interference fringe ought to be if there would be zero shift. The measured shift was 230 parts in 1000, with an accuracy of 5 parts in 1000. The predicted shift was 237 parts in 1000. According to Michelson/Gale, the experiment is compatible with both the idea of a stationary ether and special relativity. As it was already pointed out by Michelson in 1904, a positive result in such experiments contradicts the hypothesis of complete aether drag, as the spinning surface of the Earth experiences an aether wind. The Michelson-Morley experiment shows on the contrary that Earth fully drags the aether in its orbital motion, resulting in a null aether wind opposite the orbital speed. Those two results are not incompatible per se, but in the absence of a model to reconcile them, they are more adhoc than the explanation of both experiments within special relativity.Georg Joos: Lehrbuch der theoretischen Physik. 12. edition, 1959, page 448 The experiment is consistent with relativity for the same reason as all other Sagnac type experiments (see Sagnac effect). That is, rotation is absolute in special relativity, because there is no inertial frame of reference in which the whole device is at rest during the complete process of rotation, thus the light paths of the two rays are different in all of those frames, consequently a positive result must occur. It's also possible to define rotating frames in special relativity (Born coordinates), yet in those frames the speed of light is not constant in extended areas any more, thus also in this view a positive result must occur. Today, Sagnac type effects due to Earth's rotation are routinely incorporated into GPS.

Geography The Cadusii lived in Cadusia ‚Äì a mountainous district of Media Atropatene on the south-west shores of the Caspian Sea, between the parallels of 39¬∞ and 37¬∞ North latitude. This district was probably bounded on the North by the river Cyrus (today Kura, in the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan, historically known as Arran and Caucasian Albania), and on the South by the river Mardus (today Sefid River), and corresponds with the modern Iranian provinces of Gilan and Ardabil. They are described by Strabo as a warlike tribe of mountaineers, fighting chiefly on foot, and well skilled in the use of the short spear or javelin. It is possible that the name of the Gelae (Gilites) ‚Äì a tribe who are constantly associated with the Cadusii, to the point of considering the former the national name for the Cadusii ‚Äì has been preserved in the modern Gilan. No mention of the Cadusii has been found in Caucasian or Middle Eastern sources, and they are known only through Greek and Latin sources. History =Before the Persian Empire= They appear to have constantly been at war with their neighbours. First subjected by the Assyrians, if we believe to Diodorus' doubtful sources, they were then brought in at least nominal subjection to the Medes, until they rebelled at the time of the king of the Medes Artaeus. In Ctesias' tale (reported by Diodorus) the war originated from an offence the king gave to an able powerful Persian, called Parsodes. After the offence Parsodes retired himself in the Cadusii's land with a small force and he attached himself with the most powerful of the local lords by offering his sister in marriage to him. At this point the country, who was subject to at least a nominal subjugation to the Medes, rebelled and chose as its war-leader Parsodes, giving him command of their army. Against these the Medes armed no less than eight hundred thousand men (these are the numbers given by Ctesias, which shouldn't be given much trust). Artaeus failed miserably in his attempt to reconquer the Cadusii and Parsodes was triumphantly elected king by the winners. Parsodes waged continuous raids in Media for all his long kingdom, and so did those who succeeded him, generating a state of perpetual enmity and warfare between Cadusii and Medes that continued until the fall of the Medes in 559 BC. But it must be remembered that all Greek records on the East before Cyrus must be treated with the utmost skepticism. This said, it may be that behind this legend there is a part of truth if we believe some scholars who identify Artaeus with Herodotus' Deioces, or better Duyakku, an important Mede chief in the age of Assyrian hegemony. Another point of interest in this story is that Ctesias here mentions for the first time the Cadusii. What seems more certain (in the report of Nicolaus of Damascus) is that near to the end of the Mede kingdom the Cadusii played an important role in bringing its downfall by allying themselves with the Medes' enemies, the Persians. =Cadusii and Persians= It does not seem that the Persians had initially great difficulties in submitting the Cadusii; they were immediately loyal allies of Cyrus the Great (559‚Äì529 BC), firstly against the Medes and secondly against the Babylonians. And their submission seems to have been something more than nominal considering that Xenophon tells us that Cyrus assigned to a son called Tanaoxares (probably Smerdis) the satrapy of Cadusia. But by the times of Darius the Great Persian full control on the region must have suffered a partial setback, since we never hear their name in Herodotus or in Persian inscriptions in the lists of peoples and territories being part of the empire. In an unknown year they had been, it would seem, successfully submitted and probably added to the satrapy of Media or that of Hyrcania; this because it is told that in 406 BC Cyrus the Younger, a son of the High King Darius II (423‚Äì404 BC), had just led an expedition against the Cadusii in revolt. Cyrus' expedition was a success as three years later the Cadusii fought at Cunaxa under the banners of Artaxerxes II (404‚Äì358 BC) against Cyrus. But their obedience to Artaxerxes II didn't keep long; we see them rebelling in 385 and 358 BC. The first rebellion was defeated by a great army led by the same Artaxerxes. In the victory paid a key role the king's advisor Tiribazus, who smartly tricked the chief rebels in submitting themselves to the king. Another man who distinguished himself in the campaign was Datames, who would rise to become one of the most brilliant Persian generals. The conflict of 358 under Artaxerxes III (358‚Äì338 BC) was the last major clash between Cadusii and Persians; for the last years of the empire the Cadusii remained submissive. This war was important since it gave an occasion for the Persian general Codomannus, to distinguish himself in a sole combat against a Cadusian chief; an action that paved him the road to the throne as Darius III (336‚Äì330 BC). =Alexander the Great and aftermath= In the Macedonian conquest of the east the Cadusii remained loyal to the Persians all the way up to Darius III's bitter end; we read of their cavalry fighting against Alexander at Gaugamela (331 BC) and of preparing to send reinforcements to the High King after the battle. But at the end they were subdued by Alexander's general Parmenion. In the subsequent Eastern wars they are mentioned as the allies of one or other party. After the division of Alexander's empire they became part of the Seleucid empire; in this context we read of them fighting for the Seleucids in the battle of Raphia against the Egyptians (217 BC), and their name is cited by Antiochus III's (223‚Äì187 BC) envoys at Aegium to the Achaeans as one of the many people under the sway of the Seleucids. But the crushing Romans victory at Magnesia started the disintegration of Seleucid power and the loss of all eastern territories. From this moment, little is known of Cadusian history; they seem to have been early submitted by the Parthians. As their allies Mark Anthony met them in 36 BC during his Parthian campaign; and two centuries later Caracalla in 216 repeated the campaign also entering in contact with the Cadusii. Excepting a forged letter by a Cadusian chief named Velonus to the Sasanian king Shapur I in 260, this is practically the last source that speaks of the Cadusii as an existing people; at this point they seem to vanish probably merging with other Caspian tribes. Modern day Talysh people generally identify themselves with the ancient Cadusians.

Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen (a zymogen) into its active form trypsin, resulting in the subsequent activation of pancreatic digestive enzymes. Absence of enteropeptidase results in intestinal digestion impairment. Enteropeptidase is a serine protease () consisting of a disulfide-linked heavy-chain of 82-140 kDa that anchors enterokinase in the intestinal brush border membrane and a light-chain of 35‚Äì62 kDa that contains the catalytic subunit. Enteropeptidase is a part of the chymotrypsin-clan of serine proteases, and is structurally similar to these proteins. Historical significance Enteropeptidase was discovered by Ivan Pavlov, who was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his studies of gastrointestinal physiology. It is the first known enzyme to activate other enzymes, and it remains a remarkable example of how serine proteases have been crafted to regulate metabolic pathways. The inert function of digestive enzymes within the pancreas was known, as compared to their potent activity within the intestine, but the basis of this difference was unknown. In 1899, Pavlov‚Äôs student, N. P. Schepowalnikov, demonstrated that canine duodenal secretions dramatically stimulated the digestive activity of pancreatic enzymes, especially trypsinogen. The active principle was recognized as a special enzyme in the intestine that could activate other enzymes. Pavlov named it enterokinase. The debate of whether enterokinase was a cofactor or enzyme was resolved by Kunitz, who showed that the activation of trypsinogen by enterokinase was catalytic. In the 1950s, cattle trypsinogen was shown to be activated autocatalytically by cleavage of an N-terminal hexapeptide. The more precise IUBMB name enteropeptidase has been in existence since 1970. However, the original name ‚Äòenterokinase‚Äô has a long history and remains in common use. Enzyme structure Enteropeptidase is a type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) localized to the brush border of the duodenal and jejunal mucosa and synthesized as a zymogen, proenteropeptidase, which requires activation by duodenase or trypsin. TTSPs are synthesized as single chain zymogens with N-terminal propeptide sequences of different lengths. These enzymes are activated by cleavage at the carboxyl side of lysine or arginine residues present in a highly conserved activation motif. Once activated, TTSPs are predicted to remain membrane-bound through a conserved disulfide bond linking the pro- and catalytic domains. In the case of cattle enteropeptidase the primary translation product comprises 1035 residues with an expected mass of 114.9kDa. The detected apparent mass of about 160kDa is consistent with the specified carbohydrate content of 30 - 40%, with equal amounts of neutral and amino sugars. The activation cleavage site after Lys800 splits the heavy and light chains of mature cattle enteropeptidase. There are 17 potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the heavy chain and three in the light chain; most of these are conserved in other species. The heavy chain has a hydrophobic section near the N-terminus that supports the transmembrane anchor. The heavy chain influences the specificity of enteropeptidase. Native enteropeptidase is resistant to soybean trypsin inhibitor. However, the isolated light chain is subtle whether prepared by limited reduction of the natural protein or by mutagenesis and expression in COS cells. Native enteropeptidase and the isolated light chain have similar activity toward Gly-(Asp)4-Lys-NHNap, but the secluded light chain has distinctly decreased activity toward trypsinogen . An analogous selective defect in the recognition of trypsinogen can be produced in two-chain enteropeptidase by heating or by acetylation. This behavior implies that the catalytic center and one or more secondary substrate-binding sites are essential for optimal recognition of trypsinogen. Human enteropeptidase - light chain Activity Despite its alternative name (enterokinase), enteropeptidase is a serine protease that catalyses the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in proteins and, unlike other kinases, does not catalyze transfer of phosphate groups. Enteropeptidase exhibits trypsin-like activity, cleaving proteins following a lysine at a specific cleavage site (Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys). This cleavage results in trypsindependent activation of other pancreatic zymogens, such as chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxypeptidase and prolipase in the lumen of the gut. As the pro-region of trypsinogen contains this sequence, enteropeptidase catalyses its activation in vivo: trypsinogen ‚Üí trypsin + pro- region (Val-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) Genetics and disease relevance In humans, enteropeptidase is encoded by the PRSS7 gene (also known as ENTK) on chromosome 21q21. Some nonsense and frameshift mutations in this gene lead to a rare recessive disorder characterised by severe failure to thrive in affected infants, due to enteropeptidase deficiency. Enteropeptidase mRNA expression is limited to the proximal small intestine, and the protein is found in enterocytes of duodenum and proximal jejunum. Upon secretion from the pancreas into the duodenum, trypsinogen encounters enteropeptidase and is activated. Trypsin then cleaves and activates other pancreatic serine protease zymogens (chymotrypsinogen and proelastases), metalloprotease zymogens (procarboxypeptidases) and prolipases. By means of this simple two-step cascade, the destructive activity of these digestive hydrolases is confined to the lumen of the intestine. The physiological importance of this pathway is demonstrated by the severe intestinal malabsorption caused by congenital deficiency of enteropeptidase. This condition can be life-threatening, but responds to oral supplementation with pancreatic extract. Applications Enteropeptidase's specificity makes it an ideal tool in biochemical applications; a fusion protein containing a C-terminal affinity tag (such as poly-His) linked by this sequence can be cleaved by enteropeptidase to obtain the target protein following protein purification. On the converse, the N-terminal pro-sequence of proteases that must be cleaved prior to activation can be mutated to enable activation with enteropeptidase.

It has about 5,500 inhabitants. Together with neighbouring Karlovy Vary and Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ, it is part of the renowned West Bohemian Spa Triangle. The town centre is well preserved and historically significant and since 1992 is protected by law as urban monument reservation. It was nominated for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage roster. Administrative parts Villages of Aleje-Z√°ti≈°√≠, Dlouh√© Mosty, Doln√≠ Lomany, Horn√≠ Lomany, Krapice, Slatina and ≈Ω√≠rovice are administrative parts of Franti≈°kovy L√°znƒõ. Geography The town is located in the Chebsko (formerly Egerland) region near the border with Germany. It is situated in the Oh≈ôe river basin, north of the regional capital Cheb (Eger). History The salutary effects of the surrounding springs were known from the late 14th century on. The physician Georgius Agricola (1494‚Äì1555) mentioned the mineral water available to Eger citizens. The sources from which, according to ancient law, water was drafted and brought to the city, were first used locally for salutary purposes. Later, the water was also shipped in earthenware bottles and in 1700, it reportedly sold more water than all other spas in the Empire combined. About 1705, an inn was erected at the site of a mineral spring later known as Franzensquelle. Colonnade, about 1850 In 1793, the town was officially founded under the name Kaiser Franzensdorf, after Emperor Francis II (German: Franz II), and later renamed Franzensbad, under which name it became a famous spa (Bad). The spa was founded by Eger-based doctor Bernhard Adler (1753‚Äì1810).Zakladatel L√°zn√≠ - doktor Bernard Adler He promoted the expansion of spa facilities and the accommodation for those seeking healing and promoted the transformation of the swampy moorland with paths and footbridges to well-known sources. When in 1791 Adler had a pavilion and a water basin erected at the Franzensquelle, he sparked the Egerer Weibersturm (\\"Women's storm of Eger\\") by numerous women who earned their livelihood in the scooping, transport and sale of the water in Eger. Feeling their water-bearing rights threatened, they demolished his premises. The town council of Eger intervened and made the extension of Franzensbad as a health resort possible. The result was an extensive recreation area, with easy access from the city of Cheb. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was one of the most famous guests in the early days; his visits to Franzensbad with Johannes Urzidil were extensively reported in the book Goethe in B√∂hmen (1932, revised 1962 and 1965). Another famous visitor was Ludwig van Beethoven, who was accompanied by Antonia Brentano and her family. N√°rodn√≠ boulevard During the 19th century, patients included numerous aristocrats, especially Russian nobles, and at the same time widely known doctors bolstered the reputation of Franzensbad as a therapeutic resort. Franzensbad offered one of the first peat pulp baths in Europe, popular especially with female guests. A public spa house was built in 1827. The writer Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach portrayed her stay in her early work Aus Franzensbad in 1858. Other notable guests included Theodor Herzl (in 1904), Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria and Archduke Charles I of Austria. In 1862, Franzensbad became an autonomous municipality and obtained town privileges three years later. Until 1918 it was part of the Bohemian crown land of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. After World War I, the town's reputation began to fade. Then part of the new state of Czechoslovakia, the spa lost much of its patronage and was hit hard by the Great Depression of 1929. After World War II, the German-speaking population was expelled under the Bene≈° decrees; many of them settled in Bayreuth in the German state of Bavaria. The spa, officially renamed Franti≈°kovy L√°znƒõ in Czech, was nationalized under the rule of the Communist Party. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, a stock company was established to revive the status of Franti≈°kovy L√°znƒõ as a venue for international guests. Spa Glauberovy prameny (Franzensquelle) The local natural mineral water has a relatively high content of dissolved carbon dioxide. The effects of the carbonic baths are shown in the better performance of the cardiovascular system, in the mild decrease of blood pressure in the pulse, in the lower occurrence of chronic inflammatory processes in the body, and also in terms of rheumatics, and in the improved blood circulation in tissues and the vegetative stabilisation. The local mud treatments represent a traditional curative method which has thermal, chemical and mechanical effects. The mud treatment consists of a thick mushy combination of mud and mineral water which is heated up to a temperature which is significantly higher than body temperature. The treatment has a positive effect on mobility of muscles and the pain in treated tissues. The local spa corporation is the biggest spa corporation in the Czech Republic.. It operated 24 mineral springs, 12 of which are still in operation.

It is a five-day process, obtained by exposing a bitter, frost-resistant variety of potatoes to the very low night temperatures of the Andean Altiplano, freezing them, and subsequently exposing them to the intense sunlight of the day (this being the traditional process). The word comes from Quechua ch'u√±u, meaning 'frozen potato' ('wrinkled' in the dialects of the Jun√≠n Region). Origins The existence of chu√±o dates back to before the time of the Inca Empire in the 13th century, based on findings that have been made of the product at various archaeological sites. Specifically, they have been found at Tiwanaku, site of a culture which developed in the Collao Plateau, a geographic zone which includes territories of Bolivia and Peru. It had been described in 1590 by Spanish chronicler Jos√© de Acosta. Due to its portability, long shelf life, and nutritional value, chu√±o was eaten by Inca soldiers on marches. Indeed Carl Troll argued that the nighttime sub-freezing temperatures of southern Peruvian highlands that allowed for chu√±o production favoured the rise of the Inca Empire. alt=Illustration of Alstroemeria ligtu A form of chu√±o (Chu√±o de liuto or Chu√±o de concepci√≥n) is made from the starchy storage roots of Alstroemeria ligtu. Production Chu√±o is made at the beginning of Winter during June and July, during which time the temperatures reach around at elevations of over . After fall harvest (April-May), potatoes are selected for the production of chu√±o, typically small ones for ease of processing. These small potatoes are spread closely on flat ground, and allowed to freeze with the low night temperatures and dehydrate in the daytime, for about three nights. This process results in natural freeze- drying. By the end of this process, the potatoes are taken to chu√±ochinapampas ‚Äì flat areas where the potatoes can be laid out. The term is Aymara in origin and translates to ‚Äúthe place where the chu√±o is made‚Äù. Once they make it to the chu√±ochinapampas, they are trampled by foot. This eliminates what little water is still retained by the potatoes, and removes the skins, enabling subsequent freezing and drying. They remain as they are for over a week, depending on weather conditions. During the process of manually squeezing water out of the potatoes via stepping on them, whole families will participate. The previous freeze-drying breaks down cell walls, making it easier to remove water from the potatoes. They build a small pile of potatoes with their feet and then \\"dance\\" on the pile, removing the skins as they do so. This will not entirely remove the skins, so the remaining skin is removed by hand afterwards. Starting from this basic freeze-dry process, two varieties are obtained: =White chu√±o= White chu√±o is obtained by washing the frozen potatoes. The washing may take various forms. In Bolivia, the potatoes are spread on blankets or straw and constantly sprayed with water to moisten. In Peru, the frozen potatoes are transported to a river, and deposited in pools. This washing typically takes about a week. The final step is drying in the sun. The result is now called chu√±o, also known as papas secas (Spanish for \\"dry potatoes\\"). In Bolivia, white chu√±o is also called tunta. =Black chu√±o= Black chu√±o is obtained directly from the original freezing, trampling, and refreezing process. The product is not washed or exposed to water again; after freezing and trampling, it is simply sun-dried. Black chu√±o production has less regional variation than white chu√±o, and is more likely to be kept and consumed by farmers than the more commercialized white chu√±o. Preservation and consumption Maiz with chu√±o and chili Once dried, and with minimal care in storage, the product can last for a very long time, sometimes decades. Consumption is varied, from desserts to prepared dishes, as well as chu√±o flour, which is an essential ingredient in many dishes of Peruvian cuisine. Chairo is one of the most traditional Bolivian soups and it is made with chu√±o, meat, and vegetables. Especially in Bolivia, chu√±o is not considered the same as a regular potato. In certain recipes, chu√±o and potatoes should not be used interchangeably. Chairo, for example, is not considered the same without the ground chu√±o. The other ingredients - wheat, carrots, etc - can be substituted, but not the chu√±o. It is also traditional in southern regions of Peru such as Arequipa and Puno. Another soup, this one made using whole chu√±o, is jakonta. More simply, chu√±o can be eaten with a variety of sauces.

It is one of the rain-fed reservoirs from where water is drawn for supply Chennai city from this lake to Puzhal lake through canals.  History  Sholavaram lake was built prior to 1877, during British rule. It is primarily known for its lake and motor racing. The lake is one of the main water sources for Chennai. The race track near Sholavaram lake used to be an air strip during World War II. Racing events were conducted from the early 1960s to the late 1980s. Racing events took place during February of every year. The track was T-shaped so the problem was discussed with rac in london and the Madras Motor club was advised that the width of the track should not be more than 35 feet. The 150 foot runway was divided by having an eighty-foot no-man's land in the centre, with 35 foot wide tracks on two sides. This gave a wide space in the centre and the ambulance, marshalls, etc. were all located in the centre 80 foot divide. Being a place that belonged to the army, the club could not say anything when someone in the army decided to test their new tanks and the Sholavaram runway was taken up by the army on several occasions to test tanks. So the Madras Motor Sports Club built a new track in Sriperumbadur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, but this track still evokes strong memories and nostalgia from many drivers and spectators.  Geography  Sholavaram is a quiet town, 24 km north of Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Sholavaram lake is one of the largest lakes in Chennai. It is located near Sholavaram Airstrip, which has a T-shaped base where the Indian army used to test their activities. The canal has been connected in between Sholavaram and Puzhal lake. Peoples in the surroundings use the canal road to reach Thiruvallur main road, Redhills junction and also G.N.T road or National highway (NH5).  1983: Krishna River Water supply scheme  An agreement was signed jointly by Governments of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh on 14 April 1976 to spare 15 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of Krishna water to Chennai city. Following this, an accord between Andhra Pradesh Government and Tamil Nadu Government was signed on 18 April 1983 for drawing 15 TMC of Krishna water to Chennai City from Sri Sailam Reservoir to be conveyed through Somaseela and Kandaleru Reservoirs. Ultimately a net quantity of 12 TMC (after loss of 3 TMC en route in evaporation and seepage) will reach the Tamil Nadu border. Thus the water from Krishna river were stored in Sholavaram lake as well as Poondi Reservoir for drinking purposes.  2015: heavy rainfall  In November and December 2015, North East monsoon brought heavy rainfall to the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu and Andhra pradesh. The water inlet of Sholavaram lake reached the maximum capacity of 595 (mcft) out of 881 (mcft). A few years ago the water surplus place was extended up to 200 (mcft) and the bunds were also repaired. During the heavy rainfall flow in the Sholavaram lake and its surroundings, crack found in the lake region. On 16 November 2015, 400 metre of crack found in same region due to clay soil. Water Resources Department took action and the lake has been under controlled. On 1 December 2015, the lake had an inflow of 423 (cusecs) and an outflow of 400 (cusecs). Capacity augmentation In April 2019, desilting work to restore the reservoir's capacity began at a cost of 54.2 million, which would enhance the lake's storage by about 250 million cubic feet (mcft).

Bunting, Private Independent Schools, p. 379 (1963). SSFS opened its doors in September 1961 with 77 students in Grades 10 and 11. Twelfth Grade was added a year later. The school's first buildings were the Headmaster's home, named ‚ÄúScott House‚Äù after Esther Scott, and a dormitory, named ‚ÄúMoore Hall‚Äù after Brook Moore, with room for 46 students. The dormitory building also held two faculty apartments and classrooms, plus the school's kitchen and dining room, library, laboratory and lockers on the lower level.The Interchange, Vol. 36, No. 2 (BYM June 1961) at 3. The school quickly outgrew the original buildings, and over the next decade additional classrooms, an arts center, faculty housing, an infirmary and a second dormitory with expanded kitchen and dining facilities were constructed. In 1973, a 9th Grade program was added, with classes initially held in the nearby Sandy Spring Community House; the 9th Grade was brought onto the main campus in 1990. In 1980 SSFS expanded to include a middle school,‚ÄúSandy Spring to Open Middle School,‚Äù Quaker Life, Vol. 21 p. 34 (Friends United Meeting 1980). and the lower school was added as a result of the 1993 merger with Friends Elementary School.P.

Jones, \\"The Later Periods of Quakerism,\\" Vol. 2, p. 709 (McMillan & Co. 1921). After 1906, Sherwood Academy became part of the Montgomery County public school system,R. Miller, Annals of Sandy Spring, Vol. III, pp. 371, 469-70 (1909). eventually becoming the Sherwood High School. Sherwood Academy occupied the old Ashton (Orthodox Quaker) Meeting House, which was later relocated to the SSFS campus. The nearby Thornton Friends School, named after former Sandy Spring Friends Head of School C. Thornton Brown, traces its roots to an innovative academic program, the ‚ÄúInterlocking Curriculum,‚Äù that was first developed at SSFS in 1973.T. Grubisich, ‚ÄúA Classroom Breakthrough,‚Äù Washington Post, p. F1 (Mar. 21, 1974). Sandy Spring Friends School annually sends students to QYLC (Quaker Youth Leadership Conference) which connects students from Quaker schools in the area on the basis of leadership, community, and Quaker traditions. Sandy Spring Friends School also plays host to an annual \\"Friendly Dance Exchange\\" which was spearheaded by faculty member, Hannah Kerr. Along with Sidwell Friends School and the Friends School of Baltimore, the Dance Programs of the three schools are brought together for a day of community building through dance and choreography workshops. = Heads of School = * Sam Legg (1961‚Äì64) * John H.

Computers are integrated into many aspects of the curriculum. Each school division is equipped with its own computer lab, and every classroom is wired for network and Internet access. The School's library includes computers for online research through online subscription reference tools and the Internet. The historic wooden Ashton Meeting House (built 1881) was moved onto the SSFS campus in 1983,The Interchange, Vol. 57, No. 2 (BYM Spring 1982), at 5. and a new library and gymnasium was constructed in 1987. In 2005-2006, a new middle school building was added, as well as a new performing arts center and athletic facilities, along with substantial renovations to several of the existing buildings. A new high school facility is currently under construction to be put in effect at some point during the 2019-2020 school year.  Demographics  Approximately 7% of the student body are Quakers.  Athletics  The Middle School teams and the Upper School boys' and girls' athletic teams compete in the Potomac Valley Athletic Conference (PVAC);. SSFS offers the following varsity and junior-varsity sports: * Women's: Cross Country; Volleyball (Varsity and JV); Soccer (Varsity and JV); Basketball; Track & Field; Tennis; Mud Wrestling; and Lacrosse. * Men's: Cross Country; Soccer (Varsity and JV); Basketball (Varsity & JV); Track & Field; Tennis; Lacrosse; and Baseball (Varsity and JV). * Coed: Climbing, Golf, Wrestling, and Hockey (club team).  Traditions  Some of SSFS's notable traditional activities, which date to the earliest days of the school, include the following: The Morley Games. The whimsical outdoor games of Frazleerham, Hoop-a-Doop, Brindledorph, Nurdleybawl and Friedlefrappe were invented by Barry Morley, a long-time SSFS teacher. The Morley Games, inspired by limited funds and facilities early in the school's history, made use of everyday objects, and continued to be played long after the introduction of soccer, lacrosse and other sports to the school's curriculum. Brindledorph, a field hockey-like game, is played with ordinary brooms, and Hoop-a-Doop with old bicycle tires. Nurdleybawl (a variation on tee-ball) uses a small rubber ball and sawed-off softball bat. Frazleerham, a combination of rugby, soccer, basketball and ultimate Frisbee, is played with a soccer ball and wastepaper can (held by the ‚Äúfrazsnapper‚Äù) standing in a small enclosure (10‚Äô x 10‚Äô x 2‚Äô) or ‚Äúrham‚Äù made of 2-by-4's. In Friedlefrappe, a ‚Äúfriedlesphere‚Äù (a ball) is thrown up to a ‚Äúfriedlesnatcher‚Äù (goalie) standing on a ‚Äúfriedleplat‚Äù (an elevated platform) who attempts to catch it with a ‚Äúfriedlesnare‚Äù (a net on a pole), and defended by a ‚Äúfriedlefrapper‚Äù swinging a broom.‚ÄúGames Friends Play,‚Äù Sports Illustrated, Nov. 25, 1974. Spirit Week. Held within the first few weeks of the school year, this recent school tradition is a weeklong event that features a number of school-wide and division-wide activities, such as \\"Twin Day\\" (students dress alike), \\"Pajama Day\\" (come to school dressed in pajamas), ‚ÄúGreen and Gold Day‚Äù (students and faculty are requested to wear green or yellow clothing), and \\"Crazy Hat and Hair Day.\\" Community Day. Held in the fall, Community Day began as \\"Mountain Day,\\" in which the entire school would travel to nearby Sugarloaf Mountain for a picnic and a day of exploration. In the mid-1970s the venue changed to Catoctin Quaker Camp. As the size of the school grew and the logistics of transporting the entire school over long distances became more difficult, Mountain Day evolved into Community Day, a day of campus-based work projects (such as trail maintenance, tending to the community garden, and bus waxing races), followed by school- wide games. Our People, Our Planet Day. Similar to Community Day, Our People, Our Planet Day (formerly known as Earth Stewardship Day) is an all-school event held in the spring. Our People, Our Planet Day (OPOP Day) is a day dedicated to a dual focus of environmental literacy and greater understanding of the unique social, global, and cultural composition of all SSFS community members. Intersession. In the week before spring break each school year, all SSFS Upper School students are required to participate in an Intersession, a trip of experiential learning that supplements the traditional school curriculum. Intersessions often involve community service, physical activity, or environmental stewardship. In the past, Intersession trips have gone to Florida, Senegal, Korea, Sicily, and numerous other locations.M. Gerber, ‚ÄúPrivate School Guide,‚Äù Bethesda Magazine (Nov. 2005). Strawberry Cowbake. An end-of-year festival featuring a cookout and strawberry shortcake. \\"The Sophomore Olympics aka the thining\\" In this annual tradition, 8-9 students from the sophomore class are \\"disposed of\\" in a Hunger Games-esque battle two the death. This traditions came about after a time when the school went through financial troubles in the 1980s and had to get rid of students for tax purposes.  Student government and publications  The Wildezine is an upper- school student newspaper. Other student publications include a literary magazine and a yearbook. The Torch Committee, the student government organization, includes day and boarding students, as well as faculty and administration representatives. A Torch representative is invited to all faculty meetings, school business meetings and meetings of the Board of Trustees. In addition, the student body also has several affinity groups for racial identity.

The formal proclamation of the Bankstown airfield project occurred under the National Security Act on 7 June 1940. The urgency was such that work began immediately; the Act permitted construction to begin even before the land had been officially resumed by the government.Mellor D P, Australia in the War of 1939‚Äì1945, Series 4 ‚Äì Civil ‚Äì Volume V ‚Äì The Role of Science and Industry, Australian War Museum, Canberra, 1958, page 37ff On 2 December 1940 RAAF Headquarters was established at Bankstown and on 19 December No 2 Aircraft Park moved to Bankstown where it remained until 28 March 1945. Its facilities were then taken over by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm.White, K, Brief History of RAAF Station,Bankstown NSW, Australian Aviation Museum, Bankstown, 2001, page 3 During World War II, Bankstown Airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces, and was established as a key strategic air base to support the war effort in 1942.

His first novel Lo Peor de todo (The Worst Thing of All), was published in 1992, and was followed by H√©roes in 1993. Ca√≠dos del Cielo - La pistola de mi hermano (My Brother's Gun) was the first of his novels to be published in English, and he directed a film based on this book in 1997. In the same year, he worked together with Pedro Almod√≥var and Jorge Guerricaechevarria to produce the screenplay for the film Carne tr√©mula (Live Flesh), also directed by Almod√≥var. The screenplay was based on the 1986 novel of the same name by the British crime writer Ruth Rendell. His second novel to be published in English was Tokio ya no nos quiere (Tokyo Doesn't Love Us Anymore). Loriga married Spanish-Danish singer-songwriter Christina Rosenvinge in 1989.

Unlike his Imperial Japanese Army counterpart, Colonel Yasue Norihiro, he held to an anti-Semitic ideology, believing strongly in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion; but these beliefs led him to think that attracting Jews to settle in Japanese-controlled Asia was in the Empire of Japan's best interests. Biography =Early life= Inuzuka was born in Tokyo as the eldest son of a former samurai retainer of Saga Domain. His official residency was in Saga Prefecture. A graduate of a middle school affiliated with Waseda University, he entered military service and graduated from the 39th class of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1912. He went on to the Navy Staff College and served on a number of vessels, including the , cruisers , , , , and Nisshin. =World War I= During World War I, Inuzuka was stationed in the Mediterranean Sea, with the Japanese expeditionary force sent to Malta as part of Japan's contribution to the Allied war effort under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. After the war, he was stationed off the coast of Vladivostok during the Siberian Intervention to aid the White Russians against the Bolshevik Red Army. It was there that he first heard of and read the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a powerful anti-Semitic document detailing a Jewish worldwide conspiracy. The document was forged and distributed by Russian General Gregorii Semenov, a leader of the White forces. In 1922, after returning to Japan, Inuzuka began to gather a coterie of sympathetic officers who believed in the Protocols. This group of so-called 'Jewish-experts' slowly became larger and more outspoken over the next several years. The group published many documents detailing their thoughts on the Jewish conspiracy, including lists of known Jews, and a Japanese translation of the Protocols, written by Yasue. After serving as a military attach√© to France, Inuzuka served on the battleship Fuji and cruiser Kuma. =As a Jewish expert= As war with China approached in the 1930s, Inuzuka came to support the 'Manchurian faction,' a number of military men who believed that control of Manchuria was crucial to Japan's survival. Inuzuka was stationed in Shanghai from November 1934, came upon the idea of enticing Jews to settle in Manchukuo and to help build infrastructure there. Not only would they bring engineering knowledge and creative energy, but Jews living in Manchukuo would bring Japan favor from the United States and other Western nations. Inuzuka believed that gaining the favor of the Jewish people was crucial, as the Jews, in his mind, controlled the world markets. The Five Ministers' Conference in 1938 provided the formal go-ahead for Inuzuka and his colleagues to begin setting up a Jewish settlement in Shanghai. In 1939, Inuzuka, along with Colonel Yasue and Ishiguro Shiro of the Foreign Ministry, recommended that Japan set up an autonomous Jewish region near Shanghai; by providing a safe place for Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany to settle, and granting them the political and economic autonomy to live as they desired. In a report to his superiors that year, Inuzuka compared the Jews to fugu, the famous poisonous fish delicacy. Thus, Inuzuka's plans regarding the Jews came to be known as the Fugu Plan. Inuzuka, fluent in English, Russian, and French, visited countless schools and synagogues, discussing Jewish problems, and seeking aid or support from Jewish communities and organizations. He helped form the Pacific Trading Company, a joint Jewish-Japanese endeavor, and met with many of East Asia's top Jewish leaders, both religious and financial. Over the next few years, Inuzuka was central to the operations of nearly every aspect of the Fugu Plan. Along with Yasue and a handful of others he coordinated everything from choosing and setting up sites for settlements, transporting Jews to the settlements, speaking with Jewish community leaders to gain economic and moral support, and working of course within the bounds granted him by the Japanese government and military. By 1942, however, the Plan fell apart. Japanese aid for Jews would not be tolerated by Japan's ally, Nazi Germany, and Japanese attempts to shuttle Jews through the Soviet Union were halted when Germany launched its invasion of Russia. In 1941, Inuzuka's help in rescuing Jewish refugees from Nazi Europe was acknowledged and Inuzuka was granted a silver cigarette case by the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States; the interior of the case bore an inscription thanking Inuzuka for his services to the Jewish people. He was transferred by the Navy to the Philippines in 1943, and after the war, the cigarette case saved him from being tried as a war criminal. The case was later donated to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem. Inuzuka established the in 1952, which contained primarily ex- military men. He was president of the Association until his death in 1965. Beliefs and ideology The Protocols, in reality an antisemitic Tsarist fabrication, speak of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, and of the incredible economic and political power of the Jewish people. Thus, even as he believed them quite dangerous, Inuzuka believed that convincing the Jewish people to favor Japan would bring Japan great economic rewards. Under the pen name Utsunomiya Kiyo, he published a book in 1939 discussing Jewish history in regard to Japan, and describing his belief that, since Palestine was closed to Jewish settlement by the British and Arabs, Jews would seek to return to their Oriental heritage somewhere else. He also contributed anonymously to the monthly journal , which was funded by the Foreign Ministry and German Embassy.

The group has its headquarters in Kolkata in the state of West Bengal, but works around the world. History Nandikar's story begins on 29 June 1960, when Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay and Asit Bandyopadhyay, along with a collection of committed young theatre persons, broke away and formed the group, which consisted of Ajoy Ganguly, Satyan Mitra, Dipen Sengupta, later joined by Keya Chakraborty, Bibhas Chakraborty, Chinmoy Roy, and Rudraprasad Sengupta. The group's early productions were mainly adaptations of non-Indian plays, like Natyakarer Sandhane Chhati Charitra (Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author), Manjari Amer Manjari (Chekhov's Cherry Orchard), Jokhan Eka (Arnold Wesker's Roots), Sher Afgan (Pirandello's Henry IV) and Tin Poyshar Pala (Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera). They also performed Rabindranath Tagore's Char Adhyaya. In the late 1970s, first Asit Bandopadhyay and then Ajitesh Bandopadhyay left the group. With Rudraprasad Sengupta as the main director, a new era started, and Nandikar turned from a pure performance-oriented theatre group to an organisation with a wide range of projects, including the annual National Theatre Festival. Among the group's present actresses and actors are Swatilekha Sengupta, who starred in Satyajit Ray's movie Ghare Baire (The Home and the World) (1984) and Roland Joff√©'s City of Joy (1992), Goutam Halder, (he has left the group and formed a new one, initially becoming its director), Debshankar Halder, Sohini Sengupta, who acted in Aparna Sen's movie Paromitar Ek Din (2000), and Rudraprasad Sengupta himself. Besides acting in Nandikar productions, he has also played in Bernardo Bertolucci's Little Buddha (1993). Nandikar regularly performs all over India. However, during the last decade, the group has performed in several countries outside India, including Bangladesh, Germany, Sweden, UK, and United States.

Anti-Tom literature consists of the 19th century pro-slavery novels and other literary works written in response to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Also called plantation literature, these writings were generally written by authors from the Southern United States. Books in the genre attempted to show either that slavery was beneficial to African Americans or that the evils of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect.  Uncle Tom's Cabin  First published in serialized form from 1851-52 (in the abolitionist journal The National Era), and in book form in 1852, Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe quickly became the best-selling novel of the 19th century (and the second best-selling book of the century after the Bible).Notes on Book, accessed Feb 16, 2007 This abolitionist novel focused on the evils of slavery and was inspired by the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act two years before, which punished those who aided runaway slaves. The book was highly controversial and fanned the debate over slavery in the country.  The Southern literary response  The response to Stowe's novel in the American South was one of outrage. To counter Stowe's novel, Southern writers produced a number of pro-slavery books, the vast majority of them novels. In 1852 alone, eight anti-Tom novels were published.\\"Caroline Lee Hentz's Long Journey\\" by Philip D. Beidler. Alabama Heritage Number 75, Winter 2005. These anti-Tom novels tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended- family-style plantation. The novels either implied, or directly stated, the view that African Americans were unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.Joy Jordan-Lake, Whitewashing Uncle Tom's Cabin: Nineteenth-Century Women Novelists Respond to Stowe, Vanderbilt University Press, 2005 Today these novels and books are generally seen as pro- slavery propaganda. The anti-Tom genre died off with the start of the American Civil War.Lucinda MacKethan, \\"An Overview of Southern Literature by Genre\\", Southern Spaces, February 16, 2004.  Simms, Hentz, and other pro-slavery authors  The two most famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz. Simms' The Sword and the Distaff came out only a few months after Stowe's novel and contains a number of sections and discussions that clearly debate Stowe's book and view of slavery. The novel focuses on the Revolutionary War and its aftermath through the lives of Captain Porgy and one of his slaves. Simms' novel was popular enough that it was reprinted in 1854 under the title Woodcraft. The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz was published two years after Uncle Tom's Cabin. Hentz's novel offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a northern woman--the daughter of an abolitionist --who marries a southern slave owner. As with other books in the genre, Hentz's novel tries to show that black people lacked the ability to function well without oversight by whites. Her novel also focused on the fear of a slave rebellion, especially if abolitionists did not stop stirring up trouble. Simms and Hentz's books were two of between 20 or 30 pro-slavery novels written in the decade after Uncle Tom's Cabin. Another well-known author who published anti-Tom novels is John Pendleton Kennedy. Mary Henderson Eastman's Aunt Phillis's Cabin was one of the bestselling novels of the genre. Published in 1852, it sold 20,000 to 30,000 copies.Mary Henderson Eastman, Aunt Phillis's Cabin, University of Virginia, accessed 9 Dec 2008 In a note in the book, Eastman proudly stated she was a descendant of the First Families of Virginia.

Catch light or catchlight is a light source that causes a specular highlight in a subject's eye in an image. They are also referred to as eye lights or Obies, the latter a reference to Merle Oberon, for whom the light was invented by then husband and cinematographer, Lucien Ballard. The catch light is either an artifact for a lighting method, or purposely engineered to add a glint or spark to a subject's eye during photography. The technique is effective in both still and motion picture photography; helping to draw attention towards the subject's eyes, which may otherwise get lost among other elements in the scene. History  The lighting instrument was invented during filming of The Lodger, on which Oberon's husband was the cinematographer. Ballard wanted to alleviate Oberon's facial scars following a car accident in 1937, successfully done through make up and good lighting; attaching a small light mount on the side of a camera.  Logistics  The Obie light is a small, compact, three bulb light apparatus whose source emits a broad, continuously adjustable pattern within a two-and- a-half stop range. The bulbs come in three basic settings ranging from low to high which can be finely adjusted within each level by disturbing the bulbs and its compound reflector. As a focused light source, it is usually fairly dim and white in color, as to not affect and overpower any other part of the scene or face. Many other lighting methods, however, are known for the distinctive catch light they produce. Among those methods are: a ring flash, which produces several highlights in a ring, and large softboxes, which produce large, square highlights. In a patent for an Image Editing Apparatus, a catch light makes it \\"possible to emphasize or add to an expression on a subject's face\\". There are different optimum catch lights for each definitive facial expression made by actors. Its process reflects light from the surface of the cornea by a built-in flash unit, and is then exposed by an \\"image pickup element\\". A catch light is not the same as a red-eye effect. In general, red-eye is an undesired effect (caused by the reflection of light from the retina inside the back of the eyeball), while catch lights on the eye remain aesthetically desirable. Especially in portraiture, eyes without catch lights are often said to appear dull or lifeless. Lighting is often arranged in studio portraits specifically to create attractive catch lights.  Usage in film and television  War artist Thomas Lea's The 2000 Yard Stare shows the soldier's eyes lacking catchlight due to his \\"lifelessness\\" This method most often appears as bright spots and reflections of surroundings that can contain entire images in the subject's eyes. This property is sometimes used as a plot point in movies and television. Typically, this trope is represented by computer magnification of an image to gain information about the surroundings of the person being photographed, essentially using the eye as a mirror. Audiences usually perceive eyes without specular highlights to be lifeless or evil, and for this reason many cinematographers specifically eliminate catch lights on antagonistic characters. It is also commonly found in anime, usually used in an over-dramatized manner to show different emotions accompanied by exaggerated expressions.

He is known for is work on vitamins and human nutrition. He had leading roles in the discovery of folic acid, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, lipoic acid, and avidin. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1946, and served as the president of the American Chemical Society in 1957. In his later career he spent time writing for a popular audience on the importance of nutrition. Early life and education Roger John Williams was born in Ootacamund, India of American parents on August 14, 1893. His family returned to the US when he was two years old, and he grew up in Kansas and California. He attributed his early interest in chemistry to the influence of his brother Robert R. Williams, eight years his senior, who was also a chemist. Robert is remembered for being the first to synthesize thiamine (vitamin B1). Roger was an undergraduate at the University of Redlands and received his bachelor's degree in 1914. He received a teaching certificate from the University of California, Berkeley the following year and began work as a science teacher in California. After a year of teaching, he decided to return to school and began graduate work at the University of Chicago, from which he received his Ph.D. in 1919. His Ph.D Thesis was entitled The Vitamine Requirements of Yeasts.Biography: Roger J. Williams: Nutrition Scientist at the website PAULING BLOG. It says William's Ph.D Thesis title was in the spelling The Vitamin Requirement of Yeast. Julius Stieglitz was the chairman of the department of chemistry at U Chicago when Roger Williams was a student there, and Williams later described Stieglitz as a major influence upon him in organic chemistry. Academic career Williams began his academic research career by joining the faculty at the University of Oregon in 1920. During the following twelve years he spent there, he discovered pantothenic acid. In 1932 he moved to Oregon State College and in 1939 he moved again to the University of Texas at Austin. He founded and became the founding director of the Biochemical Institute (later the Clayton Foundation Biochemical Institute) in 1940 with funding from Benjamin Clayton. Williams' research program was notable in that he used yeast as model organisms to study nutritional requirements, on the hypothesis that the underlying cellular biochemistry was generalizable from yeast to animals. He aimed to study vitamins, at the time known as animal nutrients whose chemical properties were not characterized. This approach was successful in leading to the discovery of pantothenic acid, published in 1933, which prompted renewed interest among biochemists in microbial metabolism. Williams and his colleagues in Texas ‚Äì including Robert Eakin, Esmond Snell, William Shive, and Lester Reed ‚Äì continued this work and used the technique to discover a number of other vitamins and nutrients. Williams and Snell, along with student Herschel K. Mitchell, isolated and named folic acid by extracting it from four tons of processed spinach. He also worked on discovering and isolating vitamin B6, lipoic acid, and avidin. Throughout his career Williams was a prolific writer, producing not only hundreds of scientific papers but also a number of widely used textbooks. Williams retired from his role at the director of the Biochemical Institute in 1963 and from the University of Texas in 1986. Nutrition Educator Roger Williams devoted much of his later years to educating the public about the benefits of complete and proper nutrition to good health. This consisted chiefly of him writing popular books about nutrition. One of Williams's popular books is entitled Biochemical Individuality. In it, Williams emphasized the uniqueness of each person in their metabolic makeup and micronutrient needs. Because of \\"biochemical individuality\\", nutritional requirements are not fully the same for everybody. Awards and honors * Elected to the National Academy of Sciences, 1946 * President of the American Chemical Society, 1957 * Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Personal life Williams married his high school sweetheart Hazel Elizabeth Wood in 1916 during his stint teaching in California. The couple had three children. After Hazel died in 1952, he married Mabel Phyllis Hobson; the two enjoyed extensive travel. Williams also enjoyed fishing and golf and played the violin and piano. For most of his life Williams suffered from eyestrain caused by aniseikonia, a condition that was not recognized during his youth; he had glasses specially made to treat the condition in the 40s. Williams died on February 20, 1988. His wife Phyllis survived him and died in 2004. Books * The Human Frontier (Harcourt Brace, 1946) * The Biochemistry of B vitamins, Roger J.

It is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cartagena. History The Christian king Jaime I the Conqueror conquered the city during the Mud√©jar revolt of 1264‚Äì66. Despite an existing pact with the Muslims of the city that prevented the destruction of any mosque, Jaime I took the Great Mosque or Aljam√≠a to consecrate it to the Virgin Mary; a custom he put in place when conquered any settlement. However, it was not until the 14th century that construction of the cathedral would begin. In 1385 work on the foundations started and in 1388 the first stone was laid. Another six years passed until constructions upwards continued; the cathedral would be finished in October 1467. Nevertheless, the cathedral continued to evolve until the 18th century, demonstrating a variety of artistic styles. The interior is largely Gothic in style; the facade is Baroque and it was designed by the Valencian architect and sculptor Jaume Bort i Meli√°. The heart and the entrails of King Alfonso X the Wise are buried under the main altar of the cathedral, as he indicated in his testament, as a gift and proof of his love to Murcia and in thanks to the fidelity that the city showed to him. In 1854 the Cathedral suffered a terrible fire that destroyed the High Altar and the choir stalls. The repair works consisted in the creation of a new neo-Gothic altarpiece (work of the sculptors Pescador and Palao), and the commission of a majestic organ, undertaken by the Belgian firm Merklin-Sch√ºtze. Under the organ 16th-century plateresque chairs from the Monastery of Santa Maria de Valdeiglesias were installed, a donation made by Queen Isabel II to the Cathedral. Bell tower Bell tower. The bell tower, built between 1521 and 1791, stands tall-- with the weathervane. It is the tallest campanile in Spain. It ascends in five levels of different widths. The tower also combines a variety of styles. * The first level, made by Francisco and Jacobo Florentino, has a square plant with Renaissance style and ornamentation influenced by the Hispanic Plateresque. * The second body, made by Jer√≥nimo Quijano, has the same style but it is more purist. * The third floor, with Baroque style, has the body with Rococ√≥ style and the cupola, drawn up by Ventura Rodr√≠guez, with Neoclassic style. * In the fourth floor, there are four conjuratories. Located in each corner, special ceremonies were conducted in them by priests to ward off storms by means of the Lignum Crucis. Bells There are twenty-five bells, all from the 17th century and the 18th century. Each has its own name. Among them are: * The Bell of the Spells * La Catalana * The Bell of Prayer * La Fuensanta * The Conception * La Segundilla * The greater or Agueda-Martillo, which is the main bell Chapel of los V√©lez. The bells have served to warn the population about the catastrophic floods of the Segura River, wars, celebrations, and festivities. The oldest bell (14th century), la Campana Mora (the moor bell), is kept in the Museum of the Cathedral of Murcia. Interior The interior is mainly Gothic. It is made up of three naves with an apse and twenty-three chapels. The chapels are dedicated to the patron saints of the labour unions and to the burials of the bishops and nobles that helped or collaborated with the construction of the cathedral. Some of the chapels include: * The Chapel of the Apse or the V√©lez Chapel: it has Flaming Gothic style, with a cupola of stars with ten points. * The Chapel of Junterones: it is one of the great works of the Spanish Renaissance. * The Chapel of the Immaculate: it is Baroque in style. The Plateresque chairs of the choir, post-choir, and the portal of the sacristy, are also of note. Exterior Facade detail * Door of the Apostoles: Constructed in 1488 by Diego S√°nchez de Almaz√°n. It has Gothic style. At the jambs (sides) of the door, the sculptures of the four apostles are shown. It also has a shield which honors the queen Isabel the Catholic. * Chapel of the Marquess of V√©lez: Its plan is polygonal and adorned with the shields of the Chacones and the Fajardos. * Door of the Chains: Made of two bodies (the inferior from the 16th century and the superior from the 18th century), with reliefs of the brothers San Leandro, San Isidoro, and San Fulgencio. * Main Facade: It has Baroque style.

The UK edition retailed for seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $1.00. It is the first of six novels Christie published under the nom-de-plume \\"Mary Westmacott\\". Plot summary The opening of London's National Opera House is celebrated by the performance of a new composition, The Giant. The audience was either puzzled or ecstatic about this modernist piece. One man who does not personally like the composition, but can see the genius that scored it, is Carl Bowerman, an elderly and distinguished music critic, who joins the owner of the Opera House, Sebastian Levinne, for a private drink. Despite the foreign nature of the music, Bowerman recognises that the composer, known as Boris Groen, must be English because \\"Nationality in music is unmistakable.\\" He states that Groen is the natural successor to a man called Vernon Deyre who was killed in the war. Sebastian politely refuses to tell more about the absent Groen, saying \\"There are reasons...\\" In the late years of the Victorian era, Vernon Deyre was a small boy growing up in the old country house of the Deyre family, Abbots Puisannts. He was the only child of Walter, a soldier by profession, and Myra Deyre who was something of an emotional and clinging person. Walter is a sad figure who is not in love with his wife and is subject to various dalliances. Vernon's nurse ‚Äì an important figure in his childhood ‚Äì raises him, but he has no friends. In their place he has four imaginary friends, the most important of whom is called Mr Green, a florid man who loves playing games and who lives in a wood that borders on the grounds of Abbots Puisannts. One of the main male figures in Vernon's life is his Uncle Sydney, Myra's brother who is a self-made man who runs a manufacturing business in Birmingham and is someone with whom Vernon instinctively feels uncomfortable. Someone who promotes a different reaction is Walter's sister, Nina, an artistic woman who impresses Vernon by her playing of the grand piano in the house. This is an object for which Vernon has an unreasoning terror, naming it \\"The Beast\\", as it promotes a hatred of music in his soul. Aunt Nina's marriage breaks up and Walter wants her and her young daughter Josephine (Joe) to live with them, but Myra objects. Fate takes a turn though when the Boer War breaks out and Walter goes off to fight. In his absence, whilst Vernon is away at school, Nina dies and Myra takes Joe in. As a result, Vernon has a playmate in the holidays and the two start to make a circle of acquaintances. One of them, Nell Vereker, is a thin girl who cannot keep up with Vernon and Joe in their games. The local village is aghast when the property adjoining Abbots Puisannts is bought by a rich Jewish family called the Levinnes and, although held at arm's length at first, gradually the family come to be held in a grudging acceptance. Vernon and Joe also make friends with the son of the family ‚Äì Sebastian, who is about the same age as them. A few weeks before the end of the war, Walter Deyre is killed in action and Vernon inherits Abbots Puisannts, though as he is not of age so it is held in trust for him. A shortage of money means that Myra and her son have to move, and they rent the house out while they move to Birmingham to be near Uncle Sydney. Eleven years pass. Vernon and Sebastian have remained friends through their time at Eton and Cambridge. Sebastian's father has died in the intervening years and he, unlike Vernon, has inherited millions. Sebastian is starting on his career as a patron of the arts, opening a gallery in Bond Street, while Joe has artistic tastes and Vernon is at a loose end as to what he wants to do ‚Äì money, or the lack of it, still being a concern. He has a life-changing moment when he is forced to attend a charity concert at the Albert Hall and suddenly overcomes his childhood hatred of music, so much so that he declares that he wants to be a composer. Vernon reaches twenty-one and is bitter to learn that his financial situation means that he cannot afford to move back to Abbots Puisannts. He is forced to agree that he will work at Uncle Sydney's firm, but life takes a different tack when, after a gap of several years, he meets Nell Vereker again at Cambridge. She has grown into a beautiful young woman and Vernon falls in love with her. He is opposed by Nell's mother, who has brought her up to be a lady ‚Äì despite being desperately short of money herself ‚Äì and is determined that Nell will marry riches. Her preferred candidate for her daughter's hand is an American called George Chetwynd. Uncle Sydney is also opposed to Vernon marrying Nell and persuades him to wait until he is more established. One night, while Nell and her mother are abroad, Vernon is introduced to a professional singer called Jane Harding at a party hosted by Sebastian. He is attracted to Jane, despite a ten-year age difference, and starts to see her, to Joe's approval but Myra Deyre's consternation. Jane's effect on Vernon is to apply himself more to composing music and, to do so, he leaves his uncle's firm. Nell is frightened of Jane and confronts her, but the older, more experienced girl is more than a match for Nell. Vernon finishes his composition and, suddenly scared of rumours that Nell is going to marry George Chetwynd, proposes to her, but she asks him to wait. Events reach a crisis point when Joe absconds with a married man, and this prompts Vernon to accuse Nell of not having that sort of courage. This outburst merely prompts her into getting engaged to Chetwynd with whom, as she tells Vernon, she \\"feels safe\\". On the rebound, Vernon starts a relationship with Jane. He also finishes his composition which Sebastian produces and in which Jane sings. The piece receives warm reviews. The First World War is declared on 4 August 1914 and four days later Nell sees Vernon again and confesses that she still loves him. Hearing that he has enlisted, she agrees to be his wife and they are married later that afternoon. Six months later, Vernon is sent to France and Nell becomes a VAD nurse, finding the work and the treatment meted out to volunteers like her hard to take. After some time she receives a telegram to say that Vernon has been killed in action. Several months pass and George Chetwynd meets Nell briefly, before he goes off to Serbia to carry out relief work, and promises to keep in touch with her. Nell has, through her widowhood, inherited Abbots Puisannts and she makes a move that Vernon never could by selling the house. She finds out that Chetwynd has bought it and he invites Nell and her mother to visit him at the house where he proposes to her. She accepts and they marry. It is 1917. In neutral Holland, Vernon turns up one night at an inn, having escaped from a prisoner of war camp in Germany. The daughter of the woman who runs the inn gives him some old English magazines to read and a letter for a soldier she knew called Corporal Green. Struck by the man having the same name as his imaginary childhood friend, he happily agrees but is then dumbstruck to read in one of the magazines of Nell and George's marriage. He staggers into the night and throws himself in the path of a coming truck. Two years later a man called George Green is the chauffeur of a rich American who found the man in Holland suffering from loss of memory after an \\"accident\\" and working as a driver. They are back in England now and George's employer visits Chetwynd, an acquaintance, at Abbots Puisannts. By coincidence, Jane Harding is also visiting the house that day. She has lost her singing voice and is now an actress appearing locally with a repertory company. Chetwynd has invited her to tea. She and Nell meet, and their mutual animosity to each other is clear, but Nell receives a greater shock when she catches sight of their American visitor's chauffeur and realises that Vernon is still alive. Jane also recognises Vernon in the nearby town and hurriedly summons Sebastian down there by telegram. They get Vernon professional help and he slowly starts to recover his memory and has a proper reunion with Nell, while Chetwynd, unaware of what has happened, is away. Vernon wants to take up where he left off, although he accepts the loss of Abbots Puisannts, but Nell, afraid, lies to him that she is pregnant. Disconsolate, Jane takes him away, no one else being aware that he is alive, but not before she has confronted Nell with her lie. The two go to Moscow where Vernon is taken up with Meyerhold and the Avant- garde music of the new movements in Russia. They suddenly receive a telegram saying that Joe is dangerously ill in New York City and they sail across to see her. On the way, the ship hits an iceberg and starts to sink. In the confusion of the evacuation, as the ship starts to tilt badly and go down into the water, Vernon sees Nell, she and Chetwynd having been on board but sailing in a different class of passengers. She cries out to Vernon to save her and he does so, watching Jane's horrified face as she goes \\"down into that green swirl...\\" Back safely in New York, Vernon confesses to Sebastian that he let the love of his life die. Sebastian is furious but the emotional shock to Vernon causes him to regain his passion and talent for composing. He begins The Giant, oblivious to all else, even Nell who visits him to admit that she still loves him. He rebuffs her, his only concern now being for his music. Literary significance and reception The Times Literary Supplement reviewed the book on 29 May 1930. The reviewer, unaware of the true identity of the author, praised the \\"arresting prologue\\" and stated that the early years of Vernon Deyre were \\"described with charm and capture the child's point of view.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 29 May 1930 (p. 460) The review in The New York Times Book Review (17 August 1930) declared, \\"Whoever is concealed beneath the pseudonym of Mary Westmacott may well feel proud of Giant's Bread. The blurb lends mystery to Miss Westmacott's identity. She has written half a dozen successful books under her own name, it says, but they have been so different from Giant's Bread that she decided to have it 'judged on its own merits and not in the light of previous success.' Who she is does not matter, for her book is far above the average of current fiction, in fact, comes well under the classification of a 'good book.' And it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation. In Giant's Bread there are traces of the careful, detailed writing of the English novelist, and there are hints of Mary Roberts Rinehart's methods of mentioning a finished episode and explaining later how it all happened.\\" The review concluded, \\"Each figure is well conceived, human and true.\\"The New York Times Book Review, 17 August 1930 (p. 7) Gerald Gould reviewed the novel in the 4 May 1930 issue of The Observer when he wrote, \\"Giant's Bread is an ambitious and surprisingly sentimental story about a young man with musical genius, mixed love-affairs, a lost memory, a family tradition, and other commodities out of the bag of novelist's tricks. Miss Westmacott shows narrative talent; but would presumably be more original if she strained less after originality. I should expect her book to be very popular.\\"The Observer, 4 May 1930 (p. 8) References to other works In Book III, Chapter I(i) Jane Harding quotes the line \\"Come, tell me how you live!\\" from verse three of the White Knight's poem, \\"Haddocks' Eyes\\", from Chapter eight of Through the Looking-Glass (1871) by Lewis Carroll. This quote was later used by Christie as the title of her 1946 book of travel literature.

But the term has come into common usage in the world of magic as a reference to tricks that do not require sleight of hand or secret moves. For example, Glenn Gravatt compiled numerous such tricks in his book Encyclopedia of Self-working Card Tricks (1936), which was later compiled with Second Encyclopedia of Card Tricks (1936) to create Jean Hugard's classic text Encyclopedia of Card Tricks in 1937.Encyclopedia of Self-working Card Tricks Magicpedia. Retrieved 31 January 2020 Many people are first introduced to performing magic via self-working card tricks. Many such tricks rely on mathematical principles, and the audience can often replicate the effect by following the steps correctly. Optical illusions and some science demonstrations are considered by some to fall into this category as well. The wonder comes from unexpectedness of a natural phenomenon. Usually, self-working card tricks revolve around some mathematical principle. A simple example is the trick \\"Magical 13\\", in which the spectator cuts the deck 13 times, splits the deck into 13 piles, and discovers that each pile contains only cards of the same value. This is based on the principle that if the deck is set up with all the suits in order, then no matter how many times you cut the deck, the same cards of the same value will always be 13 cards away from each other.

It lies in Thiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu state. It is one of the two rain-fed reservoirs from where water is drawn for supply to Chennai City, the other one being the Chembarambakkam Lake and Porur Lake. The full capacity of the lake is 3,300 million ft¬≥ (93 million m¬≥). History left Main article: Puzhal Town The Puzhal reservoir was built in 1876 during the British rule in Puzhal Town, The reservoir was originally a small tank with a capacity of 500 million cubic feet (mcft) and two masonry weirs, built using locally available laterite stones, then functioned as surplus weirs to release excess water from the water body. Today, these masonry weirs are water-retaining structures as they have been replaced by two shutters. In 1997, the storage capacity of the water reservoir was increased to 3,300 mcft and the depth to 21.20 ft to cater to the drinking water needs of Chennai and also to store Krishna river water received from Andhra Pradesh through Poondi Reservoir and the Sholavaram Tank. Until 2012, the Water Resources Department (WRD) has only taken up maintenance work worth of 500,000 every year. Geography There are two masonry weirs in the reservoir. One weir is 178 m long and the other is 220 m long and 15 ft deep. The bund measures 5 m and runs to a distance of 7 km. The weirs have turned porous over the years. The south west part of the reservoir has Ambattur residential locality and has the main road to reach Avadi junction. Water treatment plant and Puzhal Central prison is located in the east part of the reservoir and has the highway road to reach CMBT and North Chennai. The North part has Padiyanallur village Thiruvallur koot road en route to reach Thiruvallur. There are two ways reservoir's bund road routes are located north east part of the reservoir, one bund route is from Alamaram junction to Redhills market junction and the other one bund road is from Redhills bypass road junction to Surapet junction. The North west part has Pammathukulam, Pothur, Attanthangal and Naravarikuppam villages.  Jones Tower  Jones Tower Jones Tower was built in 1881 in Puzhal lake. It is used to measure the depth of the lake water level. The surrounding bund roads are used by many for exercises such as walking, running. High level Electric motors are used to inlet the water from the lake to the tank before the cleaning process. There are 11 Electric motor pumps located play an important role when the dry season is available for providing drinking water to the chennai city.  Water Seepage  During the heavy rainfall in November/December 2015 water seepage occurred on 19 November 2015 on the two places of Puzhal lake near the weirs due to heavy storage in the water reservoir . Upgradation = 2012 : Repairing process = Repairing Puzhal bund roads in 2012 In June 2012, the WRD called for a tender for strengthening the reservoir at a cost of 101.6 million. Besides small repair to the shutters, filter arrangements on the slope of the bund will be made for 2 km. The road on top of the bund will also be widened by 1 m. The water level of the reservoir has been brought down to 10.46 ft to take up the project. The water body receives 300 cubic feet per second (cusecs) from Poondi canal to supply to the city. = 2015 : Heavy Rainfall November/December = Main article: 2015 Floods in Tamil Nadu According to Chennai metropolitan water supply and sewage board on 14 November 2015 rainfall in Puzhal reservoir has a storage of 2,228 million cubic feet as against its total capacity of 3,300 mcft and receiving an inflow of 1,196 cubic feet per second. Puzhal has lowest storage among the four reservoirs with 67.5 per cent of its capacity. On 1 December 2015 Puzhal also recorded 320mm, the highest volume of rainfall flowing overnight rain in the history. Discharge from the lake and maintain the water level two feet below the full level of 21.2 feet. Sand bags have also been placed in vulnerable areas along the surplus course such as Thandalkazhani, Vadakarai and Thiruneelakandan Nagar and Baba Nagar in Puzhal. People have also been warned of inundation. The surplus course of Red Hills travels for 15 km before joining the sea near Ennore creek.

The British edition retailed for seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. It is the second of six novels Christie wrote under the pen name Mary Westmacott. Plot summary In the midst of divorce, bereft of the only people in her life she cares for, Celia considers taking her life. But, while on an exotic island, Celia meets Larraby, a successful portrait painter, who spends a night talking with her, and learning her deepest fears. Larraby leaves Celia with the hope that he may be the one to help her come to terms with her past. Literary significance and reception The Times Literary Supplement review of 12 April 1934 outlined the plot and stated that, \\"The artist who re-tells Celia's story ends several sentences in every paragraph with dots, a mannerism that irritates; but we must forgive him, since, in the final chapter, he heals Celia's soul in one unpredictable instant.\\"The Times Literary Supplement 12 April 1934 (Page 265) The New York Times Book Review of 9 December 1934 said of the plot construction of Celia telling Larraby her life history that, \\"This literary device seems artificial and unnecessary at first, but is effectively used in the ending.\\" They concluded, \\"As a study of a shy, emotional nature, verging on the pathological, Unfinished Portrait is moderately well done. It is worth reading for its sympathetic ‚Äì and sometimes very amusing ‚Äì account of Celia's childhood. And in Celia's Grannie it introduces a grand old lady ‚Äì an indomitable Victorian with a keen love of life, a fine hand for managing 'the men', and a gruesome interest in the final takings-off of the many friends and relatives whom she survived.\\"The New York Times Book Review 9 December 1934 (Page 7) Publication history * 1934, William Collins & Sons (London), March 1934, Hardcover, 320 pp * 1934, Doubleday (New York), 1934, Hardcover, 323 pp * 1964, Dell Books (New York), Paperback, 284 pp * 1972, Arbor House (New York), Hardcover, 284 pp * 1986, Fontana Books (Imprint of HarperCollins), Paperback, The first editions in both the UK and US used the same dustjacket illustration by Hookway Cowles.

Genesis  On initiative of Jean Claude Peyronnet, president of the Conseil G√©n√©ral of Haute-Vienne and with the agreement of the French association of families of the martyrs, the project was presented to the former French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand in 1989. In 1992 the project management was decided in an international tendering process and received the support of the ministry of culture, the ministry of war veterans and the European Community. In 1994 a project director was engaged, to coordinate the process of historical research. At the same time, the architect Yves Devraine was assigned to design and build the Oradour memorial center. In 1999 the Oradour memorial centre was opened by the French president Jacques Chirac and the French minister of culture Catherine Trautmann. By 2002 the centre had had 300,000 visitors, who were able to see the permanent exhibition as well as temporary exhibits.  Architecture  According to the architect's conception, the memorial centre and the landscape unite in a unique symbiosis of a so-called \\"non- architecture\\". This \\"non-architecture\\" is realized in a roof which allows a view over the Glane valley, the ruins of the former village, and also of the new, reconstructed one. Rusty steel blades brutally separate the centre of the building symbolising destruction and remembrance as well as resistance to the elements. The materials, left in their natural state, appear aged. In the circular entrance hall two large photographs are symbolically displayed. The one depicts Hitler haranguing the crowds at a Nuremberg rally and the other is the sign at the entrance to the ruins of Oradour-sur-Glane \\"Souviens-toi\\" (Lest you forget). The permanent exhibition is displayed through contrasting areas in black and red where picture rails hang clear of the wall and depict the Nazi movement and the advance of the division \\"Das Reich\\" towards Oradour, and light areas which depict in a much softer way the village and people of Oradour before the massacre. On the lower level is the resource centre and rooms with temporary partitions that can accommodate school groups and teachers. Originally designed as a resource for the historical research that was undertaken in the preparation of the centre's permanent exhibition, the resource centre houses French and foreign archive material, photographs, films, publications and magazines. The feeling of exposure that is reflected in the external appearance and the layout of the exhibition areas enable each visitor to pursue his or her own thoughts. Much importance has been placed on windows and mirrored surfaces, which encourage visitors to make the journey from the past towards the future and explore the other side of the mirror. Vandalism On August 2020 graffiti denying the Holocaust was discovered on a wall of the Centre. Officials placed a tarpaulin over the graffiti on the wall of the centre. The word \\"lie\\" was sprayed on the wall along with other words and the phrase \\"Village Martyr\\" was crossed over. G√©rald Darmanin. the interior minister, condemned the \\"abject filth\\" and Jean Castex, the Prime Minister, said the graffiti \\"dirties the memory of our martyrs\\". √âric Dupond- Moretti, the Minister for Justice tweeted \\"Shame on those who did this\\" and \\"All will be done to find and judge those who committed these sacrilegious acts.\\"  See also  *Oradour-sur-Glane massacre References  External links  * Oradour-sur-Glane Memorial Center * Austrian Memorial Service at the centre de la m√©moire d'Oradour-sur-Glane Oradour, Centre de la memoire Category:Oradour-sur-Glane massacre Category:World War II museums in France Category:World War II memorials in France Category:Museums in Haute-Vienne ","title":"Centre de la m√©moire d'Oradour"},{"id":"2370057","text":"18th Street may refer to:  Los Angeles  * 18th Street gang, an Hispanic street gang  Manhattan, New York City  * 18th Street (IRT Broadway ‚Äì Seventh Avenue Line); a subway station serving the trains * 18th Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line), an abandoned subway station; formerly serving the trains * 18th Street (IRT Third Avenue Line), (demolished) * 18th Street (IRT Sixth Avenue Line), (demolished)  Chicago  * 18th Street station (CTA); a former 'L' station  Washington, D.C.  * 18th Street NW (Washington, D.C.)

History A38/A617/MARR road junction King's Mill Hospital with King's Mill Reservoir in the foreground King's Mill was opened as the 30th General Hospital of California, a military hospital, in 1942. The hospital housed 400 injured American personnel as well as German prisoners of war. Part of the site was used to accommodate Mansfield Secondary Technical School, taking students from 1945 housed in the Nissen huts that had been left by the US Army. It was officially opened by Sir Hubert Houldsworth, Chairman of the East Midlands Division of the National Coal Board on 22 June 1948. It later moved to new premises, becoming known as Sherwood Hall Secondary School. Other areas of the site were used to create King's Mill Hospital. The hospital was officially opened by Hilary Marquand, the Minister of Health on 17 September 1951. The Dukeries Maternity Centre was opened by the Duchess of Devonshire on 14 January 1975. New facilities were procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2005. The works were carried out by Skanska at a cost of ¬£300 million and opened in 2011. The design incorporated surface-solar energy heat recovery from an adjacent reservoir, which provides one-third of the heating and all of the cooling requirements for the complex. This involved submerging a grid of 140 stainless steel plates into the water at the deepest point, connected to the hospital via twin pipes laid under the A38 dual carriageway road. After Maternity Services moved into a new Women and Children's Centre, the old Dukeries Maternity Centre was finally demolished in spring 2013. Facilities The ambulance station, which is run by the East Midlands Ambulance Service, opened in 1981 and is located on the A38 road.

He was listed as the number one television screenwriter in the UK by Broadcast magazine in 2008 and among British broadcasting's top twenty in The Stage in 2009. He currently resides in Hertfordshire. For many years, Jordan was lead writer and series consultant for BBC One soap opera EastEnders. Jordan had written for the programme since 1989 including the 2008 single-hander \\"Pretty Baby....\\" and is considered to be an 'elder statesman' of the show, for which he has written over 250 episodes . Career Beginning his career as a market trader, Jordan began writing at the age of thirty-two. He joined EastEnders after sending a spec script to the BBC about market traders, with a covering letter saying he had been born and raised in the East End of London. The BBC turned down the spec script, but gave him a job on EastEnders because of his apparent life experience. Afraid of what would happen if the producers found out that he was from the north, Jordan kept up the pretence of being a Londoner for five years.Jordan, Tony (2 December 2008). Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe [Television production]. London: BBC Four. Jordan left school with no qualifications. For his work on EastEnders, he is particularly known for creating the Slater family along with then producer, John Yorke. Amongst significant episodes he scripted are those featuring the deaths of Arthur Fowler and Ethel Skinner; the \\"Sharongate\\" storyline; and more recently Kat's revelation to Zoe that she was her mother, the Andy-Kat-Alfie love triangle, and Dot's monologue. He was the first writer to do EastEnders when it began airing three times a week, when the siege at The Queen Victoria took place in 1994. He continued to work on EastEnders through a period which saw a reversal in its hitherto declining fortunes, with the programme winning the Most Popular Soap category at the National Television Awards in 2005. He wrote the first two episodes (broadcast on 24 and 25 October 2005) for the return of the characters of Phil and Grant Mitchell, popular characters he had originally helped to create back in 1989. While on staff at EastEnders, Jordan undertook a number of freelance projects. In early 2004, he created hit BBC One con artist drama Hustle. He also co-created the time travel/police drama Life on Mars, which began in 2006.

Jordan also created the series of Moving Wallpaper and Echo Beach for ITV; these were linked to each other, the latter being a soap opera and the former being a sitcom about the production of that soap opera. In 2007, Jordan was honoured for his work on EastEnders at the British Soap Awards with a \\"Special Achievement award\\". On 14 November 2007, it was announced that Jordan would be returning to EastEnders less than twelve months after quitting, to write one final episode. Jordan subsequently wrote the script for Dot Branning's single- handed episode, broadcast on 31 January 2008 on BBC One.

Interactive Entertainment (WBIE; also known as WB Games) is an American video game publisher based in Burbank, California. The company is part of the WarnerMedia conglomerate through the Home Entertainment division of WarnerMedia's Warner Bros. arm. WBIE was founded in January 2004 under Warner Bros. and transferred to the Home Entertainment division when that company was formed in October 2005. WBIE manages the wholly owned game development studios TT Games, Rocksteady Studios, NetherRealm Studios, Monolith Productions, WB Games Boston, Avalanche Software, and WB Games Montr√©al, among others.  History  The foundation of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (WBIE) under Warner Bros. was announced on January 14, 2004, along with the Warner Bros. Games (WB Games) brand under which WBIE would publish games. Jason Hall, previously of Monolith Productions, was named as its senior vice president. Later that year, Warner Bros. acquired Monolith Productions. Warner Bros. created a new group‚ÄìWarner Bros. Home Entertainment‚Äìin October 2005 and organized WBIE as part of it. The first game that Monolith developed in conjunction with Warner Bros. Entertainment was The Matrix Online which SEGA helped co-publish. Warner Bros. also helped distribute both Enter the Matrix and The Matrix: Path of Neo for the Matrix series. In 2006, they bought a 10.3% stake in SCi Entertainment, the owner of Eidos Interactive. That same year, they released their first self-published title (with no co-publishers), Justice League Heroes, which was distributed by Eidos on the Xbox. In 2007, their goal was for a five-year plan to expand in the video game industry, which includes the acquisition of studios for internal development and the creation of a studio (WB Games) in the Seattle area that will run all the games published and developed by the company; starting with the acquisition of TT Games that same year for the amount of . In April 2008, they increased their stake to 35% gaining distribution right of all Eidos games in the United States, Canada and Mexico. On December 15, 2008, right after SCi changed their name to Eidos plc, Warner acquired a total of 10 million shares of the company, raising its owned amount to 19.92%, after an agreement which prevented Time Warner from acquiring more shares was scrapped one month earlier. On January 28, 2009, The Hollywood Reporter reported the deal also gave Warner the rights of the Tomb Raider film series, previously owned by Paramount Pictures. On February 12, 2009, SQEX Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Square Enix, announced a takeover offer worth (32p per share) for Eidos plc, which was backed by Warner Bros. as shareholder. Square Enix eventually took over the company April 22, 2009 and later changed the name to Square Enix Europe. Warner Bros. announced on February 4, 2009 it had purchased independent developer Snowblind Studios. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the acquisition serves to strengthen the publisher's internal development effort. In 2009, Warner purchased most of the assets of American publisher Midway Games, operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, for . The assets purchased include Midway's studio in Chicago and Surreal Software, resulting in the ownership to the rights to the Joust, Mortal Kombat, The Suffering, Spy Hunter and Wheelman series. Midway Games had previously worked with Warner Bros. on several games including Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. Midway intended to hold an auction of its assets on June 29, 2009, but no other bids were placed. On July 10, 2009, the sale to Warner was completed for approximately . In the process, WB Games became the owner of the Blitz: The League series.

On April 9, 2010, Warner Bros has announced it will publish a third installment to its F.E.A.R. series in fall of this year. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group announced on April 20, 2010 the acquisition of Turbine, Inc. the developer of the famous MMOs Asheron's Call, Dungeons & Dragons Online and The Lord of the Rings Online. On June 4, 2010, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group and Turbine, inc. said that the massively multiplayer online title The Lord of the Rings Online was to become a free-to-play game that autumn. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced on June 10, 2010 that Mortal Kombat, the most brutal installment of the landmark fighting game to date was due for release on the PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system and Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system from Microsoft in 2011.

In ancient times, both Celts and Illyrians built their fortresses at the location of present-day Motovun. The name of the village is also of Celtic origin, derived from word Montona, that means \\"a town in the hills\\". The population of the village itself is 531, with a total of 983 residents in the municipality (2001); 192 of the residents speak Italian as their mother language. The Parenzana was a narrow gauge railroad that ran from Trieste to Poreƒç/Parenzo between 1902‚Äì1935, passed valley below the town. Description City gate Motovun is a medieval town that grew up on the site of an ancient city called Castellieri. It is situated on a hill above sea level with houses scattered all over the hill. On the inner walls are several coats-of-arms of different Motovun ruling families and two gravestones of Roman inhabitants (dating from the 1st century). In the 10th and 11th centuries it belonged to the Bishop of Poreƒç. From 1278 it was taken over by Venice and surrounded by solid walls which are still intact today, and used as a walkway with unique views over the four corners of Istria. All three parts of the town are connected by a system of internal and external fortifications with towers and city gates containing elements of Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance styles, built between the 14th and 17th centuries. It is a typical example of Venetian colonial architecture.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pgs. 15‚Äì16, Zagreb (1999), =Parish Church of St. Stephen (Sveti Stjepan)= The old church in Motovun Street fruit and vegetable vendor in Motovun The late-Renaissance church of St. Stephen was built right at the beginning of the 17th century according to sketches probably designed by the well-known Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio (1508‚Äì1580). The church contains several works of art: the marble statues of St. Stephen and St. Laurence by Francesco Bonazzo and the 17th-century painting of the Last Supper over the altar by an unknown Venetian artist. The water cisterns in the square in front of the church date from the 14th and 15th centuries. =The forest of Motovun/Montona= The river Mirna or Quieto river flows below the hill and on the other side of the river there is the famous Motovun forest, an area of about in the valley of the river Mirna, of which is specially protected. This area differs completely not only from the nearby forests, but also from those of the entire surrounding karst region because of its wild life, moist soil and rich-with-prized-black-and-white truffles (Tuber magnatum), which grows successfully there. Since this fungus grows underground, it is gathered with the aid of specially trained dogs. The most common tree in the forest is the English or brown oak (Quercus robur). In order to preserve natural conditions for the development of the Motovun forest, the protected area is occasionally flooded, even though the River Mirna is controlled and its entire valley protected from flooding. On the slopes of the hill, grapes for famous Istrian wines are grown: the Teran and the Malvazija wine. =The legend of Veli Jo≈æe= Motovun is known among today's population of Istria as the city of Veli Jo≈æe, the good gentle giant who represents the Croatian people of Istria. The story written by the nationalist Vladimir Nazor, one of the most important Croatian writers of the 20th century. The story was based on local folktales as a response to the national struggles of the Croats for equality with the politically dominant ethnic German and Italian community (1900‚Äì1914).:hr:Veli Jo≈æe The tale is known today throughout Croatia, while the character of Veli Jo≈æe (Big Joe) is quite correctly linked with the city. =The city today= View from Motovun walls Andrea Antico Square Since 1999, Motovun has hosted the international Motovun Film Festival for independent and avant-garde films from the U.S. and Europe. The biggest current local issue is the battle between foreign developers, who have proposed two 18-hole golf courses and a 500+-bed resort in the valley below the town, extending the existing 9-hole course and some of the local community, who are opposed to the proposals because of objections against the real estate speculation around the project, rejection of 123 building sites for villas in the protected natural environment and concerns about possible damage to their truffles growing on the other side of the river. The community is divided on the issue, as many welcome the development as a year-round aid to jobs and local tourist revenues. An environmental impact study has now been completed.

Notable residents *Motovun was the birthplace of race car driver Mario Andretti and his twin brother Aldo in 1940. The brothers raced hand-crafted wooden cars through the steep streets. After World War II Istria became a part of Croatia, a sovereign constituent unit of Yugoslavia. His family, like many other ethnic Italians, emigrated. They lived in a camp near Lucca from 1948 to 1955. The Andretti family resettled in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, United States. *Motovun was also the birthplace in 1495 of prominent Renaissance Italian music printer Andrea Antico, famous as the inventor of the first movable wooden types for printing musical scores. He started publishing in Rome in 1510 and after obtaining a patent from Pope Leo X he published polyphonic music and music for organ.

It is the last section of the route from London via the West Midlands and North West England to Edinburgh, which follows the M1, M6, A74(M) and finally the A702. Route of Road The start of the A702 at the Tollcross junction in central Edinburgh. The road heads off to the left of the photograph. The end of the A702 in St John's Town of Dalry. The A702 begins as a minor street heading north as Ponton Street from its junction with West Tolcross, then turning east into Fountainbridge, and south into Earl Grey Street where it overlaps with the A700. As at 2013 it is not possible to drive this section continuously due to opposing one-way systems. It starts as a primary route at the Tollcross junction in Edinburgh, and continues south until it meets the Edinburgh City Bypass (A720) on the city's outskirts. In the city it is known as Home Street, Leven Street, Bruntsfield Place, Morningside Road, Comiston Road and finally Biggar Road. It continues in a south-westerly direction beside the Pentland Hills to Biggar, before following the Clyde Valley. The route is a major commuter route for residents of Carlops, West Linton and Biggar who work in and around the Edinburgh area. The road passes through the villages of Coulter and Lamington, before meeting the A73 road at a new roundabout junction, and then shortly afterwards meets junction 13 of the M74. From Abington, it continues as a non-primary route, and overlaps the A76 road for 1¬Ω miles until Thornhill. From Thornhill, the road winds south-west still, through the village of Moniaive, until eventually reaching St. John's Town of Dalry. Here, it terminates at its junction with the A713 road. The A702 from junction 13 of the M74 is the recommended route to Edinburgh, whereas the windier A7 road is signed as the Tourist Route to Edinburgh. The route attracts a large number of lorries and heavy goods vehicles and even though it includes some reasonably straight sections suitable for overtaking it can be a slow route from the M74 to Edinburgh. One other possible route to Edinburgh for those prepared to enjoy their driving more is the A701 road via Moffat. The stretch of the A702 between Abington and Edinburgh was formerly part of the Euroroute system, of route E32. The E32 also ran northwards out of Edinburgh along the A90/M90 as far as Perth.

Initially unpublished in the US, it was later issued as a paperback by Dell Publishing in September 1963. It was the fifth of six novels Christie wrote under the nom-de-plume Mary Westmacott. Initially a play written by Christie in the late 1930s, the plot tells of a daughter's opposition to her mother's plan to remarry. Christie tried to interest Peter Saunders, later the producer of The Mousetrap, in the play in 1950. He suggested amendments to update some of the references, which were now twenty years old, and tried the play out at the Theatre Royal, Bath where it opened on 9 July 1956Book and Magazine Collector Issue 174, September 1998 (p. 14) and ran for one week and eight performances. It was billed under the Westmacott name but the true identity of the author slipped out resulting in good attendance figures. Saunders however felt it would not survive in the West End and Christie didn't pursue the matter further.Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (pp. 286‚Äì287) Collins, 1984 Following Christie's death, the copyright for the play was owned by her daughter, Rosalind Hicks, who was unenthusiastic about the play as it was believed that the main character was based on her. Following Hicks' death in 2004, a new production of the play, starring Jenny Seagrove and Honeysuckle Weeks and produced by Bill Kenwright, was to open in London's West End on 14 December 2009. Kenwright described the play as \\"brutal and incredibly honest\\" and \\"It's a good enough play to stand up without the Christie brand. It's quite a tough play.

There are equivalent bodies at state level. The status of the Bundesrechnungshof, its members and its essential functions are guaranteed by the German Constitution (art. 114 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law), and regulated by other legislation (i.e. Bundesrechnungshof Act, Federal Budget Code). It is an independent judicial body, with around 600 employees. Its current President is Kay Scheller. The institution is a supreme federal authority only as far as it administers internal tasks such as personnel affairs, management of buildings or clearance of travel expenses and the like. Processing its core duties - auditing, reporting and counseling as external financial controllers - it is not part of the executive branch of Germany, but is positioned beyond the three classical constitutional powers. The Bundesrechnungshof is not subordinated to the federal government. Even the legislative (parliament) cannot instruct it. At best, the parliament can ask the authority to audit certain issues. From the third power, justice, it differs firstly by freely choosing the subject matters it intends to audit and secondly by not delivering legally binding rules, but by issuing recommendations. Bundesrechnungshof‚Äôs exact placement within a classical system of the division of powers is disputed.  Role  The Bundesrechnungshof examines the financial management of the federal government, its various property funds and state-owned companies, carrying out sample audits of revenue and expenditure totalling over 500 billion Euros. Its audit mandate also covers social security institutions and the activities of the federal government in private-law enterprises of which it is a shareholder. This includes areas such as defence, roadworks, taxation, and the federal government's activity as a minority shareholder of the formerly nationalised railways, post, and phone companies (Deutsche Bahn AG, Deutsche Post AG and Deutsche Telekom AG respectively). The Bundesrechnungshof makes recommendations on the basis of its audit experience and provides advice to the audited bodies, to the German Parliament and the Federal Government. Its consulting activities have steadily increased and set out significant recommendations for quality improvement, pointing out the potential for savings or increases in revenue. The Bundesrechnungshof reports on its audit findings in management letters which are sent to the audited bodies for comment. In addition the Bundesrechnungshof submits an annual report (\\"Observations\\") to both Houses of the German Parliament, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, as well as to the Federal Government. The annual report is also used as a basis for Parliament authorising the Federal Government's budget. The annual report is presented to the public at a federal press conference. The Bundesrechnungshof may at any time submit special reports on matters of major significance to both Houses of Parliament, and to the Federal Government. The Bundesrechnungshof provides advice to the executive and legislative branches by including recommendations for improvement in its management letters and annual reports, as well as by commenting - orally or in writing - on topical issues such as government bills and major procurement projects, or in the course of the annual budget procedure. By virtue of legislation regarding German reunification, the Bundesrechnungshof's new headquarters were transferred from Frankfurt am Main to Bonn, effective 1 July 2000. The Bundesrechnungshof also has a branch office in Potsdam.  History  The first precursor of that auditory branch in Germany is the Prussian Audit Office. Its name as \\"\\" comes from the medivial concept of a Chambres des Comptes overseeing the spending of the state. In medieval times it did have regulatory functions which it did loose to various administrative offices, so much that only reporting functions were left. The installation of a high office is influenced by the mismanagement of the Cabinet of Three Counts in Prussia (1702-1710). The \\"\\" (Prussian High Audit Office) was founded in 1714 by King Frederick William I as the \\"\\" (General Audit Office), given more powers in 1723 becoming the \\"\\" (High War and Domains Audit Office).Albert Manke: Die Entwicklung des Pr√ºfungsdienstes bei der Preussischen Oberrechnungskammer und dem Rechnungshof des Deutschen Reichs (PDF; 180 kB) Vortrag, gehalten am 18.

Pango, GDK, ATK, GIO, Cairo and GLib. Accessibility Toolkit (ATK) is an open source software library, part of the GNOME project, which provides application programming interfaces (APIs) for implementing accessibility support in software. One common nomenclature to explain an accessibility framework is a usual client-server architecture. In that way, assistive technologies (ATs) such as screen readers, would be the clients of that framework, and computer applications would be the server. In this architecture the client and server need to communicate with each other, usually using the IPC technology of the platform. Ideally the accessibility framework expose this to the client and server in a transparent way. Usually the API for both client-side and server-side applications are the same, and the accessibility framework provides a client-side and a server-side implementation of that API. In the case of GNOME, there are two different APIs, one for the client-side (Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI)) and a different one for the server-side (ATK) due to historical reasons related to the underlying technologies.  Implementations  The ATK abstract headers files are freely available to help developers who want to make their GUI toolkit accessible. Developers who use stock widgets of GUI toolkits that implements the ATK headers don't have to worry too much for making their applications accessible. However, if they develop their own widgets, they will have to ensure that they are exposing all the accessible information. GAIL (GNOME Accessibility Implementation Library) was the name of the accessibility interfaces implementation defined by ATK for GTK+, the widget library of GNOME. Initially, GAIL was an independent module mapped to GTK+ but since GNOME 3.2, GAIL was merged into GTK+, so the ATK implementation is integrated into GTK+ and GAIL is deprecated. Apart from GTK+, other GUI toolkits and applications have implemented ATK in order to be accessible, such as OpenOffice/LibreOffice, Mozilla's Gecko, Clutter and WebKitGTK+.  Development  ATK is part of the GNOME Accessibility Framework that was released in 2001. The main development force behind ATK was the Accessibility Program Office (APO) of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (now Oracle) with contributions from many community members. When Oracle acquired Sun in 2010 they cut developer jobs of full-time developers working on GNOME accessibility components such as the Accessibility Toolkit ATK and the Orca screen reader. Since then, ATK is mainly maintained by the GNOME community.  Successor  During GUADEC 2020 Emanuelle Bassi announced to have been working for about 6 months on a successor to ATK. Accessibility will no longer be maintained out- of-tree but be part of GTK. Available since GTK 3.99.0 The new approach will implement WAI-ARIA (World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Accessibility Initiative ‚Äì Accessible Rich Internet Applications).

Perlbal is maintained by a group connected to Danga Interactive. The program is in common use by large web sites to distribute the load over a number of servers. Like Perl, Perlbal is distributed under both the GNU General Public License and the Artistic License and is thus free software. Perlbal also features a so-called \\"re-proxy\\" mechanism. This allows a backend webapp to send back a small response to Perlbal which acts as an \\"internal redirect\\" and causes it to get the response data from elsewhere. This is often used so that expensive application server processes can defer to much simpler, faster HTTP servers to serve static files, freeing up the application server for other computing work. This is most commonly used in conjunction with MogileFS. Additionally, plugins can be written to support various operations that may traditionally have been performed at the application layer. As an example, a filter plugin has been developed that can dynamically alter the palette of a PNG or GIF image as it passes through the proxy, allowing the image to be tinted. This is used on LiveJournal to provide predefined page templates whose colors, including those \\"baked\\" into images, can be customized by the user. Doing this relatively simple filtering task at the load balancer layer avoids the overhead of passing this request back to the full application servers.

One of several stories starring Lord Darcy, it was first serialized in Analog Science Fiction in 1966 and published in book form the same year by Doubleday. It was later gathered together with Murder and Magic (1979) and Lord Darcy Investigates (1981) into the omnibus collection Lord Darcy (1983, expanded 2002). The novel was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1967. The Lord Darcy character also appears in several other novellas and short stories by Garrett, but this is his only novel-length Lord Darcy story. Michael Kurland has written two further novels set in the Lord Darcy universe.  Plot introduction  The novel takes place in 1966. However, it occurs in a world with an alternative history. The Plantagenet kings survived and rule a large Anglo-French Empire. In addition, around A.D. 1300 the laws of magic were discovered and magical science developed. The physical sciences were never pursued. The society looks early Victorian, though medical magic is superior to our medicine. The book uses the conventions of a detective story. The protagonist is Lord Darcy, Chief Investigator for the Duke of Normandy. This Sherlock Holmes-like figure is assisted by Master Sean O‚ÄôLochlainn, a forensic sorcerer. The novel is a locked room mystery, which takes place at a wizards‚Äô convention. Garrett delights in puns. Analogues of Nero Wolfe, Archie Goodwin, James Bond and Gandalf the Grey appear.

Li is enraged and goes to confront the Zhus, taking some of his men. But he is wounded in the arm by an arrow shot by Zhu Biao. Luckily he is saved by Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu. Yang and Shi continue their way to Liangshan, where they mention Shi Qian and ask the outlaws to help rescue him. After three military offensives, Song Jiang eventually exterminates the Zhu Family Village. Joining Liangshan Keen to recruit Li Ying and Du Xing, Song Jiang carries out a plan in which Xiao Rang and a few others pose as government officials to arrest the two for \\"collaborating\\" with Liangshan. As Li and Du are being \\"escorted\\" to the county office, the outlaws intercept the convoy to \\"rescue\\" them. Taken to the stronghold, Li Ying has no choice but joins Liangshan. Du Xing follows his master. Campaigns Du Xing is placed in charge of an inn which acts as a lookout for Liangshan after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. Du Xing is one of the few Liangshan heroes who survive all the campaigns. Although conferred the title \\"Martial Gentleman of Grace\\" () and given an official position, he resigns from it when Li Ying quits his. The two return to the Li Family Manor where they lead a comfortable life.

It opened its doors to the first patient, a four-year-old boy with paralysis, on May 1, 1863. There were 28 beds available, all for children. Adults were treated as outpatients. In 1870 it moved to a newly constructed 200-bed building on the corner of 42nd street and Lexington Avenue. There was no operating room until 1888 after a hospital fire. At the turn of the century, it became the target for efforts to expand Grand Central Terminal and negotiations were led by Cornelius Vanderbilt, II, a member of the Board of Managers of the hospital. In 1912, the hospital moved to a six-story building on 42nd Street between First Avenue and Second Avenue, a site that is now the home of the Ford Foundation. The hospital moved to its present location in 1955.Levine, D. B. \\"The Hospital for the Ruptured and Crippled Moves East on 42nd Street 1912 to 1925\\", HSS Journal, September 2007.

Truckee Meadows is also colloquially used as a name for the Reno metropolitan area, even though the metro area includes areas outside this valley. Location Per the USGS, The Truckee Meadows is one of a series a north-south trending basins bounded by the Sierra Nevada on the western edge of the Great Basin. The Truckee Meadows covers approximately 94 square miles in western Nevada. It is bounded on the west by the Carson Range, on the east by the Virginia Range and Pine Nut Mountains, on the south by the Steamboat hills, and by Peavine Peak to the north. Steamboat Creek is the main tributary supplying the Truckee River through the Truckee Meadows. Steamboat Creek, flows northward into Steamboat Valley. Steamboat Valley is considered part of the Truckee Meadows. The Spanish Springs Valley drains into the Truckee Meadows area from the north. Colloquial usage  Mustangs in the Truckee Meadows. Picture was taken just prior to this portion of the valley being developed with homes. Truckee Meadows has been used interchangeably with the Reno metropolitan area, However, the metro area's official definition includes all of Washoe County and Storey County. Several Reno suburbs are located in separate valleys, including Lemmon Valley, Golden Valley, Sun Valley, Nevada, Cold Springs valley and Washoe Valley. Flora Along Steamboat Creek of the Truckee Meadow, the most common plants, include lush grasses like the Great Basin wild rye (Leymus cinereus) and tule (Scirpus sp.). Riparian vegetation of the meadow include black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), willow species (Salis sp.), and silver buffaloberry (Shepherdia argentea). At elevated and better- drained valley margins grows the typical sagebrush-grass zone. Common plants in this habitat consisted of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate), rabbitbrush (chrysothamnus sp.), greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus), horsebrush (Tetradymia glabrata), and spiny hopsage (Grayia spinosa) Common bunch grasses included wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), bluegrass (Poa sp.), Great Basin Wild rye (Elymus cinereaus), Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides), squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix), and needle and thread (Stipa comate). History Damonte Ranch House built 150 years ago which still stands today. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, 1857 pioneer rancher Peleg Brown, a Rhode Island native arrived in the Truckee Meadows with his brother, Joshua. The two brothers introduced alfalfa to the area and built their home (Damonte Ranch House) 150 years ago which still stands today. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which caused the Nevada Department of Transportation to divert the construction of Interstate 580 and U.S. Route 395 freeway around the property to preserve the home and ranch. Geology The Truckee Meadows is a valley in western Nevada located within the western Great Basin. Named for the Truckee River, which flows through the valley from west to east, this area contains archaeological evidence of aboriginal human occupation. The Truckee Formation, is the oldest deposit of the valley and yields very little water to wells. Most of the discharge of water is by evapotranspiration and by seepage to ditches and streams. Some water in the area is unsuitable for many uses because of its poor chemical quality. Water in the Steamboat Springs area is hot and has high concentrations of chloride and dissolved solids. Both water draining areas of bleached rock and ground water from areas of leached rock have high concentrations of sulfate and dissolved solids.

It has a population of 16,000. History The town consists of four different parts: Upper Dabas, Lower Dabas, Gy√≥n and S√°ri. The village of Dabas was already a populous settlement in 1270, but in the Ottoman era the whole region became totally deserted. In the 18th century four new villages were created by the owners of the territory. The inhabitants of Upper-Dabas were catholic Hungarian serfs, Lower-Dabas was the centre of the lower nobility (especially the famous and populous Hal√°sz family), S√°ri (≈†ari) was populated by catholic Slovak colonists and Gy√≥n by Reformed Hungarians and Evangelical Slovaks. The Slovaks of S√°ri kept their national identity until the present. In the 19th century the nobility of Lower Dabas built several Neoclassical mansions ‚Äì these are the main attractions of the town today. The two Dabas were united in 1947, and in 1966 the other two villages joined too. In the 1970s Dabas was urbanised and a modern town centre was built with a court house, public school, office blocks and a big department store. Dabas became a town in 1989.

Bavaria is the leading import lager in Irak. The Brewer is active in more than 130 countries, in particular in Asia and the Middle-East. While pale lager makes up the majority of beer production and consumption in the Netherlands (95% according to the Centraal Brouwerij Kantoor), most Dutch brewers also brew specials. The most common special is 'witbier' (white beer). Also Bok, brewed in Autumn and Spring, a tradition closely related to German Bock beer, is an often brewed special.

Belgian breweries also take part in the market. Inbev for example sells Jupiler, Dommelsch, and Oranjeboom in the Dutch market. According to the Centraal Brouwerij Kantoor, Heineken controls about fifty percent of the market and the other three fifteen percent each. Between the them, the large companies operate eight breweries. In addition to the multinationals, there are five independent lager breweries and around forty five small, new microbreweries and brewpubs. A dozen other companies own no brewing plant themselves and have their beers brewed by third parties in the Netherlands or Belgium. The new breweries mostly brew top-fermenting beers roughly similar to those from Belgium. In addition there are also examples of British-style ales and traditional lagers. The Dutch province, North Brabant, is home to two of the ten Trappist Breweries. The monks that run the Koningshoeven Brewery in Berkel-Enschot brew several beers, mostly branded La Trappe, and has been active since 1884, while the De Kievit brewery of the Zundert abbey was only founded in 2013 and brews a beer named Zundert.

Define, for a given p \\\\in S, a vector n \\\\in \\\\mathrm{T}_p M to be normal to S whenever g(n,v)=0 for all v\\\\in \\\\mathrm{T}_p S (so that n is orthogonal to \\\\mathrm{T}_p S). The set \\\\mathrm{N}_p S of all such n is then called the normal space to S at p. Just as the total space of the tangent bundle to a manifold is constructed from all tangent spaces to the manifold, the total space of the normal bundleJohn M. Lee, Riemannian Manifolds, An Introduction to Curvature, (1997) Springer-Verlag New York, Graduate Texts in Mathematics 176 \\\\mathrm{N} S to S is defined as :\\\\mathrm{N}S := \\\\coprod_{p \\\\in S} \\\\mathrm{N}_p S. The conormal bundle is defined as the dual bundle to the normal bundle. It can be realised naturally as a sub-bundle of the cotangent bundle. =General definition= More abstractly, given an immersion i\\\\colon N \\\\to M (for instance an embedding), one can define a normal bundle of N in M, by at each point of N, taking the quotient space of the tangent space on M by the tangent space on N. For a Riemannian manifold one can identify this quotient with the orthogonal complement, but in general one cannot (such a choice is equivalent to a section of the projection V \\\\to V/W). Thus the normal bundle is in general a quotient of the tangent bundle of the ambient space restricted to the subspace. Formally, the normal bundleTammo tom Dieck, Algebraic Topology, (2010) EMS Textbooks in Mathematics to N in M is a quotient bundle of the tangent bundle on M: one has the short exact sequence of vector bundles on N: :0 \\\\to TN \\\\to TM\\\\vert_{i(N)} \\\\to T_{M/N} := TM\\\\vert_{i(N)} / TN \\\\to 0 where TM\\\\vert_{i(N)} is the restriction of the tangent bundle on M to N (properly, the pullback i^*TM of the tangent bundle on M to a vector bundle on N via the map i). The fiber of the normal bundle T_{M/N}\\\\overset{\\\\pi}{\\\\twoheadrightarrow} N in p\\\\in N is referred to as the normal space at p (of N in M). =Conormal bundle= If Y\\\\subseteq X is a smooth submanifold of a manifold X, we can pick local coordinates (x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) around p\\\\in Y such that Y is locally defined by x_{k+1}=\\\\dots=x_n=0; then with this choice of coordinates :\\\\begin{align} T_pX&=\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\Big\\\\lbrace\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_1}_p,\\\\dots, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_n}_p\\\\Big\\\\rbrace T_pY&=\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\Big\\\\lbrace\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_1}_p,\\\\dots, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_k}_p\\\\Big\\\\rbrace {T_{X/Y}}_p&=\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\Big\\\\lbrace\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_{k+1}}_p,\\\\dots, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_n}_p\\\\Big\\\\rbrace \\\\end{align} and the ideal sheaf is locally generated by x_{k+1},\\\\dots,x_n. Therefore we can define a non- degenerate pairing :(I_Y/I^2_Y)_p\\\\times {T_{X/Y}}_p\\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} that induces an isomorphism of sheaves T_{X/Y}\\\\simeq(I_Y/I_Y^2)^\\\\vee. We can rephrase this fact by introducing the conormal bundle defined via the conormal exact sequence :0\\\\to T^*_{X/Y}\\\\rightarrowtail \\\\Omega^1_X_Y\\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\Omega^1_Y\\\\to 0, then T^*_{X/Y}\\\\simeq (I_Y/I_Y^2), viz. the sections of the conormal bundle are the cotangent vectors to X vanishing on TY. When Y=\\\\lbrace p\\\\rbrace is a point, then the ideal sheaf is the sheaf of smooth germs vanishing at p and the isomorphism reduces to the definition of the tangent space in terms of germs of smooth functions on X : T^*_{X/\\\\lbrace p\\\\rbrace}\\\\simeq (T_pX)^\\\\vee\\\\simeq\\\\frac{\\\\mathfrak{m}_p}{\\\\mathfrak{m}_p^2}. Stable normal bundle Abstract manifolds have a canonical tangent bundle, but do not have a normal bundle: only an embedding (or immersion) of a manifold in another yields a normal bundle. However, since every manifold can be embedded in \\\\mathbf{R}^N, by the Whitney embedding theorem, every manifold admits a normal bundle, given such an embedding. There is in general no natural choice of embedding, but for a given M, any two embeddings in \\\\mathbf{R}^N for sufficiently large N are regular homotopic, and hence induce the same normal bundle. The resulting class of normal bundles (it is a class of bundles and not a specific bundle because N could vary) is called the stable normal bundle. Dual to tangent bundle The normal bundle is dual to the tangent bundle in the sense of K-theory: by the above short exact sequence, :[TN] + [T_{M/N}] = [TM] in the Grothendieck group. In case of an immersion in \\\\mathbf{R}^N, the tangent bundle of the ambient space is trivial (since \\\\mathbf{R}^N is contractible, hence parallelizable), so [TN] + [T_{M/N}] = 0, and thus [T_{M/N}] = -[TN]. This is useful in the computation of characteristic classes, and allows one to prove lower bounds on immersibility and embeddability of manifolds in Euclidean space. For symplectic manifolds Suppose a manifold X is embedded in to a symplectic manifold (M,\\\\omega), such that the pullback of the symplectic form has constant rank on X. Then one can define the symplectic normal bundle to X as the vector bundle over X with fibres : (T_{i(x)}X)^\\\\omega/(T_{i(x)}X\\\\cap (T_{i(x)}X)^\\\\omega), \\\\quad x\\\\in X, where i:X\\\\rightarrow M denotes the embedding. Notice that the constant rank condition ensures that these normal spaces fit together to form a bundle. Furthermore, any fibre inherits the structure of a symplectic vector space.Ralph Abraham and Jerrold E. Marsden, Foundations of Mechanics, (1978) Benjamin-Cummings, London By Darboux's theorem, the constant rank embedding is locally determined by i^*(TM). The isomorphism : i^*(TM)\\\\cong TX/ u \\\\oplus (TX)^\\\\omega/ u \\\\oplus( u\\\\oplus u^*), \\\\quad u=TX\\\\cap (TX)^\\\\omega, of symplectic vector bundles over X implies that the symplectic normal bundle already determines the constant rank embedding locally. This feature is similar to the Riemannian case.

It was put into practice by policies like the Aryan certificate requirement,Leila J. Rupp, Mobilizing Women for War, p 125, and later by anti-miscegenation laws such as the Nuremberg Laws, adopted unanimously by the Reichstag on 15 September 1935. Initially, these laws referred predominantly to relations between Germans classified as so- called 'Aryans' and non-Aryans, regardless of citizenship. In the early stages the culprits were targeted informally, and then later on punished systematically by a repressive legal apparatus. In the course of the ensuing war years, relations between Reichsdeutsche Germans and millions of foreign Ostarbeiters brought to Germany by force, were also legally forbidden. Concerted efforts were made to foment popular distaste for it.Majer, \\"Non- Germans\\" Under the Third Reich, p.180 These laws were justified by Nazi racial ideology, which depicted Slavic people as Untermenschen. In addition, there was a practical reason for the laws. Prior to their enactment, Polish and Soviet women and girls began giving so many unwanted births on the farms that hundreds of special homes known as Ausl√§nderkinder-Pflegest√§tte had to be created, in order to exterminate the infants out of sight. Implementation A meeting of the four Nazis who imposed Nazi ideology on the legal system of Germany. From left to right: Roland Freisler, Franz Schlegelberger, Otto Georg Thierack, and Curt Rothenberger. Prior to the Nazi ascension to power in 1933, Adolf Hitler often blamed moral degradation on Rassenschande, or on \\"bastardization\\"‚Äîa way to assure his followers of his continuing anti- Semitism, which had been toned down for popular consumption.Claudia Koonz (2003), The Nazi Conscience. Harvard University Press, p. 25, - via Google Books, preview. As early as 1924, Julius Streicher argued for the death penalty for Jews found guilty of having sexual relations with Gentiles. When the Nazis came to power, considerable clashes and infighting had stemmed from conflicting views on what constituted a Jew‚Äîanything from full Jewish background to one-sixteenth part Jewish blood were argued for‚Äîthus complicating the definition of the offense.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p 171 Some regarded the number of intermarriages as too small to be harmful; such Nazis as Roland Freisler regarded this as irrelevant owing to the \\"racial treason\\" involved.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p 173-4 Freisler published a pamphlet that called for banning \\"mixed-blood\\" sexual intercourse in 1933, regardless of the \\"foreign blood\\" involved, which faced strong public criticism and, at the time, no support from Hitler.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p 174 His superior, Franz G√ºrtner, opposed it both for reasons of popular support and such problematic issues as people who did not know they had Jewish blood, and that allegations of Jewish blood (true or false) could be used for blackmail.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p 175-6 Local officials, however, were already requiring betrothed couples to prove they were worthy to marry by presenting proof of Aryan ancestry.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p 177 In 1934, Wilhelm Frick warned local officials about banning such marriages on their own, but in 1935, authorized them to delay applications by mixed couples. Even before the Nuremberg Laws were passed, the SS regularly arrested those accused of racial defilement and paraded them through the streets with placards around their necks detailing their crime.Robert Gellately, Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, p.134 Stormtroopers acted with overt hostility toward mixed couples. One girl was paraded through the streets, with her hair shaved and a placard declaring, \\"I have given myself to a Jew.\\"Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich, p 281, Placards were widely used to humiliate.Michael Burleigh, Moral Combat: Good And Evil In World War II, p 22 Das Schwarze Korps, in its April 1935 issue, called for laws against it as preferable to the extra-legal violence being indulged in.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p. 181 It reported a story that a Jew had enticed a seventeen-year-old employee into nude midnight bathing‚Äîthe girl being saved from suicide only by the intervention of an SS patrol, and a mob of thousands besieged the Jew's house until the police took him into protective custody. Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler was the main person behind the persecution of those involved with accusations of Rassenschande.Peter Padfield, Himmler, 2013, p. 228 Nuremberg Laws In Nazi Germany, after the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935 sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and non-Aryans were prohibited. Although the laws at first were primarily against Jews, they were later extended to the Romani, Blacks, and their offspring. Persons accused of racial defilement were publicly humiliated by being paraded through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming their crime. Those convicted were sentenced to a period of time in a concentration camp. As the laws themselves did not permit the death penalty for those charged with racial defilement, the jurisdiction bypassed this and summoned special courts to allow the death penalty for such cases.Majer, \\"Non-Germans\\" Under the Third Reich, p.331-332 The extent of the law meant that the police were insufficient to the task of detecting infractions; more than three-fifths of all Gestapo cases were prompted by denunciations.Nathan Stoltzfus, Resistance of the Heart: Intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse Protest in Nazi Germany p. 11, . Germans who had intermarried with Jews and other non-Aryans prior to the Nuremberg Laws did not have their unions nullified, but were targeted and encouraged to divorce their existing partners.Nathan Stoltzfus, Resistance of the Heart: Intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse Protest in Nazi Germany p. xxvi-ii, . Rape of Jewish women during World War II was also forbidden, though it did little to stop the soldiers who often killed the woman afterwards, to ensure silence.Jan Fleischhauer, \\"Nazi War Crimes as Described by German Soldiers\\", 04/08/2011, Der Spiegel In the only case where German soldiers were prosecuted for rape during the military campaign in Poland‚Äîthe case of mass rape committed by three soldiers against the Jewish Kaufmann family in Busko-Zdr√≥j - the German judge sentenced the guilty for Rassenschande rather than rape.Numer: 17/18/2007 Wprost \\"Seksualne Niewolnice III Rzeszy\\" Foreign workers Stolperstein for Walenty Piotrowski and Franciszek Wysocki, Polish forced laborers hanged for Rassenschande on 18 June 1941 After the invasion of Poland in 1939, Nazi reports of sexual relations between Polish women and German soldiers brought about a directive issued for the press to promulgate that the links between Poles and Germans brought about a decline in German blood, and that any connection with people of Polish extraction was dangerous. The press was to describe Poles as on the same level as Jews and Gypsies in order to discourage association.Jeffrey Herf, The Jewish Enemy, p.58 The Nazi German government on 8 March 1940 issued the Polish decrees with regard to the Polish forced laborer workers in Germany stated that any Pole \\"who has sexual relations with a German man or woman, or approaches them in any other improper manner, will be punished by death.\\"Robert Gellately, Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, p.155 After the war in the East began, the race defilement law was technically extended to include all foreigners (non-Germans). Himmler issued a decree on 7 December 1942 which stated that any \\"unauthorized sexual intercourse\\" would result in the death penalty.Majer, \\"Non-Germans\\" Under the Third Reich, p.369 The Gestapo persecuted sexual relations between Germans and the peoples of Eastern Europe on the grounds of the \\"risk for the racial integrity of the German nation\\". A further decree was issued that called for applying the death penalty not only to slave laborer persons in the east who had sexual relations with Germans but also to slave laborers of Western origin, such as French, Belgian or British offenders. During the war, any German woman who had sexual relations with foreign workers was publicly humiliated by being marched through the streets with her head shaven and a placard around her neck detailing her crime.Gellately, Robert (1990). The Gestapo and German Society: Enforcing Racial Policy 1933-1945, p.224. Robert Gellately in his book The Gestapo and German Society: Enforcing Racial Policy, 1933-1945 mentions cases where German women who violated the Nazi racial laws were punished. > In September 1940, Dora von Calbitz, who was found guilty of having sexual > relations with a Pole, had her head shaved and was placed in the pillory of > her town of Oschatz near Leipzig, with a placard that proclaimed: \\"I have > been a dishonourable German woman in that I sought and had relations with > Poles.

The Gestapo and German Society: > Enforcing Racial Policy 1933-1945 Oxford: Oxford University Press. > p.236-239. The policy of prohibiting sexual relations between Germans and foreign workers was pursued to the extent that a case emerged of two young German women, one (aged 16) who was raped and the other (aged 17) who was sexually assaulted, had their heads shaved and were paraded through the streets with placards around their neck stating they were \\"without honor.\\"Robert Gellately, Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, p.182 The event was met with complete disapproval but was pursued to put fear into the German public in order to avoid the Poles. From 1940 onwards, Poles were commonly hanged in public without trial for having sexual intercourse with German women. During the war, effort was made by Nazi propaganda to Germans to propagate Volkstum (\\"racial consciousness\\"). Pamphlets were issued encouraging German women to prevent sexual relations with foreign workers brought to Germany and to view them as a danger to their \\"blood\\" (i.e. racial purity).Leila J. Rupp, Mobilizing Women for War, p.125, Particularly with the Ostarbeiters, all sexual relations, even those that did not result in pregnancy, were severely punished.Robert Edwin Herzstein, The War That Hitler Won p.139 To prevent violations of German racial laws, orders explicitly provided that the workers were to be recruited in equal numbers of men and women, so brothels would not be needed.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p.399 The program to import nannies from Eastern Europe, including Poland and Ukraine, would result in their working with German children, and quite possibly sexually exploitation; therefore, such women had to be suitable for Germanisation.Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p.255, Propaganda Inculcating acceptance of this distinction, and the need for racial hygiene was widely spread in Nazi propaganda. Nazi speakers were enjoined that many Germans did not \\"recognize what is at stake\\", citing a newspaper title that called the decision to punish sexual relations between Germans and Jews \\"A Strange Decision\\".\\"Advice for Nazi Speakers on the Jews (August 1935)\\" Even foreign propaganda urged the importance of preventing it with penalties.\\"The ‚ÄúDecent‚Äù Jew\\" Der St√ºrmer was preoccupied with such cases, with nearly every issue alleging sexual crimes, often in graphic detail, about Jews.\\"The End\\" After the Nuremberg Laws were propagated, Streicher in four of the first eight articles in 1935 of the Der St√ºrmer demanded for the death penalty in cases of race defilement. It habitually referred to voluntary relationships as \\"rape\\" and \\"molestation.\\"Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p 233 Fips portrayed, for instance, a despondent mother smoking while neglecting her child in a lonely rooming house, with a picture of her Jewish seducer on the floor, with the caption: \\"Everything in her has died. She was ruined by a Jew.\\"Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p 229 Neues Volk, was a monthly publication of the NSDAP Office of Racial Policy which answered questions about acceptable race relations, other material included promoting the excellence of the Aryan race. Even an infertile German woman could not marry a Jew because \\"it offends the honor of the German people\\" and she should break off the relationship because she is in danger of violating the law.\\"Neues Volk\\" Marriage to a Chinese man, even though the woman is pregnant is likewise forbidden, and the office had seen to it that the man was deported. A Dutch woman raised questions of not only Jewish blood but non-white blood from the colonies, but if they were answered, she would be acceptable. An article also enjoined that while foreign workers were welcome, all sexual relations were out of the question. Film was also used. In Frisians in Peril, a Frisian character objects to a half-Russian, half-Frisian girl having an affair with a Russian, because Frisian blood outweighs Russian;Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p40 her murder for this is presented as in accordance with ancient Germanic custom for \\"race pollution.\\"Richard Grunberger, The 12-Year Reich, p 384, In Die goldene Stadt, a young, innocent country girl, a Sudeten German, allows a Czech to seduce her; this racial pollution is one reason why she commits suicide, in a deliberate change insisted on by the Propaganda Ministry, since the disgraced daughter should suffer rather than the guiltless father, who committed suicide in the source.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p20 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York In Jud S√º√ü, the title Jew relentlessly pursues a pure Aryan maid; after he succeeds, by having her husband arrested and tortured, and offering to free him for her compliance, she drowns herself.Jay W. Baird, The Mythical World of Nazi War Propaganda, p 7 In Die Reise nach Tilsit, the Polish seductress persuades the German husband to murder his virtuous German wife to run off with her, but the husband fails in it and in the end, contrite, returns to his wife.Cinzia Romani, Tainted Goddesses: Female Film Stars of the Third Reich p84-6 Repeated efforts were made to propagate Volkstum, racial consciousness, to prevent sexual relations between Germans and foreign workers.Robert Edwin Herzstein, The War That Hitler Won p139 Pamphlets enjoined all German women to avoid sexual intercourse with all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their blood.Leila J. Rupp, Mobilizing Women for War, p 125, =In schools= Implementation began in schools so rapidly that book production could not keep up; the ministry held that no student should graduate \\"unless he has perceived that the future of a Volk depends on race and inheritance and understood the obligation this places on him\\", and so urged for teacher courses using mimeographed materials and cheaply produced books. Students were given racist poems to memorize (right).Claudia Koonz (2003), The Nazi Conscience, Harvard University Press, p. 137, - via Google Books. By the mid-1930s, more substantial materials were produced, including many pamphlets such as Can You Think Racially?.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p. 139. The German National Catechism, a pamphlet widely used in schools, included among its questions \\"The Jewish Question in Education\\", a pamphlet for teachers, lamented that many girls and women had been ruined by Jews because no one had warned them of the perils, \\"no one introduced them to the god-given secrets and laws of blood and race.\\"\\"The Jewish Question in Education\\" Such unions could produce children of mixed blood (\\"a lamentable creature, tossed back and forth by the blood of his two races\\"), and even when they did not, \\"the curse also sticks to the defiled mother, never leaving her for the rest of her life. Racial defilement is racial death. Racial defilement is bloodless murder. A woman defiled by the Jew can never rid her body of the foreign poison she has absorbed. She is lost to her people.\\" The League of German Girls was particularly regarded as instructing girls to avoid racial defilement. The pamphlet further claimed that Jews avoided such racial mixing, but preached to other nations to weaken them. Sentences According to an article in Der Spiegel, the Nazis accused 1,580 persons in Hamburg alone between 1936 and 1943 of race defilement with 429 of them being convicted.Gerhard Mauz, ‚ÄûUnaufgefordert vollkommen entkleidet‚Äú, Der Spiegel, 04.08.1975, http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41458330.html Punishment for race defilement for men was penal labor or prison. Women were left out of the penal legislation (some said, because of the ideology that presented them as seduced, rather than active perpetrators; some said simply because their witness was needed and a witness need not give evidence against herself); they could however be tried for perjury or similar offenses if they tried to protect their (alleged or actual) lover, or in all cases sent to a concentration camp (which was not part of the justice system, but inflicted by the Gestapo without any legal control). When Himmler asked Hitler what the punishment of women found guilty of race defilement should be, Hitler said \\"having her hair shorn and being sent to a concentration camp\\". Julius Streicher and others continued to claim the death penalty, which in some cases actually was given, using laws for aggravated punishment if using war-time brownout to commit the \\"offense\\" (on which pretext Leo Katzenberger e. g. was killed), if being a \\"dangerous habitual criminal\\", and the like. For the justification of death sentences, ordinances with broad elements of fact such as the \\"Verordnung gegen Volkssch√§dlinge\\", which came into force on 7 September 1939, were also used.

It was first isolated by the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1994. Brazzein is found in the extracellular region, in the pulp tissue surrounding the seeds. With pentadin, discovered in 1989, brazzein is the second sweet-tasting protein discovered in the Oubli fruit. Like the other sweet proteins discovered in plants, such as monellin and thaumatin, it is extremely sweet compared to commonly used sweeteners (500 to 2000 times sweeter than sucrose). The fruit tastes sweet to humans, monkeys, and bonobos, but gorillas have mutations in their sweetness receptors so that they do not find brazzein sweet, and they are not known to eat the fruit. Traditional use The Oubli plant (from which the protein was isolated) grows in Gabon and Cameroon, where its fruit has been consumed by the apes and local people for a long time. Due to brazzein and pentadin, the berries of the plant are incredibly sweet. African locals call them \\"Oubli\\" (French for \\"forgot\\") in their vernacular language because their taste is said to encourage nursing infants to forget their mother's milk, as once they eat them they are said to forget to come back to the village to see their mother. Protein structure The monomer protein, consisting of 54 amino acid residues, is the smallest of the sweet proteins with a molecular weigh of 6.5 kDa. The amino acid sequence of brazzein, adapted from the Swiss-Prot biological database of protein, is as follows: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database entry #PP56552'' The structure of brazzein was determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at a pH of 5.2 and 22 ¬∞C. Brazzein has four evenly spaced disulfide bonds and no sulfhydryl groups. 3D analysis of brazzein showed one alpha-helix and three strands of anti- parallel beta sheet. This is not superficially similar to either of the other two sweet-tasting proteins, monellin and thaumatin. However, a recent 3D study shows that these three proteins possess similar \\"sweet fingers\\" believed to elicit the sweet taste. Residues 29‚Äì33 and 39‚Äì43, plus residue 36, as well as the C-terminus were found to be involved in the sweet taste of the protein. The charge of the protein also plays an important role in its interaction with the sweet taste receptor. Based on this knowledge a synthesised improved brazzein, called pGlu-1-brazzein, was reported to be twice as sweet as the natural counterpart. Sweetness properties On a weight basis, brazzein is 500 to 2000 times sweeter than sucrose, compared to 10% sucrose and 2% sucrose solution respectively. Its sweet perception is more similar to sucrose than that of thaumatin, with a clean sweet taste, lingering aftertaste, and slight delay (longer than aspartame) in an equi-sweet solution. Brazzein is stable over a broad pH range from 2.5 to 8 and heat stable at 98¬∞C for 2 hours. As a sweetener Brazzein represents an alternative to available low-calorie sweeteners. As a protein, it is safe for diabetics. It is also very soluble in water (>50 mg/mL). When blended with other sweeteners, such as aspartame and stevia, brazzein reduces side aftertaste and complements their flavor. Its taste profile is closer to sucrose than other natural sweeteners (apart from thaumatin). Unlike other sweet-tasting proteins, it can withstand heat, making it more suitable for industrial food processing. Papers have been published showing it can be made in a laboratory using peptide synthesis and recombinant proteins were successfully produced via E. coli. The Texas companies Prodigene and Nectar Worldwide were among the licensees to use Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation patents on brazzein, and genetically engineer it into maize. Brazzein then can be commercially extracted from the maize through ordinary milling. Approximately one ton of maize yields 1-2 kilograms of brazzein. It can also be engineered into plants like wheat to make pre-sweetened grains, e.g. for cereals. A company was formed to bring it to market as a sweetener in 2008, which initially said it would start selling the product by 2010 once it obtained agreement from the FDA that its brazzein was generally recognized as safe (GRAS). In 2012 the company said that regulatory approval might take an additional one or two years and in 2014 it still had not obtained a GRAS waiver from the FDA and was seeking partners, and the product was still not on the market as of 2016.

It is sometimes referred to as Bijakovo, especially among inhabitants of the eastern side of the mountain. Its highest peak is Sveti Jure (Saint George), at 1762 m.a.s.l. It shows a typical karst landscape. Atop the peak there is a powerful FM and DVB-T transmitter. The 196 km2 of its area is protected as a nature park with over 1,500 plant and animal species, some of which are endemic.Biokovo park prirode, biokovo.com; accessed 19 March 2017. Biokovo is one in a line of Dinaric Alps stretching along the Dalmatian coast - northwest of it is Mosor and southeast are Sutvid and Riliƒá. To the east, the ≈†ibenik runs in parallel. When the weather is very clear, from the top of Biokovo it is possible to see Monte Gargano in Italy, which is away. Zabiokovlje, a mountainous area in Biokovo, includes such townlets and villages as Gornja Brela, Zadvarje, ≈Ωe≈æevica, Grabovac, Rastovac, Zagvozd, ≈Ωupa, Ra≈°ƒáane and Kozica. Major economic activities there were cattle raising, grape growing, and hunting. Part of this area is in the Biokovo Nature Park. To aid hikers, the Biokovo Nature Park Visitor Center is in downtown Makarska. However, Biokovo can be perilous if hiking unprepared - tourists erroneously imagine peaks to be closer than they are and, oblivious to the danger, have been known to go hiking wearing flip-flops, without water, wearing shirts with military camouflage patterns making them harder to spot for search and rescue teams. From 1976 to 2007, 24 hikers have died on Biokovo, while 37 had to be rescued. Professional road bicycle racing Sveti Jure has recently found itself included as a climb in professional road bicycle races. It was visited for the first time on the second stage of the 2017 Tour of Croatia. However, due to bad weather the race organisers decided to shorten the stage in accordance with the UCI Extreme weather protocol. The final route was shortened by 15,2 km, moving the finish line down to Vrata Biokova on an altitude of 820 meters. The stage was won by Croatian rider Kristijan ƒêurasek of the team UAE Team Emirates, outsprinting Jaime Ros√≥n (Caja Rural‚ÄìSeguros RGA) with eventual general classification winner Vincenzo Nibali (Bahrain- Merida) finishing third, three seconds down. The climb was revisited at the 2018 Tour of Croatia, where it was included as a 28 km long climb serving as summit finish on the third stage, which was dubbed as the queen stage of that year's edition. The stage was won by Belarusian rider Kanstantsin Siutsou riding for Team Bahrain-Merida, after 75 minutes of climbing.

The breed originated in the United States when a dog known as \\"Tennessee Lead,\\" was crossed into the Walker Hound in the 19th century. The Treeing Walker Coonhound was recognized officially as a breed by the United Kennel Club in 1945 and by the American Kennel Club in 2012. The Treeing Walker Coonhound was bred primarily to hunt raccoons, but it is also used on other game such as deer, bear or mountain lion. The breed is vocal with a distinctive bay that allows its owner to identify their hound from great distances. It has a clear, ringing voice that changes to steady chop at the tree. Walker hounds are gentle, calm, friendly dogs who make great house pets. History The Treeing Walker Coonhound was developed in the Colonial era from crosses of English Foxhounds. Two breeders from Kentucky, John W. Walker, and George Washington Maupin, are given credit for the breed's initial development. The dogs they bred were referred to as Walker Hounds, and were used to hunt raccoons. In the 1800s, a stolen black and tan dog named Tennessee Lead was crossed into the Walker Hound. Tennessee Lead was of unknown origin, but he greatly influenced the Walker. The Walker Coonhound, Treeing, was first recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1905 as a part of the English Coonhound breed, at the request of breeders. The name was later changed to Treeing Walker Coonhound, and it was fully recognized as a separate breed in 1945. It was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in January 2012, making it the AKC's 174th recognized breed. Characteristics Treeing Walker Coonhound on leash The Treeing Walker Coonhound may give an impression of a working dog. According to the UKC standard, it may stand 20 to 27 inches high at maturity, with weight in proportion. The common weight range is 50 to 70 pounds, with males being larger than females. The skull should be broad, with a long muzzle and long, hanging ears. Eyes are dark and have a soft expression. All four legs should be straight when viewed from the front or back, with cat-like, compact feet. In conformation shows, blindness or deafness is a disqualification. The smooth coat is fine and glossy and comes in a tricolor and a bi-color pattern. Tricolor, white with black and tan markings, is preferred, although bi-color dogs, black and white or tan and white, are acceptable. The Treeing Walker Coonhound has a clear bay on the trail, which should change to a distinct \\"chop\\" when treed. Its temperament should be kind but fearless and courageous on the hunt. The Treeing Walker Coonhound is bred primarily for the mouth, looks, and ability. It is first and foremost a hunting dog, although it may be kept as a pet. It is described as affectionate and good with children, but its energy requires an outlet and it must be trained. The Treeing Walker Coonhound lives an average of 12 to 13 years. =Temperament= Treeing Walker Coonhounds are loving, intelligent, confident, and enjoy interacting with humans. They make good companion dogs for an owner who understands the characteristics of the breed and is willing to work with their in-bred nature as a hunting dog. On the scent, they are tireless, alert, and intense. At home, they are mellow, sensitive lovers of comfort. Treeing Walker Coonhounds get along well with other dogs and with children. Like most hounds, they are even-tempered and difficult to annoy or drive into aggression towards people or fellow dogs. With training, they will coexist with small animals such as cats, despite their nature as a small-game hunter. A Treeing Walker Coonhound exhibiting \\"treeing\\" behavior (the dog pictured is outfitted for a walk, not hunting) Hunting Treeing Walker Coonhound, post track. The Treeing Walker Coonhound's strong tracking instincts make it popular as a hunting dog, primarily for raccoons. Hunting solo or in packs of two or more, they are used to track and tree raccoons, bobcats, cougars, and bears. Individual hounds may be adept at catching small rodents such as squirrels, roof rats, opossums, and skunks. Because of their speed, Treeing Walkers may be used as deer dogs in states where hunting of antlered animals with dogs is legal. Although the Walker is best known as a coonhound, it is not as cold-nosed as other coonhounds. It is the most popular hound for competition coon hunts, since it will forego an older track for a fresher one, thereby upping the number of raccoons caught in a shorter amount of time.

It was a publication of The Washington Post. , it had the second highest circulation in the District of Columbia after The Washington Post, and was read by 239,500 people every day. The final issue was published on September 12, 2019, after losing money and readers. History and operations The Express has been published every weekday in a tabloid format since it started publication on August 4, 2003. It is distributed by hawkers at Washington Metro stations and in newspaper racks at other locations throughout the Washington metropolitan area. It was owned and printed by the Washington Post Company, owner of The Washington Post, which is itself owned by Jeff Bezos through a holding company called Nash Holdings LLC. , it had a daily print circulation of 180,000. The Express is published by Express Publications Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Washington Post Company. Express was written and edited from the Washington Post's office on Franklin Square in Washington, D.C. Prior to 2010, it was produced from an office in Arlington, Virginia. Printing the newspaper required over 700 tons of newsprint annually. Express was written and edited by a staff of 23, up from 13 in 2003. The Post announced that its final edition of Express would be dated September 12, 2019. =Content= Although it had the same owner as The Washington Post, few of the hard-news stories were written by Post staff. Express relied on syndicated content and wire services‚Äîparticularly the Associated Press and Getty images‚Äîfor most of its content. In general, Express' content tended to be lighter than the Post's‚Äîit included sections like \\"People\\" (celebrity gossip), \\"Trending\\" (social media and Internet culture), and \\"page three\\" and \\"eyeopeners\\" (highlighting uplifting or humorous stories)‚Äîand tended to emphasize local and sports news more than the Post. The cover story of Express was often a sports story, for instance. Express always included a special section, which was different each weekday. These sections were: * Screens (Monday), a TV and movies section. * Fit (Tuesday), a health and fitness section, which also includes an advice column, \\"Baggage Check,\\" written by licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Andrea Bonior. * Federal Workforce (Wednesday), a page with articles about issues relevant to civilian federal government employees. Also typically includes a promotion for the Post's Can he do that? podcast, which covers the Trump presidency. * Weekend Pass (Thursday), an extended entertainment section with a detailed guide to the weekend's upcoming shows, concerts, museum exhibits, and the like. It was by far the largest of the special sections. * Movies (Friday), a section with reviews of new movies and trailers and some Hollywood news. * Apartment Showcase (Friday), a listing of featured apartments in the Washington metro area. Apartment Showcase is also published as a weekly independent publication. Like Express, it is owned by the Washington Post. Express also ran some special advertising sections‚Äîsuch as the Guide to the Lively Arts and the Religious Services Directory‚Äîas well as the following special monthly sections: * Ahead (Second Monday of each month), on career planning and postgraduate and continuing education. * Condo Living (Fourth Wednesday of each month), like Apartment Showcase, but specializing in condos. * Free + Easy (First Thursday of each month), a feature on free events and activities in the Washington area. Express' original stories were available on the washingtonpost.com website. The newspaper was financed solely by advertising. The newspaper did not have an opinion section or letters to the editor, unlike other newspapers in the local market such as Politico, The Washington Examiner, The Washington Post, and The Washington Times. In January 2017, Express caused some controversy on the Internet when its cover story on the 2017 Women's March used the male gender symbol instead of the female one. Express apologized for the mistake after its cover went viral, and published an image of the cover with the correct female symbol, which they had intended to run. In June 2018, Express brought back its DC Rider column, which included features about the Washington Metro and answers reader questions about the Metro transit system. The column is written by Kery Murakami. Express distributor wearing an Express vest. =Layout and mobile applications= The newspaper launched a redesign on November 30, 2009, which emphasized a more magazine-style front page, along with a daily cover story. On August 4, 2014, it launched another redesign meant to engage readers more with the paper version rather than on a phone. The paper has doubled in size since its launch, from 24‚Äì28 pages in 2003 to 48‚Äì60 pages in 2012. The Express staff also produced a website, ExpressNightOut.com, that features local entertainment and lifestyle coverage. Content from Express could also be viewed on Washington Post Social Reader, a Facebook-linked website that aggregates content from the various publications owned by the Washington Post Company and partner organizations: The Washington Post, Foreign Policy, The Root, Express, Slate, and 90 others. In August 2010, the newspaper launched a mobile application, DC Rider, which is available for iOS (iPhone and iPod Touch) and Android devices. The ad-supported app provides status updates for the Washington Metro.

It is one of three seminaries operated by the Orthodox Church in America, the others being St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, Yonkers, New York, and St. Herman's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Kodiak, Alaska. left  Overview  St. Tikhon's was founded in 1938 as a Pastoral School by resolution of the 6th All-American Sobor of the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in North America (North American Metropolia). The Seminary was officially transformed from a Pastoral School into a Seminary by the Holy Synod of the Metropolia in 1942. In 1967, the Seminary was chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A formal transfer agreement with Marywood College (now Marywood University), in nearby Scranton, was articulated and signed in 1975. In 1988, the Seminary was authorized by the Pennsylvania Department of Education to award the Master of Divinity (M. Div.) degree to its graduates. The first M. Div. degrees were conferred on the graduating class of 1989. In June 2004, the Seminary was granted accreditation by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. In March 2010 the Ministry of Education of Greece formally recognized St. Tikhon‚Äôs Seminary (STS) as an accredited institution of Higher Education, equal in standing to the schools of theology in the universities of Greece. The Greek Ministry of Education (GME) also affirmed that the Master of Divinity degree conferred by STS is equivalent to the first degree in Theology conferred by the Faculties of Theology in the Universities of Athens and Thessalonica, and therefore renders the holder eligible to pursue the graduate studies programs or the doctoral programs (Th.D.) in those universities. Moreover, by virtue of Greece‚Äôs membership in the European Union (EU), the recognition of STS as an institution of higher theological learning, equal in status with the schools of theology in Greece, also extends to all schools and religious faculties of the universities within the EU‚Äôs member states.St. Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary.

A port of this game called Samurai Warriors: State of War has been released for the PlayStation Portable, which includes additional multiplayer features. A sequel, Samurai Warriors 2, was released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, then ported to Microsoft Windows in 2008. Gameplay In Samurai Warriors, the player takes the role of a single officer in battle and must fend off hordes of enemy soldiers and defeat the enemy commander. The player has at their disposal a range of combo attacks and crowd-clearing special moves known as Musou attacks. The variety of attacks available increase as the player's character gains levels and new weapons. Musou attacks can only be performed when the character's Musou gauge is full. The Musou gauge increases when the character inflicts and receives damage. Additionally, if the character is low on health or possess a special skill, they can use their True Musou attack, a more powerful version of the regular Musou attack. Each character can equip up to five items before each battle, which will affect their attributes or give them additional abilities. Players can find items which affect their attributes through normal battle by defeating enemy officers or breaking open crates. The items which give characters special abilities are obtained by meeting conditions in specific battles. Like items, weapons can also be found in battle. Each character has four different types of weapons they can find. In addition to their base attributes, weapons will randomly have additional attributes attached to them. The value of these bonuses depends on three things: the difficulty level, the stage the player is on and the ranks the character has in the 'Discern' skill. In addition to the random weapon drops, each character has a unique fifth weapon. Unlike the other weapons, the fifth weapons have set bonuses and attributes. Fifth weapons are obtained by meeting conditions in specific battles on either the Hard or Chaos difficulty level. = Differences from Dynasty Warriors Series = Samurai Warriors contains a number of changes to Dynasty Warriors' combat system, most notably the ability to perform free-style combo attacks during Musou attack mode, during which the game enters bullet-time; common soldiers move very slowly, however officers are unaffected. Other changes include the ability to perform a roll to dodge attacks, and deflect incoming arrows with their weapon. The character development system has been overhauled. There is a new ranking system after battles which depends on five categories: *Time in which the battle is won *Amount of experience earned *Missions successfully completed in battle *Number of enemies defeated while using a Musou attack. *Number of enemies killed in total. Each of these categories is given a rank (from lowest to highest: E, D, C, B, A, S) depending on the player's performance, and then the player is given an overall rank. The higher the rank and the harder the difficulty setting of the game, the more the player's character attributes will increase. In addition to the growth of the character's stats, Skill Points are also awarded. Skill Points are used to buy skills through a skill tree that enhance the character's abilities. Samurai Warriors introduces an in-battle mission system. Each stage has a number of missions which become available depending on which character the player is controlling and the success or failure of previous missions. Missions include eliminating specific enemy officers, launching sneak attacks on enemy bases or thwarting the plans of the enemy. Success in these missions can be crucial to the outcome of many battles as failure often results in a massive loss of morale to the player's forces. It will also determine the path that will be carved out for the next stage if there is a split route. However one can choose which path to take if both routes had been opened. = Officer Training Mode = Samurai Warriors gives players the opportunity to create new characters via the officer training mode. In this mode the player creates a new character who trains under a mentor, completing twelve training sessions and a final exam. The player has a variety of tasks available for each training session based on gameplay modes and combat techniques. Each of the different tasks affects different attributes of the character. After the completion of the task the player will be ranked out of a score of 100 points, by getting more points the character's attributes will increase by a greater amount. If the character is defeated during the course of a training session, they will automatically fail and will have to spend one training session resting. After 12 test sessions have passed, the character must take a final exam. This exam consists of two training sessions back to back. The player has to score a total of 100 points between these two tests in order to pass the exam. If the player completes the final exam successfully then they will become available to use in other gameplay modes. Characters The game features a total of 15 characters based on historical figures during the Warring States period of Japan, including daimy≈ç Kenshin Uesugi, Shingen Takeda, and Nobunaga Oda as well as other notable samurai such as Yukimura Sanada and Ranmaru Mori. In addition to the figures who were noted to had fought during the period, the game also made playable a handful of female characters that did not fight in any battles, such as Oichi and Noh. Only five characters are available from the start; others can be unlocked by fulfilling specific requirements such as clearing other character's story modes. In the English version, character's names are written in western order (first name, followed by family name), whereas the official writing of historical names are in reverse (family name, followed by first name). =Starting characters= *Yukimura Sanada *Mitsuhide Akechi *Kenshin Uesugi *Oichi *Hanzo Hattori =Unlockable characters= *Keiji Maeda *Nobunaga Oda *Goemon Ishikawa *Okuni *Kunoichi *Magoichi Saika *Shingen Takeda *Masamune Date *Noh *Ranmaru Mori =Unplayable characters= *Ieyasu Tokugawa *Kennyo Honganji *Lu Bu *Nagamasa Azai =Only available in Xtreme Legends= *Hideyoshi Hashiba *Yoshimoto Imagawa *Tadakatsu Honda *Ina Note: Hideyoshi Hashiba and Yoshimoto Imagawa were unique NPCs in the title game, and were made playable in Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends. Tadakatsu Honda and his daughter, Ina were added as playable characters in the same expansion and were not unique NPCs in the game. In fact, Tadakatsu Honda appeared as a generic officer and Ina wasn't in the game at all. Lu Bu of Dynasty Warriors fame, also appears as an unplayable boss of Survival Mode. Officers created from New Officer Mode are also placed together in the character select screen. Music Unlike the traditional Chinese music and rock collaborations in the Dynasty Warriors series, Samurai Warriors combines traditional Japanese instrumentals with techno. The sounds of both Samurai Warriors and Dynasty Warriors are combined in their crossover game, Warriors Orochi. Expansions =Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends= Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends (or Samurai Warriors XL for short) is a PlayStation 2 expansion disc for Samurai Warriors. Just like the Dynasty Warriors series, the aim of these expansions is solely to add more content to the game. Players can use the \\"Import\\" feature (through switching discs with the original game) to use all features of the original game. Without the original game disc, the player will only have access to the Xtreme Legends content. This offers two new characters (Tadakatsu Honda and Ina), two unplayable characters (Hideyoshi Hashiba and Yoshimoto Imagawa) was made playable rather than cutscenes and a brand new mission and map. This also offers new weapons, items, skills, three new versus modes, a new survival mode, and fixes several problems. A new difficulty level, Novice is also added which is easier than Easy and targeted for beginners. Even after they reached rank 20 characters could still gain skill points and increase their attributes without having to the reset the character to default. Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends extended this further, by adding even more powerful sixth weapons to earn. These can only be discovered by playing on Chaos mode (or Hard mode, if the correct bonus is purchased). Exclusive to Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends, through the completion of special tasks, the player can earn Bonus Points in order to purchase special features. These features include additional costumes for characters, voice sound tests, lowering the difficulty required to unlock the fifth and sixth weapons and the ability to break the default limits for character's stats. Methods of earning bonus points include the following: earning all of a character's endings, unlocking rare items and weapons and successfully creating new characters. =Samurai Warriors: State of War= A port to the PlayStation Portable, called Samurai Warriors: State of War, was released in Japan on December 8, 2005 and March 7, 2006 in North America. It has a number of additional multiplayer features. Pachi Slot Sengoku Musou/Sengoku Rush This is a slot machine based game featuring Yukimura Sanada, Hanzo Hattori and Keiji Maeda as playable characters with their own stories using character models from Samurai Warriors. Noh, Masamune Date and Hideyoshi Hashiba are included as normal bosses, while Nobunaga Oda is a special boss. Other characters who make non-playable appearances are Kunoichi, Shingen Takeda, Okuni and Goemon Ishikawa. Reception =Samurai Warriors= The PS2 release of Samurai Warriors sold a million copies within a month in Japan and reached the Japanese platinum chart with a total of 1.06 million. It was awarded an award of excellence in CESA's 2004 Game Awards and a 34 out of 40 rating from Famitsu. The game was met with mixed reviews from Western critics. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 73% and 73 out of 100 for the PS2 version, and 71% and 71 out of 100 for the Xbox version. Most reviewers criticized the game's visual and technical similarities to the Dynasty Warriors series as the cause. What earned the most praise was the RPG element added into the game as it deviates from its spiritual predecessor by adding a higher replay value for gamers. The Create a Character mode was received with mixed results. Gameplanet commented that it is \\"well implemented\\", allowing players to accurately play a character made for them while GameSpot regarded the option as \\"a nice touch\\" but \\"rather tiresome\\" in the end. The innovations made were still met with criticism for the genre as a whole, with Eurogamer stating, \\"we‚Äôre seriously on the verge of being all warriored out.\\" =Xtreme Legends= Xtreme Legends was met with average reception; GameRankings gave it a score of 72%, while Metacritic gave it 72 out of 100. =State of War= State of War was met with mixed reception, as GameRankings gave it a score of 65%, while Metacritic gave it 64 out of 100. Legacy The game led to numerous sequels published under the name of the Samurai Warriors series. The series has shipped over 7 million units worldwide by September 3, 2016.https://web.archive.org/web/20180106173331/http://www.gifu- np.co.jp/news/kennai/20160903/201609030904_27966.shtml References External links *The Official Samurai Warriors Home Page *Samurai Warriors at Neoseeker  *Samurai Warriors XL at Koei *Samurai Warriors: KATANA (Europe) *Geki Sengoku Musou at Gamecity *Sengoku Musou KATANA at Gamecity *Sengoku Musou Anime Category:2004 video games Category:Crowd-combat fighting games Category:Cultural depictions of Oda Nobunaga Category:Cultural depictions of Hattori Hanz≈ç Category:Cultural depictions of Tokugawa Ieyasu Category:Koei games Category:Koei Tecmo franchises Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Video games about samurai Category:Sengoku period in fiction Category:Sengoku video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in feudal Japan Category:Xbox games ","title":"Samurai Warriors"},{"id":"2370279","text":"Encounter or Encounters may refer to: Film *Encounters (film), a 1993 Australian thriller *Encounter, a 1997 Indian film by Nimmala Shankar *Encounter (2013 film), a Bengali film *Encounter (2018 film), an American sci-fi film Music *Encounter!, a 1968 album by Pepper Adams *Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster or Encounters, an album by Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster *Encounter (Mark Holden album) (1977) *Encounter (Michael Stearns album) (1988) *Place Vend√¥me (Swingle Singers with MJQ album) or Encounter *Encounter (Trio 3 album) (2000) *Encounters (album), a 1984 album by Mal Waldron *Encounters, an album by Sylvan *\\"Encounter\\", a 2016 song by Chris Quilala from Split the Sky * Encounter, a song in the video game Metal Gear Solid Ships *HMS Encounter (1846) *HMS Encounter (1873), a wooden-screw corvette *HMS Encounter (H10), an E-class destroyer launched in 1934 *HMAS Encounter (1902), a Challenger-class protected cruiser *HMAS Encounter (naval base), a former naval depot in South Australia Television *Encounter (1958 TV series), a 1958 CBC/ABC anthology television series *Encounter (1960 TV program), a Canadian talk show television program *Encounter (1970 TV program), a Canadian political affairs television program *Encounters (TV series), a 1994 American television series *Encounter (Indian TV series) (2014) *Encounter (South Korean TV series) (2018) Other uses *Encounter (psychology), an authentic, congruent meeting between individuals *Encounter (magazine), a literary magazine *Encounter (game), an international network of active urban games *Encounter (video game), a 1983 game by Novagen *Encounters (anthology), a 2004 anthology of speculative fiction *Encounter (sculpture), an bronze sculpture by Bruce Beasley See also *Close encounter, a claimed UFO sighting *The Encounter (disambiguation) *Encounter Bay (disambiguation) *Encounter killings by police, killing in a gun fight with the police in the Indian subcontinent, sometimes an extrajudicial killing *HMS Encounter, a list of ships * ","title":"Encounter"},{"id":"2370288","text":"Altos is a city and district of the Cordillera Department, Paraguay. Etymology Church of Altos It is also called ‚ÄúAltos de Ybypytar√©‚Äù, which in Guaran√≠ means ‚Äúpath of the wind‚Äù, previously called ‚ÄúSan Lorenzo de la Cordillera de los Altos‚Äù, one of the oldest cities of Paraguay. It is known as the ‚ÄúTerrace of the country‚Äù because of its high altitude. Climate The climate in this department is mild and dry. The average temperature is 22¬∞ Celsius, in summer reaches 39 ¬∞C and in winter drops to 3 ¬∞C. Demography Altos‚Äô population is 13,114 in total, 6,862 men and 6,252 women, according to information provided by the Statistics, Polls and Census General Direction. History There are two versions of its foundation. The first tells that Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala founded it, on August 10, 1538. The second one tells that it was Friar Luis de Bola√±os in 1580, with the purpose of being the first ‚ÄúReducci√≥n Guaran√≠‚Äù of R√≠o de la Plata and Paraguay. Atrium of the Church of Altos It was the hiding place of Joseph Mengele, notorious nazi scientist and medical doctor, who experimented in the Nazi concentration camps. Mengele and his wife flew to Altos in 1959, after the government of West Germany discovered their home in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and he received the notification for arrest. His wife did not adapt to this new life and left him. In 1960, he panicked after hearing news of the interest of the nazi hunter in his capture, and with kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann, left Altos to go to Hohenau in the South of Paraguay. Economy The Altos is known for the harvesting of pharmacological plants and coffee, as well as general agriculture, woodcraft, and the breeding of horned cattle. Tourism The church is from the time of the Jesuit Missions and in honor of its patron saint, San Lorenzo (Saint Lawrence). It is located in Heroes' Square in the center of the city. Marshal Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia's fatal plane crash was near the city of Altos, by the Agua√≠ Stream. The most important artisan production is the carving of timb√≥ wood in the shape of animals, mythological beings and masks that are later painted with intense colors. The masks became famous as ‚Äúkamba ra‚Äôanga‚Äù, an image of the mulatto, used in the re-enactments of the battles between the kamb√° (mulattos) and the guaicur√∫es (natives), during the festivities of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, on July 28 and 29th in Itaguaz√∫, located 2 kilometers from Altos. This is an important festivity of colonial origins in which are also organized games and prepared typical food. The route to access the city provides a beautiful landscape for visitors to enjoy, because it goes up a chain of mountains and looks down onto the Ypacara√≠ Lake and the exuberant vegetation surrounding it. ‚ÄúThe Tukanga Route‚Äù is an outing offered by the Municipality and it is called that way because of the abundance of ‚Äútucanes‚Äù (toucans) in the area. The region is distinctive for its richness in natural resources. There is also the Saldivar Stream, located in a natural reserve with more than 4 hectares, 8 kilometers from the center of city. The farm ‚ÄúEl Gaucho‚Äù has 4 hectares of abundant vegetation, with modern and comfortable amenities that recreate colonial times. The rural hotel ‚ÄúLa Grappa‚Äù offers visitors the natural environment of the mountainous country, in addition to nights of Paraguayan and Latin American folklore. A square in Altos People from Altos Altos is the hometown of the internationally renowned artist Luis Alberto del Paran√°. His house is located in the historical area of the city. Luis Alberto traveled through all Europe, entertaining with his music and receiving important awards for his records. Municipality of Altos How to get to Altos Altos is situated on the asphalt road turning off from Ruta 2 near Ypacara√≠, passing San Bernardino, Altos, Loma Grande, Nueva Colombia and leading in Ruta 3 in Emboscada. There is also an asphalt road connecting Altos with Atyr√°. The new ECO V√≠a highway connects Luque with San Bernardino. If you can find your way, this is now the fastest connection from Asunci√≥n to Altos, especially if you are arriving from the airport area. A bus line connects Altos to Gran Asunci√≥n. LOMA GRANDE (yellow buses) circle line starts in Loma Grande, serves Altos, San Bernardino, and Ypacara√≠, then follows Ruta 2 to San Lorenzo, continues to Fernando de la Mora (calle Mcal.

The field produces a 10.5 degree API gravity crude oil from the Eocene Misoa Formation locally called the Bosc√°n Formation. Current estimates of oil in place are greater than 25 billion barrels of oil. The field was discovered in 1946 by Chevron with drilling of the Zulia 7F-1 well (renamed BN-257) which tested . This well encountered reservoir section very close to the Bosc√°n east bounding fault at about measured depth (MD). Production began in 1947. The field is currently operated by the Empresa Mixta Petroboscan, a joint venture between Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) and Chevron.  Stratigraphy  The stratigraphic section at Bosc√°n Field consists of sands and shales of Oligocene and Eocene ages deposited in a tidally-influenced fluvial-deltaic depositional setting. The Oligocene sediments are commonly non-oil bearing and are dominantly shaley. The Eocene sands are part of the Misoa Formation and form the producing reservoir section locally known as the Bosc√°n Formation.  Structure  The Bosc√°n structure is a southwest-dipping monocline (flat, tilting surface) which contains oil over a very large depth range from to below sea level. The reservoir is broken by a series of normal faults, many of which have strike-slip movement; these faults may compartmentalize the reservoir over parts of the field.  Trapping mechanism  The productive section in the field is associated with a regional unconformity between the Oligocene Icotea Formation and the older Eocene sandstones. Shales and other tight formations in the Icotea Formation provide the trap preventing vertical migration. On the east side of the field a large strike-slip fault provides additional trapping of oil, preventing it from moving laterally to the east.  Production  Bosc√°n Field has produced over of oil, less than 6% of oil in place. There have been a total of 950 oil wells drilled in the field with approximately 525 active wells as of December, 2015. Current production is approximately 110,000 barrels per day. The reservoir drive is a combination of weak aquifer drive on the south flank, solution gas expansion, and gravity drainage. Produced water is currently injected at a rate of approximately 90,000 barrels per day for pressure maintenance support.

Rose Field notes of the definition in a May 23, 1926 New York Times article, \\"the simplest being efficient living\\". A right to environment. The Flynn effect has been often cited as an example of euthenics. Another example is the steady increase in body size in industrialized countries since the beginning of the 20th century. Euthenics is not normally interpreted to have anything to do with changing the composition of the human gene pool by definition, although everything that affects society has some effect on who reproduces and who does not. Origin of the term Ellen Swallow Richards, the first female student and instructor at MIT. The term was derived in the late 19th century from the Greek verb eutheneo, Œµ·ΩêŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒ≠œâ (eu, well; the, root of œÑŒØŒ∏Œ∑ŒºŒπ tithemi, to cause). (To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.‚ÄîDemosthenes. To be strong or vigorous.‚ÄîHerodotus. To be vigorous in body.‚ÄîAristotle.) Also from the Greek Euthenia, Œï·ΩêŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒØŒ±. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.‚ÄîHerodotus. The opposite of Euthenia is Penia, Œ†ŒµŒΩŒØŒ± (\\"deficiency\\" or \\"poverty\\") the personification of poverty and need.Theoi Project - Penia History Ellen Swallow Richards (Born in 1842-died in 1911; Vassar Class of '70) was one of the first writers to use the term, in The Cost of Shelter (1905), with the meaning \\"the science of better living\\". It is unclear if (and probably unlikely that) any of the study programs of euthenics ever completely embraced Richards' multidisciplinary concept, though several nuances remain today, especially that of interdisciplinarity. =Vassar College Institute of Euthenics= Julia Clifford Lathrop as the first chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau. After Richards' death in 1911, Julia Lathrop (1858-1932; VC '80) continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in euthenics at the college. Lathrop soon teamed with alumna Minnie Cumnock Blodgett (1862‚Äì1931; VC '84), who with her husband, John Wood Blodgett, offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at Vassar College. Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar president Henry Noble MacCracken in 1922, began in earnest by 1923, under the direction of Professor Annie Louise Macleod (Chemistry; First woman PhD, McGill University, 1910). According to Vassar's chronology entry for March 17, 1924, \\"the faculty recognized euthenics as a satisfactory field for sequential study (major). A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a multidisciplinary program [radical at the time] focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. Students in euthenics could take courses in horticulture, food chemistry, sociology and statistics, education, child study, economics, economic geography, physiology, hygiene, public health, psychology and domestic architecture and furniture. With the new division came the first major in child study at an American liberal arts college.\\" For example, a typical major in child study in euthenics includes introductory psychology, laboratory psychology, applied psychology, child study and social psychology in the Department of Psychology; the three courses offered in the Department of Child Study; beginning economics, programs of social reorganization and the family in Economics; and in the Department of Physiology, human physiology, child hygiene, principles of public health.* The Vassar Summer Institute of Euthenics accepted its first students in June 1926. Created to supplement the controversial euthenics major which began February 21, 1925, it was also located in the new Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics (York & Sawyer, architects; ground broke October 25, 1925). Some Vassar faculty members (perhaps emotionally upset with being displaced on campus to make way, or otherwise politically motivated) contentiously \\"believed the entire concept of euthenics was vague and counter-productive to women's progress.\\" Having overcome a lukewarm reception, Vassar College officially opened its Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics in 1929. Dr. Ruth Wheeler (Physiology and Nutrition ‚Äì VC '99) took over as director of euthenics studies in 1924. Wheeler remained director until Mary Shattuck Fisher Langmuir (VC '20) succeeded her in 1944, until 1951. The college continued for the 1934‚Äì35 academic year its successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls. Intended to help students meet their college costs by working in their residences. For example, in Main, students earned $40 a year by doing relatively light work such as cleaning their rooms. In 1951, Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20) donated $400,000, through the Rubicon Foundation, to Vassar to help fund operating deficits in the current and succeeding years and to improve faculty salaries. \\"Discontinued for financial reasons, the Vassar Summer Institute for Family and Community Living, founded in 1926 as the Vassar Summer Institute of Euthenics, held its last session, July 2, 1958. This was the first and last session for the institute's new director, Dr. Mervin Freedman.\\" =Elmira College= Elmira College is noted as the oldest college still in existence which (as a college for women) granted degrees to women which were the equivalent of those given to men (the first to do so was the now-defunct Mary Sharp College). Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969. A special article was written in the December 12, 1937 New York Times, quoting recent graduates of Elmira College, urging for courses in colleges for men on the care of children. Reporting that \\"preparation for the greatest of all professions, that of motherhood and child-training, is being given the students at Elmira College in the Nursery School which is Conducted as part of the Department of Euthenics.\\" Elmira College was one of the first of the liberal arts colleges to recognize the fact that women should have some special training, integrated with the so-called liberal studies, which would prepare them to carry on, with less effort and fewer mistakes, a successful family life. Courses in nutrition, household economics, clothing selection, principles of foods and meal planning, child psychology, and education in family relations are a part of the curriculum. The Elmira College nursery school for fifteen children between the ages of two and five years was opened primarily as a laboratory for college students, but it had become so popular with parents in the community that there was always a long waiting list. The New York Times article notes how the nursery had become one of the essential laboratories of the college, where recent mothers testified to the value of the training they received while in college. \\"Today,\\" one graduate said, \\"when it is often necessary for young women to continue professional work outside the home after marriage, it is important that young fathers, who must share in the actual care and training of the children, should have some knowledge of correct methods.\\" =Today= Many factors led to the movement never getting the funding it needed to remain relevant, including: vigorous debate about the exact meaning of euthenics, a strong antifeminism movement paralleling even stronger women's rights movements, confusion with the term eugenics, the economic impact of the Great Depression and two world wars. These factors also prevented the discipline from gaining the attention it needed to put together a lasting, vastly multidisciplinary curriculum. Therefore, it split off into separate disciplines. Child Study is one such curriculum. Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that \\"Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists.\\"HEARTH Library-Cornell University Thus, the end of euthenics as originally defined by Ellen Swallow Richards ensued. Relationship with eugenics According to Ellen Richards, in her book Euthenics: the science of controllable environment (1910): Debate, misconceptions and opposition Lester Frank WardAbraham Flexner, c. 1895. Margaret Sanger, 1922 Charles Benedict Davenport, ca. 1929 Debate over misconceptions about the movement started almost from the beginning. In his comparison \\"Eugenics, Euthenics, And Eudemics\\", (American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 18, No. 6, May 1913), Lester F. Ward of Brown University opens the second section regarding euthenics lamenting: Ward later noted about the organic environment that: Vassar historians note that \\"critics faulted the new program as a weakening of science and a slide into vocationalism. The influential educator and historian of education, Abraham Flexner‚Äîone of the founders of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study‚Äîattacked the program, along with other \\"ad hoc\\" innovations like intercollegiate athletics and student governments, in Universities, American, English, German (1930).\\" In the summer of 1926, Margaret Sanger created a stir when she gave a radio address, called \\"Racial Betterment\\", in the first Euthenics Institute, where she praised attempts to \\"close our gates to the so-called 'undesirables'\\" and proposed efforts to \\"discourage or cut down on the rapid multiplication of the unfit and undesirable at home\\", by government-subsidized voluntary sterilization.

A graduate of Cheng Kung Senior High School and Tamkang University, Xiong is best known for writing wuxia novels and serials, which include Juedai Shuangjiao, Xiaoli Feidao Series, Chu Liuxiang Series, Lu Xiaofeng Series and The Eleventh Son. Some of these works have been adapted into films and television series for numerous times. In the 1980s, he started his own film studio, Bao Sian, to produce film adaptations of his works. Life Xiong was born on 7 June 1938 in Hong Kong but his registered identity stated that he was born in 1941. His ancestral home was in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, and he lived in Hankou in his childhood. He moved to Taipei, Taiwan in 1952 with his parents, who divorced in 1956. With help from his friends and using the money he earned from part-time work to fund his education, Xiong graduated from the Foreign Language Department of Tamkang University.  Career  Xiong worked at the United States Army Advisory in Taipei. In 1960, Xiong published his first wuxia novel, Cangqiong Shenjian (), under the pen name \\"Gu Long\\". From 1960 to 1961, Xiong published eight novels but did not achieve the results he desired. He moved to Ruifang District (in New Taipei City) and lived there for three years, after which he changed his perspective and adopted a new writing style. Between 1967 and the late 1970s, he rose to prominence in the genre of modern wuxia fiction for his works. As the sole representative of excellence in the wuxia genre from Taiwan for an entire decade, Xiong was named along with Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng as the \\"Three Legs of the Tripod of Wuxia\\".  Personal life  While Xiong was still in university, Xiong lived with a dance hostess, Zheng Yuexia (), and had a son, Zheng Xiaolong (), with her. However, he started a relationship later with another dance hostess, Ye Xue (), who also bore him a son, Ye Yikuan (). Shortly after that, he met a senior middle school graduate, Mei Baozhu (), who became his first legal spouse and bore him his third son, Xiong Zhengda (). His extramarital affairs caused him to break up with Mei eventually. In the later part of his life, Xiong suffered from depression and the quality of his works declined rapidly. He had to employ ghostwriters to co-write many of his later works because of his ailing health. On 21 September 1985, Xiong died at the age of 48. Xiong's death was caused by illness wrought by alcoholism ‚Äì namely cirrhosis and esophageal hemorrhage. His friends brought him 48 bottles of XO Cognac at his funeral. Writing style Xiong was said to be influenced not only by wuxia fiction, but also by the works of Ernest Hemingway, Jack London, John Steinbeck and Friedrich Nietzsche. His novels are usually made up of short sentences and paragraphs, and mostly dialogues between characters ‚Äì like a play script. In contrast with Xiong, other writers such as Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng took an alternative route in writing wuxia fiction by incorporating Chinese history, culture and philosophical ideas in their works. Xiong initially intended to follow them but changed his decision after exposure to works such as the James Bond series and The Godfather novels.

Sutlive trophies for community service and assisted The Catoosa County News in achieving the General Excellence award in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and a National Press Association award for Local News coverage.The Catoosa County News (USA)2 July 2003, pg. 8A, by: Staff reports, \\"Simply the best\\" and annual award articles July 2002, 2004-2009 =Screenwriting= His love of writing blossomed into script writing under the tutorage of Carroll O'Connor during his time on In the Heat of the Night, which yielded him the unique opportunity to co-write the screenplay for the No. 1 Country song \\"Wolverton Mountain\\" with Merle Kilgore.IFCO Club House (USA)January 1998, pg. 23, by: Loudilla Johnson, \\"Randall Franks and Merle Kilgore\\" Music Artist =Early musical experiences= As a child, Franks was exposed to the rich heritage of Georgia fiddlin' at family reunions. Franks' desire to learn was sparked at the age of eight when he heard the \\"Orange Blossom Special\\" by Ervin Rouse. He was inspired to study both classically with Donald Grisier, Ph.D.http://www.sgmradio.com/2010/03/31/artist-feature-randall-franks/ and at the feet of some of Georgia's fiddle legends such as the Skillet Licker Gordon Tanner, WSB Barndance host Cotton Carrier, Dallas Burrell, and Anita Sorrells Mathis. While still in school, Franks formed the children's bluegrass band The Peachtree Pickers. It was through this act that he gained attention from national acts and television becoming a regular on the Country Kids TV Series and appearing for the Grand Ole Opry. The group released five albums.Music City News (USA)December 1984, Vol. 23, Iss. 6, pg. 9, by: Lydia Dixon Harden, \\"Alabama makes history at Eighteenth CMA Awards - The Peachtree Pickers entertain\\" To support the group's efforts Franks started a Randall \\"Randy\\" Franks Peachtree Picker Fan Club, coordinated by Pearl Bruce. The club grew to include around 8,000 fans by 1986 rivaling and exceeding those of top country stars of the period. Franks created The Pickin' Post newsletter to keep the large group of fans informed sharing info on his career as well as Southern bluegrass festivals and other groups. The club also launched The Singing Post for fans exclusively interested in gospel music. The club grew even more dramatically during Franks' success on television. =Fiddling= The influence of the Georgia Fiddle Bands is apparent within Franks's style and recordings. He was exposed to the work of Fiddlin' John Carson, The Skillet Lickers and other Georgia fiddlers. He grew and gained skills by competing in Georgia fiddle contests, many fostered by World Record Mandolinist Bill Lowery as well as the Grand Ole Opry's Grand Master Fiddler Championship. Franks became a regular performer at the Grand Master Championship for the Opry. His bluegrass recording Tunes and Tales from Tunnel Hill includes a fact-based comedy recording entitled \\"Big Tige, Mr. Roy and Me,\\" describing a teenage adventure with Opry fiddling stars Benny Martin and Roy Acuff following a Grand Masters Championship. In the 1990s Georgia honored Franks for his work to preserve the heritage of Georgia's fiddling by naming a state-sponsored fiddle contest in his honor hosted then at Lake Lanier Islands.The Times (USA)22 April 1994, pg. 3D, by: Sandra Stringer, \\"Festival features fiddling, food, crafts\\" The Randall Franks Trophy is presented to the winner each year at the 1890s Day Jamboree Old Time Fiddler's Convention in Ringgold, Georgia.The Catoosa County News (USA) 14 October 2009, by: None listed, \\"Randall Franks Trophy winner places at Grand Master Fiddler Championship\\" Randall Franks Trophy winners 1994-2018 are Jack Weeks, Roy Crawford, Johnny Ray Watts (Three-Times), Aerin DeJarnette, Mark Ralph, Doug Fleener, Megan Lynch, Maddie Denton (Five-Times), and Tyler Andal.\\"Encouragers II: Walking with the Masters\\" Peach Picked Publishing by: Randall Franks Randall Franks Trophy winner places at Grand Master Fiddler Championship\\" Franks also co- hosts America's Grand Master Fiddler Championship annually in Nashville at the Country Music Hall of Fame. Franks recorded four fiddle recordings including Peach Picked Fiddle Favorites, Pick of the Peaches Fiddlin', Golden River Fiddlin', and Sacred Sounds of Appalachia. =Bill Monroe= In the 1980s, the Father of Bluegrass, Bill Monroe took a special interest in the young band and especially the young fiddler. Monroe spent hours teaching and sharing with Franks much like Monroe's Uncle Pen had done for him. With the departure of Kenny Baker, Franks was asked to join the Blue Grass Boys. Still in school, he took off to tour from coast to coast. Though school beckoned him back, Franks continued to make appearances with Monroe up until he stopped touring. For his contributions to the work of Bill Monroe, Franks was honored by the state of Kentucky.BMP - Bluegrass Music Profiles (USA)August 2008, pg. 40, by: None listed, \\"Blue Grass Boys Memories with Randall Franks\\" Randall has joined other members of the Blue Grass Boys in special performances beginning in 2007. =SEBA and fostering bluegrass= Franks founded the SouthEastern Bluegrass Association (SEBA) in 1984 to preserve, promote and publicize Bluegrass Music. Through the organization which has grown to one of the country's largest he supported the creation of the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA).http://m.chronicle.augusta.com/things- do/applause/2011-01-12/georgia-bluegrass-performer-honored-founders-award Franks saw a bluegrass void in some areas in his home state of Georgia so in the mid-1980s he began promoting bluegrass concerts using regional talent in communities that did not have bluegrass events nearby to increase the visibility of the field outside bluegrass festivals. He carried this endeavor one step farther during his off time from In the Heat of the Night when he began the Share with D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) concert series held in communities in several states featuring acts including Jim and Jesse, The Lewis Family, the Osborne Brothers, himself and others. The shows showcased bluegrass stars while raising awareness and funds for a program to help keep children off drugs.Cordele Dispatch (USA)23 February 1993, Vol. 76, Iss. 37, by: None listed, \\"Stars to Share with DARE\\" =Doodle and the Golden River Grass= Franks was also tapped by Folk Music's Doodle and the Golden River Grass to fill the fiddle role in the internationally recognized Appalachian performing group. He joined the group featuring John \\"Doodle\\" Thrower, James Watson, Gene Daniell, Wesley Clackum, and C.J. Clackum beginning in 1985 carrying on the Georgia Fiddle Band tradition.

Franks appeared live and on television with the group which went on to become an integral part of Bill Gaither (gospel singer)'s Homecoming Friends. =Randall's Solo Career= After the members of the Peachtree Pickers embarked on different journeys in college, Franks decided to focus on creating music as a solo artist and studying acting. He juggled his own performances between guest appearances with various acts and acting opportunities. Making his first guest star appearance for the Grand Ole Opry in 1983, he continued appearing for the mother church of country music through the late 1990s. In 1989, Franks released Golden River Fiddlin to the Folk and Bluegrass markets. SPBGMA, the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America, said Franks had a \\"special touch on the fiddle\\" while Bluegrass Unlimited called him \\"hard driving‚Ä¶straightahead‚Ä¶solid‚Ä¶sure‚Äù like Tommy Jackson and Paul Warren. Franks began the 1990s as he crossed over to the Southern Gospel market being the first bluegrass performer to take his solo music project Handshakes and Smiles to the Top 20 Sales Charts.Music City News (USA)June 1990, Vol. 27, Iss. 12, pg. 91, \\"Top LPs with Hot Tracks\\" Singing News gave it Four Stars.The Singing News (USA)March 1990, Vol. 20, Iss. 11, pg. 73, by: Jerry Kirksey, \\"Handshakes and Smiles\\" He directed a music video of \\"Handshakes and Smiles\\" for the project which was nominated for a Telly Award and ran on country and gospel cable channels as well as NBC and CBS stations. Alan Autry, David Hart, Pop Lewis, Jesse McReynolds, Travis Lewis, Mark Wheeler and Lewis Phillips were among those making a special appearance. Franks formed his Hollywood Hillbilly Jamboree in the early 1990s, continuing a musical legacy begun by Ramblin' \\"Doc\\" Tommy Scott in 1945, bringing his unique style of bluegrass into fairs, festivals and communities not normally including bluegrass in their annual celebrations. His country variety show included a variety of stars, one of those casts were Donna Douglas (Elly Mae Clampett of The Beverly Hillbillies), Sonny Shroyer (Enos from The Dukes of Hazzard), and himself. Another television commercials package featured Dan Biggers (Doc Robb from In the Heat of the Night).

His \\"Let's Live Everyday Like It Was Christmas\\" single with Grand Ole Opry stars The Whites was given a nod as one of the top Country Vocal Collaborations. He presented Del McCoury his Male Vocalist of the Year Award at the IBMA Awards in Owensboro, Kentucky in 1992. Franks was tapped to host the SPBGMA Bluegrass Music Awards in Nashville, Tennessee at the Roy Acuff Theater in 1995. His 2000 Crimson CD God's Children pays homage to the brother duets of the 1930s. The project includes appearances by David Davis, Sonny Shroyer, Enos from The Dukes of Hazzard, the late Cotton and Jane Carrier and Marty Hays.

Upon graduation, he entered a position as sales and promotions manager for Atlanta- based MBM Records. He also served as director for A & R for its family of labels including Encore and ASL and coordinated its publishing company.Marietta Daily Journal (USA)10 December 1987, by: Donna Harris, \\"Smyrna studio seeking that perfect sound\\" He quickly discovered that independent bluegrass and gospel music recordings were difficult to market amongst mainstream retailers, but he set out to make the music he loved available in as many outlets as he could. Bluegrass label Atteiram Records also called upon Franks as a graphic artist and liner note writer using him to design album covers or cassette inserts for many of its artists. Some among those were The Crain Brothers, Appalachian Express, James Monroe, Jim Southern and Southern Sounds, Joe Stuart and Carl Sauceman, Brother Birch Monroe, Frank Buchanan, Carl Story and the Rambling Mountaineers, Vic Jordan, The Ridgerunners, The Boyd Brothers, Hubert Cox and the Southern Grass, The Blue Ridge Gentlemen, The Pinnacle Boys, and Southwind. As he rose in popularity on television, he used his celebrity status to break down the barriers that he previously faced as a record executive and many other bluegrass and gospel artists encountered by calling mainstream and Christian retail buyers and store managers directly using his podium from NBC and CBS to assist record companies and distributors in marketing his and other bluegrass and gospel product. Through the effort his products and many other artists sold by the companies he worked with became available in record chains throughout the country. He produced his own recordings and also shared his studio expertise with other artists. At a time when the industry was made of largely of established stars rather than rising new performers, Franks joined fellow rising star Alison Krauss as the most visible fiddlers and personalities of the industry in the late eighties and early nineties. With Franks' widespread notoriety he gained by weekly network exposure, he worked to expose bluegrass and Southern Gospel to this new audience appearing on radio and television talk, news and entertainment shows. Franks continues to appear on radio stations in all formats, television stations throughout the country, and gives print interviews talking about and sharing the music he loves.Bluegrass by the Bay (USA) October 1992, Vol. 10, Iss. 10, pg. 7,12,19, by: Nick Nichols, \\"TV Actor Randall Franks seeks to expose wider audience to bluegrass and country music\\" =In the Heat of the Night Christmas= Serving both as an artist and producer, Randall Franks and his In the Heat of the Night co-star Alan Autry joined forces under the banner of Autry-Franks Productions to produce the charity In the Heat of the Night CD Christmas Time's A Comin featuring the cast of the show.

It was the first World Youth Day and foreign trip of Pope Benedict XVI, who joined the festival on August 18. This meeting was decided by the previous pope, John Paul II, during the Toronto World Youth Day of 2002. The theme was \\"We have come to worship Him\\" (from Matthew 2:2). About 400,000 young people from 200 countries attended during the week, and more than 1,000,000 came for the weekend. They were joined by about 600 bishops and cardinals, as well as by 6,600 reporters.

They consist primarily of the descendants of the elite Ottoman Janissary corps and Ottoman- era converts to Islam from Greek Macedonia (e.g., Vallahades), Crete (Cretan Muslims), northeastern Anatolia and the Pontic Alps (Pontic Greeks). They are currently found mainly in western Turkey (particularly the regions of Izmir, Bursa, and Edirne) and northeastern Turkey (particularly in the regions of Trabzon, G√ºm√º≈ühane, Sivas, Erzincan, Erzurum, and Kars) (see also Caucasus Greeks of Georgia and Kars Oblast and Islam in Georgia). Despite their ethnic Greek origin, the contemporary Grecophone Muslims of Turkey regarding their identity have been steadily assimilated into the Turkish-speaking (and in the northeast Laz-speaking) Muslim population. Apart from their elders, sizable numbers, even the young within these Grecophone Muslim communities have retained a knowledge of Greek and or its dialects such as Cretan Greek and Pontic Greek,Mackridge, Peter (1987). \\"Greek-speaking Moslems of north-east Turkey: prolegomena to a study of the Ophitic sub-dialect of Pontic.\\" Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies. 11. (1): 117. though very few are likely to call themselves Greek Muslims. This is due to gradual assimilation into Turkish society, as well as the close association of Greece and Greeks with Orthodox Christianity and their perceived status as a historic, military threat to the Turkish Republic. In Greece, Greek-speaking Muslims are not usually considered as forming part of the Greek nation.Mackridge, Peter (2010). Language and national identity in Greece, 1766‚Äì1976. Oxford University Press. p. 65. \\"Greek-speaking Muslims have not usually been considered as belonging to the Greek nation. Some communities of Greek-speaking Muslims lived in Macedonia. Muslims, most of them native speakers of Greek, formed a slight majority of the population of Crete in the early nineteenth century. The vast majority of these were descended from Christians who had voluntarily converted to Islam in the period following the Ottoman conquest of the island in 1669.\\" In the late Ottoman period (particularly following the Greco-Turkish war of 1897‚Äì98) several communities of Grecophone Muslims from Crete and southern Greece were also relocated to Libya, Lebanon and Syria, where in towns like al-Hamidiyah some of the older generation continue to speak Greek.Barbour, S., Language and Nationalism in Europe, Oxford University Press, 2000, Historically, Greek Orthodoxy has been associated with being Romios, i.e. Greek, and Islam with being Turkish, despite ethnic or linguistic references.Hodgson, Marshall (2009). The Venture of Islam, Volume 3: The Gunpower Empires and Modern Times. University of Chicago Press. Chicago. pp. 262‚Äì263. \\"Islam, to be sure, remained, but chiefly as woven into the character of the Turkish folk. On this level, even Kemal, unbeliever as he was, was loyal to the Muslim community as such. Kemal would not let a Muslim-born girl be married to an infidel. Especially in the early years (as was illustrated in the transfer of populations with Greece) being a Turk was still defined more by religion than by language: Greek-speaking Muslims were Turks (and indeed they wrote their Greek with the Turkish letters) and Turkish-speaking Christians were Greeks (they wrote their Turkish with Greek letters). Though language was the ultimate criterion of the community, the folk-religion was so important that it might outweigh even language in determining basic cultural allegiance, within a local context.\\" Most Greek speaking Muslims in Greece left for Turkey during the 1920s population exchanges under the Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations (sometimes in return for Turkish-speaking Christians such as the Karamanlides). Due to the historical role of the millet system, religion and not ethnicity or language was the main factor used during the exchange of populations. All Muslims who departed Greece were seen as \\"Turks\\", whereas all Orthodox people leaving Turkey were considered \\"Greeks\\", regardless of ethnicity or language.Poulton, Hugh (2000). \\"The Muslim experience in the Balkan states, 1919‚Äê1991.\\" Nationalities Papers. 28. (1): 46. \\"In these exchanges, due to the influence of the millet system (see below), religion not ethnicity or language was the key factor, with all the Muslims expelled from Greece seen as \\"Turks,\\" and all the Orthodox people expelled from Turkey seen as \\"Greeks\\" regardless of mother tongue or ethnicity.\\" An exception was made for Muslims (Pomaks and Western Thrace Turks) who inhabit east of river Nestos which is in East Macedonia and Thrace, Northern Greece, who are officially recognized as a religious, but controversially not as an ethnic minority by the Greek Government.See Hugh Poulton, 'The Balkans: minorities and states in conflict', Minority Rights Publications, 1991. In Turkey, where most Greek-speaking Muslims live, there are various groups of Grecophone Muslims, some autochthonous, some from parts of present-day Greece and Cyprus who migrated to Turkey under the population exchanges or immigration. A Muslim Greek Mamluk (Louis Dupr√©, oil on canvas, 1825) Reasons for conversion to Islam As a rule the Ottomans did not require the Greeks or any non-Islamic group to become Muslims and in fact discouraged it because the dhimmi paid more in tax through the jizya and could be exploited through acts like the dev≈üirme (blood tax) which was one of the organized practices by which the Ottomans took boys from their Christian families, who were later converted to Islam with the aim of selecting and training the ablest of them for leading positions in the Ottoman society. However a large number of Greeks and Slavs became Muslims or Turks in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule. Conversion to Islam is quick and in the Ottoman Empire there were few documents showing who was or was not Muslim, the only requirements were knowing Turkish, saying you were Muslim and possibly getting circumcised. Greek has a specific word for becoming Muslim called œÑŒøœÖœÅŒ∫Œµœçœâ = tourkevo and the Slavic languages have turƒçiti, these practices of fake conversion were common and are a reason so many people in the Balkans have Turkish last names with endings like -oglu. As stated one of the main reason to convert were to avoid paying the jizya a (~ 20%) tax compared to the zakat which was a (~ 3%) tax. Another benefit converts received was that they could no longer be discriminated against in court as the Ottoman Empire had 2 separate court systems in which the Islamic court superseded the non-Islamic court and because non-Muslims were not allowed to be present in the Islamic court that basically resulted in a non- Islamic minority losing in court every time. Conversion allowed those to take advantage of greater employment prospects and possibilities of advancement in the Ottoman government bureaucracy and military. Subsequently, these people became part of the Muslim community of the millet system, which was closely linked to Islamic religious rules. At that time people were bound to their millets by their religious affiliations (or their confessional communities), rather than to their ethnic origins.Ortaylƒ±, ƒ∞lber. \\"Son ƒ∞mparatorluk Osmanlƒ± (The Last Empire: Ottoman Empire)\\", ƒ∞stanbul, Tima≈ü Yayƒ±nlarƒ± (Tima≈ü Press), 2006. pp. 87‚Äì89. . Muslim communities prospered under the Ottoman Empire, and the Ottoman law did not recognize such notions as ethnicity and the Muslims of any ethnic background enjoyed precisely the same rights and privileges.Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture, Richard C. Frucht, , ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 803. Another major reason for converting to Islam was the well-organized taxation system based on religion.Taxation in the Ottoman Empire Major taxes were the Defter and ƒ∞spen√ße and the more severe hara√ß whereby a document was issued which stated that \\"the holder of this certificate is able to keep his head on the shoulders since he paid the ŒßŒ±œÅŒ¨œÑœÉŒπ tax for this year...\\" All these of course were waived if the person would convert and become Muslim,.ŒùŒπŒ∫œåŒªŒ±ŒøœÇ Œ¶ŒπŒªŒπœÄœÄŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ (1900).

During the Greek War of Independence, Ottoman Egyptian troops under the leadership of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt ravaged the island of Crete and the Greek countryside of the Morea where the Muslim Egyptian soldiers enslaved vast numbers of Christian Greek children and women. Ibrahim arranged for the enslaved Greek children to be forcefully converted to Islam en masse. The enslaved Greeks were subsequently transferred to Egypt where they were sold as slaves. Several decades later in 1843, the English traveler and writer Sir John Gardner Wilkinson described the state of enslaved Greeks who had converted to Islam in Egypt: : Greek Muslims of Pontus and the Caucasus Pontic Greek (named Œ°œâŒºŒ±ŒØŒπŒ∫Œ± Rom√©ika, not Œ†ŒøŒΩœÑŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ¨ Pontiak√° as it is in Greece), is spoken by sizable numbers by communities of Pontic Greek Muslim origin, spread out near the southern Black Sea coast. Grecophone Pontian Muslims are found within Trabzon province and inhabit the following areas:Mackridge. Greek-speaking Moslems of north-east Turkey. 1987. p. 115-116.√ñzkan, Hakan (2013). \\"The Pontic Greek spoken by Muslims in the villages of Be≈ük√∂y in the province of present-day Trabzon.\\" Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies. 37. (1): 130‚Äì131. Pontic is spoken in the town of Tonya and in 6 villages of Tonya district. It is spoken in 6 villages of the municipal entity of Be≈ük√∂y in the central and K√∂pr√ºba≈üƒ± districts of S√ºrmene. Grecophone Muslims are also located in 9 villages of the Galyana valley in Ma√ßka district. They were resettled there in former abandoned Greek Orthodox Pontian dwellings from the area of Be≈ük√∂y after a devastating flood in 1929. The largest cluster of Pontian speakers is found in the Of valley. There are 23 Grecophone Muslim villages in √áaykara district, though due to migration these numbers have fluctuated and according to native speakers of the area there were around 70 Grecophone Muslim villages in √áaykara district.Schreiber, Laurentia (2015).Assessing sociolinguistic vitality: an attitudinal study of Rumca (Romeyka).

Free University of Berlin. p. 12. \\"Moreover, in comparison with the number of inhabitants of Romeyka-speaking villages, the number of speakers must have been considerably higher (√ñzkan 2013). The number of speakers was estimated by respondents of the present study as between 1,000 and 5,000 speakers. They report, however, that the number of Rumca-speaking villages has decreased due to migration (7).(7) Trabzon‚Äôda ban k√∂ylerinde konu≈üuluyor.

It was also spoken in the other villages but it has been forgotten. √áaykara has 120 villages. Rumca is more or less spoken in 70 of 120 villages.\\"\\"; p.55. \\"Besides Turkish national identity, Rumca speakers have a strong Muslim identity (Bortone 2009, Ozkan 2013) functioning as a dissolution of the split between Rumca and Turkish identity by emphasising common religious identity. Furthermore, the Muslim faith is used as a strong indicator of Turkishness. Emphasis on Turkish and Muslim identity entails at the same time rejection of any Rumca ethnic identity (Bortone 2009, Ozkan 2013) in relation to Greece, which is still considered an enemy country (Sitaridou 2013). Denial of any links to Greece goes so far that some female respondents from G2 even hesitated to mention the word Rum or Greek. On the one hand, respondents are aware of the Greek origin of Rumca and may even recognize shared cultural elements. Due to the lack of a distinct ethnic identity, Rumca speakers have no political identity and do not strive to gain national acknowledgement (Sitaridou 2013, Bortone 2009, Macktidge 1987).\\" 12 Grecophone Muslim villages are also located in the Dernekpazarƒ± district. Many of the Pontic natives were converted to Islam during the first two centuries following the Ottoman conquest of the region. Taking the high military and religious posts in the region, their elite were integrated into the ruling class of imperial society. The converted population accepted Ottoman identity, but in many instances the people retained their local, native languages. In 1914 according to the official estimations of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, circa 190.000 Grecophone Muslims were counted only in the region of Pontus.Œë. Œ•.Œï., Œö.

Sizable numbers of Grecophone Muslims in Pontus have retained knowledge and or are fluent in Greek and it is a mother tongue for many and even the young.Mackridge.

Grecophone Muslim Pontians can also be found in other settlements such as Rize (with a large concentration in ƒ∞kizdere district), Erzincan, G√ºm√º≈ühane, parts of Erzerum province, and the former Russian Empire's province of Kars Oblast (see Caucasus Greeks) and Georgia (see Islam in Georgia).

Greek-speaking Moslems of north-east Turkey. 1987. p. 117. \\"lack of any apparent sense of identity other than Turkish\\". In Turkey, their communities are sometimes referred to as Rum, although as with the word Yunan meaning Greek in Turkish or Greek in the English language, the term Rum is perceived within Turkey to be associated with Greece and or Christianity and they refuse to be identified as such.Bortone, Pietro (2009). \\"Greek with no models, history or standard: Muslim Pontic Greek.\\" In Silk, Michael & Alexandra Georgakopoulou (eds.). Standard languages and language standards: Greek, past and present. Ashgate Publishing. p. 68-69. \\"Muslim Pontic Greek speakers, on the other hand, did not regard themselves as in any way Greek. They therefore had no contact with Greeks from Greece, and no exposure to the language of Greece. To this day, they have never seen Modern Greek literature, have never heard Biblical Greek, have never studied classical Greek, have never learnt any Standard Greek (not even the Greek alphabet), have not heard Greek radio or TV, nor any form of the Greek language other than their own ‚Äî and have not been touched by the strict Greek policies of language standardization, archaization and purism. In other words, their Greek has had no external models for centuries. Furthermore, it is not written, printed, or broadcast. So it has no recorded local tradition and therefore no internal models to refer back to either.\\".Hakan. The Pontic Greek spoken by Muslims. 2013. p. 137-138. \\"Trabzon is well known for its staunch nationalists. Be≈ük√∂y is no exception to this rule. Because of the danger of being perceived as Greeks (Rum) clinging to their language and culture, or even worse as Pontians who seek ‚Äòtheir lost kingdom of Pontus‚Äô (which is an obscure accusation voiced by Turkish nationalists), it comes as no surprise that MP-speaking people are particularly sensitive to questions of identity. It has to be clarified at this point that the English term ‚ÄòGreek‚Äô is not identical to the Turkish Rum, which means Greek-speaking people of Turkey. Nobody in Be≈ük√∂y would identify themselves as Yunan, which denotes everything Greek coming from Greece (T. Yunanistan). However, as Rum is perceived in Turkey as linked in some way to Greece or the Orthodox Church, the Greek-speaking Muslims cannot easily present their language as their own, as other minorities in the Black Sea region such as the Laz do. In addition to the reasons stated above, many of the MP-speakers of Be≈ük√∂y strive to be the best Turks and the most pious Muslims. I had no encounter with MP-speakers without the issue of identity being brought up in connection with their language. After a while the MP- speakers themselves would begin to say something on this very sensitive topic. Precisely because of the omnipresence and importance of this issue I cannot leave it uncommented in this introduction. Nevertheless, I did not question people systematically with the use of prepared questionnaires about their identity, their attitude vis-√†-vis the language, i.e. if they like speaking it, if they want to pass it on to their children consciously, if they encountered difficulties because they speak MP, if they consider themselves of Turkish or Greek descent, if they can be Turks and Greeks at the same time, and how they regard Greece and the Pontians who live there. Appropriate answers to these very important sociolinguistic questions can only be found through extensive fieldwork that is endorsed by the Turkish authorities and a dedicated analysis of the data in a sizeable article or even a monograph. Nevertheless, I would like to dwell on some general tendencies that I have observed on the basis of the testimonies of my informants on their attitudes to language and identity. Of course I do not claim that these views are representative of MP-speakers in general, but they reflect the overwhelming impression I had during fieldwork in the region. Therefore I deem it necessary and valuable to give a voice to their opinions here. Many of the MP-speakers I met deny the Greekness of their language, although they know at least that many words in Standard Modern Greek (SMG) are identical to the ones in MP. As a linguist I was often asked to join them in their view in favour of the distinctness of their language. Without telling a lie I tried to reconcile the obvious truth that MP is a Greek dialect with the equally true assertion that MP and SMG are two different languages in the way that Italian and Spanish are distinct languages, to the extent that some characteristics are very similar and others completely different. In most cases they were satisfied with this answer.\\" Grecophone Muslim Pontians when speaking their language refer to it as Romeyka, whereas when conversing in Turkish they call it Rumca or Rumcika.Hakan. The Pontic Greek spoken by Muslims. 2013. p. 132-133. Rumca is the name used in Turkish to call all Greek dialects spoken in Turkey, a term akin to Romeyka derived from the word œÅœâŒºŒ±ŒØŒπŒ∫Œ± or Roman with Byzantine origins.Hakan. The Pontic Greek spoken by Muslims. 2013. p. 133. Current day Greeks refer to their language as ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ or Greek, an appellation that replaced the previous term Romeiika during the early nineteenth century. In Turkey standard modern Greek is referred to as Yunanca, whereas the ancient Greek language is called Eski Yunanca or Grek√ße. According to Heath W. Lowry'sProfessor.

Old and New Islam in Greece: From historical minorities to immigrant newcomers. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. p. 45. \\"In the same period, there was a search for common standards to govern state-citizen relations based on principles akin to the Greek national ideology. Thus the Muslims found themselves more in the position of a being a national minority group rather than a millet. The following example is evocative. After long discussions, the Cretan Assembly adopted the proposal to abolish soldiers‚Äô cap visors especially for Muslim soldiers. Eleftherios Venizelos, a fervent supporter of upgrading Muslims‚Äô institutional status, voted against this proposal because he believed that by adopting this measure the Assembly \\"would widen instead of fill the breach between Christians and Muslims, which is national rather than religious\\". As Greek Christians gradually began to envisage joining the Greek Kingdom through symbolic recognition of national ties to the ‚Äòmother country‚Äô, the Muslim communities reacted and contemplated their alternative ‚Äòmother nation‚Äô or ‚Äòmother state‚Äô, namely Turkishness and the Empire. Indicatively, Muslim deputies complained vigorously about a Declaration made by the plenary of the Cretan Assembly which stated that they body's works would be undertaken ‚Äòin the name of the King of Greece‚Äô. The transformation of a millet into a nation, a process which unfolded in response to both internal dynamics and outside pressures, was well underway.\\" Some Grecophone Muslims of Crete also composed literature for their community in the Greek language such as songs and wrote it in the Arabic alphabet, although little of it has been studied.Dedes, Yorgos (2010). \\"Blame it on the Turko- Romnioi (Turkish Rums): A Muslim Cretan song on the abolition of the Janissaries\\".

Amongst younger generations of Cretan Grecophone Muslims, many are fluent in the Greek language.Mackridge. Greek-speaking Moslems of north-east Turkey. 1987. p. 117. \\"A similar adherence to Greek is shown by Moslem Cretans and their descendants who live on the western and southern coasts of Asia Minor; but these people defiantly talk about themselves as Cretan.\\" Often members from the Muslim Cretan community are unaware that the language they speak is Greek.Philliou, Christine (2008). \\"The Paradox of Perceptions: Interpreting the Ottoman Past through the National Present\\". Middle Eastern Studies. 44. (5): 672. \\"The second reason my services as an interpreter were not needed was that the current inhabitants of the village which had been vacated by apparently Turkish-speaking Christians en route to Kavala, were descended from Greek-speaking Muslims that had left Crete in a later stage of the same population exchange. It was not infrequent for members of these groups, settled predominantly along coastal Anatolia and the Marmara Sea littoral in Turkey, to be unaware that the language they were speaking was Greek. Again, it was not illegal for them to be speaking Greek publicly in Turkey, but it undermined the principle that Turks speak Turkish, just like Frenchmen speak French and Russians speak Russian.\\" They often name the language as Cretan (Kritika () or Girit√ße) instead of Greek. The Grecophone Cretan Muslims are Sunnis of the (Hanafi) rite with a highly influential Bektashi minority that helped shape the folk Islam and religious tolerance of the entire community. Significant numbers of Cretan Muslims were re-settled in other Ottoman controlled areas around the eastern Mediterranean by the Ottomans following the establishment of the autonomous Cretan State in 1898. Most ended up in coastal Syria and Lebanon, particularly the town of Al-Hamidiyah, in Syria, (named after the Ottoman sultan who settled them there), and Tripoli in Lebanon where many continue to speak Greek as their mother tongue. Others were resettled in Ottoman Tripolitania especially in the east side cities like Susa and Benghazi, where they are distinguishable by their Greek surnames. Many of the older members of this community still speak Cretan Greek in their homes. A small community of Grecophone Cretan Muslims still resides in Greece in the Dodecanese Islands of Rhodes and Kos. These communities were formed prior to the area becoming part of Greece in 1948 when their ancestors migrated there from Crete and are integrated into the local Muslim population as Turks today.Comerford, Patrick (2000). \\"Defining Greek and Turk: Uncertainties in the search for European and Muslim identities\\". Cambridge Review of International Affairs. 13.(2): 250. \\"Despite the provisions of the Lausanne Treaty, some surprising and unforeseen anomalies were to arise. As yet, the Greek state did not include the Dodecannese, and many of the Muslims from Crete moved to Kos and Rhodes, began to integrate with the local Muslim population. When the Dodecannese were incorporated in the Greek state in 1948, the Turks of Kos and Rhodes found once again that they were citizens of Greece. On many occasions I have passed the dilapidated refugee village of Kritika ('the Cretans') on the coast road out of Rhodes town on the way to the airport; in the town itself, it is easy to pick out Turkish names on the marquees of sandal-makers, or on the names of kafenia and kebab stands. In Kos, the domestic architecture of the bi-ethnic village of Platani can be strongly reminiscent of rural styles in provincial Crete.\\" Epirote Muslims Muslims from the region of Epirus, known collectively as Yanyalƒ±lar (Yanyalƒ± in singular, meaning \\"person from Ioannina\\") in Turkish and Œ§ŒøœÖœÅŒ∫ŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ±ŒΩŒΩŒπœéœÑŒµœÇ Turkoyany√≥tes in Greek (Œ§ŒøœÖœÅŒ∫ŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ±ŒΩŒΩŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ Turkoyany√≥tis in singular, meaning \\"Turk from Ioannina\\"), who had arrived in Turkey in two waves of migration in 1912 and after 1923.

The Vallahades had retained much of their Greek culture and language, unlike most Muslim converts from Greek Macedonia and elsewhere in the southern Balkans who generally adopted the Turkish language and identity. In contrast, most Grecophone Muslims from Epirus, Thrace, and other parts of Macedonia who converted to Islam in the earlier Ottoman period, generally also adopted Turkish and more speedily and thoroughly assimilated into the Ottoman ruling elite. According to Todor Simovski's assessment (1972), in 1912 in the region of Macedonia in Greece there were 13,753 Muslim Greeks.Who are the Macedonians? by Hugh Poulton. Published 2000, Indiana University Press; p. 85 In the twentieth century, the Vallahades were considered by other Greeks to have become Turkish and were not exempt from the 1922‚Äì1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, which was based on religious affiliation (Christian Orthodox and Muslim) rather than language and ethnicity. The Vallahades were resettled in western Asia Minor, in such towns as Kumburgaz, B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece, and √áatalca or in villages like Honaz near Denizli. Many Vallahades still continue to speak the Greek language, which they call Rome√ØkaKoukoudis, Asterios (2003). The Vlachs: Metropolis and Diaspora. Zitros. p. 198. \\"In the mid- seventeenth century, the inhabitants of many of the villages in the upper Aliakmon valley-in the areas of Grevena, Anaselitsa or Voio, and Kastoria‚Äî gradually converted to Islam. Among them were a number of Kupatshari, who continued to speak Greek, however, and to observe many of their old Christian customs. The Islamicised Greek-speaking inhabitants of these areas came to be better known as \\"Valaades\\". They were also called \\"Foutsides\\", while to the Vlachs of the Grevena area they were also known as \\"VlƒÉh√∫tsi\\". According to Greek statistics, in 1923 Anavrytia (Vrastino), Kastro, Kyrakali, and Pigadtisa were inhabited exclusively by Moslems (i.e Valaades), while Elatos (Dovrani), Doxaros (Boura), Kalamitsi, Felli, and Melissi (Plessia) were inhabited by Moslem Valaades and Christian Kupatshari. There were also Valaades living in Grevena, as also in other villages to the north and east of the town. ... the term \\"Valaades\\" refers to Greek-speaking Moslems not only of the Grevena area but also of Anaselitsa. In 1924, despite even their own objections, the last of the Valaades being Moslems, were forced to leave Greece under the terms of the compulsory exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey. Until then they had been almost entirely Greek-speakers. Many of the descendants of the Valaades of Anaseltisa, now scattered through Turkey and particularly Eastern Thrace (in such towns as Kumburgaz, B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece, and √áatalca), still speak Greek dialect of Western Macedonia, which, significantly, they themselves call Rome√Øka \\"the language of the Romii\\". It is worth noting the recent research carried out by Kemal Yal√ßin, which puts a human face on the fate of 120 or so families from Anavryta and Kastro, who were involved in the exchange of populations.

Grecophone Muslim communities existed in the towns and some villages of Elassona, Tyrnovos, Almyros. According to Lampros Koutsonikas Muslims in the kaza of Elassona who lived in 6 villages such as Stefanovouno, Lofos, Galanovrysi and Domeniko besides the town belonged to the Vallahades group. Evliya Chelebi, who visited the area in 1660s has also mentioned them in his Seyahatname speaking Greek. In the 8th Volume of Seyahatname he mentions many Muslims of Thessaly as converts of Greek origin. He especially writes that Muslims of Tyrnovos are converts and writes that he cannot understand the denomination of Muslims of Domokos and says they are mixed with \\"infidels\\" and thus relived to pay the hara√ß tax . Moreover, there is no mention of the 12 so called Konyar Turkish villages that are mentioned in 18th Century Men√¢kƒ±bn√¢me of Turahan Bey such as Lygaria, Fallani, Itea, Gonnoi, Krokio and Rodia in Ottoman registrars in the yearly books of 1506, 1521 and 1570 which indicates that indeed Muslims of Thessaly are mostly of convert origin. There were also some Muslims of Vlach descent assimilated into these communities such as the village of Argyropouli. After the Convention of Constantinople in 1881 these Muslims started emigrating to areas which are still under Ottoman administration including to the villages of Elassona. An artillery captain William Martin Leake wrote in his Travels in Northern Greece (1835) that he spoke with the Bektashi Sheikh and the Vezir in Trikala in Greek. In fact he specifically states that the Sheikh used the word \\"·ºÑŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ\\" to define men and the Vezir said; Œ∫Œ±ŒØ Œ≠Œ≥œé ŒµœäŒºŒ±Œπ œÄœÅŒøœÜŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ œÉœÑŒ¨ ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒπŒΩŒ±. British Consul-General Blunt observed for the last quarter of the nineteenth century that \\"Greek is also generally spoken by the Turkish inhabitants, and appears to be the common language between Turks and Christians.\\" A Research on purchases of property and goods registered in the notarial archive of Agathagellos Ioannidis between 1882 and 1898 right after the annexation concludes that the overwhelming majority of Thessalian Muslims who now are Greek citizens were able to speak and write Greek. An interpreter is needed only in 15% of the acts. In half of the cases they are women. This therefore might indicate that an interpreter is used by women who in most cases were illiterate. However a sizeable population of Circassians and Tatars were settled to Thessaly in the second half of the nineteenth century to Yeni≈üehir (Larissa), Velestino, Ermiye (Almyros) and to villages of Balabanlƒ± (Asimochori) and Loksada in Karditsa. Perhaps they and also Albanian Muslims were the ones who did not fully understand the Greek Language. Morevover there were also Muslims who were interpreters in these acts.  Greek Morean/Peleponesian Muslims  Greek speaking Muslims lived in cities citadels towns and some villages close to fortified settlements in Peleponese such as Patras, Rio, Tripolitsa, Koroni, Navarino and Methoni. Evliya Chelebi, who visited the area in 1660s has also mentioned in his Seyahatname that the language of all Muslims in Morea is \\"Urum≈üa\\" which is demotic Greek. He mentions especially that the wives of Muslims in the castle of G√∂rd√ºs are non-Muslims. He mentions that the language of peoples of Gastouni is Urum≈üa but despite speaking Greek Muslims of this particular town are devout and friendly. In Longanikos he explicitly mentions that Muslims are converts from the Greeks of that town. To mention converts he uses to word \\"ahƒ±ryan\\".  Greek Cypriot Muslims  In 1878 the Muslim inhabitants of Cyprus constituted about one-third of the island's population of 120,000. They were classified as being either Turkish or \\"neo-Muslim.\\" The latter were of Greek origin, Islamised but speaking Greek, and similar in character to the local Christians. The last of such groups was reported to arrive at Antalya in 1936. These communities are thought to have abandoned Greek in the course of integration.Peter Alford Andrews, Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey, Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, 1989, During the 1950s, there were still four Greek speaking Muslim settlements in Cyprus: Lapithou, Platanisso, Ayios Simeon and Galinoporni that identified themselves as Turks.Beckingham, Charles Fraser (1957). \\"The Turks of Cyprus.\\" Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. 87. (2): 170‚Äì171. \\"While many Turks habitually speak Turkish there are 'Turkish', that is, Muslim villages in which the normal language is Greek; among them are Lapithou, Platanisso, Ayios Simeon and Galinoporni. This fact has not yet been adequately investigated. With the growth of national feeling and the spread of education the phenomenon is becoming not only rarer but harder to detect. In a Muslim village the school teacher will be a Turk and will teach the children Turkish. They already think of themselves as Turks, and having once learnt the language, will sometimes use it in talking to a visitor in preference to Greek, merely as matter of national pride. It has been suggested that these Greek-speaking Muslims are descended from Turkish- speaking immigrants who have retained their faith but abandoned their language because of the greater flexibility and commercial usefulness of Greek. It is open to the objection that these villages are situated in the remoter parts of the island, in the western mountains and in the Carpass peninsula, where most of the inhabitants are poor farmers whose commercial dealings are very limited. Moreover, if Greek had gradually replaced Turkish in these villages, one would have expected this to happen in isolated places, where a Turkish settlement is surrounded by Greek villages rather than where there are a number of Turkish villages close together as there are in the Carpass. Yet Ayios Simeon (F I), Ayios Andronikos (F I), and Galinoporni (F I) are all Greek-speaking, while the neighbouring village of Korovia (F I) is Turkish-speaking. It is more likely that these people are descended from Cypriots converted to Islam after 1571, who changed their religion but kept their language. This was the view of Menardos (1905, p. 415) and it is supported by the analogous case of Crete. There it is well known that many Cretans were converted to Islam, and there is ample evidence that Greek was almost the only language spoken by either community in the Cretan villages. Pashley (1837, vol. I, p. 8) ‚Äòsoon found that the whole rural population of Crete understands only Greek. The Agh√°s, who live in the principal towns, also know Turkish; although, even with them, Greek is essentially the mother-tongue.‚Äô\\" A 2017 study on the genetics of Turkish Cypriots has shown strong genetic ties with their fellow Orthodox Greek Cypriots.  Greek Muslims of the Aegean Islands  Despite not having a majority Muslim population at any time during the Ottoman period, some Aegean Islands such as Chios, Lesbos, Kos, Rhodes, Lemnos and Tenedos, and on Kastellorizo contained a sizable Muslim population of Greek origin. Before the Greek Revolution there were also Muslims on the island of Euboea, but there were no Muslims in Cycladic or Sporades island groups. Evliya Chelebi mentions that there were 100 Muslim houses on the island of Aegina in 1660s. On most Islands Muslims were only living in and around the main centers of the islands. Today Greek-speaking Muslims numbering about 5-5,500 live on Kos and Rhodes because Dodecanese Islands then governed by Italy were not a part of Greece and therefore they were exempt from the population exchange. However many migrated after Paris Peace Treaties in 1947. Crimea In the Middle Ages the Greek population of Crimea traditionally adhered to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, even despite undergoing linguistic assimilation by the local Crimean Tatars. In 1777‚Äì1778, when Catherine the Great of Russia conquered the peninsula from the Ottoman Empire, the local Orthodox population was forcibly deported and settled north of the Azov Sea. In order to avoid deportation, some Greeks chose to convert to Islam. Crimean Tatar-speaking Muslims of the village of Kermenchik (renamed to Vysokoe in 1945) kept their Greek identity and were practising Christianity in secret for a while. In the nineteenth century the lower half of Kermenchik was populated with Christian Greeks from Turkey, whereas the upper remained Muslim. By the time of the Stalinist deportation of 1944, the Muslims of Kermenchik had already been identified as Crimean Tatars, and were forcibly expelled to Central Asia together with the rest of Crimea's ethnic minorities.The Russian World: Kermenchik ‚Äì Crimea's Lonely Spot? by I.Kovalenko Lebanon and Syria There are about 7,000 Greek speaking Muslims living in Tripoli, Lebanon and about 8,000 in Al Hamidiyah, Syria.Greek-Speaking Enclaves of Lebanon and Syria by Roula Tsokalidou. Proceedings II Simposio Internacional Biling√ºismo. Retrieved 4 December 2006 The majority of them are Muslims of Cretan origin. Records suggest that the community left Crete between 1866 and 1897, on the outbreak of the last Cretan uprising against the Ottoman Empire, which ended the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. Sultan Abdul Hamid II provided Cretan Muslim families who fled the island with refuge on the Levantine coast. The new settlement was named Hamidiye after the sultan.

The community members would be regarded with indifference and even hostility, and would be denied visas and opportunities to improve their Greek through trips to Greece. Central Asia In the Middle Ages, after the Seljuq victory over the Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV, many Byzantine Greeks were taken as slaves to Central Asia. The most famous among them was Al-Khazini, a Byzantine Greek slave taken to Merv, then in the Khorasan province of Persia but now in Turkmenistan, who was later freed and became a famous Muslim scientist.Klotz, \\"Multicultural Perspectives in Science Education: One Prescription for Failure\\".

In 1140 at the siege of Neocaesarea he defected. As John Julius Norwich puts it, he did so by \\"embracing simultaneously the creed of Islam and the daughter of the Seljuk Sultan Mesud I.\\" John Komnenos' by-name, Tzelepes, is believed to be a Greek rendering of the Turkish honorific √áelebi, a term indicating noble birth or \\"gentlemanly conduct\\".

Those who suggest that he could be Armenian do this with the mere fact that the largest Christian community living at the vicinity of Kayseri were Armenians, but there was also a considerably large Greek population (e.g. the father of Greek-American film director Elia Kazan) in Kayseri. Actually, in Ottoman records, Sinan's father is named \\"Hristo\\", which suggests Greek ancestry, and which is probably why Encyclop√¶dia Britannica states that he was of Greek origin. * Mehmed Saqizli (, literally, Mehmed Pasha of Chios) (died 1649), (r.1631‚Äì49) was Dey and Pasha of Tripolis.

Raghib Pasha (ca. 1819‚Äì1884) was a Greek convert to Islam who served as Prime Minister of Egypt. * Narjis, mother of Muhammad al-Mahdi the twelfth and last Imam of Shi'a Islam, Byzantine Princess, reportedly the descendant of the disciple Simon Peter, the vicegerent of Jesus. * Nil√ºfer Hatun (Ottoman Turkish: ŸÜ€åŸÑŸàŸÅÿ± ÿÆÿßÿ™ŸàŸÜ‚Äé, birth name Holifere (Holophira) / Olivera, other names Bayalun, Beylun, Beyalun, Bilun, Suyun, Suylun) was a Valide Hatun; the wife of Orhan, the second Ottoman Sultan. She was mother of the next sultan, Murad I. The traditional stories about her origin, traced back to the 15th century, are that she was daughter of the Byzantine ruler (Tekfur) of Bilecik, called Holofira. As some stories go, Orhan's father Osman raided Bilecik at the time of Holofira's wedding arriving there with rich presents and disguised and hidden soldiers. Holofira was among the loot and given to Orhan. However modern researchers doubt this story, admitting that it may have been based on real events. Doubts are based on various secondary evidence and lack of direct documentary evidence of the time. In particular, her Ottoman name Nil√ºfer meaning water lily in the Persian language. Other Historians make her a daughter of the Prince of Yarhisar or a Byzantine Princess Helen (Nil√ºfer), who was of ethnic Greek descent. Nil√ºfer Hatun Imareti (Turkish for \\"Nil√ºfer Hatun Soup Kitchen\\"), is a convent annex hospice for dervishes, now housing the Iznik Museum in ƒ∞znik, Bursa Province. When Orhan Gazi was off on campaign Nil√ºfer acted as his regent, the only woman in Ottoman history who was ever given such power. During Murad's reign she was recognized as Valide Sultan, or Queen Mother, the first in Ottoman history to hold this title, and when she died she was buried beside Orhan Gazi and his father Osman Gazi in Bursa. The Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta, who visited Iznik in the 1330s, was a guest of Nil√ºfer Hatun, whom he described as 'a pious and excellent woman'. * Nur Felek Kadinefendi (1863‚Äì1914), was the first consort of Isma'il Pasha of Egypt.

She was delivered as a concubine to the harem of Sa'id ,the WƒÅli of Egypt in 1852. However, Isma'il Pasha, then not yet the Khedive of Egypt, took Tatiana as a concubine for him. She gave birth to Prince Hussein Kamel Pasha in 1853. She later converted to Islam and her name was changed to Nur Felek. When Isma'il Pasha ascended the throne in 1863, she was elevated to the rank of first Kadinefendi, literally meaning first consort, or wife. * Osman Saqizli (, literally, Osman Pasha of Chios) (died 1672), (r.1649‚Äì72) was Dey and Pasha of Tripoli in Ottoman Libya.

Raghib Pasha ultimately rose to levels of importance serving as Minister of Finance (1858‚Äì1860), then Minister of War (1860‚Äì1861). He became Inspector for the Maritime Provinces in 1862, and later Assistant () to viceroy Isma'il Pasha (1863‚Äì1865). He was granted the title of beylerbey and then appointed President of the Privy council in 1868. He was appointed President of the Chamber of Deputies (1866‚Äì1867), then Minister of Interior in 1867, then Minister of Agriculture and Trade in 1875. Isma'il Ragheb became Prime Minister of Egypt in 1882.\\\\ * Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha, also known as K√ºtahƒ± (Greek: ŒúŒµœáŒºŒ≠œÑ Œ°ŒµœÉŒØœÑ œÄŒ±œÉŒ¨œÇ ŒöŒπŒøœÖœÑŒ±œáŒÆœÇ, 1780‚Äì1836), was a prominent Ottoman statesman and general who reached the post of Grand Vizier in the first half of the 19th century, playing an important role in the Greek War of Independence.

The Rule of Wen and Jing was marked by Taoist influences in political theory, due to the influence of Emperor Wen's wife and Emperor Jing's mother, Empress Dou. Taoist influence on government did not truly end until her death in 135 BC, during the reign of her grandson Emperor Wu of Han. The Rule of Wen and Jing is often viewed as one of the golden ages in Chinese history, in particularly the Western Han dynasty, and it paved the way for the long and stable reign of Emperor Wu. It also enabled Emperor Wu to maintain a powerful army and employ an aggressive foreign policy, which greatly expanded the empire and ultimately pushed the Han dynasty to its zenith. The main criticism against it, however, was that it made the rich richer and the poor poorer, due to the lack of mechanisms to redistribute wealth. Emperor Wu's long reign of 54 years from 141 to 87 BC thoroughly depleted the empire's coffers, which took Emperor Wen and Jing decades to establish. The Han dynasty would not witness another golden age until the 1st century AD, during the rule of Emperor Ming and Zhang.

The park is an extension of the grounds surrounding Raj Bhavan, formerly known as the 'Guindy Lodge', the official residence of the Governor of Tamil Nadu, India. It extends deep inside the governor's estate, enclosing beautiful forests, scrub lands, lakes and streams. At Children's park/Guindy National Park, Chennai. The park has a role in both ex-situ and in-situ conservation and is home to 400 blackbucks, 2,000 spotted deers, 24 jackals, a wide variety of snakes, geckos, tortoises and over 130 species of birds, 14 species of mammals, over 60 species of butterflies and spiders each, a wealth of different invertebrates‚Äîgrasshoppers, ants, termites, crabs, snails, slugs, scorpions, mites, earthworms, millipedes, and the like. These are free-ranging fauna and live with the minimal of interference from human beings. The only major management activity is protection as in any other in-situ conservation area. The park attracts more than 700,000 visitors every year. History Once covering an area of of one of the last remnants of tropical dry evergreen forest of the Coromandel Coast, Guindy Park was originally a game reserve. In the early 1670s, a garden space was carved out of the Guindy forest and a residence called the Guindy Lodge was built by Governor William Langhorne (1672‚Äì1678), which had helped make St Thomas Mount a salubrious place for rest and recreation. The remaining of the forest area was owned by a British citizen named Gilbert Rodericks from whom it was purchased by the government in 1821 for a sum of 35,000. The original area of 505 ha was established as a Reserve Forest in 1910. Although it was speculated that Chital (spotted deer) were introduced into the park probably after 1945, it is now known that they already existed in the year 1900 along with other antelope during the tenure of the colonial Governor of Madras Sir Arthur Havelock (1895-1900) Between 1961 and 1977, about 172 ha of the forest, primarily from the Raj Bhavan, was transferred to various government departments in order to build educational institutions and memorials. In 1958, a portion of the forest area was transferred to the Union Education Ministry for establishing the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. In the same year, another portion of the land was transferred to the Forest Department for creating the Guindy Deer Park and Children's Park at the instance of the then prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. Memorials for Rajaji and Kamaraj were built in 1974 and 1975, respectively, from parcels of land acquired from the Raj Bhavan. In 1977, the forest area was transferred to the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. In 1978, the whole of the remaining area, popularly known then as the Guindy Deer Park, was declared a national park. It was walled off from the adjacent Raj Bhavan and Indian Institute of Technology Madras Campus in the late 1980s. Habitats The Guindy National Park, Raj Bhavan and IIT-Madras habitat complex has historically enjoyed a certain degree of protection and has continued to support some of the last remnants of the natural habitats that typify the natural range of plant and animal biodiversity of the Coromandel- Circar coastal plains in the northeastern Tamil Nadu. The ecosystem consists of the rare tropical dry evergreen scrub and thorn forests receiving about 1200 mm of rainfall annually. This vegetation has been reclassified as the Albizia amara community. The region's physiognomy occurs as discontinuous or dense scrub-woodlands and thickets, containing species such as introduced Acacia planifrons, Clausena dentata shrubs, palmyrah palm (Borassus flabellifer), Randia dumetorum, Randia malabarica, Carissa spinarum, Acacia chundra, exotic cactus Cereus peruviana and Glycosmis mauritiana. The park has a tropical dissymmetric climate. The mean annual temperatures are 32.9 ¬∞C (maximum) and 24.3 ¬∞C (minimum). Rainfall ranges from 522 to 2,135 mm, with an average annual rainfall of 1,215 mm. The summer season in April and May determines the peculiar vegetation of the Coromandel-Circar coast. Between June and December, wet season prevails, with dry season occurring between January and March. The area also has a cleared meadow called Polo Field measuring about 230 √ó 160 m. The park also has a lake known as the 'Tangal Eri'. The park is protected by a perimeter wall for a length of 9.5 km. There is an extensive network of roads and trails. The road network covers about 14 km within the park. The park has two large tanks, namely, Kathan Kollai (KK Tank) and Appalam Kolam (AK Tank), in addition to two ponds, which usually dry up during summer. The presence of the park and the surrounding green areas resulted in the byname, the green lungs of Chennai, for the Adyar‚ÄìGuindy area. Flora The park has a dry evergreen scrub and thorn forest, grasslands and water bodies with over 350 species of plants including shrubs, climbers, herbs and grasses and over 24 variety of trees, including the sugar-apple, Atlantia monophylla, wood-apple, and neem. This flora provides an ideal habitat for over 150 species of birds. About one-sixth of the park has been left as open grassland to preserve that habitat for blackbucks. Though both the species of blackbuck and spotted deer have their natural habitat in grassland, the spotted deer prefer bushes and can adjust in land covered with shrubbery. Fauna Rosy Pelican at Guindy national park Freely wandering deer at Children's park/Guindy National Park, Chennai. There are over 14 species of mammals including blackbuck, chital or spotted deer, jackal, small Indian civet, common palm civet, bonnet macaque, hyena, pangolin, hedgehog, common mongoose and three-striped palm squirrel. The park also has black-naped hare and several species of bats and rodents. Monkey at Children's park/Guindy National Park, Chennai. Ducks at Children's park/Guindy National Park, Chennai. Freely wandering deer at Children's park/Guindy National Park, Chennai. The near threatened blackbuck, considered the flagship species of the park, was introduced in 1924 by Lord Willingdon and has seen a population decline in recent times. It is now known that both Blackbucks and Chitals were a native faunal element of the park. Some albino male blackbucks were also introduced by the Maharaja of Bhavnagar. Per the census conducted on 29 February 2004, the population of Blackbuck was 405 (10 spotted in the IIT campus). The chital population in the Park, appears to have been steady or even increased in the last century. Per the census conducted on 29 February 2004, the population of the spotted deer was 2,650. Of these, 1,743 were female and 336 were fawns. The census was taken in the Guindy National Park and the adjoining areas of the Indian Institute of Technology and the Raj Bhavan campus using King's transect method, which would only reveal the numbers close to the actual figure. The park has over 150 species of birds including grey partridge, crow pheasant, parrot, quail, paradise flycatcher, black-winged kite, honey buzzard, pariah kite, golden-backed woodpecker, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, blue-faced malkoha, shrikes, Asian koel, minivets, munias, parakeet, tailor bird, robin, drongo, and stone curlew. Bird watchers anticipate migratory birds here like teals, garganeys, pochards, medium egrets, large egrets, night herons, pond herons and open- billed storks every fall season. Monkeys having a friendly fight at the Children's park/Guindy National Park, Chennai. The park is home to about 9 species of amphibians. There are also many kinds of reptiles, including saw- scaled viper and the fan-throated lizard. Some species of tortoise and turtles‚Äîespecially the endangered star tortoise, lizards, geckos, chameleons and the common Indian monitor lizard‚Äîare found here, as well as a large variety of insects including 60 species of spiders and 60 species of butterflies. Guindy Snake Park and Children's Park Spotted deer (chital) at Guindy National Park Indian peafowl at Children's Park Guindy Snake Park, formerly the location of Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, is next to the Guindy National Park. The Snake Park in Chennai gained statutory recognition as a medium zoo from the Central Zoo Authority in 1995. There one can see king cobra, pythons, vipers and other reptiles. For ex-situ conservation, about of the Guindy National Park has been carved out into a park known as the Children's Park and play area at the northeast corner of the national park with a collection of animals and birds. The Children's Park gained statutory recognition as a medium zoo from the Central Zoo Authority in 1995. Animals in the Children's Park include black buck, sambar, spotted deer, porcupine, jackal, python, grey pelican, night heron, cormorant, cockatiel, parrot, mongoose, common peafowl, crocodile, common otter, rhesus monkey, bonnet monkey and common langur. The Children's Park also exhibits a fossilised tree specimen which is estimated to be about 20 million years old and a statue of a Tyrannosaurus at the entrance. The Children's Park and the Snake Park have separate entrances and independent entry fees. Drinking water, vendors and catering are available. The entrance lies on the busy Sardar Patel Road next to the Adyar Cancer Institute. In December 2019, an augmented reality (AR) show with a capacity of 20 persons was opened to public.

At the time of the murder, the Derwentside District Council was involved in a dispute with Albert Dryden over the erection of a dwelling by Dryden in the countryside without planning permission. At approximately 9:00 am on 20 June 1991, as television news crews filmed, Dryden aimed a handgun‚Äîa .455 Webley Mk VI revolver‚Äîat Collinson and shot him dead. As the journalists and council staff fled, Dryden opened fire again, wounding television reporter Tony Belmont and Police Constable Stephen Campbell. A standoff situation followed as armed police officers‚Äîwho had been on stand-by for the incident at nearby Consett‚Äîraced to the scene and Dryden retreated to a caravan on the property. Dryden warned them that the buildings were booby trapped with explosives, that he had planted land mines in the ground around the property, and had a cache of hand grenades inside the caravan. At approximately 11:20 am, police negotiators offered to install a field telephone to enable them to better communicate with him. Dryden came out of the caravan to the perimeter fence to watch them and, realising that Dryden's holster was empty, tactical firearms officer Sgt John Taylor immediately wrestled him to the ground. Assisted by PCs Chris Barber, Andy Reay and Philip Brown, Taylor was able to subdue Dryden and he was taken into police custody. Dryden was subsequently tried at Newcastle upon Tyne during March‚ÄìApril 1992. Found guilty of Collinson's murder, the attempted murder of council solicitor Michael Dunston‚Äîwhom he had apparently been aiming for when he shot at the group‚Äîand the wounding of a reporter and a police officer, Dryden was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment and two terms of seven years' imprisonment, to run concurrently. Dryden's appeal against the conviction was dismissed, and his applications for parole were refused as he showed no remorse for his crimes. In 2017, Dryden suffered a stroke and was released from prison to a nursing home on compassionate grounds. Dryden died on 15 September 2018 aged 78 in a care home following his prison release. Background =Albert Dryden= Albert Dryden was born on 12 May 1940 at Consett, County Durham, England, which was then one of the world's most prominent steel-making towns. He was the fifth of eight children born to Albert and Nora Dryden. His parents were stalwart members of The Salvation Army, well liked and respected within the community, and the family home was a terraced house on Priestman Avenue, Consett. Albert Senior worked for the Consett Iron Company, and was described by police officer Sergeant David Blackie as \\"the epitome of a northern patriarch, a strict, clean-living man who did his best to bring up his children straight and true through the good times and bad.\\" Dryden was a solitary child with a very active imagination, often given to flights of fancy. He did not enjoy schooling and was not academic‚ÄîIQ tests taken during adulthood would show that his intelligence was well below average. He developed an early interest in weapons and firearms, and purchased his first handgun‚Äîan unlicensed World War I Webley Mk VI revolver, which he later used to murder Collinson‚Äîaged 11. Dryden paid ten shillings (50 pence) for the gun‚Äîstolen by a schoolfriend from his father‚Äîand a single bullet. The lack of ammunition combined with the scarcity of, and difficulty obtaining, the correct cartridges would lead Dryden to manufacture his own ammunition. When Dryden murdered Collinson, he was using cartridges converted from .410 bore shotgun shells, loaded with heavier than usual cast lead bullets which Dryden called his \\"manstoppers\\". Murder A .455 calibre Webley revolver of the type used by Dryden During negotiations in front of a range of television and newspaper reporters, Dryden shot Collinson in the chest at point blank range. As the assembled reporters, council staff and three unarmed police officers‚ÄîSgt Colin Campbell, PC Stephen Campbell and PC Ian Kirkup of Durham Constabulary‚Äîfled for cover, Dryden climbed over the property's fence and shot Collinson again as he lay in a ditch where he had fallen. Dryden then opened fire on the fleeing group, hitting PC Campbell in the thigh and BBC Look North reporter Tony Belmont in the arm. Seeing a police vehicle‚Äîcarrying Superintendent Stan Hegarty and Inspector Geoff Young‚Äîapproaching, Dryden shot at the vehicle, forcing it to reverse away at speed. He then reloaded and walked back to where the demolition vehicles were parked, firing twice into an excavator, twice into a low loader and once into a car. Dryden then returned to where Collinson lay and shot him again in the lower face and chest. The incident was captured on camera and transmitted on the BBC's regional news programme Look North. The footage shows Collinson asking the camera crew to take a shot of Dryden's gun. The camera pans to Dryden, who fires the gun at Collinson (now off-screen). As everyone (including crew) disperses, Dryden shoots and wounds the police officer and the reporter. A fuller version of the footage, including a prior visit and the aftermath of the shooting, now forms part of the BBC's filming safety internal training course. A subsequent search of the property and Dryden's home at Priestman Avenue, Consett, uncovered 10 handguns, 15 rifles, three shotguns, two homemade mortars with eight projectiles, an improvised propane bomb, and a 20mm cannon modified to be attached to one of his vehicles. Dryden had no firearms licence, and all the weapons were illegally held. Following the murder, it became known that Collinson and Dryden had previously enjoyed a friendly relationship, with Collinson regularly visiting the Eliza Lane property to advise Dryden on planting trees for screening and what type of building work was permitted. However, Dryden's increasingly bizarre behaviour, his decision to dig a deep trench in which to build the bungalow with just the roof showing, and his threats towards‚Äîand physical assaults against‚Äîcouncil staff brought the men into conflict. It was also revealed that the council had wanted to visit the site under cover of darkness to carry out the demolition, when Dryden would have been asleep at his home several miles away in Consett; Collinson disagreed with this underhand tactic and insisted that their actions should take place during the day and in the presence of the media to avoid any allegations of inappropriate conduct. Collinson also did not expect Dryden to back down, and arranged for a camera crew employed by the council to record the confrontation, which would allow the council to retreat without demolishing the building, instead passing the footage to the High Court to allow them to deal with the matter. Trial Moot Hall Crown Court, Newcastle upon Tyne Dryden was tried at Newcastle upon Tyne Crown Court convened in the Moot Hall in March 1992, charged with murder; the attempted murder of Belmont, Campbell and council solicitor Michael Dunston; and an alternative charge of wounding Belmont and Campbell with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Dryden entered pleas of not guilty to all charges on the grounds of diminished responsibility. After 13 days of evidence, the jury took just two hours of deliberation before finding Dryden guilty of Collinson's murder, guilty of the attempted murder of Dunston, and guilty of wounding Belmont and Campbell. Dryden was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder, life imprisonment for the attempted murder and two terms of seven years for the woundings, all to be served concurrently. Mrs Justice Ebsworth, sentencing, said: \\"The state of your mind on June 20 was abnormal, but not abnormal to the extent of diminishing your responsibility for what you did... You are a dangerous man.\\" Dryden's appeal against his conviction was dismissed in February 1994. He also made four applications for parole, all of which were rejected as he showed no remorse for his crimes. While incarcerated, Dryden maintained that he had been the victim of a high- level Masonic conspiracy, and that Collinson had been a golfing partner of the Chief Constable of Durham Constabulary‚Äîdespite Collinson being neither a Freemason nor a golfer. Described as \\"increasingly divorced from reality\\", Dryden also claimed that the prison authorities were attempting to poison him. Dryden released from prison In 2017, Dryden suffered a severe stroke and was released from prison on compassionate grounds, to be cared for in a residential care home. Collinson's brother said: \\"Personally, I couldn‚Äôt bloody care less what happens to Albert Dryden. If he dies slowly, that's good. I'll be very happy about that. He never showed one bit of remorse in all the 26 years he has been in prison. He still tried to justify his actions for some God-unknown reason. If the police had done their job properly, my brother wouldn't have been killed and Albert Dryden wouldn't have spent all this time in prison.\\" Dryden died on 15 September 2018 aged 78 in a care home following his prison release.

The character has been depicted specifically as an enemy of the X-Men. He first appeared in Astonishing X-Men #1 in May 2004. He was created by writer Joss Whedon and artist John Cassaday.  Fictional character biography  = Ord's mission = Ord is a member of an alien race from a planet called the Breakworld. He was sent to Earth by the ruler of the Breakworld, Powerlord Kruun, on a mission to stop a mutant from Earth from destroying their planet (an event predicted using their race's advanced technology). To this end Ord obtained the body of the X-Man Colossus and resurrected him using superior Breakworld technology. Ord proceeded to experiment on Colossus and with the assistance of the human scientist Dr. Kavita Rao using his DNA to develop a cure for the mutant condition in the hope that this would prevent the destruction of his planet. In doing all this Ord was acting with the tacit consent of Special Agent Abigail Brand, the head of S.W.O.R.D. who was attempting to avert a potential war between Earth and the Breakworld.Astonishing X-Men #11 = Encounters with the X-Men = During their first encounter Ord nearly defeated the latest X-Men team‚Äîconsisting of Cyclops, Emma Frost, Beast, Shadowcat and Wolverine‚Äîbut was caught off guard by Lockheed, who disfigured his face with a fire blast. Later, Ord was nearly killed by an enraged Colossus after he had been released by his X-Men comrades, but was prevented from doing so by Special Agent Brand and Nick Fury accompanied by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents (Although Fury was tempted to leave Brand with the enraged X-Men after learning that she'd known about Colossus's captivity all along). After one last attempt to escape aboard a spaceship was thwarted by Colossus and Wolverine's use of the fastball special - Wolverine being thrown up to Ord's ship and subsequently sticking his hand in Ord's mouth, pointing out to Ord that he'd regrow the hand if Ord bit down but Ord wouldn't re-grow his head if Wolverine had to extend his claws - Ord was delivered into the custody of S.W.O.R.D. Later Ord escaped from the Peak, a space station in orbit around the Earth, with the assistance of Danger and attacked the X-Men while they were under attack by Cassandra Nova. Ord and Danger were subsequently captured by S.W.O.R.D, along with the X-Men, and teleported aboard a starship headed for Breakworld. Ord was able to contact his homeworld to alert them that Colossus was also aboard, an event deliberately engineered by Agent Brand to draw Breakworld's forces away from Earth. When the S.W.O.R.D. starship was captured by the Breakworlders, Ord was taken prisoner, charged with the failure of his mission, a crime punishable by death.Astonishing X-Men #17 He meets his final fate trying to save Colossus from Aghanne, the rebellious prophet trying to use Colossus' organic metal body to rip off the energy core of the Breakworld, which would ultimately spell the planet's destruction. This was because in Aghanne's eyes living under the tyrannical rule of Kruun in a world that valued strength and violence over love and compassion is a fate worse than death itself. Even though he was unable to withstand the harsh condition around the energy core, he sacrifices himself by breaking off without the needed suit, enabling Colossus to rip out Aghanne's own suit and save himself and the planet.Astonishing X-Men #18 He then dies, self immolating in the highly radioactive atmosphere of the reactor.Astonishing X-Men #23 Powers and abilities Ord possesses strength much greater than that of a human and is also capable of flight. It is unclear whether these attributes are shared by all members of his race, or if they are the product of alien technology.

Berkland (July 31, 1930 ‚Äì July 22, 2016) was an American geologist. who controversially claimed to be able to predict earthquakes, including the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and 1994 Northridge Earthquake. and who popularized the idea that some people are earthquake sensitive. He was profiled in a popular 2006 book as The Man Who Predicts Earthquakes. The book includes a chapter that notes \\"Many of Berkland's theories--based on tides, moons, disoriented pets, lost cats and dogs, and magnetic field changes--were factors in the great Indian Ocean quake-tsunami disaster on December 26, 2004.\\". but neither his methods nor his predictions have been published in any scientific journals for peer review. His results have been disputed by peers, with other scientists going so far as calling him a crank. and a clown.Jerry Seaton, a USGS seismologist: \\"We've known this guy throughout his professional life, and he's distinguished himself by being a clown the entire time.\\" Quoted in , and also in . His Family included his Wife Jan Berkland, children, Krista and Jay, and Grandchildren Kara and Jace Beyer.  Career  Jim Berkland studied geology at the University of California, Berkeley earning the Bachelor of Arts degree in 1958. Thereafter he worked for the United States Geological Survey while pursuing graduate study. In 1964, he took a position at the United States Bureau of Reclamation. After further graduate study, he taught for a year at Appalachian State University, 1972‚Äì1973, then returned to California to work as County Geologist for Santa Clara County from 1973 until he retired in 1994.  Predictions  Berkland's predictions have been either self-published in his newsletter or website, or announced in various interviews or speaking engagements.. His notoriety arose from an interview published in the Gilroy Dispatch on October 13, 1989, where he predicted that an earthquake with a magnitude between 3.5 and 6.0 would occur in the San Francisco Bay Area between October 14 and October 21.. The 6.9-magnitude Loma Prieta earthquake occurred on October 17, just four days later. Berkland claims that government officials told him not to make any more predictions, fearing mass panic, and he was suspended for two months from his Santa Clara County geology position in late October, 1989. Interviewed on Fox News in March 2011, Berkland predicted a massive earthquake in California for sometime between March 19 and March 26, 2011. He cited as factors the highest tides in 18 years and the proximity of the Moon, suggesting that the quake will most likely strike on Saturday, March 19, 2011. He also gave predictions on the Fox News Channel No such quake occurred.See USGS catalog of earthquakes . He has also claimed to have predicted the 1980 M 7.2 Eureka earthquake just fourteen hours before it hit, but the tape-recording documenting this \\"had somehow been lost in the mail\\".. Up to June 2010 Berkland made many predictions in his newsletter and on his website, for which he has claimed a \\"75 percent accuracy rate\\"..  Methodology  Amplitude of the ocean tide at Golden Gate Bridge for five weeks in 1970. Brackets indicate seismic window periods. Berkland has been predicting earthquakes since the 1970s, but his method has not been described in the scientific literature (he claims because of censorship and a conspiracy of prejudicial reviewers; .), nor in any detail in any media. reports that the details of Berkland's method have to be teased out, as in a scavenger hunt. In 1990 he described the \\"Seismic Window Theory\\" as \\"correlating gravitational stresses with earthquakes\\" - referring to the tidal stresses in the Earth resulting from the gravitational pull of the Moon, especially at lunar perigee, when the Moon is closest to the Earth. He said there are three main processes: (1) the solid Earth tide that deforms the Earth's crust (up to three feet), (2) oceanic tides, and (3) ground water pore-pressure. Since 1979 he has also subscribed to a theory that \\"pets often react prior to earthquakes by running away\\", which he measures by monitoring the lost-and-found ads in several newspapers.. He claims that ads for missing animals \\"increase dramatically by up to 300-400 per cent\\" prior to earthquakes. In 2006 Berkland's method was described. as the \\"Three Double G\\" system: 1) \\"the gravity gradient, or the forces exacted on the Earth by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon.\\" 2) \\"Gone Gatos\\" (missing cats) as indicated by advertisements in several newspapers. 3) \\"Geyser Gaps\\", seen as irregularities in the behavior of a geyser in the Napa Valley. Berkland's method has been said to also involve \\"a hodge-podge of factors\\".. McClellan provides the most detailed description.. Berkland starts with two lunar syzygies each month where the Sun, Moon, and Earth are aligned (corresponding to the new Moon and full Moon). He then sets a \\"seismic window\\" eight days long, beginning from one to three days before each syzygy. The one nearest perigee, that raises the highest tides, he terms primary, the other secondary. The greatest tides happen when syzygy and perigee are less than 25 hours apart (from two to five times a year). On that basis he then predicts one or more earthquakes of a specified magnitude within each of three regions on the U.S. West Coast, and one or more earthquakes globally. The West Coast regions are: :(a) within 140 miles from Los Angeles City Hall (34¬∞N 118¬∞W), :(b) within 140 miles of Mt. Diablo (east of San Francisco; 37.9¬∞N 121.9¬∞W), and :(c) anywhere in Washington or Oregon. Then he then selects location and magnitude by considering a number of other factors, including: :(1) unusual animal behavior :(2) misbehaving geysers and hot springs, :(3) extreme seasonal rainfall, :(4) reports of symptoms from human \\"seismic sensitives\\", :(5) magnetic fluctuations, :(6) seismic quiet periods, :(7) personal intuition (his so- called \\"MOSS predictions\\", or \\"monthly outright seismic speculations\\"). How Berkland evaluated his success rate prior to 1999 is unknown. Since then he has used his \\"dartboard\\" method,. where he takes credit not only for \\"bulls- eyes\\" (where an earthquake occurs within his windows of time, place, and magnitude), but also partial credit of 90, 80, or 70 percent for earthquakes within: * one, two, or three days on either side of his window, * 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 units of magnitude, * 10, 20, or 30 percent beyond his standard radius of 140 miles. The product of these scores is the summary score, and any score of 70% or greater is counted as a hit.  Scientific criticism  = Of methodology = Berkland's method of predicting earthquakes is based primarily on the idea that where tectonic forces have brought rock to the brink of failure earthquakes can be triggered by the tidal forces induced by the Sun and Moon, especially when they are greatest (that is, at the points of orbital syzygy, corresponding with the new Moon and full Moon). While this seems plausible, attempts to identify any such effect generally have been equivocal, possibly because various factors might not have been properly accounted for.See discussion in , and also in . An evaluation specifically of earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay area (done by the USGS in 1980 at Berkland's request) showed a slight deficiency of earthquakes during Berkland's \\"seismic windows\\". Although that deficiency was considered statistically insignificant, the overall conclusion was that \\"the seismic window theory fails as a reliable method of earthquake prediction.\\". A subsequent study in 2004 found slightly more M > 7.0 earthquakes than expected in seismic windows in a ten-year period, but this evened out in longer periods, and overall syzygy considerations were found to have no predictive value.. Other studies (e.g., ) have found no fortnightly tidal periodicity, either globally, or for southern California specifically. = Of predictions = Berkland has said that the only real test of a predictive method is how well it performs,. and in this regard he claims a \\"75 percent accuracy rate\\".. However,See discussion in . Berkland's \\"windows\\" are so large that they should net about three-quarters of all earthquakes even if they occurred randomly, without regard to syzygy. E.g., in a 28-day lunar cycle he has two windows of eight days each, plus six partial credit days, thus covering 22 days out of the 28.Similar criticisms apply to his handling of area and magnitude. (This is reminiscent of Charles Richter's pronouncement that \\"every earthquake takes place within 3 months of an equinox.\\"Quoted in .) The arbitrary inclusion of other undocumented factors makes the results nearly impossible to evaluate. One analysis that tried to evaluate his results in a consistent manner found no statistical significance, and concluded that \\"Berkland is not actually predicting earthquakes.\\". Berkland's claimed \\"accuracy rate\\" is also incomplete. The societal value of any prediction method depends not only on its success rate (the proportion of total predictions that are successful), but also on the false alarm ratio (the proportion of predictions that are false), and on the hit rate (proportion of all events successfully predicted), or its inversion, the number of earthquakes missed.See for details. These cannot be determined without knowing about all of the predictions made, which Berkland does not document.  See also  * Earthquake sensitive * Lists of earthquakes  Further reading  *. *. *. *.

Properties Epsilon Ophiuchi has a stellar classification of G9.5 IIIb, with the luminosity class of III indicating that this is a giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen and evolved away from the main sequence. This red giant has nearly double the Sun's mass and has expanded to an estimated radius of over ten times the radius of the Sun, giving it a luminosity of about 54 times the Sun. It is about a billion years old. Unusually for a class G giant, it is cyanogen- deficient and carbon-deficient. The outer envelope of this star displays solar-type oscillations with a period of 0.19 days, allowing the methods of asteroseismology to be applied. However, the models for this star have not been able to distinguish whether this star is generating energy by the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen along a shell, or the fusion of helium at its core. Either model produces a good fit to the star's physical properties. The projected rotational velocity of the star is 5.7 km s‚àí1, and the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight from the Earth lies in the range of 41‚Äì73¬∞.

Properties Delta Ophiuchi has a stellar classification of M0.5 III, making this a red giant star that has undergone expansion of its outer envelope after exhausting the supply of hydrogen at its core. It is currently on the asymptotic giant branch. The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is . At the estimated distance of Delta Ophiuchi, this yields a physical size of about 59 times the radius of the Sun. In spite of its enlarged size, this star has only 1.5 times the mass of the Sun and hence a much lower density. The effective temperature of the outer atmosphere of Delta Ophiuchi is a relatively cool 3,679 K, which is what gives it the orange-red hue of an M-type star. It is listed as a suspected variable star that may change by 0.03 in visual magnitude. It has a low projected rotational velocity of , which gives a minimum value for the azimuthal velocity along the star's equator. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is more than double the abundance in the Sun's photosphere. The star has a high optical linear polarisation that increases from red to blue wavelengths and displays some variability, this has been ascribed to either an asymmetric distribution of dust grains in an envelope expelled from it, or the presence of photometric hot spots.

In 2011, the government of Western Australia encouraged residents of Oombulgurri to move elsewhere, after it deemed the community unsustainable. The last residents from Oombulgurri were relocated to Wyndham just before Christmas 2011. History =Mission establishment= The Anglican Forrest River Mission for Aborigines was founded in 1896‚Äì97 by Harold Hale but was abandoned after a few months. A permanent mission, known as the Forrest River Mission, was established on the site in 1913 by the bishop of the north west, the Rt. Rev. Gerard Trower. In December 1913, Anglican priest Ernest Gribble took charge, three years after he was forced to resign as superintendent at Yarrabah. Gribble remained as superintendent until the early 1930s. In 1926 the mission was plagued by an influenza epidemic and impacted by the Forrest River massacre where police killed a number of Aboriginal people. This event remains controversial. The mission was closed in 1969, after the 1967 Aboriginal referendum. In 1973, fifty Aboriginal people decided to resettle their abandoned tribal land and rename it Oombulgurri. Within a year, the population had grown to 200. Infrastructure and welfare programs were set up in the 1970s and 1980s to provide the residents with basic amenities and to allow the town to become self-sufficient. =Coronial inquest into Aboriginal deaths= In 2007 a coronial inquiry began into Aboriginal deaths in the Kimberley, including five in Oombulgurri.Kimberley coronial inquests extendedThe Western Australian coroner is set to visit Oombulgurri today as part of an inquest into five Aboriginal deaths at the remote Kimberley community.Inquest hears damning evidenceHomes danger to occupants It revealed high levels of alcohol abuse, suicide and child neglect in Oombulgurri. Some time after the inquest, alcohol was banned there. =Child sex investigation= A police task force, Operation Sheepshank, began after a report was compiled on an alleged paedophile ring at the Aboriginal community of Kalumburu, in the Kimberley resulting in arrests of three men and a juvenile from Oombulgurri.Former Aboriginal community leader arrested on child sex chargesThree people from the remote Kimberley Aboriginal community of Oombulgurri have been charged with child sex offences.Community denies trying to thwart child abuse investigationPolice lay more child sex offences in Kimberley Closure In October 2010, the government of Western Australia announced plans to close the community of Oombulgurri, as its population had decreased from 150 to less than 50. In February 2011, the government was reportedly considering a number of proposals about the community's future once all the residents had moved out, including converting it into a tourism retreat or a juvenile justice facility. On 1 March 2011, the community's only store was dismantled and removed by boat. As of 2 March 2011, only seven residents still remained in Oombulgurri. Shortly before Christmas of 2011, the remaining residents were relocated to Wyndham. In 2014 the state government's plan to demolish most of the buildings at the site was opposed by former residents. Access Oombulgurri is only reliably accessible by boat or by air, as the unsealed road leading to the town is washed out most of the year due to the wet season. There is an airstrip nearby for light aircraft. Notes References *Book review of related books. Retrieved 9 November 2005 *Western Australian education records summary (pdf).

Diamond is a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, which is Stanford University's main center for research on international issues. At the Institute Diamond serves as the director of the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law. Diamond has served as an advisor to numerous governmental and international organizations at various points in his life, including the United States Department of State, United Nations, World Bank, and U.S. Agency for International Development. He is a founding co-editor of the National Endowment for Democracy's Journal of Democracy. He is also a coordinator of the Hoover Institution's Iran Democracy Project, along with Abbas Milani and Michael McFaul. Career Diamond obtained a B.A. degree in Political Organization and Behavior in 1974, an M.A. degree from the Food Research Institute in 1978, and a Ph.D. in Sociology in 1980, all at Stanford University. Diamond was Assistant Professor of Sociology at Vanderbilt University (1980‚Äì1985). He was founding co-director of the National Endowment for Democracy's International Forum for Democratic Studies (1994‚Äì2009). Among the many governmental and nongovernmental agencies that he has advised, Diamond served as a consultant to the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2002 to 2003. Diamond was named Stanford's \\"Teacher of the Year\\" in May 2007. At the June 2007 commencement ceremonies he was awarded the Dinkelspiel Award for Distinctive Contributions to Undergraduate Education. Among the many reasons for Diamond to receive this award it was cited that he fostered dialogue between Jewish and Muslim students. He was the dissertation adviser for Regina Ip, former Secretary for Security of Hong Kong during her years at Stanford. =Post-2003 Iraq= In early 2004, Diamond was a senior adviser on governance to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. His book Squandered Victory: The American Occupation and the Bungled Effort to Bring Democracy to Iraq, published in 2005, was one of the first public critical analyses of America's post-invasion of Iraq strategy.  Views on democracy  Despite the surge of democracy throughout the world up until the 1990s, Diamond believes democracy must improve where it already exists before it can spread to other countries. He believes solving a country's governance, rather than its economy, is the answer. Every democratic country needs to be held responsible for good governance, not just when it suits them. Without significant improvements in governance, economic growth will not be sustainable. As Diamond stated in his book, The Spirit of Democracy: The Struggle to Build Free Societies Throughout the World, \\"for democratic structures to endure ‚Äì and be worthy of endurance ‚Äì they must listen to their citizens' voices, engage their participation, tolerate their protests, protect their freedoms, and respond to their needs.\\" Diamond has written and edited many pieces on the growth of democracy and its current recession on an international level. In his paper \\"The Democratic Rollback: The Resurgence of the Predatory State,\\" Diamond states that one of the main reasons for this recession in democracy is a surge of young democratic countries which employ rigged elections, intense intimidation of any opposing political party, and unstoppable expansion in executive power. What makes it worse is that many of these countries are still being accepted as democracies by western states. He cites Vladimir Putin in Russia and Hugo Ch√°vez in Venezuela as examples. Due to the growth of these corrupted semi-democracies, which Diamond calls electoral authoritarianism, there has been a worldwide fall in the confidence in democracy, especially in developing countries. Unlike many other political scientists, Diamond doesn't hold economic development, or lack thereof, as the number one factor in the decline of democracy. Diamond states that the efficiency of the government is the first problem. If the government cannot provide a safe and equal economic and political playing field then any work in promoting economic development will be useless. He cites the Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki as an example. Kibaki helped Kenya reach some of its highest levels of economic growth but failed to address massive corruption, which led to claims of fraud in his 2007 presidential election, which in turn exploded into violence. Diamond believes if governance is not improved in democratic states, people will turn to authoritarian alternatives. This will then lead to predatory states. Predatory states produce predatory societies: people do not gain wealth and a better quality of life through ways beneficial to the entire country, but get rich by taking advantage of power and privilege, by stealing from the state, and diminishing the power of the law. In order to ensure predatory states do not occur, institutions must be put in place to establish control and order. So that democracy can be revived, and sustained, throughout the world, the U.S. and other developed countries must play their part. The U.S. should primarily give financial aid to countries that are using the money to further develop their governance. This selectivity is defined in the Millennium Challenge Account (part of Bush's foreign policy). Under this policy, it says a country will receive aid dependent on \\"whether they rule justly, whether they invest in basic health care and education, and whether they promote economic freedom.\\" The important thing to remember is promoting democracy will take time and effort.

Overview  NEOS input statistics for January 2011. The format was named after an early IBM LP product and has emerged as a de facto standard ASCII medium among most of the commercial LP solvers. Essentially all commercial LP solvers accept this format, and it is also accepted by the open-source COIN-OR system. Other software may require a customized reader routine in order to read MPS files. However, with the acceptance of algebraic modeling languages MPS usage has declined. For example, according to the NEOS server statistics in January 2011 less than 1% of submissions were in MPS form compared to 59.4% of AMPL and 29.7% of GAMS submissions. MPS is column-oriented (as opposed to entering the model as equations), and all model components (variables, rows, etc.) receive names. MPS is an old format, so it is set up for punch cards: Fields start in column 2, 5, 15, 25, 40 and 50. Sections of an MPS file are marked by so-called header cards, which are distinguished by their starting in column 1. Although it is typical to use upper-case throughout the file for historical reasons, many MPS-readers will accept mixed-case for anything except the header cards, and some allow mixed-case anywhere. The names that you choose for the individual entities (constraints or variables) are not important to the solver; one should pick meaningful names, or easy names for a post-processing code to read.  MPS format  Here is a little sample model written in MPS format (explained in more detail below): NAME TESTPROB ROWS N COST L LIM1 G LIM2 E MYEQN COLUMNS XONE COST 1 LIM1 1 XONE LIM2 1 YTWO COST 4 LIM1 1 YTWO MYEQN -1 ZTHREE COST 9 LIM2 1 ZTHREE MYEQN 1 RHS RHS1 LIM1 5 LIM2 10 RHS1 MYEQN 7 BOUNDS UP BND1 XONE 4 LO BND1 YTWO -1 UP BND1 YTWO 1 ENDATA For comparison, here is the same model written out in an equation-oriented format: Optimize COST: XONE + 4*YTWO + 9*ZTHREE Subject To LIM1: XONE + YTWO <= 5 LIM2: XONE + ZTHREE >= 10 MYEQN: - YTWO + ZTHREE = 7 Bounds XONE <= 4 -1 <= YTWO <= 1 End As mentioned below, the lower bound on XONE is either zero or -infinity, depending upon implementation, because it is not specified. Strangely, nothing in MPS format specifies the direction of optimization, and there is no standard \\"default\\" direction; some LP solvers will maximize if not instructed otherwise, others will minimize, and still others put safety first and have no default and require a selection somewhere in a control program or by a calling parameter. If the model is formulated for minimization and the solver requires maximization (or vice versa), it is easy to convert between the two by negating all coefficients of the objective function. The optimal value of the objective function will then be the negative of the original optimal value, but the values of the variables themselves will be correct. Some programs support specifying minimization/maximization within the MPS file. OBJSENSE MAX  Variables  The NAME record can have any value, starting in column 15. The ROWS section defines the names of all the constraints; entries in column 2 or 3 are E for equality ( = ) rows, L for less-than ( <= ) rows, G for greater-than ( >= ) rows, and N for non- constraining rows. The order of the rows named in this section is unimportant, except for non-constraining rows market N, the first of which would be interpreted as the objective function. The COLUMNS section contains the entries of the A-matrix. All entries for a given column must be placed consecutively, although within a column the order of the entries (rows) is irrelevant. Rows not mentioned for a column are implied to have a coefficient of zero. The RHS section allows one or more right-hand-side vectors to be defined; there is seldom more than one. In the above example, the name of the RHS vector is RHS1, and has non-zero values in all 3 of the constraint rows of the problem. Rows not mentioned in an RHS vector would be assumed to have a right-hand-side of zero. The optional BOUNDS section specifies lower and upper bounds on individual variables, if they are not given by rows in the matrix. All the bounds that have a given name in column 5 are taken together as a set. Variables not mentioned in a given BOUNDS set are taken to be non-negative (lower bound zero, no upper bound). A bound of type UP means an upper bound is applied to the variable. A bound of type LO means a lower bound is applied. A bound type of FX (\\"fixed\\") means that the variable has upper and lower bounds equal to a single value. A bound type of FR (\\"free\\") means the variable has neither lower nor upper bounds and so can take on negative values. A variation on that is MI for free negative, giving an upper bound of 0 but no lower bound. Bound type PL is for a free positive from zero to plus infinity, but as this is the normal default, it is seldom used. There are also bound types for use in MIP models ‚Äì BV for binary, being 0 or 1. UI for upper integer and LI for lower integer. SC stands for semi-continuous and indicates that the variable may be zero, but if not must be equal to at least the value given. Another optional section called RANGES specifies double-inequalities, in a somewhat counterintuitive way not described here. Ways to mark integer variables are also beyond the scope of this article (keyword MARKER and possibly SOS are involved). The final card must be ENDATA (notice the odd spelling). A few special cases of the MPS standard are not consistently handled by implementations. In the BOUNDS section, if a variable is given a nonpositive upper bound but no lower bound, its lower bound may default to zero or to minus infinity (also, if the upper bound is given as zero, the lower bound might be zero or negative infinity).IBM CPLEX document If an integer variable has no upper bound specified, its upper bound may default to one rather than to plus infinity.  Limitations  MPS has many limitations. It does not specify the direction of optimization which is handled differently by solvers. Numeric fields have 12 characters width therefore limiting the precision. The representation is neither easy for human interpretation nor compact (although reserves column / row order information, which is often beneficial for LP solver behaviour reproducibility). One of the alternatives to MPS that does not have its limitations and is supported by most solvers is the nl file format.  Extensions  Many LP products include extensions to the MPS format. The free format MPS allows for long names and more accurate data by allowing fields to exceed the columns defined by the original standard, and apply whitespaces as separators instead of fixed column positions (note that this makes some MPS files that included whitespaces as part of names to be no longer valid). Some extensions include adding new kind of data to the MPS file (e.g. sections to include objective sense, integrality requirements, quadratic data or advanced MIP modelling constructs). There is also a compressed MPSC file format. SMPS is a specialized extension, designed to represent stochastic programming problem instances, in use especially in research environments. Although some extensions are not standardized, the format is still in general use.

It was established in 1946 as a vocational school. Since the 1990s, new programs were inaugurated to meet the needs of the Russian immigrant population in Israel. History The school was originally called Shevah, named after a British World War II pilot, who was the uncle of one of the founders of the school. Founded in 1945, it was the second Hebrew high school in Tel Aviv, after Gymnasia Herzliya. It was founded on the ruins of the Mount Hope farm,Tel Aviv municipality http://tel- aviv.millenium.org.il/NR/exeres/747CE319-2E55-49F6-9DED-1B9C50FF0476,frameless.htm founded by Clorinda S. Minor and others. The buildings is a design by the architect Genia Averbuch. Shevah was initially a vocational school teaching trades such as cabinet making, electricity, mechanics and sheet metal works. As the demand for such schools declined, it became an academic high school. In the 1990s, with the onset of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, Shevah introduced a new educational approach to help Russian youngsters from falling behind due to the language barrier. Intensive Hebrew language classes were organized based on proficiency in Hebrew rather than age, and a program for parents was developed that included Hebrew language studies, Jewish history and culture. In the 1990s, Yakov Mazganov, a Russian professor employed as a security guard at the school, founded Mofet, a night school for Russian immigrants that operated in the Shevah building after school hours. In turn, this attracted more Russian Ph.D.s and former professors to teach, as they couldn't find a job anywhere else, due to their lack of Hebrew knowledge. Eventually a decision was made to merge Shevah and Mofet and the Russian teachers started teaching in the regular school, which became known as Shevah- Mofet. While classes at the night school often went on in Russian, all classes in the day school were taught exclusively in Hebrew. Mofet is an acronym containing the words Mathematics and Physics, but also means excellence. This gave the school a reputation of being one of the best, but also discouraged attendance from many non-Russian students, who did not want to be part of a Russian-speaking high school in Hebrew-speaking Israel. The school was nicknamed 'Little Russia' by many. In 1995, the southern Tel Aviv school's team made a sensation by winning the first place on the team competition in Mathematics, hosted by Technion. Later, A Shevah student won a silver medal at an international junior software engineering olympics in Zagreb, Croatia on August 21, 2007, several students won medals on the International Mathematical Olympiad including the gold medal by Lev Buhovsky in 1996 and several silver and bronze medals on the Asian and the International Physics Olympiads. Shevah Mofet has attracted many Russian visitors, notably figures such as Sergei Brin, one of the creators of Google, and Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president. Dolpharium massacre memorial in Shevach Mofet school On June 1, 2001, an Arab suicide bomber killed 21 Israeli teenagers in the Tel Aviv \\"Dolphi\\" discoth√®que. Seven of the victims were from the Shevah Mofet high school, with more injured.Tel-Aviv suicide bombing at the Dolphin disco June 1, 2001 The bombing created an international outrage, but also caused many Jewish communities worldwide to donate money to Shevah Mofet. This helped improve the financial situation of the school and create a new library and cafeteria. In November 2002, it was discovered that the school cafeteria served expired, or otherwise bad food products. It created a citywide scandal, where the media (newspapers such as Yedioth Ahronoth and Maariv) was involved, as well as the health ministry. Despite this, the cafeteria was still operating and employing the same workers in a repeat check-up in August 2003. Organization For many years, Shevah Mofet was a 6-year school organized into a junior-high school (grades 7‚Äì9), and a secondary school (grades 10‚Äì12). In 2007‚Äì08 however, a new organization was introduced, and the school was split into 3 two-grade sub-sections. The secondary school has five departments, each focusing on a specific subject.

Ritchey is a US pioneer in modern frame building and the first production mountain bike builder/manufacturer in the history of the sport. He is an innovator of bicycle components that have been used in winning some of the biggest cycling competitions in the world including the UCI World Championships, the Tour de France and the Olympics. In 1988, Ritchey was inducted into the inaugural Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in Crested Butte, Colorado (now located in Fairfax, California): and 2012, inducted to the United States Bicycle Hall of Fame in Davis, California. Early years Tom Ritchey moved to Menlo Park, California, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, in 1963, when his father was hired as an engineer at Ampex Corporation, an electronics company located in Redwood City, California, pioneered the magnetic tape recorder. Ritchey attributes his interest in bicycles to his father's interest in cycling, as his father found cycling as a means to get to work and fell in love with the sport himself. At age 11, Ritchey's father taught Tom Jr. to build his wheels and repair tubular tires. Ritchey started a small business repairing tires to earn money to buy his first road bike, a Raleigh Super Corsa. When he was 14, Ritchey joined the Belmont Bicycle Club (BBC) and began racing. Shortly after this, he upgraded his bike to a frame he repaired himself, a broken Cinelli \\"B.\\" His father taught him how to braze around this time, and he started repairing bicycle frames for local racers. After learning to repair/replace other builders' damaged tubes, Ritchey built his first racing frame. He decided to build his frame out of a necessity for an affordable, lighter, faster bike. He bought the tube set and lugs from local builder Hugh Enox at the time for $21, and in 1972 built his first frame, which he raced on that year. He won many junior races and titles on this very frame, and eventually, on future bikes, he built winning the Senior Prestige Road trophy and the BAR (Best All-Around Rider) in 1973 and 1974 as a Junior. These feats led to Ritchey being known as the \\"Senior Slayer\\", having beaten top Californians (many of whom considered to be some of the best riders in the U.S. at the time) and former Olympians. Tom rode for Team USA's Junior Worlds road racing squad, and then a stint on the U.S. National Road Team. In 1976, Ritchey retired from road racing. He continued to race mountain bikes through the early 1980s, competing more recently in races like the Downieville Classic, La Ruta, Trans Andes, Trans Alps, and Cape Epic in South Africa. During his early racing years, Ritchey began building bikes for Palo Alto Bicycles and its national mail order catalog. In 1974, as his senior year in high school approached, Ritchey had already built approximately 200 frames. It was around this time he honed his fillet brazing or \\"lugless\\" method of fabricating frames. Ritchey sought to challenge bicycle industry standards of frame tubing diameter at the time limited by the use of fixed dimensioned lugs. Ritchey's fillet brazing construction method allowed the choice of larger thin-wall tubing diameters and unique ovalizations to create lighter -stiffer frames. By 1979, Ritchey had produced over 1,000 frames on his own. Personal life Ritchey is married to his second wife, Martha. Together they have six children; son Jay, and daughters Sara and Annie (Tom), and sons Steven, David, and Christopher (Martha). Tom and Martha have six grandchildren. Off-road riding and the mountain bike Ritchey often cites his friend, the late Jobst Brandt as being crucial not only to his development as a cyclist and component designer, but for his deep passion in off-road riding. Brandt, author of the iconic book, The Bicycle Wheel, had a riding style that was unlike anyone else at the time. Brandt would lead his infamous rides that quickly left the paved roads behind and ventured onto to dirt single-track trails on traditional road bikes with no modification‚Äîsomething completely unheard in the 1960s and '70s. In 1978, Ritchey was approached by Joe Breeze and Otis Guy to build a tandem for them to use in a record attempt across America. Breeze brought his newly made off- road \\"ballooner\\" bike to Ritchey's shop in Menlo Park. While he credits Joe Breeze for building the first custom off-road specific 26\\" wheeled frame, however, known only to a few people, Ritchey had already built an off-road specific 650b bike along the design lines of a fatter tired, flat barred \\"woodsy/cow trail\\" bike. Ritchey says he was influenced by the late John Finley Scott, who encouraged him to build a bike for years with 650b wheels and tires. Upon seeing Joe's bike, he said, \\"I think I‚Äôll build something like that also.\\" Breeze returned to his home of Fairfax, CA and told Gary Fisher of Ritchey's intentions to build a 26\\" \\"ballooner.\\" Immediately, Fisher called Ritchey and asked Ritchey to build him one as well. Because of Ritchey's production mindset, he built a third frame. When Fisher picked up his frame a few months later and learned of the third frame, he told Ritchey, \\"I can sell that.\\" The seeds of the new \\"mountain bike\\" company were sewn, beginning with Fisher selling bike #3 to a fellow Marin resident. These \\"ballooners\\" were first featured in BMX Plus magazine, before the world identified them as a mountain bike, and a new buzz surrounded this new style of off-road bike. Fisher enlisted the help of his friend and roommate, Charlie Kelly, to market and sell the bikes Ritchey was building. Because Ritchey had years of custom frame and component manufacturing experience, he was uniquely suited to tackle and establish many of the new designs and standards this new breed of bicycle would require. The company initially was called Ritchey MountainBikes, with Ritchey fillet brazing over 1000 bikes over the course of those beginning three years. This high volume of production lead to Ritchey becoming mountain biking's first production frame builder, earning him the moniker, \\"The General Motors of mountain bike frame companies,\\" from Mike Sinyard of Specialized. The informal business lasted about three years, with Ritchey building the bikes in the mountains of the south bay peninsula while Fisher and Kelly sold them out of Fairfax and Marin. In 1983, Ritchey left the relationship. Kelly also left due to personal reasons. On his own, Ritchey sold his remaining frames to a new company out of British Columbia, called Rocky Mountain Bicycles. Out of this turbulent time Ritchey built his own sales and marketing company, hired a retired professional road racer, Mike Neel, as his salesman and created Ritchey Design. By the early 80s general interest in cycling was in decline, however, mountain biking was growing. Events like Pearl Pass and the NORBA '83 National Championships drove interest in the emerging sport. By the mid 1980s, over 25 percent of the bike industry was based on mountain bikes, with Ritchey emerging as the #1 off-road component design company outside of Shimano. Innovations Again, Jobst Brandt was crucial to the young and aspiring Ritchey, and the products he was designing. Brandt, a mechanical engineer at Hewlett Packard, always called into question Tom's new ideas‚Äîscrutinizing every detail of his designs. Ritchey, who sought to design and produce components that were light and fast, was often countered by Brandt who demanded components be durable and strong enough to endure the back country epic rides Jobst liked to do. Ritchey's foundational design principles emerged from these dueling philosophes. Among the first of Ritchey's designs to be brought to use was his \\"Logic\\" steel frame tubing. With the new era of fillet brazing he pioneered, and the new uprising of TIG welded frame production, Ritchey knew that condensed, force-direction butted tubing would produce steel frames that would be lighter and stronger than common butted tubes previously manufactured. Initially Ritchey sought tubes from Italian company Columbus however they didn't meet Ritchey's specifications, so Tange of Japan was the final supplier. Their success lead to the birth of Logic Tubing. This tubing changed the way tubing manufacturers thought about butting profiles, allowing the manufacture of lighter, yet extremely durable larger diameter steel tubing bikes. He later took his same shortened butt concept to spoke manufacturer DT Swiss to produce spokes to build lighter, stronger wheels. Below is a list of a few innovations and firsts Ritchey produced: ‚Ä¢ 1974 Twin-plated crown forks ‚Ä¢ 1979 New \\"MountainBikes\\" frame ‚Ä¢ 1980 130mm mountain bike specific rear hub ‚Ä¢ 1980 120mm bottom bracket spindle to account for wider chain stays that accommodate a wider rear tire ‚Ä¢ 1980 The Bullmoose integrated mountain bike specific handlebar and stem ‚Ä¢ 1983 Standard unicrown tapered fork ‚Ä¢ 1984 Logic butted tubing ‚Ä¢ 1984 Developed new MTB specific tread design with IRC, Japan.

A wider, 25mm rim developed to better handle a wider knobby tire. ‚Ä¢ 1989 Logic Condensed double butted spokes produced by DT Swiss ‚Ä¢ 1989 Developed alloy 3D net shape forging, for stems that lead way to a new generation of lighter, stiffer and stronger stems that did away with welding. ‚Ä¢ 1992 First to succeed in Off Center Rim Technology (OCR) made possible a balanced spoke tension in rear wheels and off center disc specific front and rear wheels. ‚Ä¢ 1995 2x9 speed drivetrain for mountain bikes Film ‚Ä¢ Tom Ritchey was profiled in the 2007 documentary film Klunkerz: A Film About Mountain Bikes. ‚Ä¢ \\"Tom Ritchey's 40 Year Ride,\\" a documentary was released in August 2012 chronicling four decades of Ritchey's business ‚Ä¢ \\"Rising from Ashes,\\" a documentary film chronicling the beginning of Team Rwandahttps://web.archive.org/web/20121103083219/http://risingfromashesthemovie.com/ Accolades and awards * 1988, inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame * 2012, inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame Project Rwanda In December 2005, Ritchey toured Rwanda by bicycle. He found the landscape to be a beautiful one, but the people and their journey of reconciliation even more compelling. Ritchey rode through the hilly countryside, (Rwanda is called Land of a Thousand Hills) and witnessed the incredible cycling talent that existed there, without any of the modern cycling technology available to the average cyclist here in the USA. Ritchey believed that a national cycling team could bring a sense of hope and national pride. Within the next few months, Ritchey began to formalize a 501c3 called, Project Rwanda. Ritchey then asked his friend, Jared Miller, if he would go to Rwanda to explore possibilities of putting on a cycling event. On September 16, 2006, Ritchey sponsored the first annual Rwandan Wooden Bike Classic in Karongi Stadium, a mountain bike, wooden bike, and single speed colonial bike race. Attendance was over 3,000. Ritchey asked North American Tour de France Stage winner, Alex Stieda, and cycling pioneer, Jock Boyer, to race alongside him at the event held to celebrate the wooden bike innovation and what it meant to Ritchey. After the event, Ritchey asked Boyer to help him in finding and cultivating cycling talent, which would become Team Rwanda. Ritchey designed a geared cargo/coffee bike, capable of carrying heavy loads, to help the Rwandans, especially the coffee farmers in the rural areas of Rwanda, get their crops more efficiently to washing stations. He worked with other NGO's like World Vision and Bikes for Rwanda, to help distribute approximately 4,000 bikes, through micro finance programs and grants.

It was released on 17 October 2006 for the PlayStation 2. A remastered version of the game, subtitled Scholarship Edition, was developed by Mad Doc Software and released on 4 March 2008 for Xbox 360 and Wii, and on 21 October 2008 for Microsoft Windows. Bully was re-released for PlayStation 4 available via PlayStation Network on 22 March 2016. An updated version of the Scholarship Edition, titled Anniversary Edition, was developed by War Drum Studios and released for Android and iOS on 8 December 2016. Set within the fictional town of Bullworth, the story follows juvenile delinquent student James \\"Jimmy\\" Hopkins, who is involuntarily enrolled at Bullworth Academy for a year, and his efforts to rise through the ranks of the school system in order to put a stop to bullying. Players control Jimmy as he attempts to become more popular among the school's various \\"cliques\\", in addition to attending classes and completing side missions. The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot, skateboard, scooter, bicycle, or go-kart. In the Scholarship Edition, a two-player competitive multiplayer mode lets two players compete for the highest score in different classes. Despite initial controversy for its expected violence and homosexual content, Bully received positive reviews, with praise directed at the game's missions, narrative as well as the characters and their development. Criticism was reserved for its presentation and glitches. The original version of Bully sold over 1.5 million copies, and received multiple year-end accolades.  Gameplay  Bully is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The game's single-player mode has the player control a high school student‚Äîteenage rebel James \\"Jimmy\\" Hopkins. Throughout the story, Jimmy rises through the ranks of the school groups, archetypes which include Bullies, Nerds, Preppies, Greasers, and Jocks. Players complete missions‚Äîlinear scenarios with set objectives‚Äîto progress through the story. Missions reward the player with cash, new items, and increase/decrease the respect of certain groups. If a group holds Jimmy in high regard, they will act friendly towards him; if a group despises Jimmy, they will attack him on sight. Outside of missions, the player can freely roam the game's open world, consisting of the fictional town of Bullworth, and has the ability to complete optional side missions. When not performing missions, the player can attend classes, presented as minigames. Each course has five classes, which increase in difficulty, and passing all five will result in the player passing the course. Classes reward the player with new clothing items or abilities; for example, English allows the player to apologise to authority figures after violating rules, and Gym unlocks new fighting moves. Not attending classes when they are available is considered a violation of rules, unless they have been completed, in which case they become optional. The player can use melee attacks and weapons to fight enemies. The weapons available include slingshots, bags of marbles, stink bombs, baseball bats, planks of wood, and spud cannons. Jimmy can run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the game's world. The vehicles featured in the game include a skateboard, scooters, bicycles and go-karts. The player can also grab onto the back of a moving car while on a skateboard, but can't drive car themselves. Bus stops located in various locations around the world allow the player to quickly travel back to Bullworth Academy. Should the player take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated using multiple techniques, such as drinking sodas, which can be obtained from vending machines, and kissing certain NPCs after interacting with them. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and the player respawns at the nearest medical center. If the player breaks rules while playing, the game's authority figures (teachers and policemen) may respond as indicated by a \\"trouble\\" meter in the head-up display (HUD). The levels desplayed on the meter indicate the current level of severity. Authority figures will attempt to grab and subdue the player, who may fight back. The higher the severity level is, the harder will authority figures try to catch the player; at the maximum sixth level, the player can no longer fight back, as they will be instantly \\"busted\\" should they be grabbed. If the player is busted, they respawn at the nearest police station or the school principal's office and all their weapons (sans the slingshot) are confiscated. If a class is in progress, the player will instead be taken to it and forced to attend (unless they have already completed it). Authority figures can subdue other students as well, should they cause trouble. The game's multiplayer component, exclusive to the Scholarship Edition on Wii and Xbox 360, has two players compete to gain the highest score in the same minigames used for classes. One player controls Jimmy, and the other Gary Smith.  Synopsis  = Setting = Artwork of protagonist Jimmy Hopkins (left) and antagonist Gary Smith (right) Bully takes place at Bullworth Academy, a private boarding school in the New England region of the United States. After being expelled from seven previous schools, the game's protagonist, 15-year-old James \\"Jimmy\\" Hopkins, is sent there for a year while his mother and her new husband go on their honeymoon. The school campus is designed in a neo-gothic style, similar to public schools and colleges in the United Kingdom and New England, such as Fettes College in Edinburgh. Surrounding the Academy is the town of Bullworth, consisting of four main districts: Bullworth Town, the town's commercial borough, housing plenty of shops and the city hall; Old Bullworth Vale, consisting of a suburb area that houses several mansions and shops, a beach and a funfair; New Conventry, a run-down, urban-poor borough, consisting mainly of tenement housing; and Blue Skies Industrial Park, the town's industrial borough, which mainly consists of factories and industrial buildings, in addition to the docks and a trailer park housing the town's poorest residents. There is also the Happy Volts Asylum, a psychiatric institute located between the Blue Skies Industrial Park and the Bullworth Academy. At the beginning of the game, players are able to explore only the Academy, but as the story progresses, the other districts are unlocked. The town's appearance also changes with the story's progression, most notably during Chapter 3, which is set during winter and, as such, the town is covered in snow. = Plot = After being dropped off at Bullworth Academy, Jimmy Hopkins (Gerry Rosenthal) meets with principal Dr. Crabblesnitch (Ralph Gunderman), who urges him to \\"keep his nose clean\\". He is soon befriended by senior Gary Smith (Peter Vack) and freshman Peter \\"Petey\\" Kowalski (Matt Bush), and the former introduces him to Bullworth's various \\"cliques\\": the Bullies, Nerds, Preppies, Greasers, and Jocks. Initially, the two boys work together to try and assert their dominance over the cliques by playing pranks, while occasionally fending off the Bullies and gaining favour with the Nerds. However, an increasingly paranoid Gary eventually betrays Jimmy by pitting him against Russell Northrop (Cody Melton), the leader of the Bullies, in an underground fight. Jimmy beats Russell and forces him to stop picking on his fellow students, earning the Bullies' respect. Over the following months, Jimmy, aided by Petey, works to take over the other cliques in an attempt to restore peace to Bullworth. He begins with the Preppies, but just as he begins to win them over, Gary tricks them into turning against him. In response, Jimmy wins a boxing tournament hosted by the Preppies' leader, Derby Harrington (John Lavelle), and, when the Preppies still refuse to recognize his superiority, he resorts to beating them and declaring himself the new leader. In the winter, Jimmy is approached by the Greasers' leader, Johnny Vincent (Rocco Rosanio), to help expose an affair between his girlfriend Lola Lombardi (Phoebe Strole) and Gord Vendome (Drew Gehling), a member of the Preppies. However, the Greasers turn on Jimmy after he is forced to make amends with the Preppies by vandalizing the Greasers' territory, and Gary tips Johnny off on Jimmy's growing closeness with Lola. Johnny sets an ambush for Jimmy, but is ultimately defeated and the Greasers recognize Jimmy as their superior. Jimmy next moves to beat the Jocks, regarded as the most powerful clique, so he resorts to seeking assistance from their main rivals, the Nerds. When they refuse to help, Jimmy fights his way through them to confront their leader, Earnest Jones (Jesse Tendler), whom he convinces they don't have to be enemies, earning the Nerds' respect. After a failed first attempt to humiliate the Jocks by spreading inappropriate pictures of the school's head cheerleader, Mandy Wiles (Elena Franklin), Jimmy is forced to defend the Nerds' hideout from a Jock attack and remove the pictures, earning Mandy's affection. The Nerds later have Jimmy pose as the school's mascot while playing a series of pranks to the Jocks before their big football game. Humiliated in front of the entire school, their leader, Ted Thompson (Alexander Cendese), challenges Jimmy to a fight in the school's football field, which the Jocks lose. Having united all the cliques under his rule and restored peace to Bullworth, Jimmy boasts in his newfound glory and respect. Meanwhile, Gary convinces the cliques to pressure Jimmy into vandalizing Bullworth's town hall, and recruits the \\"Townies\\", a group of former Bullworth students who seek revenge against the school, to play a series of dangerous pranks on the cliques, so that they would turn on Jimmy, believing his lack of leadership skill led to this. Upon informing Crabblesnitch of Jimmy vandalazing the town hall, he is appointed head boy, while Jimmy is expelled. Seeking revenge, Jimmy meets Townie member Zoe Taylor (Molly Fox) and helps her get revenge on predatory Bullworth gym teacher Mr. Burton (Michael Boyle), who got her expelled when she accused him of sexually harassing her. With Zoe and Russell's help, Jimmy attacks the Townies' hangout, where he defeats their leader, Edgar Munsen (Jan Milewicz). Upon revealing Gary's deception, Jimmy earns Edgar's respect, who offers him Townie support. Soon after, Gary and his followers take Crabblesnitch hostage, sparking a full-blown war between the cliques. The Townies and Russell help Jimmy neutralize the clique leaders, allowing him to chase Gary to main building's roof. After a climactic fight, Jimmy tackles him over the side and the two fall through the roof of Crabblesnitch's office. Once freed, he expels Gary, fires Mr. Burton for his actions against Zoe, appoints Petey as head boy, and allows Jimmy and Zoe to return to Bullworth. As his friends and allies cheer on, Jimmy shares a kiss with Zoe.  Development  Rockstar announced Bully in May 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox with an original expected release date of October 2005. Early information released by Take-Two Interactive seemed to indicate that the player would be taking the role of a bully, and screenshots printed in Electronic Gaming Monthly showed the player-controlled antagonist administering a \\"swirlie\\" and throwing a punch at another student. However, the tone of the final game was different, with the player in the role of a problem student who stood up to and fought back against bullies, in effect, bullying on behalf of the victims, or in self-defense. The PlayStation 2 version of the game uses an advanced Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas engine through RenderWare. Rockstar Vancouver decided to make every student in the school have a unique appearance and personality. When developing the characters, the team aimed at recreating the state of being a child, and making it enjoyable. Parallels were made between Jimmy and Catcher in the Ryes Holden Caulfield. Jimmy and Holden share a background of a difficult homelife and being thrown out of multiple private schools.Jimmy: Mom, why did you marry that phony? Though the pompous school principal Dr. Crabblesnitch is originally introduced as the main antagonist, this role is later taken by Gary Smith, who initially befriends Jimmy. Gary is described as a sociopath.Algernon: Nothing... just that you are friends with that sociopath Gary. He admits that he suffers from attention-deficit disorder and is a narcissist, as he considers himself smarter and better than everyone,Gary: I'm a genius! Geniuses don't NEED medication! and wants to run the school. = Scholarship Edition = On 19 July 2007, Rockstar announced that a remaster would be released for the Wii and Xbox 360, subtitled Scholarship Edition. Rockstar New England, then called Mad Doc Software, led development with the Xbox 360 version while Rockstar Toronto ported it to the Wii. The Wii and Xbox 360 versions were released on 4 March 2008. A Microsoft Windows port was later developed by Rockstar New England and released on 21 October 2008. The game features additional content which is not in the original version, including missions, characters, school classes, and unlockable items and clothing. Some small script changes have been made, and the highly compressed voice files of the original have been replaced with higher-quality versions. The random non- player characters also have more lines. In addition, single system two-player competitive multiplayer minigames have also been added, along with Achievements for the Xbox 360 version and Wii Remote and Nunchuk motion and pointer controls for the Wii version. All ports of the Scholarship Edition use the game engine Gamebryo, rather than RenderWare, which was used for the original version.  Reception  = Critical response = Bully received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Hypers Daniel Wilks commends the game for its \\"clever script, some novel missions, and well constructed characters\\". However, he criticised it for \\"time dilation, dodgy camera, and generic mini-games\\". As of 12 March 2008, the PlayStation 2 version of Bully had sold 1.5 million copies according to Take-Two Interactive. = Remaster = Bully: Scholarship Edition was released on 4 March 2008 for Wii and Xbox 360, and 21 October 2008 for Microsoft Windows. According to Metacritic, the Wii and Xbox 360 versions received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PC version received \\"mixed or average reviews\\". IGN gave the Wii version an 8/10, while the Xbox 360 version received 8.7/10. 1UP.com gave the Wii version an A- grade and the Xbox 360 version a B- grade. Gameplasma gave the Wii version a 9/10. The PC version, however, received mixed reviews ranging from a \\"Good\\" rating of 7.8 from IGN to a C- from 1UP.com who called it \\"[a] shoddy, untimely port that, inexplicably -- considering its ridiculously long port time -- feels like a rush job.\\" GameSpot later rated it with a \\"fair\\" rating of 6.0, calling it \\"[a] lazy porting job [which] hinders Bullys classic classroom hijinks\\". The Xbox 360 version of Bully: Scholarship Edition was found to be unstable on some players' consoles, resulting in glitches, crashes and performance issues. On 20 March, a patch was released, but there were reports claiming that the problems continued or worsened. When the Windows 10 version was released in July 2015, many users reported constant crashes and errors; many of these problems were addressed by an unofficial patch released by a fan. = Awards = * Won GameSpot's award for Best Original Music. * Finalist for GameSpot's Game of the Year 2006. * Gaming Target ‚Äì 52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2006 selection. *In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. *Bully: Scholarship Edition was nominated for the Best Voice Acting award for an Xbox 360 game at IGN's Best of 2008 awards. *The PlayStation 2 version of Bully received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.  Controversy  Bullys title and gameplay features inspired controversy among parents and educators who noted the adult content in previous Rockstar games, including the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Hot Coffee minigame controversy. Groups such as Bullying Online and Peaceaholics criticized the game for glorifying or trivializing school bullying, although they raised their objections before the game was released to the public. The player may also choose to kiss select girls and boys in the game, which the ESRB was aware of when rating the product. Classification boards generally restricted Bully to a teenage audience: the United-States based Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) classified the game with a T rating, the British Board of Film Classification gave it a 15 rating, the Australian Classification Board rated it M, and the New Zealand OFLC restricted it to persons 13 years of age and over. In 2007, Yahoo! Games listed it as one of the top ten most controversial games of all time. = Censorship = Bully was banned in Brazil. In April 2008, a Brazilian judge prohibited the commerce and import of the game. The decision was based on findings by the state psychology society which stated that the game would be potentially harmful to teenagers and adults. In July 2016, however, the game was officially rereleased in Brazil. Whilst British Labour MP Keith Vaz argued that Bully be banned or reclassified as rated 18 in the UK before its publication, the game was released rated 15. Currys and PC World, both owned by DSG International, said that they did not wish to sell the game in the UK because it is \\"not appropriate for Currys' family-friendly image\\". The statement lists what Currys believes is \\"the explicit link between violence and children\\" as the reason behind the ban. Despite this decision, other high street retailers including Game, HMV and Virgin Megastores announced intentions to stock the game. Prior to both the ESRB's rating and the release of Bully, Jack Thompson filed a lawsuit attempting to have the game banned from store shelves in Florida. Thompson declared the game a \\"nuisance\\" and \\"Columbine simulator\\". Thompson's petition, filed with the 11th Judicial Circuit Court, asked for Wal-Mart and Take-Two Interactive to furnish him with an advance copy of Bully so he could have \\"an independent third party\\" play the game and determine if it would constitute a public nuisance in the state of Florida, in which case it could be banned. Take-Two Interactive offered to bring in a copy and let both the judge and Thompson view the game in the judge's chambers on 12 October 2006.Slagle, Matt. \\"Judge to Weigh in on 'Bully' Video Game \\". Associated Press, 12 October 2006. On 13 October 2006, Judge Ronald Friedman subsequently ruled in favor of shipping the game, noting that there was no content in the game that was not already on late night television. Thompson responded to the ruling with a fiery speech directed at the judge. When given a preview build, the mainstream American media took a generally positive view of the game. Press coverage described the game as free-form, focusing on building a social network and learning new skills from classes, with strictly enforced punishments for serious misbehaviour.  Possible sequel  In November 2006, Michael Pachter, Managing Director of Research for Wedbush Morgan Securities, predicted that Bully would not sell well enough over the upcoming holidays to warrant a sequel. However, when his prediction turned out to be untrue, Pachter apologized to Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, calling the sequel a \\"possibility\\". In November 2009, The Gaming Liberty interviewed musician Shawn Lee, who scored Bully, and was asked if he was scoring any more games in the near future; he responded, \\"Yes. It looks like I will be doing the soundtrack for Bully 2 in the not so distant future\\". In November 2011, in an interview with Gamasutra, Rockstar executive Dan Houser revealed that the studio might focus on a sequel for Bully after the release of Max Payne 3. \\"Contrary to a lot of people, we like to take a little bit of time at the end of a game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see what we should do in the next game,\\" he said. \\"So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with [Rockstar Vancouver] - even though it is a property that, like [Max Payne], we adore and might come back to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do [Max Payne], and then we will see what we can do with Bully.\\" In July 2012, Rockstar Vancouver was merged into Rockstar Toronto, and the staff was offered to join a different Rockstar studio. In September 2013, Dan Houser said he has many different ideas for a Bully sequel. To date, this is the last official comment on a Bully sequel. On 28 August 2017, concept art rumoured to be from the development of a sequel leaked online; it purported to show new characters and a run-down suburban home along with a few other bits of art; Rockstar Games did not comment. On 10 October 2018, alleged casting calls for a Bully sequel were revealed. These castings are to be auditioned at Spotlight in London, England, and shooting would commence on October 26, 2018 at Pinewood Studios, also located in London, and would be using motion capture technology. Jessica Jefferies, casting director on this unknown title, confirmed via Twitter that the title she was referring to was not a sequel to Bully.https://twitter.com/jessicajcasting/status/1054307949764579328 =Cancelled sequel= In July 2019, YouTuber SWEGTA posted a video discussing a leaked conversation with an individual (whose name was initially shown) who allegedly worked at Rockstar New England before being laid off. SWEGTA found the individual's name credited in Bully: Scholarship Edition, which confirmed his authenticity as a former Rockstar Games employee. According to the ex- employee, Rockstar had worked on a sequel for several months before shutting it down in 2009. He claimed to have worked on various game mechanics in the scrapped project and stated that the story would have featured Jimmy living with his mother and step-siblings in his stepfather's mansion during summer vacation. In October 2019, Video Games Chronicle published a story based on inside sources corroborating that Rockstar had indeed worked on Bully 2 for eighteen months before cancelling it. Production of the game however began in May 2010, shortly after Red Dead Redemption was released, and eventually was discontinued sometime before the end of 2013 as the project did not get much traction in the studio. During this time, a reported small slice of a working game was built using the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE). According to these sources, the studio had worked out some of the story but were not sure what period of time it would cover. One source confirmed the ex-employee's claims reported by SWEGTA that the story began with Jimmy spending summer vacation with his mother and stepfamily. Rockstar Games refused to comment on this topic.

He is best known for his role in the Swartwout-Hoyt scandal, in which he was alleged to have embezzled $1,222,705.09 during his tenure as Collector of the Port of New York. Early life Swartwout was born in Poughkeepsie, Dutchess County, New York on November 17, 1783. He was one of seven children born to Abraham Swartwout (1743‚Äì1799) and Maria (n√©e North) Swartwout. Along with his brothers John and Brigadier General Robert Swartwout, Samuel was a close ally of Aaron Burr in his early career in New York State politics. Samuel Swartwout remained close to Burr throughout the latter's life, and was his traveling companion on several long trips. Career Swartwout was an active participant in Burr's venture in the West and in the conspiracy trial that resulted from it. In October 1806, he met with Gen. James Wilkinson at the Sabine front, where he delivered the cipher correspondence which was later altered by Wilkinson and presented as evidence in the conspiracy trial. After Wilkinson took command of New Orleans in November, Swartwout was one of four Burr allies he arrested for misprision of treason and sent to Washington, D.C. for trial. In February, after a hearing, Swartwout and the others were released. He then continued to Richmond to attend Burr's trial, where he was a key witness in the indictment hearing. While in Richmond, Swartwout challenged Wilkinson to a duel, but the challenge was declined.Isenberg, Nancy. Fallen Founder: The Life of Aaron Burr (2007) During the War of 1812, Swartwout served as the captain of a corps of light infantry known as the Iron Grays. =Collector of Customs= Swartwout's close association with Andrew Jackson and his support of Jackson in the presidential election of 1828, led to his appointment by Jackson on April 25, 1829, to the position of Collector of Customs for the Port of New York. This position had great importance, as the collection of customs in New York was one of the largest sources of income for the Federal government of the United States. Swartwout's appointment by Jackson was strongly opposed by Jackson's Secretary of State Martin Van Buren. The recess appointment was upheld by the United States Senate on March 29, 1830, giving Swartwout a full term of four years. Before the expiration of his term, Swartwout was re-appointed by President Jackson for another term of four years, ending on March 29, 1838. As Collector, he openly aided the Texans in their struggle for independence from Mexico. He held meetings in New York where Stephen F. Austin, Branch Tanner Archer, and William H. Wharton appeared in quest of funds and supplies. He also sent provisions to Texas at his own expense and saved the two-ship Texas Navy from a consignment sale by paying for repairs to the vessels. = Embezzlement claims = Swartwout left office at the expiration of his term in 1838, retaining $201,096.40 with which to pay any pending claims that might be brought against him. He then went to England to raise money on his coal property before ensuring that his account at the customhouse was closed. After he left the country, or perhaps before, his account was \\"adjusted\\" by a subordinate and possibly by his successor, through the instigation of President Martin Van Buren. It was then alleged that Swartwout had embezzled $1,225,705.69 and fled. One of his assistants was indicted in 1841 for embezzling $609,525.71 of this sum, and, according to Swartwout's trustee, a federal court further reduced the amount by $435,052.21, leaving $181,127.77 as the amount Swartwout owed. He forfeited his personal property to pay the deficit, and returned to the United States in 1841 after federal officials assured him that they would not prosecute him. Personal life In December 1814, he married Alice Ann Cooper (1789‚Äì1874), and they had two children. Swartwout died in New York City on November 21, 1856. He was buried at Trinity Church Cemetery in Manhattan. =Legacy= Swartwout, Texas, now a ghosttown, was named after him for his role as supporter of early Texas colonists. It is believed that Samuel Swartwout's story is the origin of the term \\"Swartwouted out\\", which has since come to define the embezzlement of a large sum of money from the United States government and subsequent escape to a foreign nation to escape punishment.

Thirty episodes were produced, and the show was exported to the American ABC network. Overview The show starred an American actor, Steve Forrest, as John Mannering, an antiques dealer and sometime undercover agent working in an informal capacity for the head of the fictional British Diplomatic Intelligence, Templeton-Green (Colin Gordon). He is assisted by Cordelia Winfield (Sue Lloyd) and David Marlowe (Paul Ferris). In Creasey's original novels, Mannering is British and, after the few first entries, married. In transforming him into a bachelor and casting a Texan in the role, the producers decided that 'The Baron' would be nicknamed after the cattle ranch once run by his grandfather, described as being \\"200,000 acres [809.371 km2] 300 miles from Dallas\\".p.159 Chapman, James Saints and Avengers: British Adventure Series of the 1950s 2002 I.B Tauris Publishers In the books he is a reformed jewel thief (the first few novels describing Mannering's \\"career\\" from his deciding to steal to his going straight) whose criminal ties served him well in investigating jewel, art, or antiques-oriented mysteries. For the TV series, Mannering's persona is depicted as absolutely straight with no suggestion of past criminality, a fact underlined by his being co-opted by British intelligence. In the episode \\"Red Horse, Red Rider\\", it is revealed that Mannering had been a US Army Captain during the Second World War, serving in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program where he recovered art works from the Nazis. Following the war, he owned three antique stores and was a \\"charter member of the jet set\\". Cast and characters *Steve Forrest as John Mannering (alias \\"The Baron\\") *Sue Lloyd as Cordelia Winfield *Colin Gordon as John Alexander Templeton-Green *Paul Ferris as David Marlowe Although not regular cast members, Reginald Marsh and Derek Newark also appeared in three episodes (once reprising earlier roles, and once playing different characters). Occasionally actors were used twice but in different roles in the same run of episodes, including Paul Maxwell, Peter Bowles, George Murcell and Edwin Richfield. Production Like other ITC shows, The Baron shared a lot of its production crew with the other productions of the time (Danger Man, The Saint etc.), including guest cast members Peter Wyngarde and Bernard Lee, and directors Roy Ward Baker and Robert Asher. The lion's share of the scripts were by Dennis Spooner and Dalek creator Terry Nation. A few episodes were credited to Tony O'Grady, a pseudonym of The Avengers writer-producer Brian Clemens. The character of Mannering was, like Simon Templar in The Saint, a member of the jet set, whose glamorous lifestyle was typified by air travel to exotic locations, which at the time was still only easily available to the wealthy. However, filming never left the UK; it was filmed chiefly in and around Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire then owned by Associated British Pictures. Locations used included Haberdashers' Aske's School in Elstree, St Albans and Ivinghoe Beacon. These featured prominently in several other ITC series of the same era. The backlot at Elstree in particular was extensively used, being transformed alternately into Mannering's antiques shop, a Mexican town, a Parisian nightclub, an East European police station and many others besides. Paul Ferris was originally cast as Mannering's assistant David Marlowe. However, after pressure from the US network ABC, Marlowe was dropped in favour of the more glamorous Cordelia who had appeared in the first episode. She is 'reintroduced' in \\"Something for a Rainy Day\\", the ninth episode to be made, although broadcast third. As originally broadcast, the 'Cordelia' and 'Marlowe' episodes are interspersed, even though Paul Ferris left the production after eight episodes were filmed. As with other ITC series, the American market was vital; several episodes were overdubbed (e.g. \\"petrol\\" becoming \\"gas\\", \\"whisky\\" becoming \\"Scotch\\") to ensure they were fit for US audiences. Roy Ward Baker stated that owing to US sponsorship by a cigarette company, characters \\"were allowed to light up only in moments of leisure, never when they were frightened or under duress\\".Baker, Roy Ward (2000) Director's Cut: A Memoir of 60 Years in Film. Reynolds & Hearn. p.123 The show did not do well enough on ABC and was syndicated midway through its run, which effectively ensured that no second series would be made. The Baron's car was a silver Jensen CV-8 Mk II with the registration BAR 1. Unlike the Volvo driven by Simon Templar, the exclusivity of the car meant the series did not generate the same sales boost as The Saint had done for Volvo. Cordelia drove a considerably less upmarket DAF Daffodil 33. The episode \\"Something For A Rainy Day\\" featured shots of a white Jaguar plummeting over a cliff. This footage, apparently filmed for this episode (from several angles), reappeared in several other episodes and series, in an attempt to render its high cost worthwhile. The episode \\"Portrait of Louisa\\" was a reworking by Terry Nation of his earlier script \\"Lida\\", written for (and produced as) an episode of The Saint. Two films were put together for European cinema distribution by ITC; these were compiled from the two-part episodes. Mystery Island is a re-edit of the episodes \\"Storm Warning\\" and \\"The Island\\", while The Man in a Looking Glass is a combination of \\"Masquerade\\" and \\"The Killing\\". This led to further European releases in the 1960s of ITC films re- edited from episodes of The Saint, Danger Man, The Champions and Man in a Suitcase. The Baron was the first ITC show without marionettes to be produced entirely in colour. (ITC marionette series Stingray and Thunderbirds had been filmed in colour; the last fourteen of the thirty episodes of The Adventures of Sir Lancelot in 1956-57 had been shot in colour, as had the 1962 pilot episode of Man of the World.) Episodes Episodes were filmed between July 1965 and October 1966, on location and at Elstree Studios. AirdateDates from ITC Episode guide issued with the Network DVD is for ATV Midlands.

Biography =Early days= Galerkin was born on in Polotsk, Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire, now part of Belarus, to Jewish by way of the Jewish Encyclopedia of Russiahttp://www.jinfo.org/Mathematics.html and http://www.jinfo.org/Mathematics_Comp.html (at The Jewish Contribution to World Civilization) parents, Girsh-Shleym (Hirsh-Shleym) Galerkin and Perla Basia Galerkina. His parents owned a house in the town, but the homecraft they made did not bring enough money, so at the age of 12, Boris started working as calligrapher in the court. He had finished school in Polotsk, but still needed the exams from an additional year which granted him the right to continue education at a higher level. He passed those in Minsk in 1893, as an external student. The same year he was enrolled at the St. Petersburg Technological Institute, at the mechanics department. Due to the lack of funds Boris Grigoryevich had to combine studying at the institute with working as a draftsman and giving private lessons. In some point of his life, he married Revekka Treivas, a second niece. They did not have any children. =Political activities and imprisonment= Like many other students and technologists, he was involved in political activities, and joined the social-democratic group. In 1899, the year of graduating from the institute, he became a member of the Russian Social-Democratic Party (which would become the Communist Party of the Soviet Union). This provides a plausible explanation for his frequent job changes. The first three years after graduation Boris Grigoryevich was an engineer at the Russian Mechanical and Steam-locomotive Union factory in Kharkov, while simultaneously teaching workers at special courses. From the end of 1903 he was an engineer on the construction of the China Far East Railway, half a year later he became the technical head at the 'North mechanical and boiler factory' . He participated in organizing the Union of Engineers in St. Petersburg and, in 1905 he was arrested for organizing a strike among the engineers. In 1906, Boris Grigoryevich became a member of the Social-Democratic Party's St. Petersburg Committee and did not work anywhere else. In prison, known as \\"Kresty\\", Boris Grigoryevich lost interest to revolutionary activities and devoted himself to science and engineering, activities which prisoners of that time could pursue. And what is more, in his work-book it is written that Boris Grigoryevich worked as an engineer at designing and constructing the boiler power plant from 1907. This fact was not explained, and Boris Grigoryevich did not like to remind others about his revolutionary youth. Later, in Soviet questionnaires he would not give clear answers on the persistent questions about membership in different parties. Of course, he was familiar with the fate of old Party members, but the main reason for it was that he had been elected to the Committee from the Mensheviks (a Party group with non-radical views, whose members were later accused of contra-revolutionary activities and repressed). Galerkin's life could become the price if this fact became known to the public. =Academic= Same year his first scientific work was published by the institutes \\"Transactions\\". The article was titled \\"A theory of longitudinal curving and an experience of longitudinal curving theory application to many-storied frames, frames with rigid junctions and frame systems\\". The length of the title was indicative of the length of the work itself, 130 pages. It was written in the \\"Kresty\\" prison. In the summer of 1909 Boris Grigoryevich had a trip abroad to see constructions and buildings which interested him. During the next four years, i.e., before World War I, he and many other institute staff visited Europe to stimulate their scientific interests. Galerkin visited Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Sweden. Galerkin taught students at the mechanical department structural mechanics, i.e., conducted exercises and designing. The lecturer was professor V.L.Kirpichov - a famous scientist in the field of mechanics and per se the head of the Petersburg mechanical scientific school. However, most members also worked in the Polytechnical Institute, for example: Ivan Bubnov, A.N. Krylov, I.V. Meshcherskiy and S.P. Timoshenko. From autumn 1911, Galerkin also worked at the Women's Polytechnical Institute. In 1913 he worked with the design of the metallic frame for a boiler power plant in St. Petersburg - the first building with metallic frame under big loads in Russia. Later it was considered to be one of the unique European engineering objects. Galerkin regularly published his works in the institutes \\"Transactions\\", and since 1915 - also in Engineering News. Before 1915 pivot systems were at the center of his scientific interest, later he started researching plates. In 1915 Galerkin published an article in which he put forward an idea of an approximate method for differential equations, in particular boundary value problems. He had applied his method to a big number of pivot and plate analysis problems. Some time before I.G.Bubnov developed a similar approach for the variational problem solution, which he interpreted as a variant of Ritz method algorithm. The distinguishing features of Galerkin's method were the following: he did not associate the method, developed by him, with any variational problem direct solution, but considered it to be common for solving differential equations. He interpreted it, using the probable displacements principle. These ideas showed to be very productive, not only in structural mechanics, but for mathematical physics at large. The Galerkin method (or Bubnov-Galerkin method) with Galerkin's (or \\"weak\\") differential equations problem statement form are known all over the world. Nowadays they provide a foundation for algorithms in the fields of mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, hydrodynamics and many others. In January 1919, Galerkin became a professor in the 2nd (formerly Women's) Polytechnical Institute, remaining a teacher of structural mechanics in the 1st Polytechnical Institute (at that time the Polytechnical Institute was named so) mechanical department. In March 1920, a professor chair in structural mechanics was established at the department, and Boris Grigoryevich won it in a competition. In Summer 1921, S.P. Belzetskiy, a famous scientist in the field of structural mechanics and theory of elasticity, who was holding a similar chair at the civil engineering faculty, emigrated to Poland. Galerkin took part in a competition for his chair and in the beginning of 1922 he left the mechanical faculty for the civil engineering faculty, which was nearer to him in his scientific and engineering activities. However his talent at that time was not wanted by anyone and he could concentrate his attention towards scientific problems. Before, in 1917-1919 Galerkin published a series of works on rectangular and triangular plates curving in scientific periodicals, mentioned above, and in the \\"Russian Academy of Sciences Transactions\\". Later he had a break in publications, and only in 1922 he began publishing again, but only in foreign magazines (in the Soviet Union there was not enough paper for scientific literature). In December 1923 Galerkin was elected dean of the Polytechnical Institutes civil engineering faculty. It happened during a very important period of the institute's history, when a group of deans resigned from their posts, protesting from unceremonious intervention of so-called \\"student' representatives\\", controlled by the trade- unions and the Communist party committees, into the educational process. Galerkin showed to be a talented leader of the faculty. He managed to neutralize too active \\"assistants\\", who were appointed against his will, and he did not hurry to fulfill the orders of incompetent leaders, who were conducting infinite experiments in the higher school at that time. In 1924 - 1929 Galerkin was also a professor in the Railway Engineers Institute and in the St. Petersburg University. In 1924 he made his last trip abroad ‚Äì he participated in the Congress on applied mechanics in the Netherlands. In spring 1926 Galerkin learned that Narkompros (Ministry of education) had adopted a decision to close the road-making section at his faculty. This decision was prepared and adopted secretly from the dean by the institute Communist party committee in the connection with the company on elimination of parallel specialities. Meanwhile, there were no other faculties in the country, training specialists in the construction of electrified railways, urban railways and subways (the faculty had worked on this since 1907). Galerkin managed to cancel this rash decision by Moscow. During the period of Galerkin at the dean post, the first laboratory at the faculty was created. He also managed to receive governmental approval of the idea to build some other big laboratories for the faculty (the Hydrotechnical Research Institute was later established on their base). In January 1928 Galerkin was appointed as a corresponding member-elected at the USSR Academy of sciences. His candidature was nominated by academicians A.F. Yoffe (Abram Ioffe), A.N. Krylov, P.P. Lazarev. In October 1929 he left the dean's post. After this the civil engineering faculty was divided into two parts: the hydrotechnical and irrigation sections became the water industry faculty, and the rest that became a part of the civil engineering faculty. was soon left out of the Polytechnical Institute and became the Civil and Industrial Engineering Institute, which however does not exist anymore. The water industry faculty soon became the Hydrotechnical institute. Galerkin was a professor at both institutes. By the 1920s, Galerkin was already a world-famous scientist. He had had become an authority among engineers-designers. He was often recruited as a consultant to the designing and construction of serious industrial objects in the north-west Russia (heat power plants, Volkhov hydro power plant, Kondopoga pulp and paper mill and others). He was a member of the technical Councils of the designing institutes Gipromez and Giprotsvetmet, a member of the academic councils in the research institutes: Irrigation Institute (later ‚Äì Hydrotechnical Research Institute), Institute of Structures. After the end of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station construction Boris Grigoryevich also became a member of the governmental commission. In 1934, Galerkin got two doctoral degrees in technics and mathematics and the Honoured Worker in Science and Engineering title. In the beginning of 1936 he was elected a member of the USSR Academy of sciences. He also became a member of the highest Certifying Commission in the State Committee on higher technical education, a chairman of the technical mechanics group in the USSR Academy of sciences technical section, the headmaster of the USSR Academy of sciences Institute of Mechanics, the chairman of the Civil engineers scientific society and its Leningrad section. In April 1936 according to a governmental order Galerkin was appointed chairman of the Governmental Commission for the examination of the Moscow Palace of Soviets steel frame walls and overlappings initial project. Though having so many titles, Galerkin remained a professor of the structural mechanics and theory of elasticity department at the hydrotechnical faculty (the Hydrotechnical Institute was returned to the Polytechnical (at that time ‚Äì Industrial) Institute as a faculty in 1934). Mostly he taught the course of the theory of elasticity, which was very difficult for the students of that time, who had a very weak training in mathematics. Students were visiting his lectures to look at the \\"real academician\\", but he disappointed them. He was short, puny, had a weak voice. His image did not correspond to the status of serious scientist with big authority, received from the government. At one time the academician was even pulled out of a tram by other well-grown passengers, and after this \\"accident\\" the institute administration applied to the authorities for a car. =War times and death= Galerkin drew in generals uniform in 1939, when the VITU of Navy (previously known as the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy, now Military engineering-technical university, Russian: –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–Ω–æ- —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç), was revival on the base of Civil and Industrial Engineering Institute, as the head of its structural mechanics department and the academician became a lieutenant general. Boris Grigoryevich had never been in the army before, but had to wear the generals uniform. He was shy and when someone saluted to him he became frightened and waved his hands. In the summer of 1941 after the beginning of the war the Commission on the defensive installations construction was created by the city government. Some academicians and prominent scientists became members (almost everyone was from the Polytechnical Institute), but only Boris Grigoryevich was involved with construction engineering. Practically he became the supervisor of the work for the Commission. Simultaneously Boris Grigoryevich was the city engineering defence department experts group head. Later he was evacuated to Moscow, where he joined the military engineering commission of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Hard non-stop work was undermining the scientist's health. Not long after the Great Victory, on July 12, 1945 Galerkin died in Moscow.

(Literally translated, a Sch√ºrzenj√§ger is a \\"apron hunter\\": Sch√ºrze = apron, J√§ger = hunter) The band was founded in 1973; according to the band history, they were named \\"Sch√ºrzenj√§ger\\" by a female bartender in Austria during a concert, when they didn't have a band name. While they started out playing traditional music with modern instruments, their style developed over the years to incorporate folk music, Pop music, and Rock music. One of their first big hits was the \\"Zillertaler Hochzeitsmarsch\\", a modern interpretation of a traditional folk dance melody. From then on they began to introduce more rock elements, inspired by their new (1990) drummer Patrick Cox. After Zillertal Hochzeitsblues (1990) they moved to the wider German audience under Montana (Later BMG Ariola) in 1991. With their commercial success, \\"Sch√ºrzenj√§ger\\" became the epitome for filling the gap between rock and \\"Volksmusik\\" in Austria, establishing the genre of \\"Alpen Rock\\" (Alpine Rock). The folk music community, however, saw the success of the Zillertaler Hochzeitsmarsch not as a success but as an abuse of traditional music. Sch√ºrzenj√§ger regularly ended their tours with the biggest open-air concerts in Austria. Since 1988 these concerts, called \\"Alpen Air\\" (a pun of \\"Alpen\\" and \\"Open Air\\"), were played every other year. From March to July 2007, the Sch√ºrzenj√§ger went on tour for the last album \\"Lust auf mehr\\". This was the final tour with the lineup around band leader Steinlechner, culminating in the traditional \\"Alpen Air\\" in Finkenberg, Zillertal on Saturday 21 July 2007. The Eberharters then founded their own band, the \\"Hey Mann! Band\\" (HM!B), which performed Sch√ºrzenj√§ger songs live, an album was also recorded. On 3 May 2011 the comeback and a new album of the Sch√ºrzenj√§ger was announced for September 2011, before that an open-air concert will stage on 6 August in Finkenberg. The band consists of the Hey Mann! Band members Stevy (Stefan Wilhelm, vocals), Johannes Hintersteiner, Andreas Marberger, Georg Daviotis and the Eberharters, the last being the only members of the old Sch√ºrzenj√§ger lineup. According to the band, former band leader Steinlechner doesn't want to get back on stage, save for a few guest appearances now and then. Cox and von Haniel are already busy with other projects.

This program was rather large (even by today's standards), as it was supposed to be released on several CD-ROMs. Lotus Marketplace was to be released in two editions, Lotus Marketplace: Business (containing information about businesses) and Lotus Marketplace: Households (containing information about peoples and households). The Business edition of this program contained information about 7 million businesses in the United States, just like Yellow Pages, but could quickly and flexibly be searched. Unlike the Households edition, this edition was not so controversial and was released in October 1990, but was cancelled along with the Households edition; concerns about profitability were cited. The Households edition of this program became infamous and the object of considerable opprobrium because it was supposed to contain private information about 120 million people and 80 million households in the United States. Information such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, demographic information, and prior purchasing behavior were contained in the program and could be searched quickly and flexibly. This program was strongly protested by many, who cited customer privacy issues (because using this program telemarketers could get hundreds of names and addresses, and mass mail those addresses without addressees' discretion). The backlash online was particularly intense, with a new Usenet newsgroup formed to discuss it. Information was circulated online about how to contact Lotus and request the removal of one's information from the database; more than 30,000 people would eventually so contact Lotus.

Unlike the other localities of the Cinque Terre, Corniglia is not directly adjacent to the sea. Instead, it is on the top of a promontory about 100 metres high, surrounded on three sides by vineyards and terraces, the fourth side descends steeply to the sea. To reach Corniglia, it is necessary to climb the Lardarina, a long brick flight of steps composed of 33 flights with 382 steps or, otherwise follow a vehicular road that, from the station, leads to the village. Sometimes a small bus runs. The village stretches along the main road, Fieschi Road, and the houses have one side facing this road and the other facing the sea. Corniglia is characterised by narrow roads and a terrace in the rock from which all other four Cinque Terre's villages, two on one side and two on the other, can be seen. The town planning structure presents original characteristics compared to those of the other villages: the houses are lower set, and only more recently higher, similar to those of the villages of the hinterland. Corniglia is mentioned in a famous novella of Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron and in the novel The Invisible Circus by Jennifer Egan. History The origin of the village dates back to the Roman Age as testified by the name, which finds its roots in Gens Cornelia, the Roman family to whom the land belonged. In the Middle Ages it was a possession of the counts of Lavagna, the lords of Carpena and of Luni. In 1254 Pope Innocent IV gave it to Nicol√≤ Fieschi, who held it until 1276, when the village was acquired by the Republic of Genoa. Main sights Documents dating from 1276-77 mention the existence of a castle. However, remains of the castle have yet to be discovered and the location of the castle grounds is unknown. The only ruins in Corniglia belong to Genoese fortifications, a stronghold on a cliff plunging into the sea, which dates back to approximately 1556.

Music video The promo was shot by production company Squeak Pictures in Los Angeles in October 1999 and directed by Honey, i.e., the husband-and-wife directorial team of Laura Kelly and Nicholas Brooks. The video which, among others, touches upon the exploitation of garment workers, parodies the popular late '90s Gap commercials directed by Pedro Romhanyi. These ads featured attractive young people singing songs while against a white backdrop, wearing Gap clothing. The phrase \\"everybody in denial\\" was a play on \\"everybody in khaki\\" which was a Gap TV ad campaign at the time. The video begins with bland, generic, elevator music being played. There are shots of sweatshop workers (UNITE! union members playing themselves) at their tables, against a white backdrop. Shortly, the phrase \\"everybody in denial\\" is flashed on screen.

It stars Keith Carradine, Powers Boothe, Fred Ward, T. K. Carter, Franklyn Seales, and Peter Coyote. The film, set in 1973, features a Louisiana Army National Guard squad of nine on weekend maneuvers in rural bayou country as they antagonize some local Cajun people and become hunted. Plot In 1973 a squad of nine Louisiana Army National Guard soldiers convene in a local bayou for weekend maneuvers. New to the squad is Corporal Hardin (Powers Boothe), a cynical transfer from the Texas Army National Guard. He soon becomes disgusted with the arrogant behavior and attitudes of the men. A happily-married chemical engineer in his civilian life, Hardin wants no part of a date with prostitutes which PFC Spencer (Keith Carradine) has arranged for himself and their squad-mates. Nevertheless, he hits it off with the amiable Spencer, and both find themselves to be the most level-headed soldiers in their squad. The nine soldiers set out on patrol and soon get lost in the swamp. They come across a seemingly-abandoned campsite with several pirogues. To continue onward, the Guardsmen need the pirogues. The squad's leader, Staff Sergeant Poole (Peter Coyote), orders the soldiers into three of the pirogues. As they set out across the bayou, a group of Cajun hunter-trappers return and yell at the soldiers for having taken their pirogues. In response, PFC Stuckey (Lewis Smith) fires blanks from his M-60 machine gun at the Cajuns. They return fire with live ammunition, killing Poole and sending the squad into a frenzy as they make their way toward cover. Sgt. Casper (Les Lannom) ‚Äì the strict, inexperienced, and unpopular second-in-command ‚Äì orders the squad to continue their \\"mission.\\" They discover that Cpl. Reece (Fred Ward) has brought along a box of live ammunition for hunting purposes. Reece is forced at knife-point by Hardin to give up the live ammo, and Casper divides it evenly among the soldiers, in order to bolster their chances of defense. They reach the shack of a one-armed Cajun trapper-hunter (Brion James), who speaks only French. Casper has him arrested as a prisoner of war. The emotionally-unstable Cpl. Bowden (Alan Autry) uses gasoline to ignite some TNT inside the shack, blowing it up, along with numerous provisions of food, fresh water, guns, and ammunition. The soldiers feel increasingly threatened. Hearing the barking of dogs, the Guardsmen presume they're about to be rescued. The dogs, however, belong to the Cajuns, who are now stalking the soldiers because of Stuckey's actions. The Guardsmen fend off the attacking dogs, only to find that lethal boobytraps have been set for them. Pvt. Cribbs (T.K. Carter) is killed when he trips a spear-bed built into a spring-released cradle-frame, impaling him. The squad camps for the night. Overnight, Bowden begins to have a serious mental breakdown, refusing to speak to anyone or move. The group decides to tie him up for the night. The following morning, Reece tortures the one-armed Cajun by dunking his head in a fetid pond. Hardin discovers this and tries to stop it. Both soldiers get in a fight to the death with bayonets. As the men fight, Hardin gains the upper hand, and to his surprise, the one-armed Cajun screams for Hardin to kill Reece. After Reece is killed, the one-armed Cajun escapes into the swamp. Stuckey, who was close friends with Reece, threatens to kill Hardin. As a helicopter passes overhead, the soldiers frantically try to signal it. Rushing headlong into the swamp after the chopper as it moves onward, Stuckey sinks to his death in quicksand. Having no confidence in Casper after his inept leadership, Spencer relieves him of command. They split up to search for Stuckey. Instead, Casper and Simms locate the murderous Cajuns. Casper throws a homemade grenade at the Cajuns to no avail, then fixes his bayonet to his rifle and charges at them. Both he and Simms are shot dead. Spencer, Hardin, and the now-catatonic Bowden camp for the night. The following morning Hardin and Spencer are jolted awake by a freight train, and then realize that Bowden is missing. They move to the train tracks and find Bowden hanging dead from a bridge. The one-armed Cajun appears on the tracks overhead. In perfect English, he warns Spencer and Hardin to leave the Cajuns' territory while they still can. He gives them directions on how to escape the bayou, since Hardin and Spencer saved him from physical assault by Simms and Reece. Following the one-armed Cajun's advice, Spencer and Hardin follow a dirt road and end up hitching a ride with a friendly Cajun couple. They are driven to a pig roast at a nearby Cajun village. As Spencer happily mixes with the villagers, a wary Hardin sees the arrival of the three hunter-trappers who massacred their squad. One of Hardin's would-be-killers chases him into a shed and wounds him in the arm. Spencer suddenly shows up, firing blanks at the Cajun as a distraction, giving Hardin the chance to stab him in the groin. The other two Cajuns arrive, and Spencer runs, leading them away from the injured Hardin. Spencer, hiding around a corner, hits one of the Cajuns in the face with the butt of his M-16, knocking him out. The remaining Cajun gives chase, but as he is about to shoot Spencer, Hardin grabs him from behind. This gives Spencer the opportunity to stab him to death with his bayonet. Leaving behind the village, Spencer and Hardin slip away unseen into the swamp. As the duo moves into the swamp, another helicopter arrives overhead and seems to stay in the vicinity. They get back to the dirt road just in time to see a U.S. Army truck drive towards them. They look at each other, knowing they are finally safe.

At one stage it was known as The Prey. According to Walter Hill he and David Giler had a deal with 20th Century Fox to \\"acquire and develop interesting, commercial scripts that could be produced cheaply. Alien (1979) was one of them, and Southern Comfort was another. We wanted to do a survival story, and I'd already done a film in Louisiana.\\" They hired a writer, Michael Kane, to do a draft which Giler and Hill then rewrote. According to Hill, \\"No studio wanted to make it, but an independent guy showed up who had a relationship with Fox. Liked it, said he would finance it.\\"\\"Interview with Walter Hill Chapter 7\\" Directors Guild of Australia, accessed 12 June 2014 The film was financed by the Cinema Group. This was a company headed by William J. Immerman, whose head of production was Venetia Stevenson, daughter of director Robert Stevenson. The Cinema Group had raised a fund of $30 million to make movies, half of which was private, the other half which was publicly raised. Southern Comfort was their second film. (Take This Job and Shove It was their first.) Powers Boothe was cast after Hill and Giler saw him play Jim Jones in the mini series Guyana Tragedy. Hill said the concept of Keith Carradine's character \\"was that he was one of nature's aristocrats ‚Äì graceful, confident of his own ability and able to separate himself from other people with an amusing remark\\", whereas the character played by Boothe \\"is much more the rational, hardworking, self made individual\\" and as a result \\"just cannot believe the nature of the situation at first\\" whereas Carradine's can. =Shooting= The movie was shot in Louisiana over 55 days in the Caddo Lake area outside Shreveport. Hill: > We were very aware that people were going to see it as a metaphor for > Vietnam. The day we had the cast read, before we went into the swamps, I > told everybody, 'People are going to say this is about Vietnam. They can say > whatever they want, but I don't want to hear another word about it.'\\" The film is supported by an atmospheric soundtrack by longstanding Hill collaborator Ry Cooder. The song \\"Parlez Nous √† Boire\\", sung during the scene in the Cajun village at the end of the film, was performed by Cajun musician Dewey Balfa. The film includes many actors, including Fred Ward and Peter Coyote, who had one of their first big roles here. Hill later said he enjoyed the experience of making the film but that it was tough: > I was very proud of the actors in it. It was a tough movie to make, and they > put up with a lot. They would probably tell you they put up with a lot from > me. [Laughs.] But they really did it without complaint. And I just thought I > was very fortunate to have the cast that I had. Jesus, it was a hard movie > to make... I think when you see the movie you can see that this one wasn't > nightclubs in Vegas. But it was just very hard locations to get in there. > Very hard to shoot. I remember so many times we'd only have a few minutes to > set the camera because the bottom of the swamp would give way. And so, for > your camera positions, you had to stage and shoot very quickly in many > cases. It just was hard, and the weather was miserable. However, I will say > this: If you choose to go make a movie in a swamp in the middle of winter, > you probably deserve what you get. [Laughs.] \\"It was unbelievably tough\\", said Powers Boothe. \\"The actors would clamber out of the muck just in time to get back into it. The situation was even harder on the crew. They'd set up a camera platform and it would slowly sink into the bayou. Or with a tripod, one leg would sink. And how can actors hit their marks in two feet of water?... I have to give Walter Hill credit for making the three months as endurable as possible. We didn't lose our senses of humor until late in the shooting. Taking two weeks off at Christmas time helped keep our sanity.\\" Walter Hill said the film was \\"not a simple action movie where the people chasing the other out there is bad\\": > It is clearly in a sense the kind of fault of our guys for getting into this > situation. In the collective group, there are individuals who are not as > highly evolved as the others. And the answers to the dilemma, I mean both > nature's noblemen, those of higher character through some innate quality. > And you have people that operate on a sliding scale downward to the brute > level in their response to the situation that they have gotten themselves > into. All of which I think is a kind of, war is terrible. It's a wartime > situation. With mixed results and accompanying paranoia even by those who > are the best and the brightest of the bunch... None of us are quite as good > or bad as we construct them. Southern Comfort is trying not to be an easy > drama. Soundtrack The music was done by Ry Cooder who had just worked with Hill on The Long Riders. Cooder later said: > Because my own musical fantasies and Walter Hill's film fantasies arc in > sync, it's possible for me to score a film like Southern Comfort without > understanding the first thing about its environment. All I had to do was > think about this weird swamp, and the Cajun people that nobody knew about. I > had to imagine what they were going to sound like, and I figured on the > style of John Lee Hooker's music. Reception Walter Hill later said he was \\"always amazed\\" by the reception to the film. \\"The American reception was a real kind of nothing. But it was very nicely received around the world.\\" He added that the movie \\"didn't make a fucking nickel anywhere. Foreign, domestic, anything... I was proud of the film... But I was disappointed in the lack of response. It was a universal audience failure... Usually you can say they loved it in Japan or something. I don't think anybody loved it anywhere.\\" On the Rotten Tomatoes website the film has received a positive reception from critics with an overall rating of 79% from 19 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1019482-southern_comfort/ Roger Ebert rated it 3 stars, stating that it is \\"a film of drum-tight professionalism\\" but criticizing it for making its characters \\"into larger- than-life stick figures, into symbolic units who stand for everything except themselves.\\"\\"Southern Comfort\\" By Roger Ebert RogerEbert.com Jan 1, 1981 accessed 26 July 2015 While he said that the stock nature of the characters reminded him greatly of the way Hill approached the gang members in The Warriors (to which he gave a 2 stars, thumbs down review) he also said that he would recommend Southern Comfort partly because he had overlooked good qualities of Hill's previous film over that issue, and that the atmosphere and pacing of Southern Comfort were so strong that he gave it a thumbs up. At the time critics regularly made reference to the film's plot similarities to John Boorman's 1972 thriller Deliverance. Change of story under Iranian censorship In the late 1980s Iranian state TV IRIB broadcast the film, under the name \\"Operation Lagoon\\" (Amaliyate Mordab). The film was shortened to 95 minutes, and the story was changed to show a group of US Army soldiers who opposed the Vietnam War are sent to a mission among man-hunters, equipped only with blanks. The soldiers are killed by man-hunters one after another as planned by US authorities. In the end, when the remaining two soldiers suppose a US Army truck is approaching to save them, the picture fades and a voice of constant shooting is heard, indicating the US authorities killed all the soldiers they intended to kill. The film was a huge hit among the Iranian audience. The Iranian film critics believed that the IRIB censored version had made more sense considering the American government atrocities overseas.

It replaces and expands upon earlier rulebooks entitled Masters of the Wild and Defenders of the Faith, as well as being a catchall for anything that does not fit into Complete Adventurer, Complete Arcane, Complete Warrior, or Complete Psionic. Contents It presents additional base classes, prestige classes, and feats. It also contains additional rules and character ideas based on belief and the afterlife, as well as a chapter on magic items based on the original D&D; pantheon gods/goddesses. =New base classes= Shugenja Updated from Oriental Adventures, the shugenja utilizes primal energies, and tapping into the earth to cast spells. It is a charisma based sorcerer-style divine casting class, with a spell list biased towards elemental spells. Favored Soul Updated from the Miniatures Handbook, the Favored Soul is a spontaneously casting divine class, with a couple of additional divine abilities closely tied to his or her deity. Spirit Shaman The class has a fairly narrow divine spell selection. The spirit shaman cast spells as sorcerers do, but they change their spell selection each day by sending their Spirit Guide into the spirit world. The shaman also has a special abilities that affect spirits (incorporeal undead, fey, elementals and creatures defined as spirits in other texts). The Spirit Guide is a purely mental/spiritual creature, incapable of affecting the world, though it does grant the spirit shaman the feat, \\"Alertness\\", as well as justifying certain class features. Ultimately, at 20th level, the spirit shaman becomes a spirit (fey) himself, much as a 20th level monk becomes an outsider. =New prestige classes= These include church inquisitor, consecrated harrier, contemplative, divine oracle, holy liberator, hospitaler, pious templar, sacred exorcist, sacred fist and warpriest (Defenders of the Faith), blighter and geomancer (Masters of the Wild), temple raider of Olidammara (Song and Silence), void disciple (Oriental Adventures), ur-priests (Book of Vile Darkness), stormlord (Faiths and Pantheons), radiant servant of Pelor and shining blade of Heironeous. In addition, there are several previously undescribed prestige classes. Black flame zealot A class that combines a hashisheen cult with the Arabic view of Zoroastrian fire worship, but one which isn't automatically evil. Entropomancer A class that worships oblivion and has the ability to summon fragments of a sphere of annihilation. Evangelist The only five-level class in the book, designed for converting enemies rather than killing them. Rainbow servant A class of divine or arcane spellcasters trained by couatls to have similar abilities to the creatures. Seeker of the misty isle A class open only to elves and closely tied to their in- game mythologies. Publication history Complete Divine was written by David Noonan, and was published in May 2004. Cover art was by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Kyle Anderson, Tom Baxa, Steven Belledin, Cris Dornaus, Wayne England, Jeremy Jarvis, Dennis Crabapple McClain, Raven Mimura, William O'Connor, Jim Pavelec, Wayne Reynolds, Scott Roller, Richard Sardinha, Ron Spencer, Arnie Swekel, and Franz Vohwinkel. David Noonan explains the designers' approach to preparing material for the book: \\"In each section, we first decided what we wanted to pick up from previous D&D; sources such as Defenders of the Faith and Faiths and Pantheons. That meant a lot of meetings and a lot of feedback from the fans. Then, especially for the spells, we looked for niches we hadn't filled yet. For example, there's a lot of design space left for high-level druid and cleric spells, so we tilted the balance of the spell list a little toward the upper levels.\\" Reception Reviews References External links *http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10912.phtml *http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10357.phtml Category:2004 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Complete Divine"},{"id":"2370672","text":"Peter Vaughan-Clarke is a British actor, born in Wandsworth, London on 11 June 1957.

The episode was directed by Andrew Overtoom for the animation, and was written by Walt Dohrn, Paul Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. Dohrn and Tibbitt also served as storyboard directors, and Carson Kugler, William Reiss, and Erik Wiese worked as storyboard artists. It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on September 21, 2001. In this episode, SpongeBob reads a \\"bad word\\" off a dumpster behind the Krusty Krab, but does not know what it means. Patrick explains to him that it is a \\"sentence enhancer\\" which is used \\"when you want to talk fancy.\\" The two start using it in every sentence they speak, but when Mr. Krabs hears them, he warns the two never to use the word again or any of the \\"13 bad words\\". Later on, SpongeBob accidentally swears again, and Patrick runs to tell Mr. Krabs about it while SpongeBob tries to stop him. However, Mr. Krabs injures his toe, prompting him to utter all 13 bad words. The two then run to Mama Krabs' house to tell on him. Mama Krabs, who is appalled by their use of the words, makes the three paint her house as punishment. The episode was well received from critics and fans, while various members of the SpongeBob SquarePants crew consider the episode to be one of their favorites, mainly due to the satirical nature of the episode. However, the episode was not immune to negative reception, and was criticized by watchdog media group the Parents Television Council and critics, who interpreted the episode as an example of promoting and implicitly satirizing use of profanity towards children. Plot When SpongeBob goes around to the back of the Krusty Krab to take out the trash, he reads some graffiti written on a dumpster, one of which contains a word he does not understand. SpongeBob asks Patrick what it is and Patrick says that the word is a \\"sentence enhancer\\" which is used \\"when you want to talk fancy.\\" The next day, SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab and says the word to Patrick and then over to the intercom. The Krusty Krab customers are appalled by SpongeBob's use of his \\"word\\" and leave. Squidward then informs Mr. Krabs, who tells them that they were using profanity and mentions that there are 13 swear words that they should never use (which prompts Squidward to ask if Mr. Krabs actually means there are only seven, to which Krabs says that for sailors there are 13). SpongeBob and Patrick vow to Mr. Krabs that they will never use swear words again. Later, they play their favorite game, Eels and Escalators. Patrick always gets escalators but SpongeBob always gets eels. Eventually, he loses the game and accidentally swears. Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him. When SpongeBob bursts through the front door and tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish explanations, and takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them paint the Krusty Krab as a punishment. Mr. Krabs is about to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, dropping the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. After briefly fainting, Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as a punishment. Production Walt Dohrn, shown here in 2010, wrote the episode with Paul Tibbitt & Merriwether Williams. The animation of \\"Sailor Mouth\\" was directed by Andrew Overtoom, and the episode was written by Walt Dohrn, Paul Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. Dohrn and Tibbitt served as the episode's storyboard directors, and Carson Kugler, William Reiss and Erik Wiese worked as storyboard artists. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg has described the episode plot as \\"a classic thing all kids go through.\\" Much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers' own experiences from childhood. The episode originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on September 21, 2001. The episode marks the introduction of Mr. Krabs' mother, Mama Krabs, who was voiced by former SpongeBob SquarePants creative producer and current executive producer Paul Tibbitt. The writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode. The idea for \\"Sailor Mouth\\" was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience \\"[when] I got in trouble for saying the f-word in front of my mother.\\" Drymon said, \\"The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life.\\" The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired \\"by the fact that my [Drymon's] mother has a sailor mouth herself.\\" Voice actor Tom Kenny reveals in the description of this episode in the iTunes collection, SpongeBob SquarePants: Tom Kenny's Top 20 that they actually improvised fake profanities that would be censored by the silly sound effects later. He adds jokingly, \\"I was laughing so hard [recording this episode], they recorded me while I lay on the floor of the sound booth.\\" The scene where SpongeBob and Patrick playing a game of Eels and Escalators, which is a parody of Snakes and Ladders, was difficult for the crew to animate, since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location. According to the series' season 2 DVD commentary, it was planned to have a scene that had SpongeBob saying \\"Go 'dolphin noise' yourself\\" followed by Patrick saying \\"'Dolphin noise' you too!\\" during the Eels and Escalators game. It was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience. The initial decision to use dolphin noises in place of a traditional bleep was also influenced by concerns over the episode's suitability for its audience. Stephen Hillenburg recalled in 2016, \\"I pitched the idea that SpongeBob and Patrick learn a swearword. Everyone said no. I couldn't even use a bleep. So I used a dolphin sound instead.\\" Storyboard artist, Erik Wiese admitted in the Season 2 Audio Commentary for \\"Sailor Mouth\\" that it was a challenge to storyboard Walt Dohrn's idea and vision of the Eels and Escalators scene. \\"Sailor Mouth\\" was released on the DVD compilation called SpongeBob SquarePants: Sea Stories on November 5, 2002.SpongeBob SquarePants: Sea Stories. DVD. Paramount Home Entertainment, 2002. It was also included in the SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete 2nd Season DVD released on October 19, 2004.SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete 2nd Season. DVD. Paramount Home Entertainment, 2004. On September 22, 2009, \\"Sailor Mouth\\" was released on the SpongeBob SquarePants: The First 100 Episodes DVD, alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five.SpongeBob SquarePants: The First 100 Episodes. DVD. Paramount Home Entertainment, 2009. Reception The episode received generally positive reviews from critics and fans but was heavily criticized for its nature and profanity. Erik Wiese, who helped to storyboard \\"Sailor Mouth\\", considers it to be his favorite episode, mainly due to its random and satirical nature, saying \\"Sometimes SpongeBob just catches me off-guard.\\" In 2018 Nancy Basile of About.com ranked the episode at number two for her list of the Top 10 SpongeBob SquarePants Episodes (behind Band Geeks). She said \\"'Sailor Mouth' just barely missed being in the number one slot.\\" Basile praised the episode's plot and called it \\"genius[...] because children can relate to the forbidden thrill of using curse words, and adults can laugh at the parody of TV censorship.\\" In an interview with Paul Tibbitt, one of the episode's writers, he told that \\"Sailor Mouth\\" is his second favorite SpongeBob episode. =Criticism and controversy= According to a report titled Wolves in Sheep's Clothing, which documents the increase in potentially violent, profane, and sexual content in children's programming, the Parents Television Council, a watchdog media group, critics, and fans believed the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Sailor Mouth\\" was an implicit attempt to promote and satirize use of profanity among children. The episode originally aired during the 2001‚Äì02 television season, ironically the season in which the PTC named SpongeBob SquarePants among the best programs on cable television, but the report cited a repeat broadcast of this episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of profanity among children. In a later report, several members of the PTC listed \\"Sailor Mouth\\" as an example of how levels of profane, sexual, and violent activity has increased in children's television programming. \\"During the study period Nickelodeon aired an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants entitled \\"Sailor Mouth,\\" the subject of which is foul language: Innocent SpongeBob does not understand the dirty word graffiti he sees on a dumpster but Patrick tells him it's a \\"sentence enhancer\\" for when you want to talk fancy. The rest of the episode features SpongeBob and Patrick using bleeped foul language. The bleeps are made to sound like a dolphin which makes the whole thing seem humorous. At the end SpongeBob and Patrick realize the words are bad and promise to never use them again but the episode ends with them telling Momma Krabs the 13 bad words Mr. Krabs has just said. All are punished by Momma Krabs for \\"talking like sailors.\\" Nickelodeon, in response to the incident, said \\"It's sad and a little desperate that they stooped to literally putting profane language in the mouths of our characters to make a point. Has the FCC looked at this?\\" Richard Huff of the New York Daily News criticized the report for misinterpreting \\"Sailor Mouth\\" over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly.

Biography Born in Warsaw, then part of the Russian Empire, Benet was fascinated with Polish peasant culture from her early youth. This interest eventually led her to enroll as a student of literature and philosophy in the Faculty of Humanities in the University of Warsaw, graduating with a degree in anthropology in 1935. She then attended graduate school at Columbia University, where she received her doctorate in 1944. Also at this time (1936) she first made known at a seminar in Warsaw her theory that \\"calamus\\" in the Bible is hemp.Sula Benetova 1936 Le chanvre dans les croyances et les coutumes populaires. Comtes Rendus de S√©ances de la Soci√©t√© des Sciences et des Lettres de Varsovie XXVII. Benet died in New York in 1982. Cannabis research Benet proposed that the Biblical plants or spices \\"kaneh\\" (Ez. 27:19; Is. 43:24; Ct. 4:14), \\"kaneh ha-tob\\" (Je. 6:20), and \\"kaneh-bosem\\" (Ex. 30:23), which are usually translated as \\"sweet calamus\\" or \\"sweet cane\\", were actually hemp. \\"Kaneh-bosem\\" was an ingredient of the holy anointing oil: This ingredient is, however, not mentioned amongst those prescribed in Ex. 30:34, from which the incense (ketoret) for the Temple was to be prepared. According to Julius Wellhausen's documentary hypothesis, Ex. 30:23 belongs to a priestly (P) source, composed sometime between the 8th and the mid-6th century B.C. Based on similar words in cognate languages (Sanskrit ≈õana, Assyrian qunnabu, Persian kenab, Arabic kanab) Benet concluded that \\"kaneh\\" and \\"kaneh-bosem\\" refer to hemp. In many ancient languages, including Hebrew, the root \\"kan\\" had a double meaning, both hemp and reed. The possible error originated from the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, Septuagint, in the third century B.C., where the terms \\"kaneh\\" and \\"kaneh- bosem\\" had been translated as \\"sweet kalamos\\". In the many Bible translations that followed, including Martin Luther's, this translation was repeated. Benet further claimed that the Scythians, who were described by Herodotus as ritual hemp users in the fifth century B.C., were at least one millennium older than has been previously assumed. Sulah Benet's claim has found some support in the academic community among lexicographers and botanists. The standard reference lexicons of Biblical Hebrew, and reference works on Hebrew Bible plants by scholars such as University of Jerusalem botanist Michael Zohary mention Benet's suggestion, while others argue the word refers to an either different species of hemp or a different plant entirely. Celsius (Hierobotanicon) has suggested sweet flag (Acorus calamus), which grows in Egypt, Judaea, and Syria, containing in its stalk a soft white pith with an agreeable aromatic smell, and forming an ingredient of the richest perfumes. Royle identified the \\"sweet cane\\" (A.V.) of Scripture (Is. 43:24; Je. 6:20) with the Andropogon calamus, a plant extensively cultivated in India, from which an oil, deemed to be the famous spikenard of antiquity, is extracted. According to Boissier (Flora Orientalis), \\"kaneh\\" was the common marsh reed, Arundo donax L. Some biblical scholars and botanists believe that the qaneh is probably sugarcane. In Hebrew, \\"kanebas\\", \\"kanebiys\\", \\"kanebos\\" (), derived from Greek \\"kannabis\\", first appear in the Mishnah (Kilayim 2:5; 5:8; 9:1, 5, 7). The Jerusalem Talmud (Kilayim 9:5, 32d) notes that while in mishnaic times hemp was an important commodity because of the difficulty of cultivating linen, in the days of the Amoraim linen replaced it. THC-containing Cannabis has been found in a Jewish temple in Tel Arad as CNN had reported on May 28, 2020. It had been burnt besides frankincense for a ritualistic form of what is known in the Cannabis culture as hotboxing. This solidifies Sula Benet's theory of Kaneh bosem as being cannabis. Benet's papers are held in New York University archives.

Their origins most likely ultimately lie in the Mand√© peoples, only to later be absorbed by groups such as the Wolof, Serer, Fulani, or Tuareg.Mwalimu, Charles, The Golden Book: Philosophy of Law for Africa Creating the National State, p 952 Some sources say this is a loose term to encompass the pre-Sanhaja peoples, who were \\"part Berber, part Negro, and part Semite.\\" And others describe them as Mand√© agriculturalists who inhabited the area prior to the arrival of the Berbers. Others say they occupied these territories in the 15th century and, before the end of the 17th century, and were comprised by various groups, including the Wolof, Berber and Fula. History The Bafour were a settled people at the time of the Neolithic Era. According to their oral tradition, they lived in the Western Sahara and gradually migrated southward. Charles Mwalimu describes them as \\"African black Agriculturalists...subsequently replaced by the Berber\\". Anthony Pazzanita refers to them as \\"a pastoral, pre-Berber people who migrated to the area during Neolithic times\\", ancestors of the Soninke people and other Mand√© peoples.Jensen, Erik, Western Sahara: Anatomy Of A Stalemate, pp 20‚Äì21 Twentieth-century historians have suggested that they may have been inhabitants of this territory in western Africa before the Islamic period. French art historian Jean Laude wrote, \\"In the pre-Islamic period (before the ninth century), according to oral tradition, Mauritania was occupied by the Bafour, a population of possibly mixed origin from whom the eastern Songhai, the central Gangara, and the western Serer are derived.\\"Laude, Jean, The Arts of Black Africa, University of California Press, 1973 (translated by : Jean Decock), p 50, Historian James L.A.

Over four centuries before that, Arabs mixed with Bafur and Berber Masufa in Wadan, in present-day Western Sahara. A group known as Idaw al-Hajj (\\"sons of pilgrims\\" in Hassaniya) gradually settled in trading areas of northwestern Senegal, from where they dominated the gum arabic trade, as well as shipment of grain from the Wolof region to the Bidan (white North Africans), and a slave trade of Wolof people to the Maghreb for horses for their military campaigns. As is common among trading peoples, over time intermarriage had taken place between the Idaw al-Hajj and Wolof peoples, and the northerners gradually became assimilated into the sub-Saharan African community, including the use of Wolof as their language.James L.A.

Lord St Germans's wife was Lady Blanche Somerset, daughter of the 9th Duke of Beaufort, descendant of William Herbert from whom the Barony of Herbert originated. He was educated at Harrow School. He married, in 1975, Jane Bishop, daughter of Dr Ian Bishop.

In 2002 the Queen terminated the abeyance of the Barony of Herbert in his favour.By the laws of succession to ancient English baronies, daughters and co-heiresses inherit equal shares. Lady Blanche's daughters or their heirs inherited equal shares in the barony; however, David Seyfried was the elder son and thus sole heir of his mother, the younger daughter. The elder daughter had two surviving daughters who became co-heiresses to their mother's moiety or one-half. For details, see discussions on the Usenet group alt.talk.royalty.

Lake P√°tzcuaro lies in an endorheic basin, which does not drain to the sea. A watershed area of 929 square kilometres drains into the lake, of which 126.4 are the water body. The Lake P√°tzcuaro watershed extends 50 kilometres east-west and 33 kilometres from north to south. Lake P√°tzcuaro lies at an elevation of 1,920 metres, and is the center of the basin and is surrounded by volcanic mountains with very steep slopes. It has an average depth of 5 metres and a maximum of 11. Its volume is approximately 580 million cubic metres.\\"Descripci√≥n de la cuenca\\", Recuperaci√≥n Ambiental del Lago de P√°tzcuaro\\". Accessed October 18, 2009. The Lake P√°tzcuaro basin is of volcanic origin. At times it has been part of an open and continuous hydrological system formed by Lake Cuitzeo, P√°tzcuaro and Lake Zirahu√©n, which drained into the Lerma River. Today, like lakes Cuitzeo and Zirahu√©n, it is a closed basin, although ecologists consider it a sub-basin of the Lerma-Chapala basin. Wetlands The lake is surrounded by extensive wetlands, which have been designated as a Ramsar site since 2005. Cattails and other reedy vegetation are the dominant wetland vegetation, in dense stands over 2 meters tall. Typical wetland plant genera include Typha, Scirpus, Eleocharis, and Cyperus. The dominant species of aquatic vegetation are Potamogeton illinoensis, Scirpus pectinatus, tule (Typha latifolia), T. dominguensis, and Nymphaea mexicana. The wetlands are extremely important for birds, both year- round inhabitants and migrating waterfowl. Close to 200 species inhabit the wetlands, including some endemic species such as the black-polled yellowthroat (Geothlypis speciosa). Two native species have not been observed recently; the yellow rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) has not been seen since 1964 and may be locally extinct, and the endemic slender-billed grackle (Quiscalus palustris) is presumed extinct. The Lake P√°tzcuaro salamander (Ambystoma dumerilii) is endemic to the basin. Among other aquatic or semi-aquatic animals, several are largely or entirely restricted to the Lake P√°tzcuaro system, such as the rough-footed mud turtle of the subspecies tarascense, the essentially harmless Mexican garter snake of the subspecies patzcuaroensis, the fish P√°tzcuaro chub (Algansea lacustris) and P√°tzcuaro allotoca (Allotoca diazi), and the dwarf crayfish Cambarellus patzcuarensis. The lake and its surrounding wetlands have undergone significant environmental changes over the past 50 years. logging and agriculture in the surrounding watershed have contributed to siltation of the lake (1 cm / year - 1.2 million cubic meters / year), and water diversion for agriculture and urbanization has reduced the size of the lake by 40 square kilometers, and 2.6 meters in depth. Other threats include untreated sewage, the introduction of exotic species, and chemical pollution.\\"Indicadores del deterioro ambiental\\", Recuperaci√≥n Ambiental del Lago de P√°tzcuaro\\". Accessed October 18, 2009. Watershed In the watershed surrounding the wetlands, the natural terrestrial vegetation is composed of xeric scrub (1,920-2,100 m above sea level), pine and oak forests intertwined with xeric scrub (2,100-2,400 m) and by pure pine-oak forests in the higher peaks (2,400-2,900 m). The pine-oak forests are part of the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests ecoregion. In the last fifty years, human activity in the watershed has intensified. Farming and livestock ranching in the basin have significantly increased. Over 10,000 hectares of forest have been lost to logging, fires, fuelwood gathering, and clearance for farming and ranching. History The Lake P√°tzcuaro basin is home to the Pur√©pecha people. Pur√©pecha leaders established the basin as the heartland of the Tarascan state, which rivaled the Aztec Empire before the Spanish conquest.

He was pivotal in founding the International Institute of Agriculture in 1908, in Rome. Biography He was born in K≈Çodawa, Poland. His family moved to England in 1853. On his father's death, David's mother married again and they emigrated to America. He received a scant education and at an early age was placed in a jewelry factory in Attleboro, Massachusetts. Finding slight opportunity of advancement there he drifted to California. He reached Sacramento, and after working at odd jobs he amassed sufficient funds to start a dry goods store of his own. He dealt largely in overalls and thus came in contact with the farmers of California, and as he met them in person he learned something of their problems. He started a prosperous mail order business with his half-brother Harris Weinstock and his sister Jeanette Levy. Lubin's One Price Store later became known as the Weinstock-Lubin Company. While in Sacramento, he bought a fruit ranch near Sacramento and land for raising wheat. His knowledge of agriculture assisted him when he helped found the California Fruit Growers' Union. He then helped settle Eastern European Jewish refugees who worked on various farms in the area and, in 1891, he became the director of the International Society for the Colonization of Russian Jews. He then began to campaign for subsidies and protection for farmers, initially in California but eventually on an international scale. In his new vocation of farmer, there came to him the idea of an international agricultural congress, whereby one side of the globe might learn what the other side was producing and how and at what cost. He began collecting statistics on the subject, studied plant life and domestic animals and made investigations into their diseases and sought remedies. His son, Simon, helped him develop a proposal for an international chamber of agriculture. In 1896, David Lubin moved to Europe to implement the proposal. In Italy, in 1904, King Victor Emmanuel III saw the need for such an institution and gave it his ardent support, giving a building for the congress and an annual income of $60,000. In May 1905, the International Institute of Agriculture (the IIA) opened in Rome. The Institute's goals were to help farmers share knowledge, produce systematically, establish a cooperative system of rural credit, and have control over the marketing of their products. At the first gathering 40 nations were represented. In 1906, Lubin was appointed the permanent U.S. delegate to the IIA. In 1913 on the occasion of the meeting of the congress in Rome Mr. Lubin received a silver cup as a token of appreciation of his efforts in originating the organization. By 1919, 53 nations were represented at the IIA gatherings. The IIA ceased operations in 1945. Several of its assets were transferred to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The mandate of international cooperation in the field of agriculture is continued by the FAO, which named its library in honor of David Lubin. The David Lubin Memorial Library (DLML) maintains the personal archives of David Lubin and the collection of the IIA library.David Lubin Memorial Library (DLML) It accepts visitors who would like to research these materials in person.See the biography of David Lubin, hosted on the website of FAO. The U.S. Federal Farm Act (1916), whose founding ideas and policies can be seen to be influenced by Lubin and the International Institute of Agriculture, introduced rural credit and contributed to the relief of American farmers during the Great Depression. Similarly, Lubin's successful fight for the lowering of oppressive freight rates also helped lead to the development of the parcel post system. He also took a keen interest in farmers' co-operative societies and granges and was interested in oceanic shipping. He introduced a national marketing proposal on the lines of the German Landwirtschaftsrat. In addition, Lubin wrote essays and treatises. His novel, Let There be Light, proposed a universal world religion. He died in the 1918 flu pandemic, aged 69 on January 1, 1919. http://www.fao.org/library/about-library/general- information/david-lubin-an-appreciation/en/ Legacy The centenary of IIA was celebrated by ISTAT (Italian Statistics Office) and FAO and its Statistics Division on 28 May 2008 in Rome.

Population: History It was first mentioned in an 1146 chronicle as a part of Principality of Chernigov. Kozelsk became famous in the spring of 1238, when its seven-year-old prince Vasily, son of Titus, had to defend the town against the army of Batu Khan. The latter dubbed it an \\"evil town\\" because its citizens had been fighting the attackers for seven weeks in a row, killing around four thousand enemy soldiers during the siege. The citizens of Kozelsk were greatly outnumbered and almost all of them died in battle. Kozelsk siege in 1239 by Batu Khan In 1446, Kozelsk was temporarily under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1494, the town was finally annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1607, one of Ivan Bolotnikov's units was located in Kozelsk and showed resistance to the Tsar's army. The much-venerated monastery, Optina Pustyn, is close by. In the 19th century, this hermitage gained wide renown for its \\"startsy\\". After the outbreak of World War II, a POW camp was established in the monastery for Polish officers taken captive by the Red Army during the Polish Defensive War of 1939. Between April and May 1940, the NKVD transferred approximately 5,000 of them to a forest near Katyn, where they were executed in what became known as the Katyn massacre. The remaining two hundred officers were sent to a camp in Pavlishchev Bor and then to Gryazovets. The town was occupied by the German army from October 8, 1941 until December 27, 1941 and was totally destroyed. It was rebuilt after the war. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kozelsk serves as the administrative center of Kozelsky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the town of Kozelsk is incorporated within Kozelsky Municipal District as Kozelsk Urban Settlement.Law #7-OZ Military After World War II, Kozelsky District became the home for the 28th Guards Rocket Division of the Strategic Missile Troops.

Applications  = Domestic heating radiators = Bleed screw key Bleed screw key in use at a domestic radiator On a home radiator unit, the bleed screw can be opened, usually by means of a key, to allow unwanted air to escape from the unit. Bleed screws are also found on some pump types fulfilling a similar purpose. They are most often located at the top of the radiator on the side of the inflow pipe. The screw itself, usually a hexagonal or square knob, is inside a small round protrusion. The key looks similar to that used to wind a clock. It is inserted into the protrusion, mates with the bleed screw and turns it. Opening the bleed screw then allows air which has risen to the top of the radiator system (the top of the radiator itself) to escape and new water to take its place. Removing the air and allowing water to displace it makes the radiator work more efficiently since water conducts heat better than air. = Engine cooling = Engine cooling systems can also have bleed screws. They can take the form of a bolt with a hole through the middle that is threaded into a hole on the engine's cylinder head. This hole goes into the water jacket of the cylinder head. In other designs, the bleed screw is placed in the uppermost hose which leads to the heater core, i.e. at the highest point of the cooling system. When the bleed screw is loosened, antifreeze is added to the engine's cooling system and the increase in fluid pressure displaces air through the opened bleed screw. When liquid begins to flow out, all air has been removed from the system and the bleed screw is closed. Bleed screws are not common on cars today and are only necessary when design of an engine's cooling system results in areas where air can be trapped in the system. Air in the system can lead to overheating of the engine and in modern cars also to poor vehicle operation (e.g. problems with the AC system or incorrect engine idle). = Hydraulic braking systems = On a hydraulic vehicle braking systems, the bleed screws (sometimes known as bleed nipples or bleeder valves) are located at the top of each brake caliper to allow bleeding of the braking system. Whenever service work has been performed on the braking system which might have introduced air into the system (i.e. the hydraulic system has been opened), the air must be bled out. This is necessary for correct operation of the system, because air compresses (as opposed to brake fluid which is not compressible). Air in the system reduces the maximum pressure applied to the brake pistons and can lead to loss of braking ability.

Clutches are controlled from pedal by bowden cable or hydraulic systems, some use the fluid in common with the brake system.

Ambient intelligence was a projection on the future of consumer electronics, telecommunications and computing that was originally developed in the late 1990s by Eli Zelkha and his team at Palo Alto Ventures for the time frame 2010‚Äì2020. Ambient intelligence would allow devices to work in concert to support people in carrying out their everyday life activities, tasks and rituals in an intuitive way using information and intelligence that is hidden in the network connecting these devices (for example: The Internet of Things). As these devices grew smaller, more connected and more integrated into our environment, the technological framework behind them would disappear into our surroundings until only the user interface remains perceivable by users. The ambient intelligence paradigm builds upon pervasive computing, ubiquitous computing, profiling, context awareness, and human-centric computer interaction design, of which, is characterized by systems and technologies that are:Brian Epstein, Digital Living Room Conference Keynote 1998, (17 June 1998: revised script) https://epstein.org/ambient-intelligence/ accessed 14/12/17 * embedded: many networked devices are integrated into the environment * context aware: these devices can recognize you and your situational context * personalized: they can be tailored to your needs * adaptive: they can change in response to you * anticipatory: they can anticipate your desires without conscious mediation. A typical context of ambient intelligence environment is home, but may also be extended to work spaces (offices, co-working), public spaces (based on technologies such as smart street lights), and hospital environments.  Overview  Ambient intelligence is primarily of interest because of its relationship to user experience and the advancement in sensor technology and sensor networks. The interest in user experience grew in importance in the late 1990s as a result of the increasing volume and importance of digital products and services that were difficult to understand or use. In response, the user experience design emerged to create new technologies and media around the user's personal experience. Ambient intelligence is influenced by user- centered design where the user is placed in the center of the design activity and asked to give feedback through specific user evaluations and tests to improve the design or even co-create the design with the designer (participatory design) or with other users (end-user development). Ambient intelligence requires a number of key technologies to exist. These include unobtrusive, user-friendly hardware such as miniaturization, nanotechnology, and smart devices, as well as human-centric computer interfaces (intelligent agents, multimodal interaction, context awareness etc.) These systems and devices operate through a seamless mobile/fixed communication and computing infrastructure characterized by interoperability, wired and wireless networks, and service-oriented architecture. To implement ambient intelligence dynamic and massively distributed device networks, which are easy to control and program (e.g. service discovery, auto-configuration, end-user programmable devices and systems etc.) These systems and devices must also be dependable and secure, which may be achieved through self-testing and self repairing software and privacy ensuring technology. History and invention In 1998, the board of management of Philips commissioned a series of presentations and internal workshops, organized by Eli Zelkha and Brian Epstein of Palo Alto Ventures. Zelkha, together with Simon Birrell, coined the term 'ambient intelligence' to investigate different scenarios that would transform the high-volume consumer electronic industry of the 1990s, which they described as \\"fragmented with features\\", into an industry where user-friendly devices supported ubiquitous information, communication and entertainment by 2020. While developing the ambient intelligence concept, Palo Alto Ventures created the keynote address for Roel Pieper of Philips for the Digital Living Room Conference, 1998. The group included Eli Zelkha, Brian Epstein, Simon Birrell, Doug Randall, and Clark Dodsworth. These plans continued to develop throughout the 1990s, and in 2000, plans were made to construct a feasibility and usability facility dedicated to ambient intelligence. This HomeLab officially opened on 24 April 2002. In 2005, Philips joined the Oxygen alliance, an international consortium of industrial partners within the context of the MIT Oxygen project, aimed at developing technology for the computer of the 21st century. Along with the development of the vision at Philips, a number of parallel initiatives started to explore ambient intelligence in more detail. Following the advice of the Information Society and Technology Advisory Group (ISTAG), the European Commission used the vision for the launch of their sixth framework (FP6) in Information, Society and Technology (IST), with a subsidiary budget of 3.7 billion euros. The European Commission played a crucial role in the further development of the AmI vision. As a result of many initiatives the AmI vision gained traction. During the past few years several major initiatives have been started. Fraunhofer Society started several activities in a variety of domains including multimedia, microsystems design and augmented spaces. Massachusetts Institute of Technology started an ambient intelligence research group at their Media Lab. Several more research projects started in a variety of countries such as the US, Canada, Spain, France and the Netherlands. Since 2004, the European Symposium on Ambient Intelligence (EUSAI) and many other conferences have been held that address special topics in AmI. Criticism As far as dissemination of information on personal presence is out of control, ambient intelligence vision is subject of criticism (e.g. David Wright, Serge Gutwirth, Michael Friedewald et al., Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence, Springer, Dordrecht, 2008). Any immersive, personalized, context-aware and anticipatory characteristics brings up societal, political and cultural concerns about the loss of privacy. The example scenario above shows both the positive and negative possibilities offered by ambient intelligence. Applications of ambient intelligence do not necessarily have to reduce privacy in order to work. Power concentration in large organizations, a fragmented, decreasingly private society and hyperreal environments where the virtual is indistinguishable from the real are the main topics of critics. Several research groups and communities are investigating the socioeconomic, political and cultural aspects of ambient intelligence. Social and political aspects The ISTAG advisory group suggests that the following characteristics will permit the societal acceptance of ambient intelligence. Ambient intelligence should: * facilitate human contact. * be oriented towards community and cultural enhancement. * help to build knowledge and skills for work, better quality of work, citizenship and consumer choice. * inspire trust and confidence. * be consistent with long term sustainability‚Äîpersonal, societal and environmental‚Äîand with lifelong learning. * be made easy to live with and controllable by ordinary people. Business models The ISTAG group acknowledges the following entry points to AmI business landscape: * Initial premium value niche markets in industrial, commercial or public applications where enhanced interfaces are needed to support human performance in fast moving or delicate situations. * Start-up and spin-off opportunities from identifying potential service requirements and putting the services together that meet these new needs. * High access-low entry cost based on a loss leadership model in order to create economies of scale (mass customization). * Audience or customer's attention economy as a basis for 'free' end-user services paid for by advertising or complementary services or goods. * Self-provision‚Äîbased upon the network economies of very large user communities providing information as a gift or at near zero cost (e.g. social networking applications). * The combination of multiple and diverse datasets in a platform for sense-making and understanding consumer behaviour (e.g. Near).  Technologies  A variety of technologies can be used to enable Ambient intelligence environments such as : * Bluetooth Low Energy *RFID *Microchip implant * Sensors: Ambient light sensor (photodetector), thermometers, proximity sensors and motion detectors *Software agents * Affective computing * Nanotechnology * Biometrics  Computing  This means of computing links all pieces of technology together. This also allows the device to have the capability to remember past requests.  Uses in fiction  * Minority Report (2002 film). One scene illustrates adaptive advertising in the future: consumers are identified via retinal scans, and receive targeted ads . * The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. The doors have emotion, and express this when people use them. * The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson, depicts a world completely changed by the full development of nanotechnology that is present everywhere. * Her (2013 film). The opening scene depicts the protagonist commuting home, upon arriving the various lights throughout the apartment are turned on as the character moves through the rooms (automated lighting control). A later scene shows that an artificial entity can also control these systems, changing a song being played in the background to lighten a situation, and for humorous effect.

This magical horse is made of hurricane and flame, feeds on air and it treads so lightly that it doesn't leave footprints in the sand, and when it runs at full speed it can run faster than an arrow.Orlando Furioso XV: 40‚Äì41 Astolfo uses his magic horn to capture the giant Caligorante, and then parades the giant from town to town, forcing him to act as his beast of burden. He also defeats Orillo, a robber who could not be killed because he was enchanted to regenerate from any wounds he received. Even severed limbs would reattach themselves.Orlando Furioso XV: 81‚Äì87 Astolfo loans his golden lance and Rabicano to Bradamante for a short time while he rides the Hippogriff in search of Orlando's lost wits.Orlando Furioso XXIII: 14‚Äì16 Astolfo travels to Ethiopia where he met Senapo (Prester John), the emperor of that land. In a situation similar to the story of Phineus from Greek mythology, Senapo is blind and plagued by harpies who attack him whenever he tries to eat a meal, spilling the glasses and befouling the food. Astolfo blows his horn and chases the harpies through the entrance to Hell, and seals them inside. He flies the hippogriff to the summit of the mountain of Terrestrial Paradise, where he meets Saint John the Apostle, who explains how he could return Orlando to his senses. He flies in Elijah's flaming chariot to the moon, where all things lost upon the earth end up, and locates Orlando's wits in a bottle.Orlando Furioso XXXIV: 87 He returns to earth and gains Senapo's aid in the defense of Paris from the Saracen invaders.  Appearances in foreign media  Astolfo has made a major appearance in the popular anime, Fate/Apocrypha, which was produced by Type-Moon and Netflix.

Omega Sektor was one of the largest LAN gaming centers in Europe, seating 400 plus three consoles A LAN Gaming Center is a business where one can use a computer connected over a LAN to other computers, primarily for the purpose of playing multiplayer computer games. Use of these computers or game consoles costs a fee, usually per hour or minute; sometimes one can have unmetered access with a pass for a day or month, etc. It may or may not serve as a regular caf√© as well, with food and drinks being served. Many game centers have evolved in recent years to also include console gaming (Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2). Other centers offer computer repair and consulting, custom built computers (White box computer), web design, programming classes or summer camps, and many other technology related services. Centers are starting to offer PS3s, Wiis and Xbox 360s that are playable in store. LAN gaming centers can come in various sizes and styles, from the very small (6-8 computers) to the very large (400+ computers). Most have computer systems with higher-end hardware built specifically for computer gaming. Customers can play games with (or against) in-house opponents and most also include a high-speed Internet connection to allow customers to play games with online opponents as well (usually at the same time). Most also host a number of special events such as tournaments and LAN parties, some lasting throughout the night. Another typical feature is the ability to browse the Web and use instant messaging clients. Often these gaming centers allow customers the option of renting out the whole or part of the store for private LAN parties. LAN centers are typically decorated in such a way as to enhance the already present gaming atmosphere, such as adding black-light lightbulbs and gaming paraphernalia and posters around the center. A standard LAN gaming center will have rows of computers next to each other with highback leather computer chairs. There are over 650 LAN centers in the US, while 90% of the LAN Centers in the world are in China, the largest having over 1777 seats. It is common for a LAN gaming centers to sell the games that they had already installed for their in-house computers, most notably MMORPGs and many FPS games.  Campus gaming centers  The first LAN Gaming center located on a college campus was Savage Geckos which was opened by Bruce McCulloch Jones as a tenant of Eastern Michigan University's Student Center, both opening on November 6, 2006. The combination retail/gaming center included 21 networked Xboxs, other consoles: PS2s, PS3s, Wiis, 10 networked gaming PCs and theatre seating (with cup holders) for game play, LCD screens, video projectors and a retail/arcade/hang out area. This center hosted some of the first on-campus intercollegiate play with a Halo 3 tournament between students from Eastern Michigan University, University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Oakland University. The operation lasted until Spring of 2008 when it was purchased by the university. Mr. Jones made a series of presentations to the Association of College Unions International promoting the use of video games for positive social interaction on campus student centers. Now there are over 20 universities with some form of LAN Center on campus including Eastern Michigan University, University of Michigan, Oakland University, Illinois State University, and Illinois Institute of Technology.

It is the fourth in the Sabreman series, following on from his adventures in Sabre Wulf, Underwurlde and Knight Lore. Similarly to Knight Lore it uses the isometric Filmation engine. The game was written by either Tim and Chris Stamper or a U.S. Gold programming team (see the main article for the reason for this confusion). Introduction Typically for an Ultimate release, the inlay card provides little actual instruction for playing the game, but includes a cryptic short story as an introduction. This was Ultimate's way of describing the object of the game, which is to recover the lost Pentagram, an artifact of magical power. Firstly Sabreman must locate one of the wells located in the maze of screens, shoot it several times with his spell and take the resultant bucket of water to one of the broken obelisks. When dropped on these, the water will \\"heal\\" the stone. This must be done with each of the four obelisks to make the titular Pentagram appear in one of the rooms. Once this is done, five magic runestones must be found and placed on the Pentagram itself. Gameplay The difficult to reach \\"silvery waters\\" Though the objective in Pentagram is more complex and obscure than the simple \\"find and fetch\\" gameplay of the two previous Filmation games Knight Lore and Alien 8, the gameplay is similar to those two titles. The main differences in this final revision of the Filmation engine are the new ability to shoot enemies with a projectile magic spell, and the ability of the enemies to respawn. The \\"directional control\\" system of the previous games was also removed because the Spectrum's single joystick button was now needed to fire Sabreman's spell, so it could no longer be used to jump (instead, \\"down\\" on the joystick is used to jump). The basic gameplay is the same as that of Sabreman's previous outing Knight Lore (without that game's day/night shapeshifting cycle), as he wanders a mazelike system of screens filled with enemies, pieces of movable scenery (often forming obstacles or puzzles), and exits on one or more walls, sometimes high up and difficult to reach. Pentagram features larger numbers of enemies than either Knight Lore or Alien 8, due to Sabreman's newfound ability to kill them. These include some new flying creatures, such as ghosts and lice, that don't kill Sabreman but get in his way (an idea reprised from Sabreman's second adventure Underwurlde), and may even be jumped onto. These harmless but frequently annoying foes will gravitate toward Sabreman and hover around him disrupting his movement (and sometimes even nudging him off platforms) until they are destroyed. Others such as witches and zombies are lethal to touch but may be destroyed. These do not head straight for Sabreman, but wander in straight lines until meeting an obstruction, at which point they change direction. The same behaviour is true for the wood spiders, though these are more dangerous as they cannot be killed. The \\"Wulfsheads\\" are either static or move in a set pattern and also cannot be killed. When an enemy is destroyed by use of Sabreman's new magic fireball spell, another will drop in from the top of the screen to replace it after a short while, this happening much faster the further into the game the player progresses. There is a maximum of two enemies per screen at any one time, excluding any indestructible ones already in place when a room is entered. This is due to the limitations of the hardware which, as with the previous Filmation games, slows to a crawl when any more than four moving objects are on screen at once. As with the previous two Filmation games, enemies may interact with scenery in a very basic way, shoving any movable objects (such as logs and tables) along when they bump into them. As before, Sabreman may also push one or more of these objects at once, though in Pentagram he may even move them from a distance with a blast of his magic. Reception In terms of gameplay and features Pentagram was the most advanced of the Filmation titles, but some sections of the gaming press were becoming tired of the concept and accused Ultimate of unoriginality. This was Ultimate's third Filmation title (fifth if the Filmation II games, Nightshade and Gunfright, are counted), and by that time other publishers were also releasing their own isometric Filmation-inspired games. Confusion was also a factor, with Your Sinclair lamenting that Pentagram's instructions were \\"shrouded in Ultimate's rather confusing 'poetry',\\" and Sinclair User admitted that all they could work out of the objective was \\"it has something to do with the various wishing wells dotted about the game\\".Sinclair User, issue 52, page 43. EMAP, July 1986 Even CRASH, who rated Pentagram very highly, hadn't quite worked out the game's objective at the time of review.CRASH, issue 29, page 134. Newsfield Publications, June 1986 Review scores ranged from the 3/5 awarded by Sinclair User, who described it as \\"lazy\\" and criticised a perceived lack of imagination in the setting and design, to the 93% \\"CRASH Smash\\" awarded by the ever Ultimate-friendly CRASH magazine, who cited the graphics, re-spawning enemies, and atmosphere as high points.

Before the 2005 season, the Atlanta Braves returned closer John Smoltz to his original starter role to compensate for several losses in their pitching rotation. The Braves traded pitchers Jos√© Capell√°n and Alec Zumwalt to the Brewers for Kolb to replace Smoltz in the bullpen. However, Kolb endured a poor season with the Braves, going 3-8 with a 5.93 ERA while recording only 11 saves before being replaced in the closer role by Chris Reitsma. He admitted following the '05 season that the pressure of replacing a legend like Smoltz played a big part in his ineffectiveness.

In 1867, he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral on the retired list to date from 25 July 1866 in honor of his long and distinguished career. When his son, Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr., was promoted to rear admiral on February 28, 1896, they became the first father and son to be living when they were both U.S. Navy admirals. He was a Companion of the First Class of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and an Honorary Veteran Companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. Rear Admiral Selfridge died in Waverly (now part of Belmont, Massachusetts) in 1902 at the age of 98.

Together with the Xinca, Gar√≠funas (Black Caribs) and the Ladinos, they make up the 24 ethnic groups in this relatively small country. Approximately 100,000 Tz ºutujil live in the area around Lake Atitl√°n. Their pre-Columbian capital, near Santiago Atitl√°n, was Chuitinamit. In pre- Columbian times, the Tz ºutujil nation was a part of the ancient Maya civilization. The Tz ºutujil are noted for their continuing adherence to traditional cultural and religious practices. Some also practice Evangelical Protestantism or Roman Catholicism. They speak the Tz ºutujil language, a member of the Mayan language family. History and demographics The Tz ºutujil date from the post-classic period (circa 900-1500) of the Maya civilization, inhabiting the southern watershed of Lake Atitl√°n, in what is now defined as the Solola region of the Guatemalan highlands. Today they dwell primarily in the towns of San Juan La Laguna, San Pablo La Laguna, San Marcos La Laguna, San Pedro La Laguna, Santiago Atitl√°n, Panabaj, Tzanchaj (believed to have been the inspiration, because of its similar sound, for the name \\"Santiago\\"), with fewer in San Lucas Tolim√°n. This people used to inhabit a much wider region. In 1523 the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, with the help of the Kaqchikel Maya, defeated them in a battle close to the town of Panajachel. At that time they lost a portion of their lands, and the control of the lake. In 2005, several hundred Tz ºutujil died in the mudslides caused by Hurricane Stan. Rescuers recovered 160 bodies from Panabaj and Tzanchaj, while a total of 250 persons remained missing from both towns. Economics Although tourism is now an increasing source of income in the region, many Tz ºutujil still practice traditional methods of farming of the two main crops in the region, coffee and maize (corn). Tourism has provided a market for the talented artists and weavers, who seek recognition for their creativity and unique works. San Juan is one of three Tz ºutujil communities where artists have adapted the international genre of Arte Naif to express the cultural traditions, beliefs, ceremonies, and daily activities of their indigenous culture. This form of art and some of its most accomplished Tz ºutjil practitioners have been recognized in the definitive UNESCO-sponsored book on the subject, Arte Naif: Contemporary Guatemalan Mayan Painting (1998). The weavers of San Juan are among the few indigenous artisans who make their own dyes for the yarns they use; they produce the dyes largely from locally grown plants.

Playing career Brower was originally drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates out of Minnetonka High School in the 56th round of the amateur draft, but did not sign, choosing instead to attend the University of Minnesota, where he was named a Big Ten Conference All-Star and Dave Winfield Award recipient in 1994. He was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 6th round of the 1994 draft, and signed on June 5. He spent nearly four years in the Rangers system before being released early in 1998. He quickly signed with the Cleveland Indians, spending the 1998 season in AA, then splitting the next two seasons between the Indians and their AAA club. Brower was traded to the Cincinnati Reds following the 2000 season. In June 2002, the Reds traded him to the Montreal Expos for pitcher Bruce Chen. In March 2003, he was traded to San Francisco in the trade that sent Liv√°n Hern√°ndez to the Expos. In 2004, he tied the Giants' team record and led MLB in appearances with 89. Following a slow start to the 2005 season, Brower was released by the Giants on June 12, and signed by the Atlanta Braves.

The portico is an exact copy of the octagon tower of Andronicus in Athens. The Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society was founded in 1821 to promote the scientific study of animals, plants, fossils, rocks and minerals. The Society was founded by George Crawford Hyndman, James Lawson Drummond, James Grimshaw, James McAdam, Robert Patterson, Robert Simms, Francis Archer, the Thomas Dix Hincks, Edward Hincks and Edmund Getty. Five years later in 1826 Alexander Henry Haliday and William Thompson both joined. In 1823, the Society's collection and the small collection begun in 1788 in the rooms of the Belfast Reading Society and that of the Belfast Literary Society were moved to Belfast Academical Institution where James Bryce was centralising Belfast's rapidly expanding natural history holdings. A new building opened at No. 7 College Square North in 1831. How big were the first collections are unknown but the 1831 figure of 300 insects given when the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society Museum opened to non-members may refer to specimens on display. The research material would have been much more numerous and expanded rapidly during the next decade. Specimens from England, the West Indies, Lapland, France, Greece, Italy, Senegal, New Holland, Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, Mauritius, Colombia, Recife, Peru, Virginia, India and West Africa were acquired by gift. The Society maintained an excellent library and received many journals from corresponding members of English and continental natural history societies. Notable contributors were John Obadiah Westwood, Francis Walker, Carl August Dohrn), Maximilian Spinola and John Gould and Charles Darwin. Many of the collections and some of the books were transferred to the Trinity College Museum, Dublin in 1843 after the society became the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society in 1842 when lectures in chemistry, physics, engineering and were allowed. Specimens remaining in Belfast are kept in the Ulster Museum where they bear the tag BNHPS collection. The formerly central role of natural history and archaeology diminished from this year on and in 1863 the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club was founded. The fragmentary BNHS minute books (pre 1842) and few letters are in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, in Belfast. The Society still exists today retaining ownership of the Old Museum Building, publishing occasional books, and running a lecture series out of the Linen Hall Library. The museum Musei Belfastiani ; J. Johnston, Redemptore. The museum was the first erected in Ireland by public subscription. From its inception in 1831 and for 47 years the Museum employed a curator taxidermist named William Darragh (1813‚Äì1892). In the first report of the society he wrote an account entitled \\"Directions for preserving subjects in natural history\\". This covered birds, tortoises etc., lizards and serpents, fish, shells, corals, seafans etc., crabs, lobsters etc., asterias or starfish, insects, botanical specimens, seeds, minerals and Fossil. He notes, correctly anticipating foreign specimens \\"As there is now no vexatious delay or trouble experienced by Custom-house regulations, specimens of natural history being admitted free of duty, it is recommended that all packages may be entered in the ship's papers, and if a list of all the contents of each package could, with convenience, be attached inside the lid of the box or cover, the risk of injury to the specimens, by examination at the Custom- house, would in great measure be avoided\\". Also \\"Should it even happen that the specimens be already possessed by the Society, still duplicates are desirable, since such as are not possessed by the Museum can be readily exchanged for others that may be wanted\\". The Museum in 1831. The architects were Thomas Duff and Thomas Jackson. The building has three stories. In the lower story were the lecture-room and library. Each of the upper stories is a single room, forty-seven feet in length, and twenty-seven feet wide, which housed the public museum. A laboratory was later attached to the lecture room. Although the focus of the collections was primarily on zoology, botany and geology substantial archaeological, ethnographic and antiquarian acquisitions were made and in 1835 the Society gained an Egyptian mummy, Takabuti. Specimen of an emperor penguin donated to the Belfast Natural History Society by Francis Crozier Whilst the members of the Society were middle class the museum was open to the working classes, at a small charge on Easter Mondays.

By ending many of the social and cultural props of the previous century, the stage was set for dramatic economic, political and social change of the Late Enlightenment of which the development of learned societies was a part. One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularisation. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured \\"to make information available to the greatest number of people\\". As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies. Books owned by the Belfast Natural History Society reflect such changes, although some of the more expensive works were the gift of Thomas Fortescue and Arthur Hill.

From 1871 he studied music, history, classical philology and philosophy in Berlin, Bonn and Strasbourg. He completed his dissertation in 1876 at the University of Strasbourg under the supervision of the philosopher Ernst Laas and in 1881 completed his Habilitation under the neo-Kantian Hermann Cohen. In 1885 he became extraordinary professor and in 1893 became ordinary professor in philosophy and pedagogy at Marburg University, a position he retained until his retirement in 1922. In the winter semester of 1923‚Äì24 Natorp conducted an intensive exchange of ideas with Martin Heidegger, who had been called to Marburg and whose work on Duns Scotus Natorp had read very early on. In 1887 he married his cousin Helene Natorp; they had five children. Natorp was an ambitious composer, who wrote chiefly chamber music (including a cello sonata, a violin sonata, and a piano trio). He also wrote some 100 songs and two choral works. He conducted a correspondence with Johannes Brahms, who dissuaded him from becoming a professional composer. He was an influence on the early work of Hans-Georg Gadamer and had a profound effect upon the thought of Edmund Husserl, the \\"father\\" of phenomenology.

Early life Heinz's father was physician Paul Sielmann. His first film, in 1938, was a silent movie on bird life in East Prussia and the Memelland. Further work was interrupted by World War II. He was initially stationed in occupied Poland in Pozna≈Ñ (then \\"Posen\\"), as an instructor at a radio-communications training unit of the Luftwaffe. Sielmann gained a degree in Biology and specialized in Zoology, in 1940, at the University of Posen, at that time a Germanized university. There he met Joseph Beuys, who was his trainee, and they both attended lectures in biology and zoology. Later he was stationed in Crete, where he worked in cinematographically. Following time as a prisoner of war of the British in Cairo and London he started editing the material from Crete in London for a three-part documentary.Heinz Sielmann's CV on Heinz Sielmann Stiftung, retrieved 20/01/2015 Career After the war he began widely recognized work for the Educational Film Institute of the Federal Republic of Germany. His feature film about woodpeckers, Carpenters of the Forest (Zimmerleute des Waldes, 1954; UK title: Woodpecker) was a huge success in the United Kingdom when broadcast by the BBC in 1955 at the behest of Sir Peter Scott. It earned Sielmann the nickname \\"Mr Woodpecker\\". His work includes the movies Lords of the Forest (better known in the USA under its title Masters of the Congo Jungle) (1959), the English version narrated by Orson Welles; Galapagos ‚Äì Dream Island in the Pacific (1962); Vanishing Wilderness (1973); and The Mystery of Animal Behavior. During the collaboration on some National Geographic wildlife documentaries in the late 1960s he met Walon Green with whom he worked as additional photographer on the Academy Award-winning documentary The Hellstrom Chronicle about insects in 1971. Sielmann was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Cherry Kearton Medal and Award in 1973. He was also cinematographer on the American wildlife documentary, Birds do it..., Bees do it... in 1974. He was mentioned in the 1974 Monty Python's Flying Circus episode \\"Blood, Devastation, Death, War, and Horror\\". In 1994 he established the Heinz Sielmann-Stiftung, which successfully reintroduced beavers and otters in Germany. His first television work for German Television began in 1956 and his series Expeditionen ins Tierreich (Expeditions into the Animal Kingdom), broadcast on national German television from 1965 to 1991 in 152 installments, made him a household name.

Bernays in 1928, incorporated the literature from social science and psychological manipulation into an examination of the techniques of public communication. Bernays wrote the book in response to the success of some of his earlier works such as Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923) and A Public Relations Counsel (1927). Propaganda explored the psychology behind manipulating masses and the ability to use symbolic action and propaganda to influence politics, effect social change, and lobby for gender and racial equality.Bernays Walter Lippman was Bernays' unacknowledged American mentor and his work The Phantom Public greatly influenced the ideas expressed in Propaganda a year later.Stephen Bender, LewRockwell.com, \\"Karl Rove & the Spectre of Freud's Nephew.\\" Last modified 2005. Accessed March 26, 2013. http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig6/bender2.html. The work propelled Bernays into media historians' view of him as the \\"father of public relations.\\"Turow, 565. Synopsis Chapters one through six address the complex relationship between human psychology, democracy, and corporations. Bernays' thesis is that \\"invisible\\" people who create knowledge and propaganda rule over the masses, with a monopoly on the power to shape thoughts, values, and citizen response.Bernays, 20. \\"Engineering consent\\" of the masses would be vital for the survival of democracy.Bernays, 11. Bernays explains: \\"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.\\"Bernays, 9. Bernays expands this argument to the economic realm, appreciating the positive impact of propaganda in the service of capitalism.Bernays, 61. \\"A single factory, potentially capable of supplying a whole continent with its particular product, cannot afford to wait until the public asks for its product; it must maintain constant touch, through advertising and propaganda, with the vast public in order to assure itself the continuous demand which alone will make its costly plant profitable.\\"Bernays, 57. Bernays places great importance on the ability of a propaganda producer, as he views himself, to unlock the motives behind an individual's desires, not simply the reason an individual might offer. He argues, \\"Man's thoughts and actions are compensatory substitutes for desires which he has been obliged to suppress.\\"Bernays, 52. Bernays suggests that propaganda may become increasingly effective and influential through the discovery of audiences' hidden motives. He asserts that the emotional response inherently present in propaganda limits the audience's choices by creating a binary mentality, which can result in quicker, more enthused responses.Bernays, 28, 100. The final five chapters largely reiterate the concepts voiced earlier in the book and provide case studies for how to use propaganda to effectively advance women's rights, education, and social services.Bernays. Reception and impact Despite the relative significance of Propaganda to twentieth century media history and modern public relations, surprisingly little critique of the work exists. Public relations scholar Curt Olsen argues that the public largely accepted Bernays' \\"sunny\\" view of propaganda, an acceptance eroded by fascism in the World War II era.Olsen. Olsen also argues that Bernays's skill with language allowed terms such as \\"education\\" to subtly replace darker concepts such as \\"indoctrination.\\"Olsen. Finally, Olsen criticizes Bernays for advocating \\"psychic ease\\" for the average person to have no burden to answer for his or her own actions in the face of powerful messages.Olsen. On the other hand, writers such as Marvin Olasky justify Bernays as killing democracy in order to save it.Olasky In this way, the presence of an elite, faceless persuasion constituted the only plausible way to prevent authoritarian control.Olasky Concepts outlined in Bernays' Propaganda and other works enabled the development of the first \\"two-way model\\" of public relations, using elements of social science in order to better formulate public opinion.Turow, 565. Bernays justified public relations as a profession by clearly emphasizing that no individual or group had a monopoly on the true understanding of the world.Turow, 565. According to public relations expert Stuart Ewen, \\"What Lippman set out in grand, overview terms, Bernays is running through in how-to-do-it-terms.\\"Tye, 98.

Originally created in 1989 as the Poland and Hungary: Assistance for Restructuring their Economies (PHARE) programme, Phare expanded from Poland and Hungary to cover ten countries. It assisted eight of the ten 2004 accession Member States: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia, as well as those countries that acceded in 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania), in a period of massive economic restructuring and political change. Phare means lighthouse in French. Until 2000, countries of the Western Balkans (Albania, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina) were also beneficiaries of Phare. However, as of 2001, the CARDS programme (Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stability in the Balkans) has provided financial assistance to these countries. Following the 1993 Copenhagen Council's invitation to Central and Eastern European countries to apply for membership, PHARE support was reoriented towards this aim, including a marked expansion of support for infrastructure investment. PHARE's total pre- accession focus was put in place in 1997, in response to the Luxembourg Council‚Äôs launching of the present enlargement process. Phare funds focus entirely on the pre-accession priorities highlighted in the Road Maps and the Accession Partnerships which establish the overall priorities the country must address to prepare for accession and the resources available to help them do so. The National Programme for the Adoption of the Acquis is the candidate country's timetable for preparing its accession. It estimates the timing and cost of the steps needed to prepare the country for membership and the implications for staff and financial resources. Objectives # Strengthen public administrations and institutions to function effectively inside the European Union. # Promote convergence with the European Union‚Äôs extensive legislation (the Community acquis) and reduce the need for transition periods. # Promote Economic and Social Cohesion. These orientations were further refined in 1999 with the creation of SAPARD and ISPA, which took over rural and agricultural development (SAPARD) and infrastructural projects in the environmental and transport fields (ISPA) allowing Phare to focus on its key priorities that were not covered by these fields. Given that all 10 countries which previously were eligible for the Phare programme are already Member States of the European Union, substantial changes are being made to the scope of the Phare programme. 2003 was the final programming year for the new Member States, but contracting of projects continued until 2005 and payments based on these contracts continued until 2006. However, given the phasing out of Delegations in the new Member States and their replacement by smaller Representations, from May 2004 the new Member States had to take over the full responsibility for the management of the Phare programme through a process of Extended Decentralisation.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves and the Detroit Tigers. Career =High school= McBride attended Screven County High School in Sylvania, Georgia, and made his mark as a power pitcher with a fastball in the low 90s. As a high school junior he led the all-state Team Georgia to victory in the annual Sunbelt Classic and was named the tournament's most valuable player (MVP). In his final season (2001) McBride went 11‚Äì2 and notched 161 strikeouts. The Augusta Chronicle named McBride to its all-area team every year, and considered McBride \\"one of the state's most dominant pitchers.\\" Although McBride initially committed to the University of Georgia, which had offered him a baseball scholarship, in the end he entered the amateur draft and was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the first round, 24th pick overall. =Atlanta Braves= The Braves gave McBride a $1.34 million signing bonus and assigned him to the Gulf Coast Braves, their Rookie-level minor league affiliate. McBride worked primarily as a starter in the Gulf Coast League, going 4‚Äì4 with a 3.76 ERA and averaging nearly 11 strikeouts per nine innings. In 2002, Atlanta promoted McBride to the Single-A Macon Braves, where went 12‚Äì8 and led the South Atlantic League with a 2.12 ERA. Promoted again in 2003 to the High-A Myrtle Beach Pelicans, McBride went 9‚Äì8 with a 2.95 ERA. McBride made the jump from Single to Double-A ball in 2004 when he joined the Greenville Braves. He struggled in Greenville, posting a 1‚Äì7 record with a 4.46 ERA. Among his teammates that year were former Tigers pitcher Brian Moehler and future Tigers/Mud Hens teammate Zach Miner. McBride followed the Braves to Mississippi in 2005 as the franchise relocated and showed improvement, going 3‚Äì1 with a 3.65 ERA over six appearances. Atlanta promoted him to the Triple-A Richmond Braves, where he compiled a 1‚Äì5 record with a 4.33 ERA, almost wholly in relief. Lefties only hit .172 against him while he played for Richmond. McBride was recalled from Triple-A on July 21, 2005 after the Braves traded Kevin Gryboski to the Texas Rangers. He made his major league debut on July 22 and pitched 14 innings for the Braves in 23 games, with a 5.79 earned run average and 22 strikeouts in his rookie campaign. McBride rejoined Atlanta for the 2005 National League Division Series, pitching an inning of scoreless relief in Game 1 against the Houston Astros. McBride completed his first full season in the majors in 2006, finishing with a 4‚Äì1 record and a 3.65 ERA in 71 appearances. He recorded his lone save of the season on May 21, 2006 against the Arizona Diamondbacks. At the start of the 2007 season McBride struggled with his control was consequently optioned to Richmond to work on his control problems. Atlanta recalled McBride in mid-May, and he put together a 1‚Äì0 record with a 3.60 ERA before the being traded to the Detroit Tigers on June 20 for pitcher Wilfredo Ledezma. McBride, a native of Georgia, expressed disappointment: \\"I don't feel anything right now.... Growing up watching the Braves, I wanted to be part of a team that wins here. But these guys [Tigers] are pretty good, too.\\" As it happened, the Tigers were coming to town for an interleague series, so McBride simply moved his belongings from the home clubhouse to the visitors' clubhouse. = Detroit Tigers = The Tigers put McBride to work in the bullpen, where he went 0‚Äì1 with a 6.12 ERA before the Tigers optioned him to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens in mid-August. In the off- season McBride announced that a broken bone in his elbow had hampered his efforts. On April 6, 2008, McBride went back on the disabled list at Toledo with \\"soreness in his throwing elbow.\\" =Lancaster Barnstormers= McBride signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for the 2010 season in which he only appeared in one game.

History The covert members were trained in Jordan in target identification, explosives and small arms at two secret bases. Weapons and equipment (including old Soviet Hind helicopters) were supplied by the CIA. Most members were recruited from the Iraqi exile community by Iraqi Kurds. The original mission of the Scorpions was to foment rebellion in Iraq prior to the US led invasion. However, due to training delays, little of this mission was ever achieved. Following the war, the CIA began using the Scorpions in anti-insurgency roles, and for interrogations of prisoners. The Scorpions have been implicated in the events that led to the death of Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abed Hamed Mowhoush while in US captivity. These events included the use of physical and psychological torture under the auspices of a US CIA operative identified only as \\"Brian\\". That the Scorpions original mission was to start, or give the appearance of a rebellion against the regime of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party, makes their involvement in the death of Mowoush significant.

The name was coined by Major General Henning von Tresckow in 1941. He believed that because of Hitler's many successes up to that time, his personal charisma, and the oath of personal loyalty to him sworn by all German army officers, it would be impossible to overthrow Hitler and the Nazis with Hitler still alive. Hitler's death, however, would be a \\"spark\\"‚Äîa signal that it was time to launch an internal coup d'√©tat to overthrow the Nazi regime and end the war. By early 1943, the failure to overcome the Soviet Union, including the disastrous defeat at Stalingrad, defeats in North Africa, and increasing Allied bombing of Germany had substantially weakened many Germans' allegiance to the Nazi regime. The conspirators decided it was time for the \\"spark\\". General Friedrich Olbricht, who controlled the Ersatzheer (Replacement Army) set up a plan for Replacement Army troops to seize control of Germany after Hitler was killed. Tresckow was now serving as Chief Operations Officer of Army Group Centre (AGC) on the Eastern Front. AGC commander G√ºnther von Kluge knew of Tresckow's activities, but did not denounce him to the Gestapo, nor participate himself. He allowed Tresckow to put several other anti-Nazi officers on the AGC staff, but he also tried to dissuade Tresckow from taking action.  Major collaborators  * Major General Henning von Tresckow, Chief Operations Officer of AGC * Lieutenant Fabian von Schlabrendorff, Tresckow's Special Operations Officer at AGC * Colonel Rudolph-Christoph von Gersdorff, Tresckow's Abwehr Intelligence Liaison Officer * Major Georg von Boeselager, commander of cavalry forces near AGC headquarters * Captain Axel Freiherr von dem Bussche-Streithorst * Captain Eberhard von Breitenbuch * Lieutenant Colonel Werner Schrader * General Friedrich Olbricht, Chief of the Armed Forces Replacement Office (Wehrersatzamt)  Attempts at Army Group Centre  Hitler flew to Werwolf, his \\"field headquarters\\" near Vinnitsa in Ukraine, on 19 February 1943, staying until 13 March. He decided that before returning to Germany, he would also visit AGC headquarters near Smolensk that same day. He would meet with Kluge, and dine in the officers' mess before departing. This was the first opportunity for his assassination by Tresckow's group. For such an occasion, Tresckow had prepared three options: * Major von Boeselager had formed a cavalry \\"honor guard\\" unit secretly packed with anti-Nazi officers. With this force he could intercept Hitler in the forest between the airfield and the HQ area, overwhelm Hitler's SS escort in a fair fight, and kill the F√ºhrer. This option was rejected because even the plotters disliked the prospect of German soldiers fighting each other, and because the attack could fail if the escort was stronger than expected. * The plotters could shoot Hitler during dinner in the mess. This option was also abandoned for many of the plotters abhorred the idea of shooting an unarmed man and would not go along. * A timebomb could be smuggled on Hitler's plane. This was the plan ultimately attempted. The bomb was adapted from a British plastic explosive, which had been seized by the Abwehr from captured SOE agents. The pencil detonator consisted of a thin copper tube containing copper chloride that would take about ten minutes to silently eat through wire holding back the spring-loaded firing pin from the percussion cap. This mechanism provided a time delay for detonation, without any telltale ticking of a clockwork mechanism or smell from a burning fuse. The bomb was disguised as a box supposedly containing two bottles of Cointreau. Tresckow was acquainted with Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Brandt, an officer on Hitler's staff, who traveled on Hitler's plane. Tresckow asked Brandt to take the parcel with him to Germany for delivery to Tresckow's friend General Helmuth Stieff. (Stieff was anti- Nazi, but not then part of the fiasco.) Tresckow claimed the liquor was the payoff for a bet he had lost to Stieff.Alliance of Enemies: The Untold Story of the Secret American and German Collaboration to End World War II By Agostino von Hassell, Sigrid MacRae, Thomas Dunne Books, Dec 2013 Tresckow's aide, Schlabrendorff, carried the parcel to the airfield. As Hitler and his entourage prepared to board his plane, Schlabrendorff secretly activated the detonator with a pair of pliers, then re-closed the parcel and handed it to Brandt as he boarded the plane. The bomb was expected to explode about half an hour later, with the plane near Minsk, close enough to the front for the plane's loss to be attributed to Soviet fighters. When the crash and Hitler's death were reported, General Olbricht would use the Replacement Army to seize control in Berlin, Vienna, and Munich, and in the centers of the Wehrkreis (the German military supply system). It was an ambitious but credible plan, and might possibly have worked if Hitler had indeed been killed, although persuading Army units to fight and overcome possible fierce resistance from the SS could have been a major obstacle. However, as with Elser‚Äôs bomb in 1939 and all other attempts, luck favoured Hitler, which he attributed to Vorsehung (\\"Providence\\"). The British-made detonator had been tested many times and was considered reliable. It operated correctly, but the bomb did not explode. The percussion cap apparently became too cold as the parcel was carried in the unheated cargo hold. Displaying great sangfroid, Schlabrendorff took the next plane to retrieve the package from Lt. Colonel Brandt before the bomb was discovered or eventually detonated late. The explosives were later used by Gersdorff and Stauffenberg.  Later attempts  = Suicide bomb at museum = Army Group Center provided a collection of captured Soviet Army weapons to be displayed at a military museum in Berlin. The display was to open on 21 March 1943, with a personal viewing by Hitler. Colonel Gersdorff volunteered to be a human time bomb. He would carry the explosives inside his army coat. The museum was unheated, so his wearing a long coat would not seem suspicious. A few minutes before Hitler arrived, he would start the ten-minute fuses on the explosives. Just before the bombs would go off, he would rush to Hitler and embrace him; the explosion would kill both men. Despite the plan, at the last minute just before Hitler was to appear, his visit was reduced to just eight minutes as a security precaution, and he breezed through in just two minutes, leaving well before Gersdorff's explosives would have gone off. Gersdorff barely managed to get out and defuse the bombs. = The winter uniform suicide bomb = Standard German army uniforms had proven inadequate for the harsh conditions of the Russian winter, thus the Army had a new winter uniform designed. A viewing of the new uniform by Hitler was arranged. The uniform was also to be adopted by the Waffen-SS and the Luftwaffe Field Divisions, so SS chief Heinrich Himmler and Luftwaffe commander Hermann G√∂ring were expected to be present as well. This made for a great opportunity: the three most important and powerful Nazis could all be finished. After several misfires (due to a rescheduling made by one of the three men), the viewing was scheduled for 16 November 1943. The model was to be Axel von dem Bussche, who volunteered to carry a landmine in the knapsack of the uniform, and detonate it when the three Nazi leaders were gathered around him. Nonetheless, the freight car containing the new uniforms was destroyed in an Allied air raid the night before the scheduled demonstration. The viewing was rescheduled, but again delayed by schedule conflicts among the \\"Big Three\\" Nazis until February. Meanwhile, von dem Bussche had to return to front-line duty, and was badly wounded, losing part of one leg, so he could no longer serve as model. Captain Ewald von Kleist volunteered to replace von dem Bussche, and attempt a similar suicide bombing at a viewing scheduled for 11 February 1944; yet this event was repeatedly postponed and eventually cancelled. = Shooting attack = Captain von Breitenbuch was on the staff of Field Marshal Busch, now commanding Army Group Centre. In early 1944, Busch and his staff were summoned to brief Hitler. Breitenbuch volunteered to carry a 7.65mm Browning pistol concealed in his trouser pocket into the briefing (which took place on 11 March), and shoot Hitler. But on the day of the briefing, Hitler issued a F√ºhrer directive excluding junior officers from F√ºhrer briefings. = Water tower bomb = Two army conspirators smuggled a bomb into the Wolf's Lair and lowered it into a water tower. But the bomb mysteriously exploded a few weeks later, jolting the SS guards. SS Chief Himmler immediately launched an inquiry into the incident which was deliberately blocked by Lieutenant Colonel Werner Schrader‚Äìthe investigative officer in charge and, as it turned out, a fellow conspirator.

In the 1950s the estate was bought by a local businessman as a caravan park. During the 1970s, under new ownership, the estate became a holiday park, with 45 of the 200 acres ( of the ) dedicated to lodges, bungalows and cottages. Local charities The local social enterprise, Antur Waunfawr, which was created by R. Gwynn Davies, in 1984, among its many initiatives, has three sites, with the site at housing the organisation's head office. This site has proved to be a popular attraction for local people and tourists alike, as it includes a seven-acre nature park, gardens, caf√©, a crafts shop and a children's play area. provides work and training opportunities to adults with learning difficulties, and operates a green agenda, with their other sites ( and on the Industrial Estate in ) recycling everything from cardboard to curtains. Historical landmarks The Marconi Company built a large high- powered longwave wireless telegraph transmitting station on the hilltop above the village in 1914 which worked in association with its receiving station at . The station initiated commercial transatlantic wireless service from London to New York City in 1920. It replaced Marconi's transatlantic wireless service from Clifden, Ireland to Canada, after the Clifden station was destroyed in the Irish Civil War in 1922. The building was until recently used as a climbing centre called Beacon Climbing, which has since relocated to Caernarfon town. There are many recreational facilities available in , from playing snooker to playing football on the all-weather pitch. There is also a youth club and a junior football club. The village has its own school teaching local children up to the age of 11, called Ysgol Waunfawr . The village has a number of interesting church buildings, some of them dating back over 150 years and possessing classic forms of masonry and architecture.

It was founded in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1964, by three friends, and has since endured three ownership changes.  Growth  The first Blimpie store opened on May 16, 1964, in Hoboken, New Jersey. By mid-2002, there were about 2,000 Blimpie outlets in operation, located in 47 states and in 15 other countries. Blimpie does not own many stores corporately, but relies on revenue from franchises. In addition to traditional free-standing locations, Blimpie can also be found in a variety of non-traditional sites, such as inside convenience stores, gasoline station food marts, schools, office complexes, hospitals, and sports arenas. The number of Blimpie locations declined by over 60% through 2011. A key area of growth is in the development or acquisition of other brands. In 1999, the company launched Pasta Central, a franchised chain within the \\"home meal replacement\\" category featuring Italian-style pasta and pizza; the concept was exclusively a vehicle for co-branded Blimpie/Pasta Central outlets. Two years earlier, Blimpie International acquired majority control of Maui Tacos, a Mexican quick-service restaurant chain. Along with Maui Tacos came its offshoot founded in 1998, Smoothie Island. History =1960s through mid-1970s= The first Blimpie sub shop opened on May 16, 1964, in Hoboken by Tony Conza, Peter DeCarlo, and Angelo Baldassare, former high school friends and classmates at Saint Peter's Prep in Jersey City. Inspired by the successful Point Pleasant operation Mike's Submarines (later Jersey Mike's Subs), the three speculated that a similar restaurant would do well in Hoboken. The store's name came about because Tony Conza preferred not to call the sandwiches subs, which he felt sounded like a greasy spoon. Conza preferred the term hoagies, but Hoboken residents were unfamiliar with the Philadelphia term. He scanned a dictionary until he found \\"Blimp\\", a word that sounded to him most like a sandwich.Kleinfield, N.R. (December 13, 1987).\\"Trying to Build a Bigger Blimpie\\". The New York Times. Accessed June 29, 2010. The original Blimpie store was a hit, and, before long, customers began asking about franchises. The first franchise was sold to a friend in western New York for $600 during the company's first year of operation. In 1965 Baldassare left the company and Conza and DeCarlo expanded into New York City with a store on 55th Street in Manhattan. By 1967 there were 10 Blimpie restaurants in the chain, four of which were owned by the founders. Despite the chain's growth and good sales volume, profits were difficult to make, and the partners sold the four stores they owned and began to concentrate primarily on franchising. By the mid-1970s, Conza wanted to introduce Blimpie subs to the South. DeCarlo, however, was against the move. This disagreement led to a split between the two. In 1976 Blimpie was divided into two entities, with both retaining rights to the Blimpie trademark. DeCarlo became head of a new, completely independent company, Metropolitan Blimpie (later Blimpie's of New York, Inc.), which controlled franchising rights in New York, New Jersey, and other parts of the East Coast. Conza retained control of the original company, which was incorporated in 1977 as International Blimpie Corporation. Conza remained chairman and chief executive officer of Blimpie through January 2002. =Late 1970s through 1989= During the late 1970s, Conza sold franchises anywhere he found an interest. Blimpie began selling franchises both for individual stores and for territories. Many of these new franchises were rather isolated from the rest of the chain, and some benefits of franchise arrangements had little effect in those locations. Although the chain was growing rapidly, several of the newer stores failed. By 1983, International Blimpie's annual revenues were approaching $1 million, and Blimpie's franchises totaled 150. Conza took the company public that year, with an initial over-the-counter offering of 90 cents per share. Conza felt that there was little potential in submarine sandwiches, and in 1984 opened Border Caf√©, a tablecloth restaurant serving southwestern cuisine on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Although the Border Caf√© did reasonably well at first, this shift in focus did not do the company much good. While Conza was turning his attention away from subs, competitor Subway, which was founded a year after the first Blimpie's was opened, was beginning an expansion drive that pushed it far ahead of Blimpie as the world's foremost submarine sandwich chain.Keegan, Peter O. (September 5, 1994). \\"Under New VP, Blimpie Int'l. Eyes Nontraditional Growth\\". Nation's Restaurant News. p. 7. After the Border Caf√©'s initial success, Conza opened two more of them in 1986, one in Woodstock, New York, and the other on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. However, the Border Caf√© idea was a money loser. Despite $4.5 million in revenues for 1987 (its largest total yet), the company showed a net loss of $347,800 for the year. That year, only 30 new Blimpie restaurants were opened, and company stock was in free fall, bottoming out as low as 15 cents per share. Conza's interest in his core business began to return. Over the next couple of years, Atlanta became the company's biggest target for new Blimpie's franchises. In 1987, the company celebrated the opening of the 50th Blimpie's store in the Atlanta area by giving away 25,000 free sandwiches to customers there. By 1988 Conza realized where his focus was, and he exited the Tex-Mex business. Seeing the tremendous success of Subway, Conza redoubled his efforts in the sandwich arena. He began to address the Blimpie problem with a more systematic approach than he had used before. The first step in Conza's revitalization program was to identify four fundamental problems plaguing the business: a lack of goals, poor use of financial resources, low employee morale, and procrastination. He then assembled a group of managers and drew up a list of \\"101 Small Improvements\\". Delegating to his senior staff much of the day-to-day managing he had always done himself, Conza went on the road in an attempt to open up the long-closed channels of communication between Blimpie and its franchisees. Next, Blimpie launched a quality-control program aimed at cleaning up its 140 New York restaurants, which had long been subpar.\\"Blimpie's Starts Quality Drive in Manhattan\\". Nation's Restaurant News. April 4, 1988. p. 63. At the same time, Conza continued in his efforts to improve relations with franchisees, many of whom had become disgruntled over the last decade. In addition to visiting dozens of cities to meet restaurant owners, Conza formed a franchisee advisory council to keep him apprised of important issues, launched a newsletter called No Baloney News and a toll-free hotline to get important information to franchisees, and gave franchisees more control over advertising through the formation of regional advertising co-ops. In 1989 Blimpie began testing a new low-calorie menu. It was called Blimpie Lite, and included a variety of tuna, crab, chicken, and turkey-based items, in both salad and pita-bread sandwich form. The following year, the company launched another test: gourmet salads sold under the name 'Blimpie Fresherie'. Blimpie began tinkering with its prototype restaurant design around this time, incorporating the company's signature lime-green and yellow colors into an updated look for new outlets. By 1990 Blimpie had recovered, with system wide sales reaching $120 million per year. =1990 to present = The Blimpie chain continued to grow steadily through the early 1990s. Much of this growth was fueled by the company's area developer program, in which franchise rights were sold for an entire area to a developer, who then subfranchised those rights to individual operators. The company continued testing new products throughout this period. In 1991 Blimpie unveiled its 'Quick Bite' menu. The company also began testing pizza at a handful of locations in an effort to expand its dinner business. Conza's attempts to improve franchisee relations continued as well, which included a franchisee convention, the first in 1991. By the beginning of 1992, there were Blimpie restaurants in 27 states. That year, the chain passed the 500-unit mark and the company changed its name to Blimpie International, Inc. In the spring of 1993, Blimpie began trading its stock on the NASDAQ exchange.Howard, Theresa (February 22, 1993). \\"Now on Deck for Blimpie: NASDAQ, New Ad Campaign\\". Nation's Restaurant News. p. 16. Around that time, the company began to more aggressively advertise than it had in the past, doubling its marketing budget to about $2 million per year. A new advertising campaign was launched, including television, radio, print, and point-of-purchase. This campaign marked the introduction of the chain's new tag line: \\"Simply Blimpie for fresh-sliced subs.\\" Some television spots featured people on the street struggling to repeat the tongue-twisting phrase, \\"Simply Blimpie.\\"Grimm, Matthew (September 2, 1991). \\"Blimpie Plans Winter Image Push\\". Adweek's Marketing Week. p. 7. Blimpie system sales reached $132 million by 1993, and Blimpie International earned $1 million on $12 million in revenue. By autumn of that year, the chain had 670 outlets. Improved marketing support from the parent company reduced the rate of franchise failures from 10 percent to 3 percent. In some cases, such as in the Chicago market, Conza allowed franchisees to divert their 6 percent annual franchise fee to advertising.Touby, Laurel (March 22, 1993). \\"Blimpie Is Trying to Be a Hero to Franchisees Again\\". Business Week. p. 70. As the 1990s continued, Blimpie devised a new concept that aimed to grow the company even more. Blimpie's franchises began appearing in nontraditional locations. First was convenience stores; as convenience store proprietors began to seek ways to compensate for declining cigarette sales, they turned to fast food. Blimpie's was appealing for many, mainly for two reasons: a real kitchen was not required, and startup costs were relatively low (as little as $35,000) compared with other fast-food operations. Among the early nontraditional sites for Blimpie's outlets were the Des Moines, Iowa-based Kum & Go convenience store chain, Texaco Food Marts in Mississippi, and the food court at the University of Texas. Blimpie's also became part of the first Home Depot superstore restaurant section, located in Atlanta.Rigg, Cynthia (October 11, 1993). \\"Blimpie's Cuts Mustard with Convenience Stores\\". Crain's New York Business. p. 3. In 1994, the company launched several new concepts to further its drive for nontraditional venues. The \\"Blimpie kiosk\\" was a movable, condensed restaurant that could fit into a area. The kiosk, which could serve four types of sandwiches, drinks, and side orders, was designed for use at stadiums, fairs, and other events. Other new concepts included a special refrigerated case for convenience stores (an expanding market), and the 'Blimpie Bakery', offering a variety of baked goods aimed at boosting early morning business.Richman, Louis S. (February 21, 1994). \\"Rekindling the Entrepreneurial Fire\\". Fortune. p. 112. Blimpie reached two major milestones in 1995. One was that the chain passed the 1,000-outlet mark that year. Blimpie International opened its first international location in Stockholm, Sweden.O'Dwyer, Gerard (December 11, 1995). \\"Blimpie Develops a Swede Tooth\\". Crain's New York Business. p. 17. As the 1990s continued, the company looked for more new ways to sell Blimpie sandwiches, including vending machines, outlets in supermarkets, and new types of carts and other mobile product-delivery systems. With the opening of new outlets in the US slowing and with overseas growth occurring at a slow pace (there were only 61 overseas locations in 15 countries by 2001), Blimpie launched a new diversification effort in the late 1990s. The first such initiative came late in 1997 when the company acquired a 75 percent stake in Maui Tacos, a fast-food chain with six units in Hawaii. This concept featured traditional quick-service Mexican food, such as burritos, tacos, and quesadillas, but with a Hawaiian twist, such as meat marinated in pineapple, lime, and other Hawaiian flavorings. Under Blimpie's majority ownership, Maui Tacos was soon introduced to the mainland, and by 2001 there were 15 units in nine states and the District of Columbia.Hamstra, Mark (November 10, 1997). \\"Blimpie Goes Hawaiian, Buys Mexican Chain\\". Nation's Restaurant News. pp. 1, 143. After almost two years of in-house development, Blimpie launched Pasta Central in 1999. Unlike Maui Tacos, Pasta Central was not a standalone concept but was created as a co- branding vehicle, coupled with Blimpie Subs & Salads. Co-branding emerged as a growth vehicle in the late 1990s and involved the placement of two (or more) restaurant brands within a single unit.Zuber, Amy (April 19, 1999). \\"Blimpie Eyes Higher-End QSR, Opens Pasta Central\\". Nation's Restaurant News. pp. 1, 6. A third new concept was 'Smoothie Island', which was launched through Maui Tacos in 1998. Smoothie Island's menu featured beverages blended with frozen yogurt and fruit. In addition to opening standalone units, including airports, health clubs, and grocery stores, Blimpie also planned to co-brand Smoothie Island with both the Maui Tacos and Blimpie concepts‚Äîboth in dual-branding and tri-branding formats. By mid-2001 there were 80 Smoothie Island units located in the United States, Puerto Rico, and four other countries. Blimpie's logo from 2005 until 2009; it is a refresh of their 1970-2005 logo. However, by the turn of the 2000s, Blimpie International was struggling. Net income had fallen steadily throughout the second half of the 1990s. A main factor in this decline was that the subfranchiser rights to the Blimpie Subs chain had largely been sold by the mid-1990s, thus bringing a halt to what had been a steady stream of income. As Blimpie's struggles continued, investors showed little interest in the company, and the price of the company's stock sagged. Seeing little benefit in being a publicly traded firm, Blimpie joined the growing ranks of restaurant companies fleeing the public market. In October 2001 a private investor group led by Jeffrey K. Endervelt, owner of the 44-unit Blimpie of California subfranchise, agreed to buy Blimpie International for $25.7 million. The transaction was completed in January 2002, whereupon Endervelt took over as chairman, president, and chief executive officer, and Conza, a partner in the investor group, remained in an advisory capacity. In 2006, Kahala Corp. acquired Blimpie, and it became the tenth brand franchised by the franchisor. By 2011 the number of Blimpie locations had fallen to 739 stores, and revenue was down to just over $110 million. In 2013, a controlling interest in Kahala Corp. was purchased by the Serruya Family of Canada. The Serruyas own and founded Yogen Fruz, a chain with 1400 stores around the world. At that time, Michael Serruya became chairman and CEO of Kahala Corp. The company name was changed from Kahala Corp to Kahala Brands to better align the focus of the business. In 2016, MTY Food Group Inc. struck a friendly deal valued at more than $300-million (U.S.) to acquire Arizona-based Kahala Brands Ltd. and its 2,900 locations in 25 countries. The first Blimpie store which was opened in Hoboken, New Jersey, was closed in September 2017. It was bought by the owner of Shaka Bowl, another popular restaurant in Hoboken.  In popular culture  Blimpie has been referenced several times in media, but, most notably, was a recurring joke on the TV sitcom 30 Rock. One of the characters, Lutz, was a fan of the restaurant, and often picked it on the days in which he chose lunches, much to the other writers' dismay.

A former fishing village, it was one of the first towns on Bali to see substantial tourist development, and as a beach resort remains one of Indonesia's major tourist destinations. It is known internationally for its long sandy beach, varied accommodation, many restaurants and bars, and many renowned surfers who visit from Australia. It is located near Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport. The Balinese Provincial Government have taken the view that the preservation of the Balinese culture, natural resources and wildlife are of primary importance in the development of the island. To this end they have limited tourist development to the peninsula on the extreme southern aspect of the island; Kuta beach is on the western side of this peninsula and Sanur is on the east. To the north of the peninsula no new tourist development is supposedly permitted. To the south, Kuta Beach extends beyond the airport into Jimbaran. Other nearby towns and villages include Seseh (6.4 nm), Denpasar (4.5 nm), Ujung (1.8 nm), Pesanggaran (2.0 nm), Kedonganan (2.9 nm), and Tuban (1.0 nm). Administration Badung Regency includes three districts with the name of Kuta: * Kuta District (Kecamatan Kuta), which covers the villages of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak, Kedonganan, and Tuban. Kuta, Legian and Seminyak form a conurbation along the western side of the isthmus linking the Nusa Dua peninsula to the rest of Bali. * South Kuta District (Kecamatan Kuta Selatan; includes Jimbaran and the whole of the Nusa Dua peninsula). * North Kuta District (Kecamatan Kuta Utara; includes villages of Kerobokan Kelod, Kerobokan, Kerobokan Kaja, Tibubeneng, Canggu, and Dalung). Map of Kuta Kuta is now the center of an extensive tourist-oriented urban area that merges into the neighboring towns. Legian, to the north, is the commercial hub of Kuta and the site of many restaurants and entertainment spots. Most of the area's big beachfront hotels are in the southern section of Tuban. Legian and Seminyak are northern extensions of Kuta along Jl. Legian and Jl. Basangkasa. They are somewhat quieter suburbs with cottage-style accommodations, where many of the expat crowd live. Also to the north are Petitenget, Berawa, Canggu, and Seseh ‚Äî new and quieter continuations of Kuta's beach. They are easy to reach through Abian Timbul or Denpasar and Kerobokan. Several large hotels are located in this area: the Oberoi Bali, Hard Rock Hotel Bali, the Intan Bali Village, the Legian Bali in Petitenget, the Dewata Beach, and the Bali Sani Suites in Berawa. Bali bombing memorial The Bali bombing memorial After the first Bali Bombing in 2002 at Kuta, which killed 202 people including 88 Australians, a permanent memorial was built on the site of the destroyed Paddy's Pub on Legian Street. (A new bar, named \\"Paddy's: Reloaded\\", was reopened further along Legian Street.) The memorial is made of intricately carved stone, set with a large marble plaque, which bears the names and nationalities of each of those killed. It is flanked by the national flags of the victims. The monument is well-maintained and illuminated at night. The memorial was dedicated on 12 October 2004, the second anniversary of the attack. The dedication included a Balinese Hindu ceremony and the opportunity for mourners to lay flowers and other offerings. The Australian ambassador and Indonesian officials attended the ceremony as most of the victims were Australians. Kuta Beach The beach has been notable since the early 1970s. Kuta beach is also known as Sunset Beach, as opposed to the Sunrise Beach, another name for Sanur Beach. Luxury resorts, restaurants, and clubs are located along the beach. In 2011, a two-meter white sandstone fence, built in a Balinese architecture style, was built along the road to block the sand from blowing to the cafes and restaurants. The project costed Rp.4 billion ($0.47 million). Some tourists dislike it as it is considered to be blocking the beach view, while others believe the wall helps dampen the sounds from the congested traffic on the adjacent street.http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/03/kuta-wall-‚Äòruins-beach- view‚Äô.html To make the beach cleaner, as of late August 2011, the vendors are prohibited from selling food on the beach, but they are still allowed to sell beverages and souvenirs.

His main ethnographic work described the culture of the Vedda people of Sri Lanka and the Shilluk people of the Sudan. He was a Professor at London School of Economics and was highly influential as the teacher of such notable anthropologists as Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski, E. E. Evans-Pritchard and Meyer Fortes all of whose work overshadowed his own. He was a proponent of the Hamitic hypothesis, according to which, some civilizations of Africa were thought to have been founded by Caucasoid Hamitic peoples.Wilson Jeremiah Moses. 1998.

Cambridge University Press, p. 86 Since the 1960s the Hamitic hypothesis, along with other theories of \\"race science\\", has become entirely discredited in science. Life Seligman was born into a middle class Jewish family in London, the son of wine merchant Hermann Seligmann (Charles shortened his name to Seligman after 1914). He studied medicine at St Thomas' Hospital. After several years as a physician and pathologist, he volunteered his services to the 1898 Cambridge University expedition to the Torres Strait. He later joined expeditions to New Guinea (1904), Ceylon (1906‚Äì1908), and Sudan (1909‚Äì1912, again in 1921‚Äì1922). In 1905, Seligman married Brenda Zara Salaman, who he accompanied on their many expeditions and whom he credited in his publications. She was educated at Bedford College and was skilled at languages and she was able to observe ceremonies that Charles was not allowed to see. From 1913 to 1934, he served as chair of Ethnology at the London School of Economics, where the Anthropology department maintains the Seligman Library in his name. From 1933 he edited the Cresset Historical Series, a book series published by the Cresset Press in London.Cresset Historical Series. Edited by Professor C.G. Seligman., worldcat.org. Retrieved 14 March 2020. Seligman was also a Fellow of the Royal Society. Works =Hamites= Seligman is most remembered for his detailed ethnographical work Races of Africa (1930), which recognises four major distinct races of the African continent: Bushmanoids (Bushmen), Pygmies, Negroids, and Caucasoids (Hamites). The Hottentots, Seligman maintains are a mixture of Bushmanoid, Negroid and Hamitic.The Races of Africa, Oxford University Press, 1957, 3rd Ed. p. 23. As a staunch proponent of the Hamitic theory, in his work Seligman asserts that Hamitic Caucasoid North and Northeast Africans were responsible for introducing non- Semitic Afro-Asiatic languages (Berber-Cushitic-Egyptian) into Africa, as well as civilization, technology and all significant cultural developments. In his book, Seligman states his belief that: > \\"Apart from relatively late Semitic influence...the civilizations of Africa > are the civilizations of the Hamites, its history is the record of these > peoples and of their interaction with the two other African stocks, the > Negro and the Bushmen, whether this influence was exerted by highly > civilized Egyptians or by such wider pastoralists as are represented at the > present day by the Beja and Somali....The incoming Hamites were pastoral > Caucasians ‚Äì arriving wave after wave ‚Äì better armed as well as quicker > witted than the dark agricultural Negroes.\\"Edith R. Sanders, \\"The Hamitic > Hypothesis: Its Origin and Functions in Time Perspective,\\" Journal of > African History, 10 (1969), 521‚Äì532C. G. Seligman, The Races of Africa, > London, 1930, p. 96 Following Giuseppe Sergi's (1901) classification of the Hamites, Seligman divides the Hamites into two groups: (a) \\"Eastern Hamites\\" and (b) \\"Northern Hamites\\". The former include the \\"ancient and modern Egyptians... the Beja, the Berberines (Barbara and Nubians), the Galla, the Somali, the Danakil and... Ethiopians\\". The latter branch includes the Berbers and the \\"Taureg and Tibu of the Sahara, the Fulbe of Western Sudan and the extinct Guanche of the Canary Islands\\".The Races of Africa, Oxford University Press, 1957 3rd Ed. p. 87. Seligman acknowledged varying degrees of Negroid admixture amongst the Hamitic groups, but emphasized throughout his major works the essential racial and cultural unity of the various Hamitic peoples. In his Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1913), he writes that the Northern and Eastern Hamitic \\"groups shade into each other, and in many parts a Negro admixture has taken place, nevertheless, culturally if not always physically, either division stands apart from its fellow.\\"C.G. Seligman, \\"Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan\\", The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 43 (Jul. ‚Äì Dec., 1913), pp. 593‚Äì705. The Hamites in general, and the Northern Hamites in particular, he asserted, have close \\"kinship with the European representatives of the Mediterranean race\\".Charles Gabriel Seligman, The Races of Africa, (Oxford University Press, 1967), 4th ed. p.62. Drawing from Coon, Seligman also discusses fairer features observed amongst a minority of Berbers or Northern Hamites, such as lighter skin, golden beards and blue eyes. Races of Africa, however, notably questions the belief held by some anthropologists in the early 20th century that these fairer traits, such as blondism, were introduced by a Nordic variety.The Races of Africa, Oxford University Press, 1957, 3rd Ed. p. 115. In addition, Seligman laid stress on the common descent of Hamites with Semites, writing that \\"there is no doubt that the Hamites and Semites must be regarded as modifications of an original stock, and that their differentiation did not take place so very long ago, evidence for this statement being furnished by the persistence of common cultural traits and linguistic affinities. Physically their relationship is obvious\\". =Races of Africa= Races of Africa (1930) upon publication received positive reviews. It was considered to be the first major published work in English on the ethnography of Africa, widely regarded as an \\"ethnological classic\\".Reviews: R. W.

Races of Africa was also revised four times, Seligman published a second revised edition in 1939, a year before his death: \\"Additions to the original edition published nine years ago include a note on the importance of the Boskop skull‚Ä¶an account of the Pygmies as described by Paul Schebesta and a slight alteration in the classification of the linguistic stocks of the Guinea Coast\\".Review by K.

Of those 17 countries, only 5 fielded teams in all 3 disciplines: France, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia. A total of 97 entries and 126 horses competed. Horses in both the jumping and eventing competitions were required to carry at least . Disciplines =Show jumping= The jumping competition was held over a 1060-meter course with fences up to 1.40 meters and at a speed of 400 m/min. Civilians were allowed to compete, although many teams still had army officers. 34 of the 43 riders finished, but 17 of those had time penalties over the challenging course, which were added at a 1/4 point per second over time. 11 nations competed. =Dressage= 9 nations and 24 riders total competed in the dressage competition. Unlike today, the dressage test had a time limit. For the 1924 Games, the 10.5 minute time allowed was too short and the first few riders garnered point deductions for taking too long, while those that went later cut corners and performed the test as quickly as possible. The test was performed in a 60 m x 20 m arena, as it is today, but the 5 judges all sat together on one of the short sides of the area, rather than being spread out at different points. Dressage required the horses to be ridden in a plain snaffle and split bit. =Eventing= 44 riders from 13 countries competed in the eventing competition, with only 32 finishing. 8 riders were eliminated during the endurance test, 1 during the jumping test, and 3 did not contest the jumping following endurance day. The dressage test was worth 200 points total for the competition; phases A, C, and E of the endurance test were worth 200 points, steeplechase was worth 500 points, and cross-country 700 points; and the jumping test was worth 400 total points.

Chollerton is also a registration sub-district in Northumberland; its population in 1851 was 5024 people.A Vision of Britain Through Time The etymology of the name Chollerton is uncertain; possibly it is from the Old English \\"Ceolferth's tun\\" but more likely it meant \\"tun by Ceolan ford or Ceolford\\", if so \\"Ceolford\\" meant \\"Ceola's ford\\" (i.e. modern Chollerford).Ekwall, E. (1940) The Concise Dictionary of English Place-names; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 101\\"Chollerton\\" is also an older form of Chorlton, Manchester.  Governance  Chollerton is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham.  Transport  Chollerton was served by Chollerton railway station on the Border Counties Railway which linked the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, near Hexham, with the Border Union Railway at Riccarton Junction in Scotland. The first section of the route was opened between Hexham and Chollerford in 1858, the remainder opening in 1862. The line was closed to passengers by British Railways in 1956. The station still stands and is now in use as a private house. Also still standing is a small viaduct over the road into the village.

It is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support. The term is used in many contexts, but is most widely applied in business with respect to a contractual customer base, for example in businesses with a subscriber-based service model such as mobile telephone networks and pay TV operators. The term is also used to refer to participant turnover in peer-to-peer networks. Churn rate is an input into customer lifetime value modeling, and can be part of a simulator used to measure return on marketing investment using marketing mix modeling. Definition =Churn rate of a customer base= Churn rate, when applied to a customer base, refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a supplier during a given time period. It is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, more successful sales and/or marketing by the competition, or reasons having to do with the customer life cycle. Churn is closely related to the concept of average customer life time. For example, an annual churn rate of 25 percent implies an average customer life of four years. An annual churn rate of 33 percent implies an average customer life of three years. The churn rate can be minimized by creating barriers which discourage customers to change suppliers (contractual binding periods, use of proprietary technology, value-added services, unique business models, etc.), or through retention activities such as loyalty programs. It is possible to overstate the churn rate, as when a consumer drops the service but then restarts it within the same year. Thus, a clear distinction needs to be made between \\"gross churn\\", the total number of absolute disconnections, and \\"net churn\\", the overall loss of subscribers or members. The difference between the two measures is the number of new subscribers or members that have joined during the same period. Suppliers may find that if they offer a loss-leader \\"introductory special\\", it can lead to a higher churn rate and subscriber abuse, as some subscribers will sign on, let the service lapse, then sign on again to take continuous advantage of current specials. When talking about subscribers or customers, sometimes the expression \\"survival rate\\" is used to mean 1 minus the churn rate. For example, for a group of subscribers, an annual churn rate of 25 percent is the same as an annual survival rate of 75 percent. Both imply a customer lifetime of four years. I.e., a customer lifetime can be calculated as the inverse of that customer's predicted churn rate. For a group or segment of customers, their customer life (or tenure) is the inverse of their aggregate churn rate. Gompertz distribution models of distribution of customer life times can therefore also predict a distribution of churn rates. For companies with a fast-growing customer base (e.g., digital media companies in a BCG-matrix problem child or star phase), confusion can arise between the statistical analyses associated with what percentage of the whole customer base churns in a given yearWhat percentage of the base of subscribers in all of 2010 churned out?versus a particular customer cohort's churn rate. For example: Taking those customers who subscribed in given month, say January 2010How many had churned out by January 2011? Examining churn for a fast-growing aggregated customer base will understate the true churn rate compared to cohort based approach to the calculation. The cohort based approach will also allow you to calculate the survival rate and the average customer life, whereas the aggregate approach can not calculate these two metrics. The phrase \\"rotational churn\\" is used to describe the phenomenon where a customer churns and immediately rejoins. This is common in prepaid mobile phone services, where existing customers may take up a new subscription from their current provider in order to avail of special offers only available to new customers. In most circumstances churn is seen as indicating that customers are dissatisfied with a service. However, in some industries whose services delivers on a promise, churn is considered as a positive signal, such as the health care services, weight loss services and online dating platforms. =Revenue churn= Revenue churn is the monetary amount of recurring revenue lost in a period divided by the total revenue at the beginning of the period. Revenue churn is commonly used in Software as a Service (SaaS) and other business models that rely on recurring revenue models. =Employee turnover= In some business contexts, churn rate could also refer to employee turnover within a company. For instance, most fast food restaurants have a routinely high churn rate among employees. For larger companies, such as Fortune 500 companies, the attrition rate tends to be much lower compared to a fast food franchise. Company size and industry also play a key role in attrition rate. An \\"acceptable\\" attrition rate for a given company is relative to its industry. It would not be useful to compare the attrition of fast food employees with a Fortune 500 company in a corporate setting. Regardless of industry or company size, attrition rate tends to be highest among the lowest paying jobs, and lowest for the highest paying jobs. Attrition rate has always played a role in how cash flow is affected for employee payroll. For example, if a company has 10,000 employees, and needs to save money on payroll, it may be wise to simply institute a temporary \\"hiring freeze\\" knowing that some people will leave the company through natural attrition, thus saving employee payroll by not replacing or hiring new employees. It could be expected that if the average employee makes $40,000 per year, and the company has 10,000 employees, a natural attrition rate could be between 1‚Äì5 percent depending on the size and industry of the company. A rate of five percent or more for a larger company most often indicates layoffs in addition to natural attrition, early retirement, and firing. =Employee moves/attrition rate= Churn rate can also describe the number of employees that move within a certain period. For example, the annual churn rate would be the total number of moves completed in a 12-month period divided by the average number of occupants during the same 12-month period. Monthly and quarterly churn rates can also be calculated. Attrition rate (%) = (Number of employees resigned during the month / Average number of employees during the month) x 100 where Average number of employees during the month = (Total number of employees at the start of the month + Total number of employees at the end of the month) / 2.

It is designed to support and expand the physical capabilities of its users, particularly people with physical disabilities. There are two primary versions of the system: HAL 3, which only provides leg function, and HAL 5, which is a full-body exoskeleton for the arms, legs, and torso. In 2011, Cyberdyne and Tsukuba University jointly announced that hospital trials of the full HAL suit would begin in 2012, with tests to continue until 2014 or 2015. By October 2012, HAL suits were in use by 130 different medical institutions across Japan. In February 2013, the HAL system became the first powered exoskeleton to receive global safety certification. In August 2013, HAL received EC certification for clinical use in Europe as the world's first non-surgical medical treatment robot. In addition to its medical applications, the HAL exoskeleton has been used in construction and disaster response work. History The first HAL prototype was proposed by Yoshiyuki Sankai, a professor at Tsukuba University. Fascinated with robots since he was in the third grade, Sankai had striven to make a robotic suit in order ‚Äúto support humans.‚Äù In 1989, after receiving his Ph.D. in robotics, he began the development of HAL. Sankai spent three years, from 1990 to 1993, mapping out the neurons that govern leg movement. It took him and his team an additional four years to make a prototype of the hardware. The third HAL prototype, developed in the early 2000s, was attached to a computer. Its battery alone weighed nearly and required two helpers to put on, making it very impractical. By contrast, later HAL-5 model weighs only and has its battery and control computer strapped around the waist of the wearer. Cyberdyne began renting the HAL suit out for medical purposes in 2008. By October 2012, over 300 HAL suits were in use by 130 medical facilities and nursing homes across Japan. The suit is available for institutional rental, in Japan only, for a monthly fee of US$2,000. In December 2012, Cyberdyne was certified ISO 13485 ‚Äì an international quality standard for design and manufacture of medical devices ‚Äì by Underwriters Laboratories. In late February 2013, the HAL suit received a global safety certificate, becoming the first powered exoskeleton to do so. In August 2013, the suit received an EC certificate, permitting its use for medical purposes in Europe as the first medical treatment robot of its kind. Design and mechanics When a person attempts to move their body, nerve signals are sent from the brain to the muscles through the motor neurons, moving the musculoskeletal system. When this happens, small biosignals can be detected on the surface of the skin. The HAL suit registers these signals through a sensor attached to the skin of the wearer. Based on the signals obtained, the power unit moves the joint to support and amplify the wearer's motion. The HAL suit possesses a cybernic control system consisting of both a user-activated ‚Äúvoluntary control system\\" known as Cybernic Voluntary Control (CVC) and a ‚Äúrobotic autonomous control system\\" known as Cybernic Autonomous Control (CAC) for automatic motion support. Users HAL is designed to assist the disabled and elderly in their daily tasks, but can also be used to support workers with physically demanding jobs such as disaster rescue or construction. HAL is mainly used by disabled patients in hospitals, and can be modified so that patients can use it for longer-term rehabilitation. In addition, scientific studies have shown that, in combination with specially- created therapeutic games, powered exoskeletons like the HAL-5 can stimulate cognitive activities and help disabled children walk while playing. Further scientific studies have shown that HAL Therapy can be effectively used for rehabilitation after spinal cord injury or stroke. During the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show, it was announced that the United States government had expressed interest in purchasing HAL suits. In March 2011, Cyberdyne presented a legs-only HAL version for the disabled, health care professionals and factory workers. In November 2011, HAL was selected to be used for cleanup work at the site of the Fukushima nuclear accident. During the Japan Robot Week exhibition in Tokyo in October 2012, a redesigned version of HAL was presented, designed specifically for the Fukushima cleanup. In March 2013, ten Japanese hospitals conducted clinical tests of the newer legs-only HAL system. In late 2014, HAL exoskeletons modified for construction use entered service with the Japanese construction contractor Obayashi Corporation.

Along with the Semyonovsky Regiment, the Preobrazhensky Regiment also served as a gendarmerie unit for the state Secret Chancellery (secret police) in the 18th century, headed by Prince Fyodor Romodanovsky. History It was formed by Peter the Great in the late 17th century from his poteshnye voiska (\\"toy forces\\"), during his military games in the village of Preobrazhenskoye (now a district in Moscow). The Preobrazhensky Regiment distinguished itself during the Great Northern War of 1700‚Äì1721, the Patriotic War of 1812, and the Russo- Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878. As the body-guard of Catherine the Great, as well as the main supporter of her bloodless coup against her husband Peter III, this regiment was declared the highest in the order of military precedence from 14 July 1762. In spite of its distinguished record, part of one battalion of the regiment mutinied in June 1906, at a time of general unrest in the Russian Empire. The mutiny was quickly suppressed and 190 soldiers sentenced to service in disciplinary battalions.Patrick de Gmeline, pages 334-336 \\"La Garde Imperiale Russe 1896-1914\\", publisher Charles-Lavauzelle Paris 1986 The regiment was disbanded in December 1917 by its last commander, Colonel Alexander Kutepov (later a general).

Uniforms Preobrazhnesky Barracks in St. Petersburg Throughout its history the regiment wore the standard uniform of the Infantry of the Imperial Guard, which from 1683 to 1914 was predominantly of a dark green (eventually verging on black) colour. The main distinctions of the Preobrazhensky Regiment were the red facings (plastron, collar, cuffs and shoulder straps) edged in white piping. Distinctive regimental patterns of braid (litzen) were worn on the tunic collar, plus the tsar's monogram on the soldiers' shoulder straps and officers' epaulettes. Following the Russo-Turkish War, the regiment was awarded a small bronze scroll to be worn as a battle-honour on shakos and other headdresses. In 1883, in recogition of its overall distinguished record, officers of the regiment were authorised to wear a large metal gorget inscribed \\"1683-1850-1883\\".

He is also the former owner of the Simtek Formula One team, a former aerodynamicist at March and former technical director at the Benetton, and Virgin Racing teams.  Education and early life Wirth attended Sevenoaks School from 1977 to 1984 and has B.Sc(Hons) in Mechanical Engineering (First Class) from University College London and is the youngest-ever Fellow of the Royal Institution of Mechanical Engineers. March Wirth started his Formula One career as an aerodynamicist for March Engineering, responsible for all aerodynamic concepts, schematics and design of windtunnel model components for the and Leyton House March cars. In addition, he conceived and designed all components of the March active suspension system, which ran successfully in February 1989. Simtek Simtek Research was founded in 1989 by Max Mosley and Nick Wirth. It originally was involved in many areas of Formula One, including wind tunnel construction and chassis building for third parties. Wirth was previously employed by March Team owner Mosley. From October 1993 to June 1995, Wirth was founder, owner, and technical director of Simtek Grand Prix, a Formula One racing team that first appeared in the 1994 Formula One season. Simtek Research provided the team with engineering and design for the cars. The team suffered the blow of the death of Roland Ratzenberger during qualifying for the San Marino Grand Prix. Simtek suffered a difficult first season and eventually pulled out of Formula One during the season which forced Simtek Research into bankruptcy. Benetton and projects outside Formula One From 1996 until 1999 Wirth was chief designer and later a board member of the Benetton Formula One team. In 1999 Wirth founded RoboScience, creators of the RS-01 RoboDog. In 2003 he founded Wirth Research. In 2006 Wirth Research began working for the FIA in the Casumaro windtunnel in Italy on the split rear wing (CDG) design that the FIA proposed for the 2008 F1 season. In 2007 Wirth Research became involved with the Acura LMP programme in the American Le Mans Series and was involved with designing the LMP1 class car for 2009 season. Wirth used computational fluid dynamics extensively to design the LMP1 class car. Virgin Racing In 2009 Wirth Design teamed up with John Booth of Manor Motorsport to create a car for the 2010 Formula One season. Wirth was appointed the technical director of the team. Richard Branson's company Virgin became a title sponsor and the team was renamed Virgin Racing. The car that Wirth designed for use in the 2010 season, the Virgin VR-01, is the first Formula One racing car designed entirely with computational fluid dynamics with no use of traditional wind tunnels during the design or build process. Wirth also designed Virgin's second F1 car, the MVR-02, but its performance proved to be disappointing as it failed to close the gap to the leaders relative to the VR-01. In June 2011, Virgin announced that it had parted company with Wirth and abandoned its policy of only using CFD.

The origin of the family name is Maalouf and is of Lebanese descent via their paternal grandfather. Originally from New Mexico, the family's success began with the distribution rights for Coors Beer in the Southwest region of the US in 1937. The Maloofs were the owners of the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1998 until 2013 and are minority owners of the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League (NHL). Notable family members include George J. Maloof Sr., Adrienne Maloof, and George J. Maloof Jr. Sports The family owned a sports franchise in the Sacramento, California market, the NBA's Sacramento Kings, from 1998 until 2013. In 2013 the family sold the 65% of the team they owned for $347 million to a Sacramento group, led by Vivek Ranadive, which was committed to building a new arena in downtown Sacramento that had previously been rebuked by the Maloofs. The Maloofs had acquired a minority interest in the Kings in 1998 and took majority control the following year, with Joe and Gavin operating the franchise. As part of the purchase of the Kings, they also acquired the team's sister franchise in the WNBA, the Sacramento Monarchs. The Maloofs operated the Monarchs until 2009, when the WNBA was unable to find a new owner and the team folded. Prior to the sale of the team, a previous deal had been reached to sell the Kings to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and investor Chris Hansen, who had hoped to move the team to Seattle. This sale was nullified on May 15, 2013, when the NBA Board of Governors denied the relocation in a vote of 22-8. The Maloof family also briefly owned the Houston Rockets from 1979-1982. The Rockets made the NBA Finals in 1981. The team was sold to Charlie Thomas in 1982. The Maloofs are also the minority owners of the Vegas Golden Knights of the NHL, who made it to the Stanley Cup Finals in their inaugural season. Las Vegas Palms Casino Resort In 1994, the Maloof family opened the Fiesta Rancho hotel-casino in North Las Vegas, and sold it in 2000 for over $185 million. The money was reinvested into the creation of the Palms Casino Resort hotel and casino. The Maloofs sold their beer distribution in an unsuccessful attempt to save the Palms and Palms Towers. In 2011 a restructuring gave private equity firms TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners each a 49% share, leaving the Maloofs with 2% ownership. Maloof Productions The Maloofs have expanded their business ventures into entertainment with the creation of Maloof Productions. Through its television division, Maloof Television, they have produced the reality series Bullrun for Spike TV in 2007, Speed Channel in 2009, and Living Lohan, the E! reality series running in 2008. In 2008 the family was developing Rebuilding the Kingdom with reality television producer Mark Burnett. The film division, Maloof Motion Pictures, produced the 2005 film Feast and as of 2007 was developing The Big Bizarro, starring Pierce Brosnan. Skateboarding Joe Maloof in San Diego promoting the Maloof Money Cup Founded in 2008 by Joe and Gavin Maloof, the Maloof Money Cup is a competition for both professional and amateur skateboarders. The Orange County, US, dates of the contest series include the US Pro Men's and Women's Street Championships, the US Pro Vert Championships, and the Maloof Money Cup AM Championships. A spring New York date and a fall (autumn) South Africa date were added in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In 2012, the Maloofs have focused on the South African event, entitled the Maloof Money Cup World Skateboarding Championships, and canceled the Orange County event due to logistical issues. The Maloof family is also one of the main sponsors of the game Skate 3 offering a slew of different competitions Family members The family consists of George J.

Criticisms The Maloof family, especially Joe and Gavin, were under heavy fire in 2006 when they proposed building a new basketball arena in downtown Sacramento and were able to put a tax increase proposal on the fall election ballots. They wanted the taxpayers to pay for the majority of the arena instead of paying for it themselves. The proposal involved a quarter- cent sales tax hike aimed at raising $1.2 billion over the next 15 years. The city was divided between those who supported it and those who disapproved of it. There were rumors that the Maloofs were threatening to move both the Sacramento Kings and the Sacramento Monarchs to Las Vegas if they did not get a new arena. In November, voters overwhelmingly voted against the proposal. A proposal to build a new arena at Cal Expo (the State Fairgrounds) which would include an upgrade to the fairgrounds as well as retail and housing developments was presented and accepted by the Cal Expo Board of Directors on February 27, 2009 but fell apart soon after, leaving Sacramento without a new arena.http://www.calexpo.com/Html/nba_arena.asp Cal Expo In late 2010, the Maloof family began negotiating with officials in Anaheim, California in an effort to move the Kings franchise to that city, despite repeated assurances that the team would stay in Sacramento. On March 29, 2011, the City of Anaheim approved bond measures aimed at assisting the Kings move. Finally, on May 2, 2011, the NBA put a halt to the move to Anaheim, California because the current bills that were owed to the city of Sacramento, California gave the city just cause to keep them in Sacramento. In June 2011, the Maloof brothers, Joe and Gavin, (along with successful investor Ghassan El Morabit), sold majority share of the Palms to two lending companies (Leonard Green & Partners LP in Los Angeles and TPG Capital in Texas), allowing them to continue building their stadium. Upon the news of a possible relocation, Sacramento Kings launched a grassroots effort with pledges of over $800,000 to go to a new arena. This and other grassroots efforts, along with Mayor Kevin Johnson's presentation to the NBA Board of Governors, convinced the NBA to delay any relocation authorization for one year. Within this one year time frame (deadline: March 2012) a completed arena plan, with funding, must be in place. Plans were approved by the City Council in March 2012 and construction for the Kings' new arena, the Golden 1 Center, began on October 29, 2014 and it was completed prior to the start of the 2016-17 NBA Season. In February 2013, they agreed to sell the Sacramento Kings to a group led by Chris Hansen and Steve Ballmer, who promised to relocate the team to Seattle and rename them the Seattle SuperSonics. Kevin Johnson brought a group together led by Vivek Ranadive to keep the team in Sacramento. The local fan base rallied behind him in an effort to keep the team. The new ownership group was established and a deal struck with the city to build a new arena in downtown Sacramento. On May 15, 2013, the NBA Board of Governors denied the relocation bid, effectively nullifying the sale to the Seattle group. The following day, the Maloofs agreed to sell the team to the Sacramento group. During the months leading up to the sale, the Seattle group raised their offer twice and it was reported that the Maloofs were going to refuse to sell to the Sacramento group. At one point, the Chris Hansen group had offered to buy 20% of the team with the Maloofs retaining their majority ownership, even after the Sacramento group came together with an offer. However, Sacramento continued to work directly with the NBA, and the Maloofs sale to the Sacramento group eventually went through.

He is signed to Impact Wrestling as a member of the creative team and producer. He is best known for his 12-year career in Ring of Honor (ROH), where he is a five-time World Tag Team Champion. He has also worked for WWE as a writer in the past.

Scoville spent nine months performing various tasks, including providing color commentary and acting as the company webmaster. After PWW folded, Scoville began working for the Lakeshore Wrestling Organization (LsWO), and was made a referee on March 6, 1999, substituting for a referee who was on vacation. He began training as a wrestler under veteran Joe \\"El Tejano\\" Ortega, a former student of Jose Lothario and the founder of the LsWO, in Holland, Michigan in March 1999, and wrestled his debut match on May 1, 1999, at the age of fifteen as \\"Jimmy Jacobs\\", losing to Michael Stryker. Scoville completed his training in August 1999 and went on to wrestle for various independent promotions in the Michigan area on the weekends, while attending high school and working as a furniture mover during the week. After graduating, he attended college for three years before deciding to focus on his wrestling career as a full-time job in May 2005. =Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (2002‚Äì2009)= From 2002 to 2005, Jacobs worked for Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA Mid-South). On September 17, 2004, Jacobs defeated Delirious in a ladder match to win the vacant IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship. On December 12, Delirious defeated Jacobs in a rematch to win the title. On April 1, 2005, Jacobs defeated Danny Daniels to win the IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship.

On June 5, 2009, Jason Hades defeated Jacobs for the title. =Ring of Honor= Early appearances and Lacey's Angels (2003‚Äì2007) Jacobs joined Ring of Honor (ROH) in 2003 along with rival Alex Shelley with whom he'd feud against or occasionally team with early on in ROH. After Dan Maff left the company as a result of a fallout with his trainer Homicide, Jacobs formed a tag team with Maff's former partner, B.J. Whitmer. On April 2, 2005, Jacobs and Whitmer defeated Samoa Joe and Jay Lethal for the vacant ROH Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to The Carnage Crew on July 9, 2005, but regained them on July 23. They went on to lose the title again, this time to the team of Sal Rinauro and Tony Mamaluke, on October 1, 2005. steel cage match against B.J. Whitmer. Jacobs and Whitmer continued to team as part of Lacey's Angels managed by Lacey. The team broke apart as Jacobs was more concerned with winning Lacey's affections than winning matches. Jacobs would go on to make music videos for ROH professing his love for Lacey. After Jacobs and Whitmer split, the two began feuding in brutal matches. In one match at the Dragon Gate Challenge on March 30, 2006 Whitmer slipped on the top turnbuckle while attempting a super powerbomb that dropped Jacobs head and neck first on the ropes and edge of the ring. The two continued to wrestle several minutes longer. At In Your Face on June 17, 2006, Whitmer super powerbombed Jacobs into the crowd. Jacobs went on to injure Whitmer at Gut Check on August 26, 2006. It was later revealed in a storyline that Lacey was sleeping with Colt Cabana. Lacey arranged for the two to be a tag team. Cabana left the team because he was annoyed at Lacey, and tried to explain to Jacobs that she was using him. Jacobs seemingly accepted Cabana's explanation, before assaulting him. Whitmer made his way back from injury and continued his issue with Jacobs. When Brent Albright joined Lacey's Angels, their matches soon became tag team matches, where Whitmer and Cabana would face Jacobs and Albright. It later progressed when Daizee Haze joined forces with Whitmer, and Lacey, in turn as the leader of the group, hired an \\"assassin\\", Mercedes Martinez. At The Chicago Spectacular: Night 2, Lacey was injured after Whitmer accidentally struck her in the face with a spike when Jacobs moved out of the way. Jacobs would go on to make his third music video (in which he has been described as being \\"demented\\") expressing his feelings on her disfigurement. On March 31, 2007, in his native town of Detroit, Jacobs battled B.J. Whitmer in what the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter called an instant classic. The two concluded their year-long feud in a steel cage match. Jacobs won the match, but afterwards, it was announced that Jacobs had lost a tooth and torn his Anterior cruciate ligament (an injury he previously sustained), and Whitmer had suffered a neck injury. While Jacobs was injured, ROH decided to continue the Lacey-Jacobs storyline with 4 small vignettes shown on YouTube, detailing a trip that Lacey spent in Chicago with Jacobs; afterward, he accompanied Lacey to the ring for her matches, in which they appeared to have swapped personalities. In August 2007, Jacobs returned to ROH winning three straight matches by defeating Rhett Titus on August 24, Mitch Franklin on August 25 and Chris Hero on September 14. The Age of the Fall (2007‚Äì2009) For months leading into the ROH return to Chicago there were cryptic messages on a blog of a stable entering ROH that was code-named \\"Project 161\\". After making a successful return to ROH, Jacobs, the returning Necro Butcher and the debuting Tyler Black attacked The Briscoe Brothers immediately following their ladder match with Kevin Steen and El Generico, which confirmed that Jacobs was behind Project 161. Jay Briscoe was hung upside from the rigging that was used to hoist the titles from the ladder match and, as Jay's blood dripped onto Jacobs, he announced the beginning of The Age of the Fall. The angle was so controversial that ROH decided to remove the footage from the pay-per-view that was being taped at the event. The footage was heavily requested by ROH fans, however, so it was shown on the ROH Videowire for the week of September 15, and a \\"blood edit\\" of their debut is featured on the DVD of the event, Man Up. Later on in the event, Tyler Black and Jack Evans faced off in a dark match until both Jacobs and Necro Butcher got involved. The Irish Airborne (David and Jake Crist) entered the ring to save Jack Evans, which led to a six-man tag team match between The Age of the Fall and the team of Evans and the Irish Airborne. The match ended a no contest as Necro Butcher attacked the referee. Tyler Black in the ring together at a Pro Wrestling Guerrilla event. The day after their debut, their website revealed that all the blog entries had been written by Tyler Black. In an interview with a German website, Jacobs revealed there would be more people involved. This was incorporated into British promotion 3CW in early November when Jacobs was revealed as the newest member of a similar faction in the promotion known as The Lost, managed by Sean David. Jacobs faced Sterling James Keenan on November 11 in a \\"Street Fight\\" in Middlesbrough, England.

At Final Battle 2007, Jacobs and Tyler Black defeated the Briscoe Brothers to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship.

The following night, Jacobs and Black lost the ROH World Tag Team Championship to the No Remorse Corps' Davey Richards and Romero in an Ultimate Endurance match, also involving Brent Albright and BJ Whitmer of The Hangmen 3, and Austin Aries and Bryan Danielson. On February 22, 2008, Jacobs introduced Zach Gowen as the newest member of the group. Following the announcement the two of them were defeated by the Vulture Squad of Jigsaw and Ruckus. The group at this time had an open invitation for Austin Aries to join them, writing blogs and posting YouTube videos about and directed at him. Tammy Lynn Sytch had made a counter offer to Aries of her services (including offering money and sex) against him joining the group. On March 30, 2008, Aries left the ring with Lacey, who was going to 'convince' him, and it was implied that the two had sex. At this show Rain accompanied the group to the ring, as she has done in Full Impact Pro, because the show was in Florida. On April 19, Aries not only turned down the invitation into the group, Lacey left the group instead, siding with Aries romantically. Jacobs, heartbroken by Lacey leaving him, broke down in the ring to the chants of \\"Cry, Jimmy, Cry!\\" from fans and being covered with streamers. Later in the show Jacobs showed signs of a mental breakdown as he hit himself in the head with his trademark spike, to the concern of his fellow group members. The main event was changed as Jacobs pulled out. \\"The Vulture Squad\\" (Ruckus, Jigsaw and Jack Evans) were then beaten by the combination of Matthews, Black and Gowen (who replaced Jacobs). Post match Jacobs called out Aries and the two brawled, before Aries was attacked Black, Matthews and Gowen. Jacobs went to attack Aries with his spike, but stopped when Lacey begged him not to. On October 25, Jacobs and Aries then had an Anything Goes match where Jacobs won, but lost a Dog Collar match to Aries on November 8, after losing a large amount of blood. In a match set to end the feud, Jacobs lost to Aries in an \\"I Quit\\" match at Rising Above. During the match Lacey returned and almost threw in the towel for Aries, but Aries begged her not to. Lacey then prevented Tyler Black from throwing in the towel for Jacobs, forcing Jacobs to say \\"I Quit\\". As a result of the loss to Aries, Jacobs attacked Black at Final Battle 2008 in December. Jacobs and Black continued to feud for several months, and on June 27, Black defeated Jacobs in a steel cage match. Afterwards, over a dozen men dressed in black clothing and black masks climbed into the cage and attacked Black, while Jacobs proclaimed that the Age of the Fall was not over. The following night, after Kenta had defeated Black, Jacobs and his followers attacked Black again and tried to hang him upside down above the ring, but were stopped by Kevin Steen, El Generico and Delirious. They hung Jacobs upside down above the ring, with Black declaring that the Age of the Fall was finished. During mid-July 2009, it was revealed that Jacobs had left ROH.

After several months of trying to \\"purge\\" himself of evil, Jacobs hinted a heel turn at the 10th Anniversary Show in a No Disqualification match against Kevin Steen, but lost after freezing in shock when he hit Steen with his trademark spike. Later that month, at Showdown in the Sun, Jacobs fully turned heel by helping Steen beat El Generico in a Last Man Standing match on March 30, and beat Generico himself the next night in an impromptu match. On May 12, Jacobs and Steen were joined by Steve Corino to form the S.C.U.M. (Suffering, Chaos, Ugliness, and Mayhem) stable. On September 15 at Death Before Dishonor X: State of Emergency, Jacobs and Corino defeated Charlie Haas and Rhett Titus in the finals of a tournament to win the vacant ROH World Tag Team Championship.

Whitmer as part of The Decade in March 2014 In September 2013, Jacobs returned to ROH at the request of the retiring B.J. Whitmer, who interceded with Matchmaker Nigel McGuinness on Jacobs' behalf. As part of the storyline, Jacobs was given a five-match series, with the stipulation that if he won at least three of the matches, he would receive a match for the ROH World Championship.

As with other organophosphates, temephos affects the central nervous system through inhibition of cholinesterase. In larvae, this results in death before reaching the adult stage. In the developing world where the vector-borne disease dengue fever is endemic, temephos is widely used and applied by both private and public pest control in areas of standing water where the Aedes aegypti mosquito breeds in order to reduce the population of this disease-carrying insect.New York Times article covering its application in Africa Temephos is also used in the Guinea worm eradication program to kill water fleas that carry guinea worm larvae. Resistance to temephos by A. aegypti has been seen in Brazil. The Brazilian Aedes aegypti resistance monitoring program detected temephos resistance in A. aegypti populations from several localities in the country in 1999 (Funasa 2000, Lima et al. 2003).

J. P. Oud (9 February 1890 ‚Äì 5 April 1963) was a Dutch architect. His fame began as a follower of the De Stijl movement. Oud was born in Purmerend, the son of a tobacco and wine merchant. As a young architect, he was influenced by Berlage, and studied under Theodor Fischer in Munich for a time. He worked together with W.M. Dudok in Leiden, which is where he also met Theo van Doesburg and became involved with the movement De Stijl. Between 1918 and 1933, Oud became Municipal Housing Architect for Rotterdam. During this period when many laborers were coming to the city, he mostly worked on socially progressive residential projects. This included projects in the areas of Spangen, Kiefhoek and the Witte Dorp. Oud was one of a number of Dutch architects who attempted to reconcile strict, rational, 'scientific' cost-effective construction technique against the psychological needs and aesthetic expectations of the users. His own answer was to practice 'poetic functionalism'. Gallery house at Weissenhof Estate designed by J. Oud In 1927, he was one of the fifteen architects who contributed to the influential modernist Weissenhof Estate exhibition. In America Oud is perhaps best known for being lauded and adopted by the mainstream modernist movement, then summarily kicked out on stylistic grounds. As of 1932, he was considered one of the four greatest modern architects (along with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier), and was prominently featured in Philip Johnson's International Style exhibition. Johnson maintained a correspondence with Oud, tried to help him get work, commissioned a house for his mother (never built), and sent him socks and bicycle tires.Speaks, Michael; Hadders, Gerard (ed.): Mart Stam‚Äôs Trousers: Stories from behind the Scenes of Dutch Moral Modernism , 010 Publishers, 1999 In 1945, after the end of World War II allowed photographs of Oud's 1941 Shell Headquarters building in The Hague to be published in America, the architectural press sarcastically condemned his use of ornament (\\"embroidery\\") as contrary to the spirit of modernism. After World War II, Oud designed the Dutch National War Monument in Amsterdam and the monument of the Military War Cemetery Grebbeberg. By then, he had mostly let go of any Stijl influences. He continued to take a highly individualistic stance against mainstream modernism. He designed projects such as the Spaarbank in Rotterdam, office- building De Utrecht in Rotterdam and the Children's health-centre in Arnhem (Bio-herstellingsoord). Oud's brother, Pieter Oud was mayor of Rotterdam. Oud died in 1963 at the age of 73 in Wassenaar.

Swimming The flutter kick in a front crawl. In swimming strokes such as the front crawl or backstroke, the primary purpose of the flutter kick is not propulsion but keeping the legs up and in the shadow for the upper body and assisting body rotation for arm strokes. The legs are extended straight backwards in line with the body. They are moved up and down, one leg kicking downwards (relative to the front of the swimmer's body) as the other leg moves up. The knees are slightly bent to facilitate the kicking action, but not too much in order to minimise drag created by the thighs as they move out of the shadow of the swimmer's body. Similarly, toes are pointed to minimize drag. The downward moving leg provides the thrust. An integral part of the kick is the flexing of the ankles; it is the flexing of the ankle that allows the foot to provide thrust. The knees are not kept rigid when kicking but are allowed to flex slightly to allow the required \\"snapping\\" action through the end of the toes.Mills, Glenn, \\"Freestyle - Flutter-Kick Basics\\" =Scuba diving= Most scuba diving training organizations are agnostic as to kick techniques, and thus most underwater divers utilize the flutter kick of surface swimmers. However, as divers use swimfins, propulsion occurs almost entirely from the kick. Divers that subscribe to the Doing It Right approach and many other cave and wreck divers use a modified flutter kick or frog kick, done entirely with bent knees, pushing water up and behind the diver to avoid stirring up sediment on the bottom. Calisthenics The calisthenics version of the flutter kick is often used as an intensive training tool in the military. They help to develop the hip flexors, abdominal muscles and leg muscles. Flutter kicks are a four-count exercise. Starting position is lying flat on the back with the feet and head approximately 6 inches (15 cm) off the ground. Hands are under the buttocks to support the lower back. Count one: raise the left leg to a 45-degree angle, keeping the right leg stationary. Count two: raise the right leg off the ground to a 45-degree angle while, at the same time, moving the left leg to the starting position. Counts three and four are repetitions of the same movements. Legs must be locked, with toes pointing away from the body.\\"Military Ab Exercises - Flutter Kicks\\" References Category:Swimming styles ","title":"Flutter kick"},{"id":"2371232","title":"Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport"},{"id":"2371234","text":" Coalcleugh is a hamlet in Northumberland, England.

It is about to the south-west of Haltwhistle, on the South Tyne. Nearby is the village of Lambley. Coanwood was anciently written as Collingwood meaning \\"Hazel Trees/Woods\\".  History  Sir Simon Musgrave was recorded in 1568 as possessed of East and West Coingwood, which he and his wife Julian conveyed in 1575 to Richard Lowther whose daughter Anne married Alexander Featherstonhaugh (). By 1633 Albany Featherstonhaugh was Lord of the Manor, and in 1656 sells the manor to Nicholas Byreley of Whitehall, Durham. Byerley, and Thos Selby of Winlaton, in 1657 conveyed the manor to Thomas Wallis, of Ash Holme, but Byreley remained Court Baron. A declaration of 1659 in name of Richard Cromwell that Cuthbert Wigham buys the Manor of East and West Coanwood with 14 tenements and land and common of pasture from Albany Featherstonhaugh, Nicholas Byreley, and Thos Selby. In 1673 Matthew Wigham of Conewood was \\"collecting rates\\" as he was High Constable of the West Division of Tindale Ward. William Wigham, son of Matthew, served his Apprenticeship at Chapell with Matthew Baxter as a Skinner and Glover, and in 1699 Baxter was in court forbeating Edward Short and breaking his head, accused and fined 6s 8d for blood and affray. Short was also fined for beating Baxter and throwing a stone at him, 6d. A riding of the manor boundary took place on 1 May 1700. Thomas Wallis, Lord of Manor of West Coanwood and Matthew Wigham, Lord of the Manor of East Coanwood together with their 20 customary tenants rode the boundary between Chriswell Bourne and Old Lough Foote, Whitfield. Boundary agreed and signed by all. The turn of the Century, in 1900, was a much quieter time in Coanwood with several properties going into disrepair for the first time. This was mainly due to the closure of the Colliery at Dykes in the late 1800s and the Miners moving to pastures new. In 1970 Yont the Cleugh farm was purchased by Neville Hanson and converted into a Caravan Park which he ran with his son Peter until it changed hands in 1995. Since then the site has had 4 owners and is still thriving.  Governance  Coanwood is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham.  Geography  Coanwood has coal reserves and has in the past been a coal mining area. From the 1860s to 1930 coal was worked in the area. In 1914 the Coanwood Coal Company employed 63 people.Durham Mining Museum website accessed 10.1.2014 http://www.dmm.org.uk/company/c021.htm  Transport: railways  Coanwood was served by Coanwood Railway Station on the Alston Line from Haltwhistle to Alston. The line opened in 1852 and closed in 1976. Platform at derelict old station March 2013  Education  The Herdley Bank Church of England Aided First School provides primary school education. By a [Statutory Instrument] no. 3301 in 2005 the school was designated as a school having a religious character.

His 1929 work Germanische Heiligt√ºmer was rejected by experts even at the time of publication, but continues to have some influence in esoteric and neopagan circles in Germany. Life and career Teudt was born on 7 December 1860 in Bergkirchen, Schaumburg-Lippe as the son of a Protestant priest. He studied theology and philosophy at the universities of Berlin, Leipzig, T√ºbingen and Bonn. He was ordained in 1885 and was a pastor in Probsthagen and Stadthagen. In 1894/95, he succeeded Friedrich Naumann as the head of the Inner mission at Frankfurt. In 1907, Teudt co-founded the ' (a group fighting the ideas of Charles Darwin) before renouncing his status as a priest in 1909. Teudt volunteered for military service and served in World War I from 1915-18. In 1921, due to the Occupation of the Ruhr by French and Belgian troops he moved to Detmold. That same year he founded the Cheruskerbund - Heimatbund f√ºr Lippe, which in 1924 was incorporated into Der Stahlhelm. Teudt joined the German National People's Party (DNVP). He likely joined the ' in 1924 and in 1925 supported the Nationalsozialistische Freiheitsbewegung Deutschlands. In 1928/29, he became Gauherr or Deutschmeister of the Deutschbund in Detmold. Teudt founded the Vereinigung der Freunde germanischer Vorgeschichte in 1928 and in 1929 published the book Germanische Heiligt√ºmer. Though his ideas overlapped with those of Hermann Wirth and Wirth published some articles in Teudt's monthly Germanien, after the Nazi takeover of power the two became competitors. Teudt joined the NSDAP at some point before 1935. In 1936, his organization (Freunde) participated in the Pflegst√§tte f√ºr Germanenkunde at Detmold set up by the Ahnenerbe. In 1935, on his 75th birthday he was awarded a professorship by Adolf Hitler, apparently on the suggestion of Heinrich Himmler. In 1936, he became an honorary citizen of the city of Detmold. He joined Ahnenerbe in 1936, but was forced to leave in 1938 because of a falling-out with Himmler, who described Teudt as \\"unobjective and pathologically quarrelsome\\". Thus his work at the Pflegst√§tte ended in 1938. In 1939, Teudt founded the Osningmark- Gesellschaft, renamed after his death to Wilhelm-Teudt-Gesellschaft. The year after, Teudt was awarded the Goethemedaille f√ºr Kunst und Wissenschaft on the request of Gauleiter Alfred Meyer. Teudt's family grave at Detmold Teudt died on 5 January 1942 in Detmold and is buried there. A street was named after him until 1969. In 2010, the city posthumously revoked his status as honorary citizen. Theories Teudt's interest in \\"Germanic archaeology\\", in particular the discovery of Germanic pagan sacred sites, developed in the 1920s. He trusted in his paranormal faculty of picking up the \\"vibrations\\" of his ancestors helping him visualize ancient sceneries of the sites he was researching. Teudt was particularly interested in the natural stone formation of the Externsteine near Detmold, which he suggested was the location of a central Saxon shrine, the location of Irminsul and an ancient sun observatory. He assumed that the Germanic buildings there had been made from wood and thus left no traces. Teudt was put in charge of the excavations at the site and appointed to head the work done there by the Reichsarbeitsdienst in 1934/35. Teudt thought that the Externsteine had served as an observatory until its destruction by Charlemagne. He initiated the demolishing of tourist infrastructure (tramway, hotels) and the creation of a \\"sacred grove\\" nearby. In Teudt's view, the Christianisation of the Saxons after 800 AD was nothing less than a cultural genocide. He thought that a highly advanced Germanic civilization had predated contact with the Romans. References * Uta Halle: ‚ÄûDie Externsteine sind bis auf weiteres germanisch!‚Äú.

She is a former hero turned villain. The character first appeared in The New Teen Titans #17 (March 1982) as Frances Kane, and debuted as Magenta five years later in Teen Titans Spotlight #16 (Nov 1987). An early concept design for Magenta by George P√©rez appeared in DC Sampler #2. The character's initial name was Polara and her color scheme consisted of red and blue rather than magenta and white. Magenta made a live appearance on the third season of The Flash played by Joey King. Fictional character biography Frances Kane was Wally West's girlfriend during his Kid Flash days. When Wally was a member of the New Teen Titans, Frances began to have strange experiences, including objects flying around without control. Frances' mother believed that she had been possessed, a theory that gained credence when, during an especially powerful episode, the silhouette of a large horned person appeared. The Titans managed to save Frances, who was thereafter discovered to have magnetic superpowers. Unbeknownst to the Titans, the silhouette had not been a demon, but the magnetically powered supervillain Doctor Polaris, who had been trapped in another dimension by Green Lantern and was trying to use Frances' nascent powers to escape. Wally pushed her to become \\"Kid Flash's girlfriend\\" ‚Äî a superhero. She became Magenta (a near anagram of \\"magnet\\"), and used her powers as Kid Flash's \\"super girlfriend\\" and as a Titans ally. The pressure of being a superhero put a lot of stress on her, and the pair broke up. West regretted this in his adult life. Despite the break-up, Frances still had feelings for Wally (some of them negative), and when the Justice League fought the Teen Titans, Magenta came to help, even using her abilities to jump-start a machine that was vital in saving Earth from massive chunks of debris from a falling planet. Her heroic efforts masked her growing mental illness. Though Frances was often called \\"bipolar\\" (as a darkly humorous pun on her magnetic powers), her illness more closely resembled multiple personality disorder; all the stress and resentment emerged into a vindictive and aggressive new identity, while her \\"regular\\" personality became unusually weak-willed and mousy. It is notable that this split personality problem has also cropped up in Doctor Polaris, though his mental illness apparently predated his super- villain career. The \\"new\\" Magenta forced a confrontation with Wally West (now the third Flash) which quickly devolved into a brawl. When police intervened, she used her powers to rip the fillings from their teeth. Flash was horrified by Frances' nearly homicidal tendencies. Frances would encounter Wally on and off again many times. In one incident, she was calm and non-violent, realizing that using her powers would awaken her \\"darker\\" side. She had to use her powers when another of Flash's enemies teleported a bomb to a computer- determined random location in the city. Frances, riding on Flash's back, was able to detect the bomb with her powers and, risking turning evil, levitate it high enough so its explosion harmed no one. During her time, she formed a friendship with Linda Park, Wally's girlfriend, bonding over things Wally had done in the past. Later, she would return and attempt to kill the Flash. Using her powers to hijack a car transport vehicle, she raced it through town. She flung car after car at the Flash, who couldn't just dodge the cars because he also had to protect the townspeople from Kane. With the help of Linda, Frances calmed down enough to end her rampage. Later, when Cicada attacked the Flash, Magenta was an early convert. She was present at the final battle between them, but escaped. She joined Blacksmith's rogues and, after being sexually harassed by Girder, she ripped Girder in half. Her interference allowed Flash the chance to defeat his other adversaries. In the 2005 \\"Rogue War\\" storyline, she was shown as a member of James Jesse's reformed Rogues (alongside Heatwave and the Pied Piper). When they attacked Captain Cold's group, she was defeated by the Weather Wizard. She was seen among the new Injustice League and is one of the exiled villains in Salvation Run. On Earth, she got involved with the \\"Cyborg Revenge Squad\\", a loosely formed group of villains with mastery over metals and cybernetics assembled by the shady Mister Orr, on the behest of Enclave M to capture the cybernetic hero Cyborg and harvest his discoveries and technologies for military uses. Cyborg gave her an electric shock so powerful it brought her back to her senses, unaware of where she was or what she had done but still able to recognize Cyborg.DC: Special: Cyborg. DC Comics. Magenta appears in the post-Rebirth DC Universe. In the \\"Flash War\\" prelude, Wally West is hoping to find people from his past who still remember him, so he approaches Frances Kane. She initially doesn't know who Wally West is, but she suddenly regains her missing memories and reacts violently as Magenta. Wally West manages to calm her down and they reconcile over their shared history.The Flash Annual #1 (March 2018). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Magenta can generate and control magnetic fields, which she can use to move, lift, and manipulate ferrous metals. She can focus her powers into blasts of concussive magnetic force that can shatter steel, or fire electromagnetic pulses to disrupt electronic systems. She can concentrate her magnetic powers into a protective shield that repels metals and most physical assaults. By surrounding herself with an aura of magnetism that has an equal polarity to the Earth's own geomagnetic field, she can cause the Earth to repel her upward, and thereby fly by magnetic levitation. In other media Magenta appears in her self-titled episode of The Flash portrayed by Joey King. Frankie Kane is a metahuman orphan who lived with her abusive foster father John James and his wife Karen James. Her split-personality refers to herself as Magenta and both she and Frankie were affected as a result of the temporal changes due to the Flashpoint timeline and gained the ability to control metal after meeting Doctor Alchemy. She attacked John James on several occasions. After being talked down by Flash, Magenta was seen at S.T.A.R. Labs where she was told that John James will be prosecuted and that Caitlin Snow had found a better home for her. When asked by Frankie what happens when her Magenta personality resurfaces, Barry Allen tells her that she should fight it and call them if she needs help dealing with Magenta. In the episode \\"Marathon\\" which takes place sometime after Crisis on Infinite Earths, pictures of Frankie and her Magenta side appear in Vibe's \\"Who's Who\\" binder of characters whose status upon the formation of Earth-Prime are unknown. Frost mentioned that she liked Magenta.

The Woodlawn Vase on display before The Preakness Stakes in 2002, note a Black- eyed Susan glass is set in photo to give a size comparison Overview of the trophy After the Preakness Stakes is run each year on the third Saturday of May, the winners are awarded the Woodlawn Vase on national television. The vase was first awarded in 1861 to a stakes-winning mare named Mollie Jackson in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1917, the Woodlawn Vase became the official trophy for the winner of the second jewel of the Triple Crown and was awarded to the Preakness winner Kalitan. For many years the trophy was given to the winning owner to keep for one year until the next running of the race. In 1953, Native Dancer won the Preakness Stakes and the wife of winning owner Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. (Jeanne Murray Vanderbilt) declined to take annual possession of the trophy because of its monetary and sentimental value to the sport. Following 1953, the winning owner of the horse that won The Preakness Stakes was no longer allowed to keep the trophy for the year. In 1983, the trophy's silver design was appraised by Tiffany and Company of New York (the original creator in 1860) as priceless but a figure of $1,000,000 was established for insurance purposes. The appraised value is now reported to exceed $4,000,000.00 in replacement value.The 127th running The Preakness Stakes on NBC TV, Triple Crown Production Series, May 18, 2002, quoting former Pimlico General Manager Chick Lang in an interview with the late John McKay.May 21, 2011, The 137th Preakness Stakes Telecast on NBC; Bob Costas of NBC Sports reported that the Woodlawn Vase was currently estimated at a value of more than $4,000,000.00 The original trophy is kept at the Baltimore Museum of Art in Maryland and brought to the Preakness Stakes each year escorted by Maryland Army National Guard Soldiers and Air National Guard Airmen in their dress uniforms donning white gloves for proper care during transportation to the \\"Old Hilltop's\\" cupola winner's circle for the presentation ceremony. Dimensions and description of the vase Standing 36 inches tall and weighing 400 ounces of solid sterling silver (approx. 30 pounds), the Woodlawn vase has a colorful history as rich as the classic race at which it is presented. The following is an excerpt from Wilkes B. Spirit of \\"The Times, The American Gentleman's Newspaper\\" in 1860: \\"Messrs. Tiffany & Co., the celebrated jewelers, on Tuesday last, sent to Louisville, KY a massive silver vase, for the Woodlawn Race Course Association, the most elegant of its kind ever made anywhere in the world. Its entire height is 36 inches, its weight is four hundred ounces, and its value $1,500. The base of this piece is a circle thirteen inches in diameter, supported upon a cross, then four projections of which are faced each with a race shoe; and on the top of each projection is a racing saddle, whip, jockey cap, etc. The upper part of the base represents a lawn, divided into fields by a rustic fence. In one field is seen a stallion and in the other a mare and foal. On either side of the pillar is a bulletin, on which the rules to be observed in contending for the prize are distinctly engraved. The centerpiece, or bowl, is fourteen inches above the base, and fourteen inches in diameter, and has four shields. On one of these is engraved the picture of a race horse, on another a representation of the Woodlawn Race Course, on another is a blank for the history of the winning of the prize, and the other also blank for a portrait of the winner. Between the shields are four figures of Victory, in frosted silver, each holding a wreath in either hand. Seven inches above the bowl is a circular ornament nine inches in diameter, having engraved on it the portraits of eight officers of the Woodlawn Race Course Association. The whole is surmounted by a full figure of the horse \\"Lexington\\" mounted by a jockey in costume. History of the vase It has been raced for in Louisville, Kentucky, Elizabeth, New Jersey, the Sheepshead Bay Race Track, New York, Jerome Park Racetrack, New York, Morris Park Racecourse, New York, and since 1917, at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Created as a challenge cup, the Woodlawn Vase was first won by Capt. Thomas G. Moore's mare, Mollie Jackson, in 1861. This excerpt appeared in the newspaper that week, \\"The rules under which this prize is to be contended for are such that a man who wins it on the first trial (which is to occur on Saturday, the 18th instant of the year) is to give bonds to produce the Vase for future trials; and no one is entitled to it without giving such bonds, until he has won it three successive times. The challengers for the Vase, who name their horses to the post will be listed in the paper and the result reported for perpetuity in time in our next paper.\\" The same owner retained possession the following year through the victory of the famous mare \\"Idlewild.\\" The outbreak of the Civil War prevented further competition until 1866. Following the war, the vase remained in Kentucky for 13 years until 1878, when the Dwyer Brothers Stable captured it by the aid of their colt \\"Bramble\\" and trainer Jim McLaughlin in the American Stallion Stakes at Churchill Downs, in Louisville, Kentucky. The Dwyer Brothers presented the vase to the Coney Island Jockey Club, where notable stables of the day competed vigorously for the vase for the next 25 years. The first running at Morris Park Racecourse took place on October 26, 1901. It was won by Gold Heels, whose trainer, Matthew Allen, had been part of the training staff at Louisville, Kentucky for 1861 winner, Mollie Jackson. Thomas C. Clyde, owner of Goughacres Stable, won possession through the double victory of his homebred colt \\"Shorthose\\" in 1903 and 1904. \\"Shorthose\\" was the only horse - with the exception of the wonderful Miss Woodford - to win it twice. In 1917, Mr. Clyde presented the vase to the Maryland Jockey Club, of which he was a director. It was added to the Preakness that year, though Clyde proposed a condition - the winning owner should keep the vase for the year, and have the privilege of naming the course and the stake for its renewal. Edward R. Bradley's Kalitan was the first winner of the vase at Pimlico. The vase was presented to the winning Preakness owner each year from 1917 to 1953 ‚Äì although the latter part of Clyde's condition did not prevail. In 1953, when Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr.'s Native Dancer won the trophy and proclaimed, \\"Due to the historic value of the legendary trophy and Mrs. Vanderbilt preference not to accept responsibility for the vase's safekeeping until the next year's Preakness,\\" that the trophy be permanently kept and protected by the Maryland Jockey Club. Owner, trainer and jockey replicas Eventually, a one-third-size (35% of scale) solid sterling silver reproduction of the trophy valued at $40,000 is given annually to the winning owner to keep permanently. It is made each year at a height of 14 inches with twelve pounds of silver, composed of fourteen large parts and 36 little parts all intricately crafted together. Article in Baltimore Sun in May 2011 about the three Replica Trophies awarded annually. The winning trainer and jockey are given solid sterling silver cups that look similar to the trophy valued at $15,000 each standing at a foot tall. The smaller solid sterling silver replica requires sixteen weeks work of one of the nation's most skilled silversmiths, Kirk Stieff. It is awarded to the winning owner of the Preakness Stakes on a permanent basis. The perpetual trophy is now on display at The Baltimore Museum of Art under the direction of The Maryland Historical Society and is brought to Pimlico Race Course under guard by Maryland National Guard and Air National Airman in dress uniform for the annual running of the Preakness.

The towers were popular in the late 19th century in cities across the United States and Europe; they were most common in the 1880s and 1890s. In some places they were used when standard street-lighting, using smaller, shorter, and more numerous lamps, was impractically expensive. In other places they were used in addition to gas street lighting. The towers were designed to illuminate areas often of several blocks at once, on the \\"high light\\" principle. Arc lamps, known for their exceptionally bright and harsh light, were the most common method of illumination. As incandescent electric street lighting became common, the prevalence of towers began to wane. Austin, Texas Austin, Texas, is the only city in the world known to still have moonlight towers. They are tall with foundations wide. The towers were manufactured in Indiana by Fort Wayne Electric Company and assembled on site.Texas Historical Commission Atlas In 1894, the City of Austin purchased 31 used towers from Detroit. A single tower cast light from six carbon arc lamps, illuminating a radius circle brightly enough to read a watch. In 1993, the city of Austin dismantled the towers and restored every bolt, turnbuckle and guy-wire as part of a $1.3 million project, the completion of which was celebrated in 1995 with a citywide festival. Detroit In front of City Hall, Detroit, Michigan, about 1900 Detroit, Michigan, had a particularly extensive system of light towers inaugurated in 1882 with 122 towers, tall and apart downtown, shorter, less powerful, and twice as far apart elsewhere. The towers were masts secured with cables and were maintained daily by crew who hauled themselves to the top using a counterweighted elevator. The system covered about , but soon had to be supplemented with incandescent lighting in the city center, partly because trees interfered with the light, and by the turn of the century they remained only in Cadillac Square; the towers were soon removed there, too. New Orleans New Orleans riverfront electrically illuminated at night, 1883 Towers were erected in New Orleans, Louisiana, starting in the early 1880s. One set of towers illuminated a section of the Mississippi River levee, aiding in loading and unloading ships at night in the busy port. A tower at the busy intersection of Canal Street, Bourbon Street, and Carondelet Street was constructed with a set of four water pipes to aid in fire-fighting in the nearby multi-story buildings.The Electrical Engineer, August 3, 1888, page 90 San Jose, California San Jose Electric Light Tower half-size replica In 1881, a -tallSan Jose Historical Museum Association plaque located beneath the tower. tower was erected spanning the intersection of Santa Clara and Market streets in San Jose, California, making it the first city to be illuminated by electric light west of the Rocky Mountains.

The tower collapsed in a storm on December 3, 1915.Larson, p. 21. In 1977, a nearly half-sized replica, tall, was constructed at the San Jose Historical Museum.Larson, p. 22.

Actor Dominic Purcell has portrayed the character in The CW's television series The Flash and currently is in Legends of Tomorrow.  Publication history  Heat Wave was first introduced in The Flash #140, written by John Broome. He was first made to be a rival for Captain Cold. However, in recent comics by Geoff Johns, Rory looks to Captain Cold to help him keep his obsession at bay, though Cold thinks he'll eventually become beyond help.  Fictional character biography  Born on a farm outside Central City, Mick Rory became fascinated with fire as a child. This fascination turned into an obsession and one night, he set his family's home ablaze. His obsession was so great, that he simply watched the flames engulf his house, instead of running to get help. After this event, Rory went to live with his uncle. His pyromania continued and he was forced to run away after locking a schoolmate in his house and setting it on fire, after the boy locked Rory in a meat locker during a field trip. He took a job as a fire eater with a traveling circus. This did not last long either, as he ended up setting the circus on fire. He has an intense fear of cold, called cryophobia. This was due to a school field trip (noted above) to a slaughterhouse, during which one of his friends locked him in a freezer. It was these events that made him desperate to fight his fire obsession and after seeing the Rogues in action in Central City, he decided to use his mania to become a villain. He created a protective costume made of asbestos (this was back before the dangers of asbestos were known), built a gun-sized flamethrower (nicknamed the \\"Hot Rod\\"), and became Heat Wave. As he was committing crimes in Central City, it was inevitable that he would run into the Flash, which he did quite regularly. Subsequently, he also ended up in jail quite regularly. He also became an adversary of Captain Cold, due to his aversion to cold temperatures. It was Captain Cold who introduced Heat Wave to the Rogues, and in his first appearance they teamed up to get rid of the Flash as they competed over a newscaster they had both fallen in love with and fought each other as they each tried to complete a larger crime spree, but the Flash jailed them both. Eventually, Mick went straight, due largely to the manipulations of the Top. He took a job as a firefighting consultant, using his vast knowledge on fires and heat. He also became good friends with Barry Allen, whose secret identity as Flash was discovered by Rory years before. Rory later succumbed to an offer by Abra Kadabra of gaining respect and infamy in the world. He and four other members of the Rogues sacrificed themselves, quite unwittingly, to unleash the demon Neron.Underworld Unleashed #1 (November 1995) Neron returned the soulless bodies of the five to Earth, in a plan to force Flash into a deal.Flash #126 (June 1997) The five Rogues each possessed incredible powers and wreaked havoc, death, and destruction before Neron was forced by Flash to halt their actions and return their souls to their bodies.Flash #129 (September 1997) Heat Wave would only briefly return to his criminal ways before abandoning them to study with Zhutanian monks.New Year's Evil ‚Äì The Rogues #1 (February 1998) Afterwards, he worked for Project Cadmus as a backup agent, but eventually quit that too and moved to the Quad Cities, Illinois area. He eventually got a job at the FBI, along with other reformed members of the Rogues. This was a spectacular failure and Rory became a villain once again after the Top arrived and undid the mental program that had kept him reformed. In Infinite Crisis, Heat Wave became a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains. = One Year Later = In One Year Later, Heat Wave is next seen being recruited by Inertia to team up against Bart Allen. He is one of the rogues who deliver the killing blow to Bart. He freaks out about what he and the Rogues have done and flees only to be captured by Captain Boomerang alongside Weather Wizard. He is sent to \\"hell planet\\" Salvation with the other Rogues. When the conflict starts, he sides with Luthor. When they beat J'onn, he's worried about killing another hero, claiming that they will kill them with rusty razors. He returns to Earth with the villains who are still alive. = Salvation Run = Heat Wave is one of the exiled villains featured in Salvation Run along with his fellow Rogues: Captain Cold, Weather Wizard, Mirror Master, and Abra Kadabra. = Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge = He was seen as the member of Rogues who joined Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains. In Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge #1, however, Heat Wave and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game. Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used, particularly after they find that Paul Gambi, the Rogues' tailor, has been badly beaten by the 'New Rogues' organised by Libra. During the hunt for Inertia, Heat Wave also kills Burn- his own counterpart in the 'New Rogues'- when the two shoot their weapons at each other, Heat Wave noting that Burn's costume was of poorer quality than his own, allowing him to burn Burn to death while he is barely sweating while subjected to Burn's own weapons. Captain Cold later has him kill Cold's father, abducted by Libra as a hostage against Cold. While Libra tries to hypnotize the Rogues, Captain Cold tells Rory to watch a nearby fire to retain his focus. When they are fighting Inertia, Rory melts his boots, making him unable to move. He then helps the other Rogues kill Inertia. Once the crisis is over, the unarmed Human Flame seeks out Heat Wave, hoping to purchase one of his signature flamethrower guns after his own equipment was lost in a confrontation with the Mafia. After learning that the Human Flame can only offer him $5 000, Heat Wave refuses, denouncing Human Flame as \\"pathetic\\". Noting that Captain Cold advised against this meeting and he only agreed to see what the other man had to offer, Heat Wave gives Human Flame a harsh beating, the fight concluding with Heat Wave blowing up the fireworks factory they were meeting in, noting that he had always wanted to do something like that.Final Crisis Aftermath: Run! #2 (June 2009) = The Flash (Vol. 3) = Heat Wave and the Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words In Case of Flash: Break Glass written on it.Flash Secret Files and Origins (2010) Rory is still on the run with The Rogues.The Flash (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010) = The New 52 = In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity.

DC Comics.  Powers and abilities  = Pre-52 = In the Pre-52 continuity Heat Wave had no meta-human abilities; however, he was able to create a flamethrower that allowed him to project intense streams of flame that reach temperatures well over 900 degrees Fahrenheit. The flame that his weaponry projects is so hot that it has been able to melt Flash's friction proof boots, the same boots that allow Flash to run at light speed. He also has an in-depth knowledge of fire and pyrotechnics. = New 52 = In the New 52 continuity, Heat Wave merged his DNA with his flamethrower, thus granting him the ability to project and manipulate fire from his own body. = Weapons & Equipment = Heat Wave carries a hand held flamethrower that allows him to project a concentrated stream of fire at opponents. He wears an asbestos suit with a breathing mask that affords him protection against fire and heat. His suit was once shown to be able to project heat as well, capable of staving off an attack from Captain Cold's cold gun, neutralizing solid projectiles, or melting his way through walls. Heat Wave has a pipe attached to his left arm that can project a fire retardant which allows him to put out fires.

He is then sent to death row in the military Doom prison. During this time, Eel O'Brian arrives to break him out, having been hiding in the body of his cellmate Cluemaster.Flashpoint: Legion of Doom #1 (June 2011) During the prison break, Heat Wave forces an inmate to join him, after taking out another inmate Victor Zsasz and the corrections officer Atom, who controls the actions of Amazo. While retrieving his weapons, Heat Wave then attacks the guards' control room and attempts to ram Cyborg's home city of Detroit with the Doom prison.Flashpoint: Legion of Doom #2 (July 2011) Heat Wave then betrays O'Brian and apparently kills him with his flamethrower. Cyborg arrives and moves the Doom prison away from the city with his sonic weapon. When the Doom prison crashes, Heat Wave attempts to escape, but Cyborg challenges him to a fight.

He and Weather Wizard end up getting incinerated by Bizarro's heat breath. In other media =Television= Animation * Heat Wave was originally going to be a villain for the third Super Friends series, in a group called the League of Evil. They were eventually changed to the Legion of Doom and most of the planned members did not appear. * Heat Wave (spelled Heatwave in the show's billing) was shown in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Lex Lang. He appears as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society. In \\"To Another Shore\\", he was seen helping Giganta, Killer Frost, and Devil Ray retrieve a frozen Viking ship containing the Viking Prince's corpse. In \\"Alive\\", he was seen burning Blockbuster and being struck by Silver Banshee.

Arrowverse Dominic Purcell as Heat Wave on the television series The Flash. * Mick Rory/Heat Wave appears on The CW's television series The Flash, portrayed by Dominic Purcell. This version is depicted as a pyromaniac with burns covering half of his body, including his upper arms. He debuts in the episode \\"Going Rogue\\", where his ex-partner Leonard Snart (played by Purcell's Prison Break co-star Wentworth Miller) recruits him into his criminal gang. Snart offers Rory an experimental 'heat gun' that he stole earlier and proposes that they work together to kill the Flash so that no one could interfere with their crimes in Central City. However, in \\"Revenge of the Rogues\\", the Flash tricks Snart and Rory into firing their guns at each other, destroying both weapons. After being apprehended, they are rescued by Snart's sister, Lisa, and are able to coerce the Flash's ally Cisco Ramon into recreating their weapons. * Rory next appears in the spin-off DC's Legends of Tomorrow (with Dominic Purcell reprising his role), where he and Snart join the time-traveling Legends team. Here, Snart reveals that when he was first sent to juvenile prison, fellow inmate Rory protected the much-smaller Snart from the other inmates. Snart since looked out for Rory, tempering his more violent tendencies. Eventually Rory and Snart begin having problems with each other, which leads to Rory betraying the team. As a result, he is abandoned in an unspecified place, where he is later captured by the Time Masters and turned into the bounty hunter Chronos. He hunts his former teammates until he is defeated by them and imprisoned on the Waverider, with the team electing to try to rehabilitate him. Later, Rory rejects the Time Masters' attempt to turn him back into Chronos and rejoins the Legends. When Snart sacrifices himself to destroy the Time Masters, Rory is left without his partner onboard the Waverider. In season two, Rory begins seeing visions of Snart and eventually meets a version of him that the Legion of Doom had picked up from earlier in the timeline and recruited into their ranks. After the Legends reprimand Rory for accidentally giving information to Snart, he abandons them and joins the Legion of Doom, helping them obtain the Spear of Destiny and rewrite reality. Rory quickly comes to regret his decision and eventually rejoins the Legends, helping them defeat the Legion of Doom. In season three, Rory and the Legends start fixing anachronisms caused by their actions in season two. During the season, Rory encounters his father in 1967 Vietnam, forcing him to face his feelings about his father's abusive history. He later becomes the wielder of the Fire totem for the final battle against the demon Mallus. In the fourth season, Rory shows he has a talent in writing, and becomes a semi-popular romance novelist under the name \\"Rebecca Silver\\". ** Mitchell Kummen portrays a younger Mick Rory in the episode \\"Last Refuge\\", when the team rescue him from the fire that killed his parents when he was a child. A conversation with his future self reveals that Mick started the fire- albeit by accident- but the conversation helps Rory accept that his younger self was just a foolish child who did not know any better rather than causing the fire out of genuine malice, advising his younger self to be better than him. ** Purcell also portrayed an Earth-74 Rory in the crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" as a former member of the Legends after some of the team retire and one member died. =Film= * Heat Wave appears in Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox in a non-speaking role.

He was a major figure in American poetry in the second half of the 20th century and is considered a key figure in the Confessional school of poetry. His best-known work is The Dream Songs. Life and career John Berryman was born John Allyn Smith, Jr., on October 25, 1914 in McAlester, Oklahoma, where he was raised until the age of ten, when his father, John Smith, a banker, and his mother, Martha (also known as Peggy), a schoolteacher, moved to Florida. In 1926, in Clearwater, Florida, when Berryman was 11 years old, his father shot and killed himself. Smith was jobless at the time, and he and Martha were filing for divorce. Berryman was haunted by his father's death for the rest of his life and wrote about his struggle to come to terms with it in much of his poetry. In \\"Dream Song #143\\", he wrote, \\"That mad drive [to commit suicide] wiped out my childhood. I put him down/while all the same on forty years I love him/stashed in Oklahoma/besides his brother Will\\". In \\"Dream Song #145\\", he also wrote of his father: Similarly, in Dream Song #384, Berryman wrote: 220x220pxAfter his father's death at the rear entrance to Kipling Arms, where the Smiths rented an apartment, the poet's mother, within months, married John Angus McAlpin Berryman in New York City.Nicorvo, Jay Baron. \\"The Art of Reading John Berryman.\\" Poets & Writers. 30 January 2015. The poet was renamed John Allyn McAlpin Berryman. Berryman's mother also changed her first name from Peggy to Jill.Mariani, Paul. Dream Songs: The Life of John Berryman. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1990. Although his stepfather later divorced his mother, Berryman and his stepfather stayed on good terms.Ellman, Richard and Robert O'Clair. The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry. New York: W. W. Norton and Co., 1973. With both his mother and stepfather working, his mother decided to send him to the South Kent School, a private boarding school in Connecticut. Berryman then attended Columbia College, where he was president of the Philolexian Society, joined the Boar's Head Society, edited The Columbia Review, and studied under the literary scholar and poet Mark Van Doren. Berryman later credited Van Doren with sparking his interest in writing poetry seriously. For two years, Berryman also studied overseas at Clare College, Cambridge, on a Kellett Fellowship from Columbia. He graduated in 1936. Berryman's early work formed part of a volume titled Five Young American Poets, published by New Directions in 1940\\". One of the other young poets included in the book was Randall Jarrell. Berryman published some of this early verse in his first book, Poems, in 1942. His first mature collection of poems, The Dispossessed, appeared six years later, published by William Sloane Associates. The book received largely negative reviews from poets like Jarrell, who wrote, in The Nation, that Berryman was \\"a complicated, nervous, and intelligent [poet]\\" whose work was too derivative of W. B. Yeats. Berryman later concurred with this assessment of his early work, saying, \\"I didn't want to be like Yeats; I wanted to be Yeats.\\"Bloom, James D. (1984) The stock of available reality: R.P. Blackmur and John Berryman Bucknell University Press p61 In October 1942, Berryman married Eileen Mulligan (later Simpson) in a ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral, with Van Doren as his best man. The couple moved to Beacon Hill, and Berryman lectured at Harvard. The marriage ended in 1953 (the divorce was formalized in 1956), when Simpson finally grew weary of Berryman's affairs and acting as \\"net-holder\\" during his self- destructive personal crises. Simpson memorialized her time with Berryman and his circle in her 1982 book Poets in Their Youth. In 1947, Berryman started an affair with a married woman named Chris, documented in a long sonnet sequence that he refrained from publishing in part because that would have revealed the affair to his wife. He eventually published the work, Berryman's Sonnets, in 1967. It includes over one hundred sonnets. In 1950, Berryman published the first biography of the fiction writer and poet Stephen Crane, whom he greatly admired. The book was followed by his next significant poem, Homage to Mistress Bradstreet (1956), which featured illustrations by the artist Ben Shahn and was Berryman's first poem to receive \\"national attention\\" and a positive response from critics.Poetry Foundation profile Edmund Wilson wrote that it was \\"the most distinguished long poem by an American since T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land.\\" When Homage to Mistress Bradstreet and Other Poems was published in 1959, the poet Conrad Aiken praised the book's shorter poems, which he found superior to \\"Homage to Mistress Bradstreet\\".Berryman, John. Homage to Mistress Bradstreet and other poems. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1959. Despite his third book of verse's relative success, Berryman's great poetic breakthrough occurred with 77 Dream Songs (1964). It won the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for poetry and solidified Berryman's standing as one of the most important poets of the post-World War II generation that included Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, and Delmore Schwartz. Soon thereafter, the press began to give Berryman a great deal of attention, as did arts organizations and even the White House, which sent him an invitation to dine with President Lyndon B. Johnson (though Berryman declined because he was in Ireland at the time). Berryman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967, and that same year Life magazine ran a feature story on him. Also that year the newly created National Endowment for the Arts awarded him a $10,000 grant (when a Minneapolis reporter asked him about the award, he said that he had never heard of NEA before receiving it). Berryman also continued to work on the \\"dream song\\" poems at a feverish pace and in 1968 published a second, significantly longer, volume, His Toy, His Dream, His Rest, which won the National Book Award for Poetry and the Bollingen Prize. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1969\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-25. (With acceptance speech by Berryman and essay by Kiki Petrosino from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) The next year Berryman republished 77 Dreams Songs and His Toy, His Dream, His Rest as one book, The Dream Songs, in which the character Henry serves as Berryman's alter ego. In Love & Fame (1970), he dropped the mask of Henry to write more plainly about his life. Responses to the poems from critics and most of Berryman's peers ranged from tepid to hostile; the collection is now generally \\"considered a minor work\\".Galassi, Jonathan. \\"John Berryman: Sorrows and Passions of His Majesty the Ego.\\" Poetry Nation, No. 2, 1974. 117-124. Henry reappeared in a couple of poems published in Delusions Etc. (1972), Berryman's last collection, which focused on his religious concerns and spiritual rebirth. The book was published posthumously and, like Love & Fame, is considered a minor work. Berryman taught or lectured at a number of universities, including the University of Iowa (at the Writer's Workshop), Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Minnesota, where he spent most of his career, except for his sabbatical year in 1962‚Äì3, when he taught at Brown University. Some of his illustrious students included W. D. Snodgrass, William Dickey, Donald Justice, Philip Levine, Robert Dana, Jane Cooper, Donald Finkel, and Henri Coulette. In a 2009 interview, Levine said Berryman took his class extremely seriously and that \\"he was entrancing ... magnetic and inspiring and very hard on [his students'] work ... [and] he was [also] the best teacher that I ever had\\". Berryman was fired from the University of Iowa after a fight with his landlord led to him being arrested, jailed overnight, and fined for disorderly conduct and public intoxication. His friend the poet Allen Tate helped him get the job at the University of Minnesota.Healy, Steve (September 9, 1998). \\"John Berryman: The Dreamer Awakes.\\" City Pages. Personal life and death Berryman was married three times. According to the editors of The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry, he lived turbulently. During one of the many times he was hospitalized for alcohol abuse, in 1970, he experienced what he termed \\"a sort of religious conversion\\". According to his biographer Paul Mariani, Berryman experienced \\"a sudden and radical shift from a belief in a transcendent God ... to a belief in a God who cared for the individual fates of human beings and who even interceded for them.\\" Nevertheless, Berryman continued to abuse alcohol and struggle with depression, as he had throughout much of his life, and on the morning of January 7, 1972, he killed himself by jumping from the Washington Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis onto the west bank of the Mississippi River. Poetry Berryman's poetry, which often revolves around the sordid details of his personal problems, is closely associated with the Confessional poetry movement. In this sense, his poetry had much in common with the poetry of his friend, Robert Lowell. The editors of The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry note that \\"the influence of Yeats, Auden, Hopkins, Crane, and Pound on him was strong, and Berryman's own voice‚Äîby turns nerve-racked and sportive‚Äîtook some time to be heard.\\" Berryman's first major work, in which he began to develop his own style, was Homage to Mistress Bradstreet. In the long, title poem, which first appeared in Partisan Review in 1953, Berryman addresses the 17th- century American poet Anne Bradstreet, combining her life history with his fantasies about her (and inserting himself into the poem). Joel Athey noted, \\"This difficult poem, a tribute to the Puritan poet of colonial America, took Berryman five years to complete and demanded much from the reader when it first appeared with no notes. The Times Literary Supplement hailed it as a path-breaking masterpiece; poet Robert Fitzgerald called it 'the poem of his generation.'\\"Athey, Joel. American National Biography. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. Copyright ¬© 1999 by the American Council of Learned Societies. Edward Hirsch observed that \\"the 57 stanzas of Homage to Mistress Bradstreet combine the concentration of an extended lyric with the erudition and amplitude of a historical novel\\".Hirsch, Edward. \\"Taking glee in the past\\". The New York Times October 8, 1989. Berryman's major poetic breakthrough came after the first volume of The Dream Songs, 77 Dream Songs, in 1964. The dream song form consists of short, 18-line lyric poems in three stanzas. They are in free verse, with some stanzas containing irregular rhyme. 77 Dream Songs (and its sequel His Toy, His Dream, His Rest) centers on a character named Henry who bears a striking resemblance to Berryman, but Berryman was careful to make sure his readers realized that Henry was a fictional version of himself (or a literary alter ego). In an interview, Berryman said, \\"Henry does resemble me, and I resemble Henry; but on the other hand I am not Henry. You know, I pay income tax; Henry pays no income tax. And bats come over and they stall in my hair ‚Äî and fuck them, I'm not Henry; Henry doesn't have any bats.\\"\\"An Interview with John Berryman\\" conducted by John Plotz of the Harvard Advocate on Oct. 27, 1968.

John Malcolm Brinnin, reviewing 77 Dream Songs in The New York Times, wrote that its \\"excellence calls for celebration\\".Brinner, John Malcolm. \\"The Last Minstrel.\\" New York Times. 23 August 1964. Robert Lowell wrote in The New York Review of Books, \\"At first the brain aches and freezes at so much darkness, disorder and oddness. After a while, the repeated situations and their racy jabber become more and more enjoyable, although even now I wouldn't trust myself to paraphrase accurately at least half the sections.\\"Robert Lowell, \\"John Berryman\\" in Robert Giroux, Ed., Collected Prose (New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1987) 107-108. In response to the perceived difficulty of the dream songs, in his 366th \\"Dream Song\\", Berryman facetiously wrote, \\"These Songs are not meant to be understood, you understand. / They are only meant to terrify & comfort\\". In His Toy, His Dream, His Rest, many of the dream songs are elegies for Berryman's recently deceased poet friends, including Delmore Schwartz, Randall Jarrell, and Theodore Roethke. The volume contains four times as many poems as the previous one, and covers more subject matter. For instance, in addition to the elegies, Berryman writes about his trip to Ireland, as well as his own burgeoning literary fame. Berryman's last two volumes of poetry, Love & Fame and Delusions, Etc., featured free-verse poems that were much more straightforward and less idiosyncratic than The Dream Songs. Before Love & Fame's publication, Berryman sent his manuscript to several peers for feedback, including the poets Adrienne Rich and Richard Wilbur, both of whom were disappointed with the poems, which they considered inferior to those of The Dream Songs. But some of Berryman's old friends and supporters, including Lowell, the novelist Saul Bellow, and the poet William Meredith, offered high praise for a number of the Love & Fame poems. Love & Fame and Delusions, Etc. were more openly \\"confessional\\" than Berryman's earlier verse, and also explored the nature of his spiritual rebirth in poems like \\"Eleven Addresses to the Lord\\" (which Lowell thought one of Berryman's best poems and \\"one of the great poems of the age\\") and \\"Certainty Before Lunch\\". In 1977 John Haffenden published Henry's Fate & Other Poems, a selection of dream songs that Berryman wrote after His Toy, His Dream, His Rest but did not publish. According to Time magazine's review, \\"Posthumous selections of unpublished poetry should be viewed suspiciously. The dead poet may have had good aesthetic reasons for keeping some of his work to himself. Fortunately, Henry's Fate does not malign the memory of John Berryman\\".Gray, Paul. \\"A Quartet of Poets Singing Solo.\\" Time. 21 March 1977. Berryman's Collected Poems--1937-1971, edited and introduced by Charles Thornbury, was published in 1989. Robert Giroux decided to omit The Dream Songs from the collection. In his review of the Collected Poems, Edward Hirsch said of this decision, \\"It is obviously practical to continue to publish the 385 dream songs separately, but reading the Collected Poems without them is a little like eating a seven-course meal without a main course.\\" Hirsch also wrote that, \\"[Collected Poems features] a thorough nine- part introduction and a chronology as well as helpful appendixes that include Berryman's published prefaces, notes and dedications; a section of editor's notes, guidelines and procedures; and an account of the poems in their final stages of composition and publication.\\" In 2004, the Library of America published John Berryman: Selected Poems, edited by the poet Kevin Young. In Poetry magazine, David Orr wrote: > Young includes all the Greatest Hits [from Berryman's career] ... but there > are also substantial excerpts from Berryman's Sonnets (the peculiar book > that appeared after The Dream Songs, but was written long before) and > Berryman's later, overtly religious poetry. Young argues that \\"if his > middle, elegiac period ... is most in need of rediscovery, then these late > poems are most in need of redemption.\\" It's a good point.

Poetry. December 2005. After surveying Berryman's career and accomplishments, the editors of The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry wrote, \\"What seems likely to survive of his poetry is its pungent and many-leveled portrait of a complex personality which, for all its eccentricity, stayed close to the center of the intellectual and emotional life of the mid-century and after.\\" In popular culture *Berryman's ghost is a character in Thomas Disch's novel The Businessman: A Tale of Terror, published in 1984. *The Hold Steady's song \\"Stuck Between Stations\\" from the 2006 album Boys and Girls in America relates a loose rendition of Berryman's death, describing the isolation he felt, despite his critical acclaim, and depicting him walking with \\"the devil\\" on the Washington Avenue Bridge where he committed suicide. *Okkervil River's song \\"John Allyn Smith Sails\\" from their 2007 album The Stage Names is about Berryman. *Australian singer/songwriter Nick Cave has cited Berryman's influence on the composition of his 1992 album Henry's Dream, and also expressed his admiration overtly in the song \\"We Call Upon the Author\\" from the 2007 album Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! *Phish bassist Mike Gordon's side-project band has performed \\"Dream Song 22-'Of 1826'\\", releasing it on a live album, The Egg. Additionally, on March 30, 2014, their show featured a rendition of \\"The Poet's Final Instructions\\". *Berryman's Dream Song 235 is referenced in Elizabeth Strout's novel Olive Kitteridge and its HBO adaption with the quotation, \\"Save us from shotguns & fathers' suicides.\\" *Berryman's poem \\"The Curse\\" is referenced in the prologue of Tracy Letts's play August: Osage County by the character Beverly, a poet who later commits suicide. * On 14 January 1974 the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired The Hours of John Berryman, a 60-minute commentary on Berryman's \\"Opus Dei\\" (the 8-poem sequence that opens Delusions) by Canadian scholar and critic George Whalley. John Reeves produced the broadcast. * Irish poet Desmond Egan contemplates Berryman's suicide in \\"For John Berryman\\", which appears in his 2008 collection September Dandelion.

Biography Martinez was born in C√≥rdoba, and studied there until 1900, when he started his military service. He later studied law at the National University of C√≥rdoba, receiving a degree in 1911. Martinez was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1917 to fill the seat vacated by Vice President Elpidio Gonz√°lez. He was elected Governor of C√≥rdoba in December 1927, with Jos√© Antonio Ceballos as Vice-Governor, and took office on May 17, 1928. The death, on July 22, of Vice President-elect Francisco Beir√≥, prompted President-elect Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen to ask Mart√≠nez to take the late Francisco Beir√≥'s place, and on October 12, 1928, he was inaugurated Vice President of Argentina. Following a series of incidents organized against the populist Yrigoyen, on September 5, 1930, the President took a leave of health, and Mart√≠nez assumed the presidency on an acting basis. A coup d'√©tat overthrew the Yrigoyen administration the following day, however, and both he and Mart√≠nez was jailed for two years. Mart√≠nez moved to Buenos Aires in 1934, and retired from public life. While riding horseback in Villa Mar√≠a, C√≥rdoba, in 1938, he suffered an accident, and died at age 51.

His works included compositions in a variety of genres, including two symphonies (No 2 premiered at the Proms in 1908)Lloyd, Stephen. H Balfour Gardiner (2005), but many of his scores, including the symphonies, are lost and only a very limited amount of his music survives. His best-known work Evening Hymn (1908), a setting of the compline hymn \\"Te lucis ante terminum\\", is a lush, romantic work for eight-part choir and organ, of dense harmonies. For most of the time, it sits in four parts, though the treble, alto, tenor, and bass parts all subdivide at various points. It is considered a classic of the English choral repertoire and is still regularly performed as an anthem at Evensong in Anglican churches.The Evening Hour, Signum 446 (2016) The fame of this work has overshadowed his surviving orchestral works, which include Overture to a Comedy (1906, revised 1911)Overtures From the British Isles, Chandos 10797 (2014), the Percy Grainger-like Shepherd Fennell's Dance (1911)Anthony Collins Conducts British Music, Beulah (2008) (once a favourite at the Proms, chalking up 35 performances between 1911 and 1951)BBC Proms Performance Archive, and the Delius-like A Berkshire Idyll, the latter written in 1913 at Field House, Ashampstead Green in Berkshire, where he lived between 1911 and 1930. The first performance of the Idyll (along with two other unpublished pieces, Philomela and the choral setting April), took place on 6 May 1955 at the Royal Festival Hall, 42 years after its completion.'New Era Concert', The Times, 7 May 1955, p 3 It was recorded in 2017 for the first time.British Tone Poems, Volume 1, Chandos 10939 (2017) Also surviving are a number of short piano worksBalfour Gardiner, Piano Works, played by Peter Jacobs, Continuum (2015) and songs.Balfour Gardiner: The Complete Songs, Regent Records (2015) Gardiner's most important work, possibly, was his promotion of the music of contemporary British and colonial composers, particularly through a series of concerts he personally financed at Queen's Hall London in 1912 to 1913. The composers represented included Arnold Bax, Frederic Austin, Gustav Holst, Percy Grainger, Roger Quilter, Cyril Scott and Norman O'Neill. (The last four had also studied with him at Frankfurt.) Gardiner was very generous with his personal fortune, paying for a private benefit performance of The Planets for Holst in 1918 and purchasing Frederick Delius's house at Grez-sur-Loing to enable him to continue living in it at the end of his life. In the early 1920s he also became a patron of Charles Kennedy Scott, conductor and founder of the Philharmonic Choir which was the predecessor of the present London Philharmonic Choir.The Observer, Profile ‚Äì KENNEDY SCOTT.

When Dave Catlin-Birch is on tour, he was usually replaced by Honka James Roby. Brown replaced original regular Richard Vranch in 2003. Thus the show usually followed the format: *Introduction Song in which the regulars and guests are introduced. *Short interview with the guests, usually playing a snippet from one of their hits or a performance of the first song they ever wrote. This usually turns into an innuendo, and the performance is stopped by Rivron just before it becomes too explicit. *Feature from one of the regulars (ABBA/Beatles backwards / \\"Two Songs for the Price of One\\" / \\"Beatles per Minute\\"). *Bass Line: the bassist plays a bass line, and the other member of the band (except Rivron) try to guess from which song it comes. *Mixing Styles: One guest suggests a musical style, and other a singer/band, and styles are combined, e.g. 'Roll with It' by Oasis in the style of Jerry Lee Lewis. The roles are then reversed, with the other guest performing. *Party Pieces Guests will perform their musical party piece, or they have to sing one of their well-known songs inserting words suggested by the rest of the band. *Audience: Members of the audience call out different words and the band have to try to think of songs that include the word, and play a sample of that song. *Concluding jam drawn from the last of the songs played from the feature above, or in earlier series, \\"they song we enjoyed playing most today\\", which could any song performed during the show. *The programme is punctuated by snippets from a song sung in varying styles (e.g. a cappella, Country and Western, Bob Dylan-esque) as announced at the end of the programme \\"Jammin' was brought to you in association with....\\" However, the Autumn 2006 series did not include this information.

Vi. Ka, was a Tamil scholar, essayist and activist. He is esteemed for the strong humanism of his essays, the analytical depth of his commentaries on classical Tamil literature and philosophy, and the clear, fluid style of his prose. His works, along with those of V. O. Chidambaram Pillai, Maraimalai Adigal, and Arumuga Navalar, are considered to have defined the style of modern Tamil prose. History Thiru Vi.Kalyanasundaram was born in Tuluva Vellala family in the village of Thullam, presently called Thandalam in Chengalpet district, near Chennai in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu on 26 August 1883. His family moved to Thiruvarur as his father got transferred. He attended the Wesley College High School, and also studied Tamil under Maraimalai Adigal and N. Kathiravel Pillai of Jaffna. He worked briefly as a teacher and, in 1917, became an editorial assistant on Desabaktan, a nationalist, Tamil daily newspaper. Thiru Vi. Ka. was soon involved in various aspects of the independence movement. During this period, he became a strong campaigner for worker rights. In 1918 he became active in the trade union movement as an associate of BP Wadia and organised the first trade unions in the south of India. Contribution to literature In 1920, Thiru. Vi. Ka. started a new Tamil weekly magazine, titled Navasakthi. Navasakthi would be the vehicle for his thoughts for much of the rest of his life. Thiru Vi. Ka. sought to make his magazine a beacon to the Tamil people. His writings reflected his political and philosophical views. He published one of the first Tamil interpretations of the thought of Mahatma Gandhi, which is still regarded as an important milestone in Gandhian studies. He wrote a number of works on the religious and spiritual thought of Ramalinga Swamigal, an influential Tamil Saivite philosopher-saint of the 19th century. He wrote commentaries on a number of works of classical Tamil literature, which appeared as serials in Navasakthi. Over the course of his writing career, Thiru Vi. Ka. published over fifty books. These include Manitha Vazhkkaiyum Gandhiyadigalum, a study of the implications of Gandhi's thought for human conduct. His Pennin perumai allatu valkait tunai nalam was one of the most read books of that period. Also very influential, albeit at a more critical level, is his study of the concept of Beauty in Hinduism, published as Murugan alladhu azaku(Lord Murugan or Beauty). His writings reflect the internationalism characteristic of Indian intellectuals of that period, a strong pride in Indian and Tamil culture, coupled with a strong belief in the unity and universal kinship of all human thought. In his writings, Thiru Vi. Ka. developed a prose style which built on the inner rhythms of the Tamil language and produced a rhythmic, flowing text. The field of Tamil prose was still relatively new, and the style he developed was extremely influential. His works are today seen as having given a new energy to the Tamil language and regarded as part of the foundations on which the modern Tamil prose style has been built. Politics Through this period, Thiru Vi. Ka. continued to remain active in politics and the Indian independence struggle. He was considered to be one of the three pillars of the Indian National Congress in Tamil Nadu, even becoming the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee in 1926. He spent much time touring Tamil Nadu, making speeches on the need for independence. He remained active well into his sixties, and did not retire from politics until Indian independence in 1947. Death Thiru Vi. Ka. died on 17 September 1953 at the age of 71.

He studied under Alfredo Casella in Rome, returning to France in 1946. Around this time he founded the \\"Groupe Zodiaque\\", which fought against prevailing musical dogma. His mature musical style shows the influence of Mediterranean folk music, particularly the Andalusian cante jondo. In 1976 he took French citizenship.

In 1926, it was re- published as The Tale of Samuel Whiskers. The book is dedicated to the author's fancy rat \\"Sammy\\" and tells of Tom Kitten's escape from two rats who plan to make him into a pudding. The tale was adapted to animation in 1993.  Plot  The theme of the tale is the childhood sin of disobedience.Taylor 137 Tom Kitten is a young cat who lives with his mother, Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, and sisters, Moppet and Mittens, in a house overrun with rats. Her children being an unruly bunch, Mrs. Twitchit puts Moppet and Mittens in a cupboard in order to keep them under control, but Tom Kitten escapes up the chimney. As he makes his way to the top of the house, he comes across a crack in the wall and, squeezing through it, finds himself under the attic's floorboards. There he meets the rats, Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife Anna Maria. They catch him and proceed to cover him with butter and dough they have stolen in order to eat him as a pudding. They are seen by the two other Kittens who are hiding from their mother as they steal the dough, butter, and rolling-pin. However, when they proceed to settle the dough with a rolling-pin, the noise gets through the floorboards and attracts the attention of Tabitha Twitchit and her cousin Ribby who has been helping search for Tom. They quickly call for John Joiner, the carpenter, who saws open the floor and rescues Tom. He has the dough removed, is washed, and the remains of the dumpling are eaten by the family. Whiskers and his wife escape to the barn of Farmer Potatoes, spreading their chaos to another location, though leaving the cat family residence in peace. Potter mentions herself as seeing Samuel Whiskers and Anna Maria making their escape, using a wheelbarrow that looks like her own. Tom is so affected by the incident that while his sisters become fine rat-catchers he is afraid of anything larger than a mouse.  Composition and publication  Hill Top Farm in Cumbria was the setting for Samuel Whiskers The tale is the sequel Potter promised readers at the end of The Tale of Tom Kitten and is set in the interior of the house at Hill Top Farm. The storyline was inspired by an invasion of rats Potter experienced after purchasing the place.Lear 223-4 The tale was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1908 in a large 5 by 8 format (rather than the series usual 4 by 5) and dedicated to Potter's long deceased pet rat, \\"Sammy\\" or Mr. Samuel Whiskers. In 1926, the book was republished as The Tale of Mr. Samuel Whiskers in the small format of the series.Lear 337  Characters  Anna Maria and Samuel Whiskers prepare Tom Kitten as a roly-poly pudding *Samuel Whiskers is a bold, snuff-taking, \\"enormous old rat\\". He and his wife Anna Maria are thieves. Whiskers appears in the text and illustrations in The Tale of Ginger and Pickles where he has run up a bill for bacon. *Anna Maria, Samuel Whiskers' wife. *Tom Kitten a naughty Kitten. *Mittens and Moppet are Tom's mischievous sisters. At the end of the tale, they have become rat-catchers and display their trophies (in the form of their victims' tails) on the barn door. Both appeared in The Tale of Tom Kitten of 1907. Moppet starred in her own book, The Story of Miss Moppet in 1906. *Tabitha Twitchit is described as \\"an old cat\\" and \\"an anxious parent\\". She is continually losing her mischievous kittens. She is a village shopkeeper in The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan and The Tale of Ginger and Pickles. *Ribby is Tabitha's neighbour and cousin. She stops by Tabitha's house to borrow yeast, is not afraid of rats, and remains to search for Tom. She is one of the two central characters in The Tale of the Pie and the Patty- Pan (1905). *Farmer Potatoes is the narrator's neighbour. Whiskers and Anna Maria take up residence in his barn after John Joiner discovers their retreat under the attic floorboards. He was based on Potter's neighbour Poslethwaite,Hallinan 71 and appears in one illustration modelled on a photograph. *John Joiner, the carpenter dog, removes the floorboard to release Tom. The character was based on John Taylor, the repair man at Sawrey. *Miss Potter is depicted in one illustration observing Samuel Whiskers and Anna Maria entering Farmer Potatoes gate with their bundles in her wheelbarrow. Illustrations The book's large 5 by 8-inch format allowed Potter to include black and white line drawings and to lavish greater detail on the colour illustrations.MacDonald 104 The kitchen range, the staircase, the front door, the dresser and other details of Hill Top are all depicted in the illustrations. After purchasing Hill Top, Potter found less time and opportunity to work up illustrations and began to rely more and more on photographs to complete her work during the winter or while sojourning in London. Farmer Potatoes was Potter's real world neighbour Postlethwaite and the illustration was modelled on a photograph. The original sketch of Tabitha standing on the staircase searching for Tom has the head of the cat cut out and pasted in place. It is unknown if this was done because the original was wrong or that Potter was seeking a dimensional effect. Randolph Caldecott was an inspiration for Potter and his influence is evident in the depictions of Samuel Whiskers and Anna Maria who were modelled on the Rat and Miss Mousey in the illustrations for his \\"A Frog He Would A-Wooing Go\\". Potter's Jeremy Fisher was based on Caldecott's Frog.Taylor 136-9 Some children wondered if Potter used a trussed-up kitten as a live model in her depiction of Tom Kitten waiting to be rolled into a pudding.  Critical commentary  Potter had considerable experience drawing rats, mice, and cats before approaching Samuel Whiskers but the book is exceptional in her oeuvre for the many interior scenes at Hill Top and the character and personality of the domineering Samuel Whiskers.

Butterworth published a dramatic adaptation of the tale as Mr. Samuel Whiskers.MacDonald 129 In 1993, an animated film adaptation was telecast on the BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends with the voices of Rosemary Leach as Tabitha Twitchet, John Gordon Sinclair as John Joiner, Patricia Routledge as Ribby, Struan Rodger as Samuel Whiskers, and Sheila Hancock as Anna Maria.

He was the only person to sign each of the three Humanist Manifestos of 1933, 1973, and 2003.  Biography  Mondale was born in Walnut Grove, Minnesota, the son of Methodist minister and World War I hero Theodore Sigvaard Mondale and Jessie Alice Larson. Although his family was Methodist, he converted to Unitarianism while earning his B.A. from Hamline University. In 1926 Mondale entered the Unitarian ministry and in 1929 he earned an S.T.B. from Harvard Divinity School. He was ordained by the New North Unitarian Church, Hingham, Massachusetts, and went on to serve congregations in Evanston, Illinois, Kansas City, Missouri; Birmingham, Michigan; White Plains, New York; Tempe, Arizona; and Quincy, Illinois. His younger half-brother was Walter Mondale, Vice-President of the United States under Jimmy Carter. In 1933, Mondale was the youngest to sign A Humanist Manifesto and was also signatory to the 1973 Humanist Manifesto II. At age 99, he was the oldest to sign the 2003 Humanism and Its Aspirations and was the only signatory to all three documents. He died shortly afterwards. Mondale was a member of the American Humanist Association (AHA) since its inception and received its Humanist Pioneer award in 1973 and the Humanist Founder award in 2001.

It is the second- largest bank in Mexico. The Banamex Financial Group was purchased by Citigroup in August 2001 for $12.5 billion USD. It continues to operate as a Citigroup subsidiary. History Banamex was formed on 2 June 1884 from the merger of two banks, Banco Nacional Mexicano and Banco Mercantil Mexicano, which had operated since the beginning of 1882. The newly founded bank had branches in M√©rida, Veracruz, Puebla, Guanajuato and San Luis Potos√≠, and opened a branch in Guadalajara. After the start of World War I, the French managers of the bank left Mexico. After 10 years, Agust√≠n Legorreta Ram√≠rez who served as acting president managed to revive the bank. Following its reorganization, the bank collaborated with Banco de Mexico and US government officials. By 1937, 36 out of 50 bank branches in Mexico were owned by Banamex. Banamex gradually introduced several financial product innovations to the Mexican market including the first credit cards in 1968 and an ATM banking system in 1972. In 1977, Grupo Banamex was formed by merging the bank with its investment and mortgage assets. Four years later, Banamex acquired the California Commerce Bank. historic center of Mexico City. During a severe economic crisis in 1982, then Mexican president Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo announced a major devaluation of the peso and nationalized all private banks in Mexico. For the next nine years, Banamex operated as a government-owned national credit association. In 1991, Banamex was reprivatized and it established Grupo Financiero Banamex‚ÄìAccival with the investment bank Acciones y Valores de M√©xico (Accival). It had 720 branch offices, 31,797 employees, assets of $26.2 billion and a customer base of four million people making it the largest financial group in Latin America at the time. As a result of the private credit aggressive expansion in Mexico, resulted in a strain of the bank's balance sheet (loan portfolio quality ratios and capitalization ratios). The December 1994 macro-devaluation of the Mexican pesos and the ensuing significant increase in domestic interest rates coupled with a dramatic economic recession, caused Banamex's and much of the rest of the privatized banks to essentially become insolvent. Banamex former logo used from the 1990s until 2016 In order to avoid the potentially catastrophic effects of generalized bank bankruptcies, the Ernesto Zedillo administration decided to rescue the troubled banks through a government fund (Instituto de Protecci√≥n al Ahorro Bancario or IPAB, later called Fondo Bancario de Protecci√≥n al Ahorro or Fobaproa). IPAB enticed the banks' shareholders to inject fresh equity into the banks by pledging to buy from the banks non-performing loans in a two to one (or in some cases greater) ratio with respect to the newly injected fresh capital in exchange for a long-dated government note with capitalized interest. Banamex eventually sold $_ worth of non-performing loans to IPAB, and its shareholders injected $_ of fresh equity. The combination of these measures coupled with a recovery of the Mexican economy helped clean up the bank's balance sheet. From 1997 to 2001 Roberto Hern√°ndez Ram√≠rez was the CEO. In 1997, Afore Banamex was created to access the newly created private pension fund market. On 6 August 2001, Citigroup Inc. acquired Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival for US$12.5 billion, which became Grupo Financiero Banamex. This was the largest-ever U.S.-Mexico corporate merger. Grupo Financiero Banamex's operations were integrated with Citibank's relatively small existing Mexico business under the Banamex brand name. In October 2014, allegations were made that employees had taken millions of dollars in kickbacks from vendors. Authorities in Mexico and the United States are investigating the allegations. Citigroup encouraged Manuel Medina-Mora to resign. Subsidiaries A Banamex ATM in Puerto Vallarta The following are subsidiaries of Grupo Financiero Banamex: * Banamex * Accival * Afore Banamex * Seguros Banamex * Arrendadora Banamex * Operadora e Impulsora de Negocios * Acci√≥n Banamex * Pensiones Banamex * Fomento Cultural * Fomento Social =Banamex USA= After Citigroup's purchase of Banamex in 2001, Banamex decided to expand into the U.S. by opening a subsidiary in the country and creating Banamex USA. Most of the bank branches were located in the Southwest with branches in California, Texas, and Arizona. The U.S. subsidiary didn't last long though and was shut down in 2015 after a 6-year investigation into Citigroup's and Grupo Financiero Banamex' money laundering scheme by the U.S. Department of Justice. This resulted in Citigroup having to pay a $140 million fine.

Direct zinc smelting appears to have been unknown in Europe until the mid-18th century, even though the alloyed calamine brass was in use for centuries, and metallic zinc was produced directly via reducing-atmosphere smelting in India and China from the 12th century CE onwards. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc and, when it was first developed, methods for producing metallic zinc were unknown. Metallurgists wishing to produce brass thus used calamine (actually a mixture of the virtually indistinguishable zinc ores smithsonite and hemimorphite) as the zinc component of brass. The resulting brasses, produced by heating a mixture of copper and calamine to a high temperature for several hours (allowing zinc vapor to distill from the ores and permeate the metallic copper), contained a significant amount of slag material resulting from the non-zinc components of calamine. The use of ore rather than metallic zinc also made it difficult to accurately produce the desired final proportion of copper to zinc. This process is known as cementation. Calamine brass was produced using proportions of two-sevenths fine copper, four-sevenths calamine, and one-seventh shruff (old plate brass). Calamine brass was the first type of brass produced, probably starting during the 1st millennium BC, and was not replaced in Europe by other brass manufactures until the 18th century (it is likely that Indian brass manufacturers had developed more advanced techniques some centuries earlier). The area around La Calamine, now Kelmis, in Belgium, was the source of much of the medieval brass of northern Europe. Brass production was introduced to England in 1587 when several members of the Company of Mineral and Battery Works obtained a licence from the company (within whose monopoly it was) to build a brass works at Isleworth. However a decade later the company obstructed the owners from mining calamine. A plaque at Tintern Abbey claims that the well-known brassworks at this site began in 1568.Near this place in the year 1568 Brass was first made by alloying Copper with Zinc. To commemorate the event and on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of the National Brassfoundry Association, this plaque was erected in 1957 The plaque also claims though that the brass was made with copper and zinc, which is so unlikely at this date as to make the claimed date also slightly suspect. New brass works were built by Jacob Momma, a German immigrant in 1649 at Esher, probably using Swedish copper. After the passing of the Mines Royal Act in 1689, further works were built near Bristol, where brass production became a major industry in the 18th century. Later brass production sites in England included Cheadle and Birmingham. Calamine brass was slowly phased out as zinc smelting techniques were developed in Europe, which produced metallic zinc more suitable for brass production than calamine. However, the conversion away from calamine brass manufacture was slow; a British patent was awarded to William Champion in 1738, but the alloying of metallic zinc and copper to produce brass was not patented until 1781 (by James Emerson), and calamine brass mills persisted in South Wales until as late as 1858. The slow diffusion of this technology was probably the result of economic factors.

From Analyst to Leader: Elevating the Role of the Business Analyst Management Concepts, 2008. . p94: \\"As the discipline of business analysis becomes professionalized\\" of identifying business needs and determining solutions to business problems. Solutions often include a software-systems development component, but may also consist of process improvement, organizational change or strategic planning and policy development. The person who carries out this task is called a business analyst or BA. Business analysts do not work solely on developing software systems. But work across the organisation, solving business problems in consultation with business stakeholders. Whilst most of the work that business analysts do today relate to software development/solutions, this derives from the ongoing massive changes businesses all over the world are experiencing in their attempts to digitise. Although there are different role definitions, depending upon the organization, there does seem to be an area of common ground where most business analysts work. The responsibilities appear to be: * To investigate business systems, taking a holistic view of the situation. This may include examining elements of the organisation structures and staff development issues as well as current processes and IT systems. * To evaluate actions to improve the operation of a business system. Again, this may require an examination of organisational structure and staff development needs, to ensure that they are in line with any proposed process redesign and IT system development. * To document the business requirements for the IT system support using appropriate documentation standards. In line with this, the core business analyst role could be defined as an internal consultancy role that has the responsibility for investigating business situations, identifying and evaluating options for improving business systems, defining requirements and ensuring the effective use of information systems in meeting the needs of the business. Sub-disciplines Business analysis as a discipline includes requirements analysis, sometimes also called requirements engineering. It focuses on ensuring the changes made to an organisation are aligned with its strategic goals. These changes include changes to strategies, structures, policies, business rules, processes, and information systems. Examples of business analysis include: =Enterprise analysis or company analysis= Focuses on understanding the needs of the business as a whole, its strategic direction, and identifying initiatives that will allow a business to meet those strategic goals. It also includes: * Creating and maintaining the business architecture * Conducting feasibility studies * Identifying new business opportunities * Scoping and defining new business opportunities * Preparing the business case * Conducting the initial risk assessment =Requirements planning and management= Involves planning the requirements development process, determining which requirements are the highest priority for implementation, and managing change. =Requirements elicitation= Describes techniques for collecting requirements from stakeholders in a project. Techniques for requirements elicitation include: * Brainstorming * Document analysis * Focus group * Interface analysis * Interviews/Questionnaire * Workshops * Reverse engineering * Surveys * User task analysis * Process mapping * Observation/job shadowing * Design thinking *Prototyping =Requirements analysis and documentation= Describes how to develop and specify requirements in enough detail to allow them to be successfully implemented by a project team. Analysis The major forms of analysis are: * Architecture analysis * Business process analysis * Object- oriented analysis * Structured analysis * Data warehouse analysis, storage and databases analysis Documentation Requirements documentation can take several forms: * Textual ‚Äì for example, stories that summarize specific information * Matrix ‚Äì for example, a table of requirements with priorities * Diagrams ‚Äì for example, how data flows from one structure to the other * Wireframe ‚Äì for example, how elements are required in a website, * Models ‚Äì for example, 3-D models that describes a character in a computer game =Requirements communication= Describes techniques for ensuring that stakeholders have a shared understanding of the requirements and how they will be implemented. =Solution assessment and validation= Describes how the business analyst can perform correctness of a proposed solution, how to support the implementation of a solution, and how to assess possible shortcomings in the implementation. Techniques There are a number of generic business techniques that a business analyst will use when facilitating business change. Some of these techniques include: =PESTLE= This is used to perform an external environmental analysis by examining the many different external factors affecting an organization. The six attributes of PESTLE: :Political (current and potential influences from political pressures) :Economic (the local, national and world economy impact) :Sociological (the ways in which a society can affect an organization) :Technological (the effect of new and emerging technology) :Legal (the effect of national and world legislation) :Environmental (the local, national and world environmental issues) =Heptalysis= This is used to perform an in-depth analysis of early stage businesses/ventures on seven important categories: :Market opportunity :Product/solution :Execution plan :Financial engine :Human capital :Potential return :Margin of safety =STEER= Is essentially another take on PESTLE. You will notice it factors in the same elements of PESTLE and shouldn't be considered a tool on its own except an author/user prefers to use this acronym as opposed to PESTLE. STEER puts into consideration ‚Äì the following : Socio- cultural : Technological : Economic : Ecological : Regulatory Factors =MOST= This is used to perform an internal environmental analysis by defining the attributes of MOST to ensure that the project you are working on is aligned to each of the four attributes. The four attributes of MOST are: : :Mission (where the business intends to go) :Objectives (the key goals which will help achieve the mission) :Strategies (options for moving forward) :Tactics (how strategies are put into action) =SWOT= SWOT is used to help focus activities into areas of strength and where the greatest opportunities lie. This is used to identify the dangers that take the form of weaknesses and both internal and external threats. The four attributes of SWOT analysis are: :Strengths ‚Äì What are the advantages? What is currently done well? (e.g. key area of best-performing activities of your company) :Weaknesses ‚Äì What should be improved? What is there to overcome? (e.g. key area where you are performing unsatisfactorily) :Opportunities ‚Äì What good opportunities face the organization? (e.g. key area where your competitors are performing poorly) :Threats ‚Äì What obstacles does the organization face? (e.g. key area where your competitor will perform well) =CATWOE= This is used to prompt thinking about what the business is trying to achieve. Business perspectives help the business analyst to consider the impact of any proposed solution on the people involved. There are six elements of CATWOE: :Customers ‚Äì Who are the beneficiaries of the highest level business process and how does the issue affect them? :Actors ‚Äì Who is involved in the situation, who will be involved in implementing solutions and what will impact their success? :Transformation Process ‚Äì What processes or systems are affected by the issue? :World View ‚Äì What is the big picture and what are the wider impacts of the issue? :Owner ‚Äì Who owns the process or situation being investigated and what role will they play in the solution? :Environmental Constraints ‚Äì What are the constraints and limitations that will impact the solution and its success? =de Bono's Six Thinking Hats= This is often used in a brainstorming session to generate and analyse ideas and options. It is useful to encourage specific types of thinking and can be a convenient and symbolic way to request someone to \\"switch gears\\". It involves restricting the group to only thinking in specific ways ‚Äì giving ideas & analysis in the \\"mood\\" of the time. Also known as the Six Thinking Hats. :White: Pure facts, logical. :Green: Creative. :Yellow: Bright, optimistic, positive. :Black: Negative, devil‚Äôs advocate. :Red: Emotional. :Blue: Cold, control. Not all colors / moods have to be used. =Five Whys= Five Whys is used to get to the root of what is really happening in a single instance. For each answer given a further 'why' is asked. =MoSCoW= This is used to prioritize requirements by allocating an appropriate priority, gauging it against the validity of the requirement itself and its priority against other requirements. MoSCoW comprises: :Must have ‚Äì or else delivery will be a failure :Should have ‚Äì otherwise will have to adopt a workaround :Could have ‚Äì to increase delivery satisfaction :Won't have this time ‚Äì useful to the exclude requirements from this delivery timeframe =VPEC-T= This technique is used when analyzing the expectations of multiple parties having different views of a system in which they all have an interest in common, but have different priorities and different responsibilities. :Values ‚Äì constitute the objectives, beliefs and concerns of all parties participating. They may be financial, social, tangible and intangible :Policies ‚Äì constraints that govern what may be done and the manner in which it may be done :Events ‚Äì real-world proceedings that stimulate activity :Content ‚Äì the meaningful portion of the documents, conversations, messages, etc. that are produced and used by all aspects of business activity :Trust ‚Äì between users of the system and their right to access and change information within it =SCRS= The SCRS approach in business analysis claims that the analysis should flow from the high-level business strategy to the solution, through the current state and the requirements. SCRS stands for: :Strategy :Current State :Requirements :Solution =Business Analysis Canvas= The Business Analysis Canvas is a tool that enables Business Analyst to quickly present a high level view of the activities that will be completed as part of the business analysis work allocation. The Business Analysis Canvas is broken into several sections. : Project Objective : Stakeholder : Deliverable : Impact to Target Operating Model : Communication Approach : Responsibilities : Scheduling : Key Dates The Canvas has activities and questions the Business analyst can ask the organization to help build out the content.https://www.batimes.com/articles/business-analysis-canvas-roadmap-to- effective-ba-excellence.html# =Business Process Analysis= Processes are modeled visually to understand the current state and the models appear in levels to understand the enablers that are influencing a particular businesses process. At the highest level of the models are end-to-end business processes that would be common to many businesses. Below that business process level would be a level of activities, sub-activities and finally tasks. The task level is the most granular and when modeled depicts a particular workflow. As business processes get documented on the workflow level, they become more heavily influenced or \\"enabled\\" by characteristics that impact that particular businesses. These \\"workflow enablers\\" are considered to be Workflow Design, Information Systems/IT, Motivation and Measurement, Human Resources & Organization, Policies and Rules, and Facilities/Physical Environment. This technique of process leveling and analysis assists business analysts in understanding what is really required for a particular business and where there are possibilities to re-engineer a process for greater efficiency in the future state. Roles of business analysts As the scope of business analysis is very wide, there has been a tendency for business analysts to specialize in one of the three sets of activities which constitute the scope of business analysis, the primary role for business analysts is to identify business needs, define requirements, and provide solutions to business problems these are done as being a part of following set of activities. ; Strategist : Organizations need to focus on strategic matters on a more or less continuous basis in the modern business world. Business analysts, serving this need, are well-versed in analyzing the strategic profile of the organization and its environment, advising senior management on suitable policies, and the effects of policy decisions. ; Architect : Organizations may need to introduce change to solve business problems which may have been identified by the strategic analysis, referred to above. Business analysts contribute by analyzing objectives, processes and resources, and suggesting ways by which re-design (BPR), or improvements (BPI) could be made. Particular skills of this type of analyst are \\"soft skills\\", such as knowledge of the business, requirements engineering, stakeholder analysis, and some \\"hard skills\\", such as business process modeling. Although the role requires an awareness of technology and its uses, it is not an IT-focused role. : Three elements are essential to this aspect of the business analysis effort: the redesign of core business processes; the application of enabling technologies to support the new core processes; and the management of organizational change. This aspect of business analysis is also called \\"business process improvement\\" (BPI), or \\"reengineering\\". ; IT-systems analyst : There is the need to align IT development with the business system as a whole. A long-standing problem in business is how to get the best return from IT investments, which are generally very expensive and of critical, often strategic, importance. IT departments, aware of the problem, often create a business analyst role to better understand and define the requirements for their IT systems. Although there may be some overlap with the developer and testing roles, the focus is always on the IT part of the change process, and generally this type of business analyst gets involved only when a case for change has already been made and decided upon. In any case, the term \\"analyst\\" is lately considered somewhat misleading, insofar as analysts (i.e. problem investigators) also do design work (solution definers). The key responsibility areas of a business analyst are to collate the client's software requirements, understand them, and analyze them further from a business perspective. A business analyst is required to collaborate with and assist the business and assist them.http://businessanalystmentor.com/2009/06/29/why-should-you-become-a- business-analyst/ http://news.dice.com/2013/06/13/5-steps-to-becoming-a- business-analyst/ Function within the organizational structure The role of business analysis can exist in a variety of structures within an organizational framework. Because business analysts typically act as a liaison between the business and technology functions of a company, the role can be often successful either aligned to a line of business, within IT, or sometimes both.IRM, https://irm.com.au/ba-training-roadmap/ ; Business alignment : When business analysts work at the business side, they are often subject matter experts for a specific line of business. These business analysts typically work solely on project work for a particular business, pulling in business analysts from other areas for cross-functional projects. In this case, there are usually business systems analysts on the IT side to focus on more technical requirements. ; IT alignment : In many cases, business analysts work solely within IT and they focus on both business and systems requirements for a project, consulting with various subject matter experts (SMEs) to ensure thorough understanding. Depending on the organizational structure, business analysts may be aligned to a specific development lab or they might be grouped together in a resource pool and allocated to various projects based on availability and expertise. The former builds specific subject matter expertise while the latter provides the ability to acquire cross-functional knowledge. ; Practice management : In a large organizations, there are centers of excellence or practice management groups who define frameworks and monitor the standards throughout the process of implementing the change in order to maintain the quality of change and reduce the risk of changes to organization. Some organizations may have independent centers of excellence for individual streams such as project management, business analysis or quality assurance. A practice management team provides a framework by which all business analysts in an organization conduct their work, usually consisting of processes, procedures, templates and best practices. In addition to providing guidelines and deliverables, it also provides a forum to focus on continuous improvement of the business analysis function. Goals Ultimately, business analysis wants to achieve the following outcomes: * Create solutions * Give enough tools for robust project management * Improve efficiency and reduce waste * Provide essential documentation, such as project initiation documents One way to assess these goals is to measure the return on investment (ROI) for all projects. According to Forrester Research, more than $100 billion is spent annually in the U.S. on custom and internally developed software projects. For all of these software development projects, keeping accurate data is important and business leaders are constantly asking for the return or ROI on a proposed project or at the conclusion of an active project. However, asking for the ROI without sufficient data of where value is created or destroyed may result in inaccurate projections. =Reduce waste and complete projects on time= Project delays are costly in several ways: * Project costs ‚Äì For every month of delay, the project team costs and expenses continue to accumulate. When a large part of the development team has been outsourced, the costs will start to add up quickly and are very visible if contracted on a time and materials basis (T&M;). Fixed price contracts with external parties limit this risk. For internal resources, the costs of delays are not as readily apparent, unless time spent by resources is being tracked against the project, as labor costs are essentially ‚Äòfixed‚Äô costs. * Opportunity costs ‚Äì Opportunity costs come in two types ‚Äì lost revenue and unrealized expense reductions. Some projects are specifically undertaken with the purpose of driving new or additional revenues to the bottom line. For every month of delay, a company foregoes a month of this new revenue stream. The purpose of other projects is to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Again, each month of failure postpones the realization of these expense reductions by another month. In the vast majority of cases, these opportunities are never captured or analyzed, resulting in misleading ROI calculations. Of the two opportunity costs, the lost revenue is the most egregious ‚Äì and the effects are greater and longer lasting. On a lot of projects (particularly larger ones) the project manager is the one responsible for ensuring that a project is completed on time. The BA's job is more to ensure that if a project is not completed on time then at least the highest priority requirements are met. =Document the right requirements= Business analysts want to make sure that they define the requirements in a way that meets the business needs, for example, in IT applications the requirements need to meet end-users' needs. Essentially, they want to define the right application. This means that they must document the right requirements through listening carefully to ‚Äòcustomer‚Äô feedback, and by delivering a complete set of clear requirements to the technical architects and coders who will write the program. If a business analyst has limited tools or skills to help him elicit the right requirements, then the chances are fairly high that he will end up documenting requirements that will not be used or that will need to be re-written ‚Äì resulting in rework as discussed below. The time wasted to document unnecessary requirements not only impacts the business analyst, it also impacts the rest of the development cycle. Coders need to generate application code to perform these unnecessary requirements and testers need to make sure that the wanted features actually work as documented and coded. Experts estimate that 10% to 40% of the features in new software applications are unnecessary or go unused. Being able to reduce the amount of these extra features by even one-third can result in significant savings. An approach of minimalism or \\"Keep it Simple\\" and minimum technology supports a reduced cost number for the end result and on going maintenance of the implemented solution. =Improve project efficiency= Efficiency can be achieved in two ways: by reducing rework and by shortening project length. Rework is a common industry headache and it has become so common at many organizations that it is often built into project budgets and time lines. It generally refers to extra work needed in a project to fix errors due to incomplete or missing requirements and can impact the entire software development process from definition to coding and testing. The need for rework can be reduced by ensuring that the requirements gathering and definition processes are thorough and by ensuring that the business and technical members of a project are involved in these processes from an early stage. Shortening project length presents two potential benefits. For every month that a project can be shortened, project resource costs can be diverted to other projects. This can lead to savings on the current project and lead to earlier start times of future projects (thus increasing revenue potential).

It shares a field with Vernon Barford Junior High, it is said that most students do go to Vernon Barford for grades 7 -9. The school opened in January 1967; students selected for the school double shifted with Malmo school from September 1966 until construction was complete. The original 1966 school building was designed by the Massey medal-winning architect, Peter Hemingway. At first the school had junior high school grades because there was no suitable nearby high school. Early construction problems - in particular, an open plan central area with protruding electrical outlets, and a bridge outside the front door on which students sometimes enjoyed hanging - occasionally caused ambulances to be called. In 2010 \\"AMP\\" was called into action, the year after Shauna Paul became Principal. AMP Consists of Art, Music, and Phys.Ed which rotates around on a daily schedule. All students receive a time table, with their AMP Periods stated on. AMP is used as a practice for Junior High and High School when students will have to remember when and where they have classes.

He retired after the 1972 Olympics and later took part in professional wrestling. Professional wrestling career Ruska competed between 1976 and 1980 for the New Japan Pro Wrestling and World Wrestling Federation promotions. He had over 150 pro wrestling matches, in some of which he was the tag team partner of fellow judoka Allen Coage. =Match with Ivan Gomes= In 1976, during a tour through Brazil, Ruska was slated to fight a special, high-level bout against Ivan Gomes, fellow NJPW wrestler and famous vale tudo fighter, on August 7 at the Maracan√£ Stadium. Previous negotiations about the match's results and length were troublesome, and as a result, there was tension between the parts. During the bout, refereed by Mr. Takahashi, Gomes raked Ruska's eye with a palm strike, which Ruska answered by landing a punching combination, and the match became a shoot right after. The Brazilian, who enjoyed a 15kg weight advantage, dragged Ruska to the ground with a guillotine choke, but Ruska escaped and mounted him. After becoming entangled with the ring ropes, a bloody Gomes captured Ruska's back and tried a rear naked choke, to which Ruska grabbed the ropes to signal Takahashi to break action. The Brazilian refused to release Ruska, but the referee, upon observing most of his body was outside the ropes, called for countout in order to end the match at 9:03.Keisuke Shibusawa, Gracie Jiu Jitsu no Itsusashu, 1995, Nihon Sports There was controversy about whether the choke was effective or not.Ken Yanagisawa, 1976 Antonio Inoki, 2007Ivan Gomes, BJJ Heroes The event's crowds believed Gomes had been wronged with the decision, and a riot almost broke out until Inoki came out and calmed them down. Still, repercussion in Brazil was negative, with viewers commenting Ruska should be considered the victor, even although some acknowledged he had started the affair with an illegal move. As a consequence, the Athletic Commission of Rio de Janeiro banned Takahashi and Ruska from all sport competitions.Shinji Ishii, Martial Arts Death Battle - The stormy story of the fools who wanted to be the strongest, Takarajimasha, 1994 The Japanese considered Ruska the winner, as Gomes had to be hospitalized and received nine stitches for damage suffered in the brawl while Ruska was in much better condition,Keishuke Shibusawa, Mat World Scandal, 2006 and it was reported NJPW president Antonio Inoki secretly gifted Ruska a money bonus to compensate his ban from competing.

The first TC competition took place in 1937 with 12 races, each in a different province. Future Formula One star Juan Manuel Fangio (Chevrolet) won the 1940 and 1941 editions of the TC. It was during this time that the series' Chevrolet-Ford rivalry began, with Ford acquiring most of its historical victories. Until the 1960s the races were held on temporarily closed roads, hence the series' name. These improvised circuits would often present a combination of dirt and asphalt surfaces unlike those of dedicated race tracks. During the 1960s the category began employing high-end technologies, with local manufacturers investing heavily for prestige. The Ford Motor Company of Argentina and Chevrolet were main contenders, with Dodge to a lesser degree. The European brand Renault, which had merged with Industrias Kaiser Argentina and thus inherited the Rambler range, was also a contender. In the 1970s, the Sport Prototipo (modified cars in the Gran Turismo vein) category was spun off TC to allow TC to return to its stock-car roots which made it immensely popular with small-town audiences. The spin-off withered away slowly. A second spin-off was TC 2000 Championship in the 1980s which allowed the showcasing of the smaller cars most Argentines were driving, thus including Peugeot, Renault, Fiat and Volkswagen, and later, Japanese brands as well. TC 2000 soon became as popular as TC itself. In later years, and to preserve its main draw, TC has been clinging to the larger models that have mostly gone out of use in Argentine roads, and incorporated imported engines. Brands in TC still have huge fan bases, with Ford and Chevrolet being the largest. General Motors decided to end manufacturing Chevy Coup√© SS (Chevrolet Nova) in Argentina in 1977.

It is the application of law by government or independent administrative agencies for various purposes, including remedying market failure, protecting the environment, and economic management. Regulation Regulation is generally defined as legislation imposed by a government on individuals and private sector firms in order to regulate and modify economic behaviors. Conflict can occur between public services and commercial procedures (e.g. maximizing profit), the interests of the people using these services (see market failure), and also the interests of those not directly involved in transactions (externalities). Most governments, therefore, have some form of control or regulation to manage these possible conflicts. The ideal goal of economic regulation is to ensure the delivery of a safe and appropriate service, while not discouraging the effective functioning and development of businesses. For example, in most countries, regulation controls the sale and consumption of alcohol and prescription drugs, as well as the food business, provision of personal or residential care, public transport, construction, film and TV, etc. Monopolies, especially those that are difficult to abolish (natural monopoly), are often regulated. The financial sector is also highly regulated. Regulation can have several elements: * Public statutes, standards, or statements of expectations. * A registration or licensing process to approve and permit the operation of a service, usually by a named organization or person. * An inspection process or other form of ensuring standard compliance, including reporting and management of non-compliance with these standards: where there is continued non-compliance, then * A de-licensing process through which an organization or person, if judged to be operating unsafely, is ordered to stop or suffer a penalty. Not all types of regulation are government-mandated, so some professional industries and corporations choose to adopt self-regulating models. There can be internal regulation measures within a company, which work towards the mutual benefit of all members. Often, voluntary self-regulation is imposed in order to maintain professionalism, ethics, and industry standards. For example, when a broker purchases a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, there are explicit rules of conduct, or contractual and agreed-upon conditions, to which the broker must conform. The coercive regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are imposed without regard for any individual's consent or dissent regarding that particular trade. However, in a democracy, there is still collective agreement on the constraint‚Äîthe body politic as a whole agrees, through its representatives, and imposes the agreement on those participating in the regulated activity. Other examples of voluntary compliance in structured settings include the activities of Major League Baseball, FIFA, and the Royal Yachting Association (the UK's recognized national association for sailing). Regulation in this sense approaches the ideal of an accepted standard of ethics for a given activity to promote the best interests of those participating as well as the continuation of the activity itself within specified limits. In America, throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the government engaged in substantial regulation of the economy. In the 18th century, the production and distribution of goods were regulated by British government ministries over the American Colonies (see mercantilism). Subsidies were granted to agriculture, and tariffs were imposed, sparking the American Revolution. The United States government maintained a high tariff throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century until the Reciprocal Tariff Act was passed in 1934 under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. However, regulation and deregulation came in waves, with the deregulation of big business in the Gilded Age leading to President Theodore Roosevelt's trust busting from 1901 to 1909, deregulation and Laissez-Faire economics once again in the roaring 1920s leading to the Great Depression, and intense governmental regulation and Keynesian economics under Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal plan. President Ronald Reagan deregulated business in the 1980s with his Reaganomics plan. In 1946, the U.S. Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which formalized means of ensuring the regularity of government administrative activity and its conformance with authorizing legislation. The APA established uniform procedures for a federal agency's promulgation of regulations and adjudication of claims. The APA also sets forth the process for judicial review of agency action. =Regulatory capture= Regulatory capture is the process through which a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or special concerns of interest groups that dominate the industry said agency is charged with regulatingAchola Kevin. The probability of regulatory capture is economically biased, in that vested interests in an industry have the greatest financial stake in regulatory activity and are more likely to be motivated to influence the regulatory body than dispersed individual consumers, each of whom has little particular incentive to try to influence regulators. Thus the likelihood of regulatory capture is a risk to which an agency is exposed by its very nature.Gary Adams, Sharon Hayes, Stuart Weierter and John Boyd, \\"Regulatory Capture: Managing the Risk\\" ICE Australia, International Conferences and Events (PDF) (October 24, 2007). Retrieved April 14, 2011 Theories of regulation The art of regulation has long been studied, particularly in the utilities sector. Two ideas have been formed on regulatory policy: positive theories of regulation and normative theories of regulation. The former examine why regulation occurs. These theories include theories of market power, \\"interest group theories that describe stakeholders' interests in regulation,\\" and \\"theories of government opportunism that describe why restrictions on government discretion may be necessary for the sector to provide efficient services for customers.\\" These theories conclude that regulation occurs because: # the government is interested in overcoming *information asymmetries and in aligning their own interest with the operator, # customers desire protection from market power in the presence of non-existent or ineffective competition, # operators desire protection from rivals, or # operators desire protection from government opportunism. Normative economic theories of regulation generally conclude that regulators should # encourage competition where feasible, # minimize information asymmetry costs by gathering information and incentivizing operators to improve their performance, # provide for economically efficient price structures, and # establish regulatory processes that provide for \\"regulation under the law and independence, transparency, predictability, legitimacy, and credibility for the regulatory system.\\" Alternatively, many heterodox economists and legal scholars stress the importance of market regulation for \\"safeguarding against monopoly formation, the overall stability of markets, environmental harm, and to ensure a variety of social protections.\\" These draw on sociologists (such as Max Weber, Karl Polanyi, Neil Fligstein, and Karl Marx) and the history of government institutions partaking in regulatory processes. \\"To allow the market mechanism to be sole director of the fate of human beings and their natural environment, indeed, even of the amount and use of purchasing power, would result in the demolition of society.\\" *Information asymmetry deals with transactions in which one party has more information than the other, which creates an imbalance in power that at the worst can cause a kind of market failure. They are most commonly studied in the context of principal-agent problems. Principal-agent theory addresses issues of information asymmetry. Here, the government is the principal, and the operator the agent, regardless of who owns the operator. Principal-agent theory is applied in incentive regulation and multi-part tariffs.Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure regulation Theories of Regulation.  Regulatory metrics  The World Bank's Doing Business database collects data from 178 countries on the costs of regulation in certain areas, such as starting a business, employing workers, getting credit, and paying taxes. For example, it takes an average of 19 working days to start a business in the OECD, compared to 60 in Sub-Saharan Africa; the cost as a percentage of GNP (not including bribes) is 8% in the OECD, and 225% in Africa. The Worldwide Governance Indicators project at the World Bank recognizes that regulations have a significant impact in the quality of governance of a country. The Regulatory Quality of a country, defined as \\"the ability of the government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development\\" is one of the six dimensions of governance that the Worldwide Governance Indicators measure for more than 200 countries. Deregulation =In modern American politics= Overly complicated regulatory law, increasing inflation, concern over regulatory capture, and outdated transportation regulations made deregulation an appealing idea in the US in the late 1970s. During his presidency (1977-1981), President Jimmy Carter introduced sweeping deregulation reform of the financial system (by the removal of interest rate ceilings) and the transportation industry, allowing the airline industry to operate more freely. President Ronald Reagan took up the mantle of deregulation during his two terms in office (1981-1989) and expanded upon it with the introduction of Reaganomics, which sought to stimulate the economy through income and corporate tax cuts coupled with deregulation and reduced government spending. Though favored by industry, Reagan-era economic policies concerning deregulation are regarded by many economists as having contributed to the Savings and Loan Crisis of the late 1980s and 1990s. The allure of free market capitalism remains present in American politics today, with many economists recognizing the importance of finding balance between the inherent risks associated with investment and the safeguards of regulation. Some, particularly members of industry, feel that lingering regulations imposed after the financial crisis of 2007 such as the Dodd-Frank financial reform act are too stringent and impede economic growth, especially among small businesses. Others support continued regulation on the basis that deregulation of the financial sector led to the 2007 financial crisis and that regulations lend stability to the economy. In 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that he claimed would \\"knock out two regulations for every new regulation.\\"Donald Trump Trump made the claim: \\"Every regulation should have to pass a simple test. Does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers? If the answer is no, we will be getting rid of it.\\" =Counterparts= A common counterpart of deregulation is the privatization of state-run industries. The goal of privatization is for market forces to increase the efficiency of denationalized industries. Privatization was widely pursued in Great Britain throughout Margaret Thatcher's administration. Though largely considered a success and considerably reducing government deficit, critics argue that standards, wages, and employment declined due to privatization. Others point out that lack of careful regulations on some of the privatized industries is a source of continued problems. Controversy =Proponents= The regulation of markets is to safeguard society and has been the mainstay of industrialized capitalist economic governance through the twentieth century. Karl Polanyi refers to this process as the 'embedding' of markets in society. Further, contemporary economic sociologists such as Neil Fligstein (in his 2001 Architecture of Markets) argue that markets depend on state regulation for their stability, resulting in a long term co-evolution of the state and markets in capitalist societies in the last two hundred years. =Opponents= This position is alternatively summarized in what is known as the Iron Law of Regulation, which states that all government regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare. Some argue that companies are incentivized to behave in a socially responsible manner, therefore eliminating the need for external regulation, by their commitment to stakeholders, their interest in preserving reputability, and their goals for long term growth.

Medal of the Order of Saint Sylvester and the Golden Militia, 1841. The Order of the Golden SpurHeraldically gold, it is to be understood: \\"Throughout the Middle Ages gold was far too rare to permit spurs being made of solid gold, despite the importance with which spurs were regarded. They were usually made of iron, brass, or copper, silvered or gilded, and often of iron tinned\\". (Stephen V. Grancsay, \\"A Pair of Spurs Bearing the Bourbon Motto\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 36.8 (August 1941:170-172) p. 171). (, ), officially known also as the Order of the Golden Militia (, ),Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 ), p. 1272 is a papal order of knighthood conferred upon those who have rendered distinguished service in propagating the Catholic faith, or who have contributed to the glory of the Church, either by feat of arms, by writings, or by other illustrious acts. History =Before 19th century: a noble order= It is accounted the earliest papal chivalric institution. The Order of the Golden Spur had its origins in the title Count palatine of the Lateran Palace,Comes palatini Lateranensis. which was in the gift of the Holy Roman Emperor in the fourteenth century: Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor conferred the title on one Fenzio di Albertino di Prato, 15 August 1357, at Prague.Paul F. Grendler, The Universities of the Italian Renaissance (2004), p. 184, note 130; the title empowered Fenzio to confer the license of doctor of civil law. The Order began to be associated with the inheritable patent of nobility in the form of count palatinate during the Renaissance; Emperor Frederick III named Baldo Bartolini, professor of civil law at the University of Perugia, a count palatinate in 1469, entitled in turn to confer university degrees. \\"Bartolini also received the Knighthood of the Golden Spur, a title that sometimes accompanied the office of count palatinate in the Renaissance\\", according to the historian of universities Paul F. Grendler;Grendler 2004:184 note 134. the Order of the Golden Spur, linked with the title of count palatinate, was widely conferred after the Sack of Rome, 1527, by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor; the text of surviving diplomas conferred hereditary nobility to the recipients. Among the recipients was Titian (1533), who had painted an equestrian portrait of Charles.C Hope, \\"Titian as a Court Painter\\", Oxford Art Journal, 1979. Close on the heels of the Emperor's death in 1558, its refounding in Papal hands is attributed to Pope Pius IV in 1559.Thomas Robson, The British Herald; or, Cabinet of armorial bearings of the nobility... (1830) s.v. \\"Golden Spur, in Rome\\" and plate 4 (fig. 21) and 5 (figs 3 and 7). By the mid-18th century the Order was being so indiscriminately bestowed that Casanova remarked \\"The Order they call the Golden Spur was so disparaged that people irritated me greatly when they asked me the details of my cross;\\"\\"L'ordre qu'on appelle de l'√âperon d'Or √©tait si d√©cri√© qu'on m'ennuyait beaucoup quand on demandait des nouvelles de ma croix.\\" (Histoire de ma vie, 8;ix);. he had the grace to add that he would have been pleased if he had been able to answer \\"mon Toison\\", and he did habitually wear it, nevertheless, on its scarlet riband. In 1777 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had his portrait painted with the star-encircled cross of the order on his coat,Hulton Archive and the Order granted to Giovanni Battista Piranesi permitted him to sign his etchings Cav. G.B. Piranesi. The Order was granted to \\"those in the pontifical government, artists, and others, whom the pope should think deserving of reward. It is likewise given to strangers, no other condition being required, but that of professing the catholic religion.\\"Robson 1830. =19th century: decline of the order= In the 19th century, members of the Curia, prelates and papal nuncios had the privilege of nominating recipients. The Order was given out liberally upon payment of a small fee, and some scandal arose in Paris concerning the sale of forged letters patent claiming to confer this title,\\"Scrutator\\" in Notes and Queries 3rd Series, 3, p. 254. formerly linked with the purely honorary designation Count Palatine of the Sacred Palace of the Lateran.Robson 1830; the language used in the patent was French, the international diplomatic lingua franca of the era. Honor√© Daumier included the \\"Knight of the Golden Spur\\" among his series of lithographs \\"Bohemians of Paris\\" (1842); its satirically mocking legend reads \\"This so- called former Colonel of the Papal Guard, later aide-de-camp to the Prince of Monaco,The bachelor Honor√© V, Prince of Monaco, had died the previous year, during which the pope had included the Order within the Order of Saint Sylvester and the Golden Militia. awaiting as a prize for his services a distinguished post in the Government!... he would, however, willingly accept a tobacconist's shop or a position as an inspector of [street] sweeping; besides, he is a gallant man like all knights of his order, for a trifle demanding satisfaction from five-year-old children, perfectly making excuses from the moment you look at him in the face.\\"The National Museum of western Art: Daumier, \\"Bohemians of Paris\\", 24 (illustrated). The badge, as described by Robson in 1830, was an eight-pointed gold cross with a ray point between each arm and the legend BENE MER‚Ä¢ENTI. On the reverse was Ex dono with the name and date when presented. On top of the cross, an imperial crown, and at the base a small spur. In 1841, Pope Gregory XVI, in the Papal Brief Quod Hominum Mentes, reformed and renamed the order as the Order of Saint Sylvester and the Golden Militia. He withdrew all faculties to whom and by whomsoever given, and forbade the use of the title or the decoration to all knights created by any means other than a Papal Brief. To restore the Order to its ancient glory, he limited the number of Commanders to 150 and knights to 300 (for the Papal States only), and appointed the Cardinal of Apostolic Briefs as Chancellor of the Order, with the duty of preserving the name, grade, number and date of admission of each knight.Papal knights =20th century till present= On 7 February 1905, in commemoration of the golden jubilee of the dogmatic definition of the Immaculate Conception, Pope Pius X in his motu proprio Multum ad excitandos, divided the order into two, one taking the name of Order of St. Sylvester and the other taking the older name of the Order of the Golden Spur, and placed it under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In modern times the order has only one class, Knight, and its membership has been restricted to one hundred knights throughout the world. The honour is conferred by a Motu Proprio of the Pope. It is used to award merit, without any consideration of noble birth, and no longer confers nobility, as it did before 1841. It is the second highest of the papal orders (the first being the Supreme Order of Christ). With the death of Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg in 2019 there are no living members of the Order of the Golden Spur. Insignia The emblems of the order after the 1905 reorganization consists of: *The badge, an eight-pointed, enamelled gold cross, in whose center is a small white medallion on one side of which is the word \\"Maria\\" surrounded by a golden circle, and on the other the year MDCCCCV and in its surrounding circle the words \\"Pius X Restituit\\". Pendant from the bottom of the cross is a small golden spur. The decoration is suspended from a red ribbon with white borders. *The star, which is worn on the left breast, is the same cross centered upon the rays of a silver star. The official uniform is a red tunic decorated with two rows of gilt buttons, black velvet collar and cuffs embroidered in gold, black trousers with gold side stripes, epaulettes ornamented with gold fringes and surmounted on top with the emblem of the order, gold spurs, oblong two- peaked hat trimmed with gold and bearing the papal colors, and a sword whose hilt forms a gilt cross in a black scabbard, held in place with a gold sword belt with red fringe. In the early days of the order its members were entitled to wear a gold livery collar (chain), but when the order was revived in 1905 this was not resumed, though the collar remains a symbol of the order. In ecclesiastical heraldry, individuals awarded this Order may depict the gold livery collar completely encircling the shield on their coat of arms.

It is located on a peninsula abutting Jamaica Bay and is bordered by Avenue U on the northwest and the Mill Basin/Mill Island Inlet on its remaining sides. Mill Basin is adjacent to the neighborhood of Bergen Beach to the northeast, Flatlands to the northwest, Marine Park to the southwest, and Floyd Bennett Field and the former Barren Island to the southeast. Mill Basin also contains a subsection called Old Mill Basin, north of Avenue U. Mill Basin was originally Mill Island, located in Jamaica Bay. In the 17th century, a mill was built on Mill, Bergen, and Barren Islands. The archipelago was then occupied by the Schenck and Crooke families through the late 19th century, and remained a mostly rural area with oyster fishing. After Robert Crooke developed a smelting plant on Mill Island in 1890, industrial customers started developing the island and connected it to the rest of Brooklyn. In an effort to develop Mill Basin as a seaport district, ports and dry docks were built in the early 20th century, though a lack of railroad connections hindered the area's further growth. Residential development began in the 1950s, along with much of the rest of southeast Brooklyn, though some of the former industrial buildings remain. Mill Basin has some of the most luxurious houses in New York City, though it also contains commercial and industrial tenants, as well as the Kings Plaza shopping mall in the western part of the neighborhood. The area around Mill Basin consists of a mostly white population as of the 2010 United States Census, and is sparsely served by public transportation. Nearby recreational areas include Floyd Bennett Field, the first municipal airport in New York City, which is part of the Gateway National Recreation Area and is located just southeast of Mill Basin. Mill Basin is part of Brooklyn Community District 18, and its primary ZIP Code is 11234. It is patrolled by the 63rd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Geography Originally, Mill Basin was an island in Jamaica Bay off the coast of Canarsie, called Mill Island. Most of the island was composed of low-lying meadows located near sea level, but a very small portion of the island was arable uplands, or hilly areas located above sea level. The original geography of the area was vastly different from the modern geography. A bulkhead was built along Mill Island's shore in the late 1890s. It was later connected to the uplands of nearby Bergen Beach, creating the continuous embankment between Mill and Paerdegat basins later used for the construction of the Belt Parkway. Most of the earliest filling operations along the island were private, although the city government later took over. Some parts of Mill Basin remained a wetland until the late 20th century. A stream ran where Avenue U is today, dividing Mill Island from the mainland. Maps show that Mill Island was connected to the mainland by 1926. However, modern city maps still allude to \\"Mill Island\\". The New York Times described the neighborhood as a \\"mitten-shaped peninsula\\" enclosed to the south, west, and east by the eponymous waterway. Mill Basin is zoned as a predominantly residential neighborhood with one- or two-family residences. Small commercial overlays and recreational waterfront uses also exist, and the area between Avenue U and the Mill Basin waterway is zoned for heavy industry. Old Mill Basin is located north of Avenue U. According to a map published by The New York Times in 2009, Old Mill Basin can be considered to reach as far north as Avenue N. History =Early settlement= The local Lenape Native Americans originally inhabited the area. They referred to the surrounding area, including Mill and Barren Islands, as \\"Equendito\\" or \\"Equindito\\", a name that probably means \\"Broken Lands\\". In 1624, the Dutch Republic incorporated much of the current New York City area into the colony of New Netherland. In 1636, as the Dutch were expanding outward from present-day Manhattan, Dutch settlers founded the town of Achtervelt (later Amersfoort, then Flatlands) and purchased around Jamaica Bay. Amersfoort was centered around the present-day intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Flatlands Avenue. Canarsie Indian leaders had signed three land agreements with Dutch settlers between 1636 and 1667, handing ownership of much of their historic land, including Mill Island, to the Dutch. Mill Island, as well as the nearby Barren Island, was sold to John Tilton Jr. and Samuel Spicer in 1664. At some point in the 1660s or 1670s, a settler named Elbert Elbertse leased Mill Island, along with Bergen and Barren Islands. The land was owned from 1675 by Jans Martense Schenck, who built a house on the land believed to be one of the oldest houses in New York City. Schenck also built a pier so he could load and unload cargo to or from the Netherlands. A tide mill had been built on the land by that time, but the exact date of the mill's construction is not known; sources give dates between 1660 and 1675. One of Schenck's relatives, a ship captain named Hendrick, allegedly formed an alliance with the pirate William Kidd and allowed Kidd to bury treasure on Mill Island. The Jans Martense Schenck house as seen in the 19th century When Schenck died in 1689, his son Martin received ownership of the estate; the mill was later inherited by Nicholas Schenck. In 1784, the property was sold to Joris Martense of Flatbush. Martense also received \\" of uplands, of woodlands, and a parcel of salt-meadows\\" in the transaction, as noted in a 1909 history of Brooklyn. By 1794, John Schenck was renting the property from Joris's widow. At the time, the mill was called \\"the mill of Martensen\\". The property, which included the mill, farm, and house, was later conveyed to Susan Caton, the daughter of Joris Martense. Caton named Robert L. Crooke as the trustee for Caton's daughter, Margaret Crooke, who was married to General Philip S. Crooke. In 1818, Margaret Crooke inherited the land. After this conveyance, the mill was called \\"Crooke's Mill\\". General Crooke was the trustee for the Crooke children, and upon Margaret's death, had the power to pass the property down to their children. In 1870, after Margaret died, General Crooke conveyed the property to Robert, who gave the property back in 1873. For the next thirty years, there would be a dozen more land conveyances, and by 1906, Robert Crooke ended up owning the property again. The name \\"Mill Island\\" is believed to have been first used in the late 19th century. Before then, settlers called it \\"the mill\\" because of the gristmill there. =Industrial development= Up to the late 19th century, the area retained its rural character, and the only structures on the island were a house and \\"three stable\\" buildings. The chief resources were the abundant crabs, oysters, and clams in Jamaica Bay. However, in 1890, Robert Crooke built a lead-smelting plant on Mill Island. The Crooke Smelting Company was bought out by the National Lead Company, and Robert sold the remainder of the land to the firm of McNulty and Fitzgerald, which erected bulkheads and filled in the marshes. By 1906, Mill Island reportedly received of ore annually. The island's factories had a combined annual output of of metals whose aggregate value was $1.25 million ($ in modern dollars). Boats delivered and received shipments via the nearby waterways. Robert Crook sold the former mill to Florence C. Smith in January 1906. The day after the sale, Smith deeded it to the real estate company Flatbush East, who transferred the land's ownership to Flatbush Improvement Company at the end of the year. The Flatbush Improvement Company brought marshland and engaged the firm of Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific to dredge creeks and fill in meadows. After the filling project was completed, the parcel had an area of and was fit for industrial development. As compensation, Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific acquired ownership of the eastern portion of Mill Island, which comprised about of land. Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific built factories and worker housing on its half of the island, and in 1916, began laying sidewalks and utilities. The expanded island attracted companies such as National Lead, Gulf Refining, and other leading firms engaged in heavy industry, which were operating plants along the Mill Island shoreline. Additionally, construction of an extension of Flatbush Avenue to the Rockaway Inlet started in 1913. In 1910, developers began dredging ports within Jamaica Bay in an effort to develop a seaport district there. Work on dredging a , main ship channel started in 1912 and was completed the next year, but lawsuits delayed progress until the 1920s. The channel ran along the western and northern shores of Jamaica Bay. The first improvements to Mill Island itself started in 1915, when a wooden pier was installed along Flatbush Avenue. In 1916, of shoreline along Mill Island was incorporated into the proposed port. At the time, a , channel was to be excavated within Mill Basin, the waterway. This new channel would allow a proposed extension of the Flatbush Avenue Streetcar from Avenue N to the Mill Basin shoreline. The New York City Department of Docks awarded a contract to dredge the Mill Basin channel, along the southern and western sides of the island, to the federal government in 1917. Mill Basin would eventually be wide and deep. Work on the main ship channel restarted in 1923. After the entire main channel was dredged to 500 feet wide by 18 feet deep, it was re-dredged to 1,000 feet wide by deep. This project was completed by the late 1930s, eliminating many small islands in the bay and causing the expansion of another island, Canarsie Pol. The eastern branch of Mill Basin had been created by the 1930s. In 1918, the city allowed several large piers to be constructed within the bay, though only one was built. The pier, which was built in order to receive landfill for the other proposed piers, stretched northeast of Barren Island, south of Mill Island, and was wide. A total of six such piers were planned for this area. In June of that year, a municipally owned pier was opened at Mill Basin. At the time, there were proposals to fill in between Mill and Barren Islands so 14 more piers could be built. By 1919, Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific was building three large dry docks on Mill Island. It was also constructing seven barges for the United States Navy. The fill for the docks came from as far away as Europe. As of that year, Mill Island was the site of at least six manufacturing and commercial concerns. One observer attributed the presence of several of these factories to the proposed improvements at Jamaica Bay. A contract for building concrete piers was awarded in 1921 and completed the next year. In 1925, the Flatbush Avenue extension to Rockaway Inlet opened, providing an additional of dock facilities and a strip of land for a road across the marshes. However, construction of the actual docks did not start until 1927. During the late 1920s and 1930s, the New York City Department of Docks rented the docks to a number of small industrial firms. The development of the proposed docklands at Jamaica Bay spurred large increases in property values in Mill Basin, since the docklands was expected to gain a connection to the Long Island Rail Road. Planners wanted to create a spur of the Bay Ridge Branch south to Flatlands, with two branches to Canarsie and Mill Basin. A connection to Staten Island would be built via the planned Staten Island Tunnel, which would in turn allow freight to be delivered and shipped to the rest of the continental United States. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey offered to build the new railroad link for $2 million and lease it to the city. However, Mill Basin's further development was hindered when plans for rail service to the rest of Brooklyn went unrealized. Industrial activity continued through the 1960s. In 1927, United States Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's \\"Fact-Finding Committee on Suitable Airport Facilities for the New York Metropolitan District\\" suggested Southeast Brooklyn as a possible site for a new municipal airport in New York City. The New York City Chamber of Commerce approved the site in September of that year. Originally, real- estate developers suggested that in Mill Basin could be used for the new airport, which would allow the airfield to open before the end of 1928. Ultimately, New York City's aeronautical engineer Clarence Chamberlin selected nearby Barren Island as the site for the new airport, which later became Floyd Bennett Field. The Belt Parkway was built through the neighborhood in the 1930s, and it opened in 1940. The construction of a drawbridge along the parkway, traversing Mill Basin, was approved in 1939 and completed the next year. =Residential development= A house in Mill Basin Old Mill Basin, to the north of the Mill Basin peninsula, was developed beginning in the 1920s. However, the 1939 WPA Guide to New York City mentions that the area comprising present-day Mill Basin and Bergen Beach was the residence of \\"pathetic communities of squatters, who live in makeshift houses, and eke out a living by fishing and scouring the near-by city dumps for odd necessities\\". At the time, the southern shore was still marshland. Residential development on the peninsula began after World War II, when Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific sold a large plot of land to the firm of Flatbush Park Homes. The land was bounded to the north by Avenue U, to the east by East 68th Street and East Mill Basin/Mill Island, to the south by Basset Avenue, and to the west by Strickland Avenue and Mill Avenue. Over a hundred brick bungalows were built in the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of which were later replaced by large, custom-built, detached one-family houses on lots measuring . The Crooke- Schenck House, which stood at East 63rd Street, was dismantled in 1952 and later reassembled as an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. Starting in the 1950s, a series of suburban waterfront communities were being rapidly developed in Southeast Brooklyn, including present-day Bergen Beach and Canarsie as well as Mill Basin. In 1956, builders announced the construction of 1,500 houses on the Mill Basin peninsula. However, as late as the 1960s, parts of the area were still a swamp. During the 1950s, private developers laid their own streets while constructing houses in the neighborhood, resulting in the creation of a patchwork of private roads. Some of these streets were poorly maintained: a newspaper article from 1954 described houses that flooded after heavy rains because there were no sewage pipes. In 1963, the city government asked the developers to fix these streets, which were already breaking down. The city argued that these streets would remain private roads until the streets were upgraded to city standards, but the developers took the opposite argument, saying that the streets were not up to city standards because they were private roads. After a controversy over the paving of the streets, the city ultimately dropped their requests for private builders to pave these streets, instead deciding that the city's Department of Highways would perform the paving. The New York City Department of Buildings agreed not to grant any certificates of occupancy to any new building unless the street in front of it was paved. In 1964, a federal judge signed an order that transferred these private streets to city ownership, allowing the city to pave these streets. The area gained residential popularity by the end of the 1960s. By 1963, the South Shore High School in Canarsie was being constructed to accommodate the growing population. Due to a large number of new residents moving in, temporary classrooms were built on the playground of P.S. 236. A training school for sailors was also constructed in Mill Basin. The neighborhood had some of the most expensive houses in Brooklyn by 1972. Several controversies arose during the development of Mill Basin as a residential neighborhood. In 1954, the city indefinitely postponed the construction of a garbage incinerator that had been planned for the area. Another controversy in 1966 surrounded a \\"boatel\\", or motel with boating docks, that had been planned for the site of a marsh south of the Mill Basin waterway. The boatel site, which was located at the intersection of Belt Parkway and Flatbush Avenue, was supposed to contain a shopping mall with docks for up to 300 boats. Residents continued to oppose plans for the shopping center since it would have been located on a wildlife sanctuary. Plans for the shopping mall were scrapped the next year after the city denied a rezoning plan for Mill Basin that would have allowed the shopping mall's construction. Another shopping mall, Kings Plaza, had been dedicated in 1968 at a site further north, on Avenue U. Community The Kings Plaza shopping mall in Mill Basin Mill Basin has been characterized by The New York Times as a suburban community with a nearly-360-degree shoreline. It is adjoined by the waterway of the same name to the south and west. Many residents own boats. Mill Basin is are part of Brooklyn Community Board 18, which also includes Canarsie, Bergen Beach, Georgetown, Marine Park, and the southern portion of Flatlands.Brooklyn Community Boards , New York City. Retrieved December 31, 2007. The neighborhood has evolved to include some of New York City's most luxurious houses. Most of the housing stock was developed starting in the late 20th century, and many waterfront houses include docks, water views, or high ceilings. Prices of houses often range in the millions. , an unrenovated house on a lot along a main street had a minimum price of about $850,000. Housing prices rose based on the width of the lot, extent of renovations, and proximity to the water: the cheapest waterfront house is $1.6 million. A few houses also had elevators inside them, and several residences had features such as six-car garages and all-glass facades. In Georgetown, north of Mill Basin, there are two-family brick townhouses with overhanging balconies and awnings. Old Mill Basin, to the northeast, mostly has detached frame houses. It is defined as the portion of the neighborhood north of Avenue U. In Mill Island, the peninsular part of Mill Basin, houses are more expensive than the rest of the neighborhood; by contrast, the cheapest houses are on the northwest corner. The former Mill Island and Old Mill Basin are divided by Avenue U, at the Mill Basin waterway's innermost reaches. Some lead factories, built in the 20th century by Dutch businessmen, remain standing, but many are derelict. Commercial activities, mainly family-owned shops and restaurants, are primarily located along Strickland Avenue and Avenue U. The Kings Plaza shopping mall, located on a plot at Avenue U and Flatbush Avenue, is the largest indoor shopping center in Brooklyn. The neighborhood also contains Mill Plaza Mall, a strip mall at the northwest corner of Mill and Strickland Avenues. Demographics From the 1950s through the 1980s, the area was mainly Italian, but the predominant communities today are Russians and Israelis. By the end of the 20th century, the vast majority of Mill Basin residents were white, as were most residents of adjacent neighborhoods such as Bergen Beach and Marine Park. The 1990 United States Census counted 10 African-Americans living in Mill Basin; by the 2000 United States Census, there were 26 black residents. However, by 2011, the number of black residents in Southeast Brooklyn had risen 241%, the steepest such increase of any area in the city. As of that year, the African American population in these neighborhoods represented 10.9% of the total population. Mill Basin is located in ZIP Code 11234, which also includes Georgetown, Marine Park, Bergen Beach, and the southern portion of Flatlands. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the combined population of Georgetown, Marine Park, Bergen Beach, and Mill Basin was 45,231, an increase of 2,291 (5.3%) from the 42,940 counted in the 2000 United States Census.

Recreation Aerial view of Floyd Bennett Field, located south of Mill Basin, in the 1940s There are several parks in Mill Basin. The only park on the peninsula proper is Lindower Park, a park at the southwest corner of Mill and Strickland Avenues. The park is named after Alex Lindower, a lawyer and community activist who lived in Mill Basin. The city bought the land in 1959 and made it into a public park in 1963, the year before Lindower died. It contains baseball fields, basketball and handball courts, and a children's playground. There are two smaller parks in Old Mill Basin. The James Marshall Power Playground, located at Avenue N and Utica Avenue, is a frequent gathering point for softball teams. The Monsignor Crawford Athletic Field, located on Avenue U between East 58th and East 60th Streets, contains two baseball fields. It is named after Monsignor Thomas J. Crawford, the first pastor of the Mary Queen of Heaven Church, located four blocks north of the ballfields. Mill Basin is also adjacent to Floyd Bennett Field, located to the immediate south of Mill Basin, across the Belt Parkway and Mill Basin Inlet. Named after aviator Floyd Bennett, the field was formerly the city's first municipal airport, and is now part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. The bowler Lou Seda purchased the Gil Hodges Lanes, a bowling alley in Mill Basin, in 2009. It was then rebranded into a new bowling alley called Strike 10 Lanes, which was one of the few remaining bowling alleys in Brooklyn. Education The New York City Department of Education operates several schools in the neighborhood. They include P.S. 312, P.S. 236, and P.S. 203, all of which have historically ranked among the top public schools in the city. There are several private schools around Mill Basin, such as the Yeshivah of Crown Heights, the Mary Queen of Catholic Academy and St. Bernard Catholic Academy. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brooklyn operates Catholic schools in that borough. Mary Queen of Heaven Catholic Academy was in the Mill Basin area, but the school closed in 2019 after falling into debt. The Canarsie Courier stated that St. Bernard was the closest remaining Catholic school. Brooklyn Public Library operates the Mill Basin Library at 2385 Ralph Avenue, near Avenue N. The Mill Basin Library first opened in 1940, and it has been located in its current building since 1975. Transportation Mill Basin Bridge replacement work Mill Basin is served by the , , , , and bus routes, operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations. There are no New York City Subway stations in the neighborhood; the closest stop is Kings Highway in Midwood, along the . BM1 express bus service to Manhattan started in 1973, mainly as a result of the area's isolation from the subway. =Mill Basin Bridge= The original Mill Basin Bridge was a double-leaf bascule bridge supporting the Belt Parkway over Mill Basin. The span formerly carried six lanes of traffic, three in each direction, but , only the eastbound lanes used the drawbridge. There was a sidewalk on each side of the leaf; the eastern or downstream one, the only one still extant, is part of the Shore Parkway Greenway.New York City Department of Transportation: Mill Basin Bridge . Retrieved June 14, 2006. Construction of the span was approved in 1939, and the bridge was opened in 1940. It is the only drawbridge on the Belt Parkway. The New York City Department of Transportation renovated the Belt Parkway Bridge over Mill Basin in late 2006 because of severe deterioration, but began planning for a replacement span. In 2013, the city proposed a -high fixed bridge to replace the aging span. The new bridge will also feature shoulders and wider lanes, which the drawbridge was not built with. The new bridge started construction in 2015, with an expected completion date of 2021, four years after its original completion date of 2017. The westbound lanes were shifted to the newer bridge in August 2017. Religion There are several houses of worship in Mill Basin, including ten synagogues. Some of these synagogues and other houses of worship have been converted from residential structures.

With some 190 genera and nearly 2500 recognized species, only the tribes Senecioneae and Astereae are larger. The name is derived from the genus Helianthus, which is Greek for sun flower. Most genera and species are found in North America and South America, particularly in Mexico. A few genera are pantropical. Most Heliantheae are herbs or shrubs, but some grow to the size of small trees. Leaves are usually hairy and arranged in opposite pairs. The anthers are usually blackened. The above statements about the size and distribution of the tribe apply to a broad definition of Heliantheae, which was followed throughout the 20th century. Some recent authors break the tribe up into a dozen or so smaller tribes. Uses Commercially important plants in the Heliantheae include sunflower and Jerusalem artichoke. Many garden flowers are also in this group, such as Coreopsis, Cosmos, Echinacea, Rudbeckia, and Zinnia. Some authors place Coreopsis and Cosmos in the Coreopsideae tribe. In addition to the benefits brought by the group, some are also problematic weeds. Species of Ambrosia (ragweed) produce large quantities of pollen. Each plant is reputed to be able to produce about a billion grains of pollen over a season, and the plant is wind-pollinated. Subtribes and representative genera The traditional circumscription of the Heliantheae arises from Cassini's 19th-century classification of the Asteraceae. This broad group been divided by some authors into smaller tribes: Bahieae, Chaenactideae, Coreopsideae, Helenieae, Heliantheae sensu stricto, Madieae, Millereae, Perityleae, Polymnieae, and Tageteae. Because the Eupatorieae originated from within the Heliantheae (broadly defined), to maintain monophyletic taxa it is necessary to either make Eupatorieae a subtribe within Heliantheae or to split the Heliantheae into smaller tribes. Such classifications may define a supertribe Helianthodae including these smaller tribes, the Eupatorieae, and a few other tribes such as Inuleae.Helianthodae H. Rob., Tree of Life Web Project In his 1981 revision of the Heliantheae, Harold Ernest Robinson divided the group into 35 subtribes: * Ambrosiinae (includes: ragweed and Parthenium) * Baeriinae * Chaenactidinae * Clappiinae * Clibadiinae * Coreopsidinae (includes: Coreopsis, Cosmos) * Coulterellinae * Desmanthodiinae * Dimeresiinae * Ecliptinae * Engelmanniinae (includes: rosinweed) * Enhydrinae * Espeletiinae * Fitchiinae * Flaveriinae * Gaillardiinae * Galinsoginae (includes: Hidalgoa) * Guardiolinae * Helianthinae (includes: sunflowers) * Heptanthinae * Hymenopappinae * Jaumeinae * Lycapsinae * Madiinae (includes: tarweeds, Hawaiian silverswords) * Marshalliinae * Melampodiinae * Milleriinae * Montanoinae * Neurolaeninae * Pectidinae * Peritylinae * Pinillosinae * Polymniinae * Rudbeckiinae (includes: Echinacea, Rudbeckia) * Varillinae * Zaluzaniinae * Zinniinae (includes: Zinnia) References * Bremer, K√•re.

The song is also referred to by the title \\"Oh, My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose\\", \\"My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose\\" or \\"Red, Red Rose\\" and is often published as a poem. The Poem O my Luve's like a red, red rose That‚Äôs newly sprung in june; O my Luve's like the melodie That‚Äôs sweetly play'd in tune; As fair art thou, my bonnie lass, So deep in luve am I; And I will luve thee still, my dear, Till a‚Äô the seas gang dry; Till a‚Äô the seas gang dry, my dear, And the rocks melt wi‚Äô the sun; I will luve thee still, my dear, While the sands o‚Äô life shall run. And fare thee weel, my only Luve And fare thee weel, a while! And I will come again, my Luve, Tho‚Äô it were ten thousand mile. Origins of the song Burns worked for the final seven years of his life on projects to preserve traditional Scottish songs for the future. In all, Burns had a hand in preserving over 300 songs for posterity, the most famous being \\"Auld Lang Syne\\". He worked on this project for James Johnson's the Scots Musical Museum (1787-1803) and for George Thomson's five-volume A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice. Burns had intended the work to be published as part of Thomson's selection. However, he wrote to a friend that Thomson and he disagreed on the merits of that type of song. \\"What to me appears to be the simple and the wild, to him, and I suspect to you likewise, will be looked on as the ludicrous and the absurd.\\" Instead, Burns gave the song to Scots singer Pietro Urbani who published it in his Scots Songs. In his book, Urbani claimed \\"the words of The Red Red Rose were obligingly given to him by a celebrated Scots poet, who was so struck by them when sung by a country girl that he wrote them down and, not being pleased with the air, begged the author to set them to music in the style of a Scots tune, which he has done accordingly.\\" In other correspondence, Burns referred to it as a \\"simple old Scots song which I had picked up in the country.\\" Other sources have been suggested as an inspiration for Burns. A contemporary poem, \\"O fare thee well, my dearest dear\\", written by a Lieutenant Hinches bears a striking similarity to Burns's verse, notably the lines which refer to \\"ten thousand miles\\" and \\"Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear\\". A ballad originating from the same period entitled \\"The Turtle Dove\\" also contains similar lines, such as \\"Though I go ten thousand mile, my dear\\" and \\"Oh, the stars will never fall down from the sky/Nor the rocks never melt with the sun\\". Of particular note is a collection of verse dating from around 1770, The Horn Fair Garland, a copy of which is thought to exist bearing an inscription \\"Robine Burns aught this buik and no other\\". A poem in this collection, \\"The loyal Lover's faithful promise to his Sweet-heart on his going on a long journey\\" also contains similar verses such as \\"Althou' I go a thousand miles\\" and \\"The day shall turn to night, dear love/And the rocks melt in the sun\\". The lyrics of the song are simple but effective. \\"My luve's like a red, red rose/That's newly sprung in June\\" describe a love that is both fresh and long lasting. David Daiches in his work describes Burns as \\"the greatest songwriter Britain has produced\\" for his work in refurbishing and improving traditional Scots songs including \\"Red, Red Rose\\" which he described as a \\"combination of tenderness and swagger.\\" Musical performances Urbani published the song to an original tune that he wrote. The song appeared in Johnson's Museum in 1797 to the tune of Niel Gow's \\"Major Graham\\" which was the tune that Burns wanted. In 1799, it appeared in Thomson's Scottish Airs set to William Marshall's Wishaw's Favourite with the lyric \\"And fare thee weel awhile\\" changed. The song became more popular when Robert Archibald Smith paired it with the tune of \\"Low Down in the Broom\\" in his Scottish Minstrel book in 1821. This has become the most popular arrangement. The song has been widely performed by a range of artists in the 20th and 21st centuries including Jean Redpath, Pat Boone, Kenneth McKellar, the Fureys, Eddi Reader, Camera Obscura, Eva Cassidy, Izzy, and Ronnie Browne of the Corries (in his solo album after Roy Williamson's death, 'Scottish Love Songs'(1995)). Robert Schumann composed a setting of a German translation of Burns's poem in 1840. Singer and actor Pat Boone performed the song on piano in the 1959 film adaptation of A Journey to the Center of the Earth. Modern choral arrangements include a four-part, a cappella version by David Dickau, an intimate, Irish folk music-influenced setting, also SATB a cappella, by Matthew Brown (\\"A Red, Red Rose,\\" published by Santa Barbara Music), an accompanied SATB setting by James Mulholland as well as a broader version by American composer Ren√© Clausen. Clausen's arrangement incorporates a piano, two violins, and a four-part chorus. (SATB) A Swedish translation and recording named \\"Min √§lskling (du √§r som en ros)\\" was made famous by the renowned Swedish musician Evert Taube. Carly Simon sang a solo version of \\"A Red, Red Rose\\" on the album The Simon Sisters Sing The Lobster Quadrille And Other Songs For Children that she produced with her sister Lucy Simon. A version of Oh My Love is like a Red, Red Rose by Italian singer Ariella Uliano was performed with classical guitar accompaniment on the album Leave Only Your Footsteps Behind. Eva Cassidy sang a slightly modified version titled \\"My Love's Like A Red Red Rose\\" which is featured as a live performance on her posthumous album \\"Somewhere\\". The lyrics are included in the song \\"Final Breath\\" by the post rock band Pelican on their album What We All Come to Need. Moscow-based art-rock band \\"Red Red Rose\\" derives its name from the poem and has a song 'RRR' inspired by the poem. A Red Red Rose is a lyric about the poet's intense love. The poet uses different types of poetic devices. He presents the image of a Red Rose, a symbol of love. The poem is very effective and it creates special poetic effect. The use of figures of speech is a significant feature of this poem. When he presents comparison between love and melody or love and a red rose, he uses simile. In the 3rd stanza of the poem, the poet says if rocks melt with the sun in the future and the sea dries, his love for his beloved will not end. He wishes to love her continuously until his death. Inspiration When asked for the source of his greatest creative inspiration, American singer songwriter Bob Dylan selected Burns' 1794 song A Red, Red Rose, as the lyrics that have had the biggest effect on his life. The title of the 1935 short story \\"Till A‚Äôthe Seas\\" by H. P. Lovecraft and R. H. Barlow comes from the lyrics to \\"A Red, Red Rose.\\"  Symbolism  The song is highly evocative, including lines describing rocks melting with the sun, and the seas running dry. Burns may have been inspired by the concept of deep time put forward a few years earlier by geologist James Hutton in his Theory of the Earth in 1789. Hutton and Burns were contemporaries, and would have mixed in similar circles in Edinburgh.

Doing so was one of the key commitments undertaken at the WTO Uruguay Round in 1994 to retire the Multi Fibre Arrangement. The ATC, that is the WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing, is the regulation governing textile and clothing and implements this commitment. The agreement established a ten-year period which would eliminate the use of quotas in all textile and clothing trade between WTO nations. It expired on December 31, 2004. As of January 1, 2005, the garment and fabric trade worldwide is operating without quotas. To ensure the respect of bilateral textile agreements, goods shipped prior to January 1, 2005 and subject to the 2004 quotas will be subject to the import regime of 2004 even if they are presented to customs after January 1. To avoid excessive burdens on trade and customs, as of April 1, 2005, all garments and fabrics will trade freely into the European Union (EU). Although the quotas have been eliminated, the regulation also sets up a statistical monitoring system for the imports of textiles and clothing into the EU. This system is to provide information regarding the chance of market disruptions and will allow for the governing body to closely follow the trade in this new environment. This regulation is beneficial for Canadian clothing and fabric manufacturers because now there are fewer restrictions. It is hoped by some that this ruling will open up the European market in the near future. Benefits of the abolition of quotas are also expected to textile companies in India and Pakistan.

MFSK is a form of M-ary orthogonal modulation, where each symbol consists of one element from an alphabet of orthogonal waveforms. M, the size of the alphabet, is usually a power of two so that each symbol represents log2M bits. * M is usually between 2 and 64 * Error correction is generally also used Fundamentals In a M-ary signaling system like MFSK, an \\"alphabet\\" of M tones is established and the transmitter selects one tone at a time from the alphabet for transmission. M is usually a power of 2, so each tone transmission from the alphabet represents log2 M data bits. MFSK is classed as an M-ary orthogonal signaling scheme because each of the M tone detection filters at the receiver responds only to its tone and not at all to the others; this independence provides the orthogonality. Like other M-ary orthogonal schemes, the required Eb/N0 ratio for a given probability of error decreases as M increases without the need for multisymbol coherent detection. In fact, as M approaches infinity the required Eb/N0 ratio decreases asymptotically to the Shannon limit of ‚àí1.6dB. However this decrease is slow with increasing M, and large values are impractical because of the exponential increase in required bandwidth. Typical values in practice range from 4 to 64, and MFSK is combined with another forward error correction scheme to provide additional (systematic) coding gain. Spectral efficiency of MFSK modulation schemes decreases with increasing of modulation order M:Haykin, S., 2001. Communication Systems, John Wiley&Sons.; Inc. - p. 402 \\\\rho = \\\\frac{2\\\\log_2 M}{M} Like any other form of angle modulation that transmits a single RF tone that varies only in phase or frequency, MFSK produces a constant envelope. This significantly relaxes the design of the RF power amplifier, allowing it to achieve greater conversion efficiencies than linear amplifiers. =2-tone MFSK= It is possible to combine two MFSK systems to increase the throughput of the link. Perhaps the most widely used 2-tone MFSK system is dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF), better known by its AT&T; trademark of \\"Touch Tone\\". Another is the Multi-frequency (MF) scheme used during the 20th century for in-band signalling on trunks between telephone exchanges. Both are examples of in-band signaling schemes, i.e., they share the user's communication channel. Symbols in the DTMF and MF alphabets are sent as tone pairs; DTMF selects one tone from a \\"high\\" group and one from a \\"low\\" group, while MF selects its two tones from a common set. DTMF and MF use different tone frequencies largely to keep end users from interfering with inter-office signaling. In the 1970s, MF began to be replaced by digital out-of-band signaling, a conversion motivated in part by the widespread fraudulent use of MF signals by end users known as phone phreaks. These signals are distinctive when received aurally as a rapid succession of tone pairs with almost musical quality. The simultaneous transmission of two tones directly at RF loses the constant-envelope property of the single tone system. Two simultaneous RF tones is in fact the classic \\"stress test\\" of an RF power amplifier for measuring linearity and intermodulation distortion. However, two audio tones can be sent simultaneously on a conventional, constant-envelope FM RF carrier, but the noncoherent detection of the FM signal at the receiver would destroy any signal-to-noise ratio advantage the multitone scheme might have. =MFSK in HF communications= Skywave propagation on the high frequency bands introduces random distortions that generally vary with both time and frequency. Understanding these impairments helps one understand why MFSK is such an effective and popular technique on HF. Delay spread and coherence bandwidth When several separate paths from transmitter to receiver exist, a condition known as multipath, they almost never have exactly the same length so they almost never exhibit the same propagation delay. Small delay differences, or delay spread, smear adjacent modulation symbols together and cause unwanted intersymbol interference. Delay spread is inversely proportional to its frequency-domain counterpart, coherence bandwidth. This is the frequency range over which the channel gain is relatively constant. This is because summing two or more paths with different delays creates a comb filter even when the individual paths have a flat frequency response. Coherence time and Doppler spread Fading is a (usually random and undesired) change in path gain with time. The maximum fade rate is limited by the physics of the channel, such as the rate at which free electrons form and are recombined in the ionosphere and charged particle cloud velocities within the ionosphere. The maximum interval over which the channel gain does not appreciably change is the coherence time. A fading channel effectively imposes an unwanted random amplitude modulation on the signal. Just as the bandwidth of intentional AM increases with the modulation rate, fading spreads a signal over a frequency range that increases with the fading rate. This is Doppler spreading, the frequency domain counterpart of coherence time. The shorter the coherence time, the greater the Doppler spread and vice versa. Designing MFSK for HF With appropriate parameter selection, MFSK can tolerate significant Doppler or delay spreads, especially when augmented with forward error correction. (Mitigating large amounts of Doppler and delay spread is significantly more challenging, but it is still possible). A long delay spread with little Doppler spreading can be mitigated with a relatively long MFSK symbol period to allow the channel to \\"settle down\\" quickly at the start of each new symbol. Because a long symbol contains more energy than a short one for a given transmitter power, the detector can more easily attain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resultant throughput reduction can be partly compensated with a large tone set so that each symbol represents several data bits; a long symbol interval allows these tones to be packed more closely in frequency while maintaining orthogonality. This is limited by the exponential growth of tone set size with the number of data bits/symbol. Conversely, if the Doppler spread is large while the delay spread is small, then a shorter symbol period may permit coherent tone detection and the tones must be spaced more widely to maintain orthogonality. The most challenging case is when the delay and Doppler spreads are both large, i.e., the coherence bandwidth and coherence time are both small. This is more common on auroral and EME channels than on HF, but it can occur. A short coherence time limits the symbol time, or more precisely, the maximum coherent detection interval at the receiver. If the symbol energy is too small for an adequate per-symbol detection SNR, then one alternative is transmit a symbol longer than the coherence time but to detect it with a filter much wider than one matched to the transmitted symbol. (The filter should instead be matched to the tone spectrum expected at the receiver). This will capture much of the symbol energy despite Doppler spreading, but it will necessarily do so inefficiently. A wider tone spacing, i.e., a wider channel, is also required. Forward error correction is especially helpful in this case. MFSK schemes for HF Because of the wide variety of conditions found on HF, a wide variety of MFSK schemes, some of them experimental, have been developed for HF. Some of them are: * MFSK8 * MFSK16 * Olivia MFSK * Coquelet * Piccolo * ALE (MIL-STD 188-141) * DominoF * DominoEX * THROB * CIS-36 MFSK or CROWD-36 * XPA, XPA2 Piccolo was the original MFSK mode, developed for British government communications by Harold Robin, Donald Bailey and Denis Ralphs of the Diplomatic Wireless Service (DWS), a branch of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It was first used in 1962 and presented to the IEE in 1963. The current specification \\"Piccolo Mark IV\\" was still in limited use by the UK government, mainly for point-to- point military radio communications, up to the late 1990s. Coquelet is a similar modulation system developed by the French government for similar applications. MFSK8 and MFSK16 were developed by Murray Greenman, ZL1BPU for amateur radio communications on HF. Olivia MFSK is also an amateur radio mode. Greenman has also developed DominoF and DominoEX for NVIS radio communications on the upper MF and lower HF frequencies (1.8‚Äì7.3 MHz). Automatic link establishment (ALE) is a protocol developed by the USA military and used mainly as an automatic signalling system between radios. It is used extensively for military and government communications worldwide and by radio amateurs.It is standardized as MIL-STD-188-141B, which succeeded the older version MIL-STD-188-141A. \\"CIS-36 MFSK\\" or \\"CROWD-36\\" () is the western designation of a system similar to Piccolo developed in the former Soviet Union for military communications. \\"XPA\\" and \\"XPA2\\" are ENIGMA-2000 For information about ENIGMA and ENIGMA-2000 see Notes and References section in Letter beacon. designations for polytonic tranismissions, reportedly originating from Russian Intelligence and Foreign Ministry stations.

These specialized MFSK modulation systems are used over troposcattering, EME (earth-moon-earth) and meteoscattering radio paths. PI4PI4 is a digital mode specifically designed for VUSHF beacon and propagation studies. The mode was developed as part of the Next Generation Beacons project among others used by the oldest amateur beacon in the world OZ7IGY. A decoder for PI4 is available in the PI-RX program developed by Poul-Erik Hansen, OZ1CKG. DTMF was initially developed for telephone line signaling.

It was a particularly noted phenomenon of the Royal Air Force's Bomber Command night attacks during World War II. The most dangerous time of a bombing raid in World War II was during the bombing run, the approach to the target. The bomber pilot was required to hold the aircraft straight and level, unable to take evasive action in the face of fierce enemy air defences over the target, including searchlights, night fighters and anti- aircraft fire. The temptation was strong for the bomber crew to 'flinch' and release their bombs slightly before reaching the target indicator flares that marked the aiming point. The fires started by the short bombs tended to be used as an aiming point by subsequent crews, who in turn also dropped their bomb loads slightly short. The result was that \\"the bombing inevitably crept back along the line of the bomb run.\\"Middlebrook, p99 The problem was further exacerbated by the need to re-mark the target with flares as the original markers were extinguished or hidden by smoke and flame. The marker aircraft were also susceptible to creepback, which accelerated the effect on subsequent waves of bombers. The RAF could find no effective counter to the problem of Creepback, and eventually incorporated it into their mission planning.Middlebrook, p100 The initial aiming point for a bombing raid would be set on the far side of the target as the bomber stream approached, allowing the bombing pattern to 'creep back' across the target, which was usually an industrial or residential district of a city. Creepback may not have been so pronounced during American day bombing raids, because the large, tightly- packed American bomber formations dropped their bombs together when the formation leader's aircraft bombed. In the British bomber stream tactic, by contrast, each aircraft bombed independently while flying at a set height and course.

She descended patrilineally from former Kings of Georgia. Her mother's family belonged to the untitled Polish aristocracy,The Times, London. \\"Leonida Georgievna Romanov\\", 15 June 2010. although one of Leonida's two lines of descent from Georgia's penultimate king Erekle II (Heraclius II) is through her mother, a descendant of the king's daughter, Princess Anastasia, who married an Eristavi prince. The other ancestral line derives through the marriage of another of the king's daughters, Princess Tamara, to Ioane Bagrationi, 18th Prince of Mukhrani. The Bagration family's genealogy traces back at least to the medieval era in its male line and hundreds of years further back as rulers in the female line.Eastmond, Antony (1998), Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia, pp. 135-7. Penn State Press, . Leonida's grandfather, Prince Alexander Bagration of Mukhrani, was born in 1853 in Georgia's historical capital Tbilisi, then part of the Russian Empire, and was killed by Bolsheviks at Pyatigorsk in 1918 during the Russian revolution. Fearing for their lives, the family took refuge in Constantinople, then spent eight months in Germany before returning to Tbilisi, now capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, to re-claim a portion of property which, as √©migr√©s they risked losing to total confiscation. Although the family made repairs to their home and Leonida would recall her grandfather's insistence that they continue to dine formally on silver plate to retain their sense of propriety, they were eventually deprived of all but two rooms of their old palace and subjected to harassment.The Telegraph.co.uk, London. \\"Grand Duchess Leonida of Russia\\", 28 May 2010. Thanks to the intervention of Maxim Gorky, who had enjoyed the patronage of the Bagrations, in 1931 they once again fled the Soviet Union, going into exile in Spain. The family moved to France, where Leonida's grandmother and relations had already settled. First marriage In France, Princess Leonida met Sumner Moore Kirby (1895‚Äì1945), a wealthy \\"Pennsylvanian Protestant\\". They were married in Nice, France, on 6 November 1934. Sumner Moore Kirby had been born in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, the younger of two sons of Fred Morgan Kirby, a millionaire and business partner of one of the F. W. Woolworth Company heirs (Charles Sumner Woolworth) and his wife Jessie Amelie Owen. Leonida was his third wife, he having been married from 1925 to 1931 to Doris Landy Wayland, with whom he had a daughter, Gloria Price Kirby (1928-2017). Kirby's second marriage, to Valentine Wagner, lasted from 20 January 1932 to 19 July 1934. Valentine Wagner's mother was born Princess Elisabeth Bagration, a member of the same family as Princess Leonida. Her father was Prof. Conrad Wagner. Kirby had no children of this marriage which, like his first and third marriages, was contracted civilly in Nice and dissolved there. Leonida and Sumner Kirby had one daughter, Helen Louise Kirby, born in Geneva, Switzerland, on 26 January 1935. Their marriage was short-lived, they divorced after three years on 18 November 1937. Kirby died in a hospital at Leau, near the Buchenwald Concentration Camp to which he had been deported from France after being arrested along with other U.S. and British civilians by the Vichy regime in 1944. As war intensified, Leonida and her daughter relocated to officially neutral Spain. In 1944, Leonida's brother, Prince Irakli, also moved to Spain. Second marriage According to her published memoirs, Leonida first met Vladimir Kirillovich at a restaurant in France during World War II. But they did not see each other again for a few years, when both were making extended visits to Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, Spain, where their hosts happened to be neighbors. Vladimir was staying with his aunt, the Infanta Beatrice de Orleans, first cousin of the murdered Tsarina Alexandra. On 13 August 1948 Princess Leonida wed for the second time, marrying Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, who used the pre-revolutionary Russian title Grand Duke, the style Imperial Highness and claimed to be, from 1938 to his death, Head of the Russian Imperial HouseAnnouncement by the Office of the Head of the Russian Imperial House .

In 1783, the Treaty of Georgievsk was signed through which the Kingdom of Georgia, while retaining its autonomy and its ancient monarchy was placed under the protection of the Russian Empire. In 1801 after the death of George XII, the last King of Georgia, Tsar Alexander I of Russia in violation of the treaty, annexed the kingdom of Georgia and the Bagration dynasty lost its throne. The Bagrations became a leading family of the Russian nobility, serving in the Tsar's army and at court in Saint Petersburg. The former ruling branch became extinct in the late 19th century , when it passed its succession rights to the branch to which Grand Duchess Leonida belonged, but this too is disputed. As his consort she used the title Grand Duchess Leonida Georgievna. By him, she had another daughter, Maria Vladimirovna, who claims to have succeeded her father upon his death in 1992.Website of Grand Duchess Maria In 1946, Leonida's brother, Prince Irakly, married King Alfonso XIII's niece, Princess Do√±a Mar√≠a de las Mercedes de Baviera y Borbon (1911‚Äì1953), obtaining Vladimir's recommendation that the Spanish pretender, Don Juan, Count of Barcelona, accept the marriage as dynastic, which he did not. The Count of Barcelona, then Head of the Royal House of Spain, considered the issue of this marriage to be disqualified from the Spanish succession. The only son of this marriage was sponsored at his baptism by the Count of Barcelona but the latter's refusal to recognize his god-son as a Spanish dynast led to the Bagrations' alienation from the Spanish Royal Family according to Guy Stair Sainty.

Controversy The Grand Duke's marriage to Leonida Bagration remained controversial; some considered it to be morganatic. Although the princess descended from the Bagrationi dynasty which had ruled as kings of Georgia since the early Middle Ages, it had been deposed and reduced to the status of Russian nobility for more than a century prior to the Russian Revolution in 1917. Leonida belonged to the senior surviving branch of that family , but the last Georgian king from whom she descended in the male line was Constantine II who died in 1505,Cyril Toumanoff, \\"The Fifteenth-Century Bagratides and the Institution of Collegial Sovereignty in Georgia\\". Traditio. Volume VII, Fordham University Press, New York 1949‚Äì1951, pp. 169‚Äì221. although other branches of the family continued to reign in the Caucasus as late as 1810. Besides, according to the Almanach de Gotha, as per the decision of Emperor Nicholas II made in 1911, the Princess Tatiana Constantinovna of Russia had morganatically wed Prince Konstantin Alexandrovich Bagration- Mukhransky, a member of the same branch of the House of Bagration into which Princess Leonida would later be born. Because the Russian Empire did not accord royal rank to the Bagrations at the time of the Russian Revolution, most Romanov dynasts in exile maintained that Leonida's daughter, Maria Vladimirovna, could not succeed to her father's claim to the Russian throne. Claimant's consort Leonida accompanied her husband when he made his only visit to Russia in November 1991, following the implosion of the Soviet Union. She was also at Vladimir's side the following year when he collapsed and died following delivery of a speech in Florida. She visited her own ancestral land with her nephew Prince George Bagration of Mukhrani in 1995 when he first visited Georgia as a royal pretender to that country's abolished monarchy. But she did not attend the much-publicized 2009 wedding of her grand-nephew, Prince David Bagration of Mukhrani to Princess Ana Bagration-Gruzinsky, the heiress of King George XII of Georgia, celebrated at the restored Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi. Nor did she re-locate her home from western Europe to Russia, although she visited the country repeatedly following her husband's funeral and burial in Saint Petersburg. Wealth inherited by her elder, unmarried daughter Helen Kirby (styled by Vladimir's declaration as \\"Countess Dvinskaya\\"), helped Leonida, her second husband and younger daughter maintain homes in the north of France and in Madrid. There, both Maria Vladimirovna, who remains active as the claimant to the throne of the Romanovs in exile, and Maria's only son, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich (born in 1981, his father is Maria's ex-husband and distant cousin, Prince Franz Wilhelm of Prussia), were reared. Death Leonida Georgievna died on 23 May 2010, after her health had rapidly deteriorated. She requested to be buried next to her husband Vladimir Kirillovich in the Grand Ducal Mausoleum, Saint Petersburg.

The town is located from Montbrison along the D8. It was originally built on the volcanic peak (le puy), but has since migrated to the plain. Geography Le Puy itself is of volcanic origin and the surrounding plain of Forez has basaltic conglomerates. Wells have been sunk to exploit the naturally sparkling mineral waters. History Le Puy is located on the Roman road, the Bol√®ne Way, linking Lyon (Lugdunum) to Bordeaux (Burdigala), which was constructed during the reign of the emperor Augustus, by his son-in-law Agrippa. It is also on the Gallo-Roman way from Sury to Changy. These roads were later reused by pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela. About 500, Car√©t√®ne (aunt of Saint Clotilde the wife of Clovis) replaced a temple of Venus (famous for a bath of youth utilising the areas' mineral springs) by a Christian church dedicated to Saint Michael. Guy II de Forez, the feudal lord of Saint- Romain-le-Puy, was the vassal of Louis VII. In 1173, the fief of Saint-Romain was transferred from Ainay Abbey to the County of Lyon. In 1218, Count Guy IV de Forez, gave the priory (founded in 1007) into the care of the religious of Saint-Thomas-les-Nonnains. There was longstanding conflict between the chateau and the priory. In 1431, the town was pillaged by routiers under Rodrigo de Villandrando on orders from the Crown as part of the quashing of a jacquerie. In 1531, Forez passed from the control of the Dukes of Bourbon to the Crown of France. In 1633, the surrounding town wall was destroyed by order of Richelieu. During World War I, the town lost 102 soldiers. Population Economy Local industries include Mineral Waters (Fran√ßois Parot, a public works entrepreneur sunk a well in 1858) and Glassmaking (Saint-Gobain- Emballage factory founded in 1893). Agriculture includes beef rearing, dairying and wine-growing. Sights * Gallo-Roman villa at the nearby Ch√©zieux; * Priory of Saint-Romain-le-Puy 10th century to 14th century.

Family Jael shows Sisera lying dead to Barak, James Tissot, 1896-1902 Jael was the wife of Heber the Kenite.Frymer-Kensky, Tikva. \\"Jael: Bible.\\" Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 1 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive (Viewed on April 25, 2020) The Kenites were a nomadic tribe, some of whom lived in close proximity to the Israelites. The Bible records a number of cases of intermarriage; the father-in-law of Moses was apparently a Kenite, but it is not clear if this was Jethro. The Kenites may have been a part of the Midianite group. =Heber the Kenite= Heber the Kenite () was, according to the Book of Judges in the Bible, a descendant of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses. He had separated himself and his wife Jael from the other Kenites and pitched their tent in the plain of Zaanaim, which is near Kedesh in the tribal territory of Naphtali.Judges 4:11 Heber lived approximately during the 12th century BC in the Hula Valley (anciently known as Zaanaim) of northern Israel during the time of the Israelite judges. According to Jack Sasson, there are reasons to doubt whether the events narrated in Judges 4 ever occurred. Jael in the Book of Judges Deborah, a prophetess and judge, advises Barak to mobilize the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulon on Mount Tabor to do battle against King Jabin of Canaan. Barak demurred, saying he would go, provided she would also. Deborah agreed but prophesied that the honour of defeating Jabin's army would then go to a woman. Jabin's army was led by Sisera (Judg. 4:2). The armies met on the plain of Esdraelon, where Sisera's iron-bound chariots became hampered by the mud caused by a downpour during the night that caused the Wadi Kishon to overflow its banks. The Canaanites were defeated and Sisera fled the scene. Limoges enamel plaque, 1550-75 Sisera arrived on foot at the tent of Heber on the plain of Zaanaim. Heber and his household were at peace with Jabin, the king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor.Judges 4:17 Jael, however, sympathized with the Israelites because of the twenty-year period of harsh oppression inflicted on them by Jabin, his commander Sisera, and his nine hundred iron chariots. Jael (whose tent would have been separate from Heber's) Barnes' Notes on Judges 4, accessed 17 October 2016 welcomed Sisera into her tent and covered him with a blanket. As he was thirsty, she gave him a jug of milk. Exhausted, Sisera lay down and soon fell asleep. While he was sleeping, Jael took a mallet and drove a tent peg into his temple, killing him instantly. The \\"Song of Deborah\\" (Judg. 5:24-26) recounts: Scholars have long recognized that the Song of Deborah, on the basis of linguistic evidence (archaic biblical Hebrew), is one of the oldest parts of the Bible, dating back to the 12th century BC. Extra-biblical references Jan Saenredam engraving picturing Jael killing Sisera Pseudo-Philo refers to Jael in the book, Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum: > Now Jael took a stake in her left hand and approached him, saying, \\"If God > will work this sign with me, I know that Sisera will fall into my hands. > Behold I will throw him down on the ground from the bed on which he sleeps; > and if he does not feel it, I know that he has been handed over.\\" And Jael > took Sisera and pushed him onto the ground from the bed. But he did not feel > it, because he was very groggy. And Jael said, \\"Strengthen in me today, > Lord, my arm on account of you and your people and those who hope in you.\\" > And Jael took the stake and put it on his temple and struck it with a > hammer. And while he was dying, Sisera said to Jael, \\"Behold pain has taken > hold of me, Jael, and I die like a woman.\\" And Jael said to him, \\"Go, boast > before your father in hell and tell him that you have fallen into the hands > of a woman.\\" There is also a reference to the story of Jael in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. During the Wife of Bath's Prologue, and whilst discussing her fifth husband's \\"book of wikked wives\\", Chaucer mentions some wives who \\"han drive nailes in hir brain, / Whil that they slepte, and thus they had hem slain.\\" Commentary Judges 4:17 states that there was peace between the Canaanites and Heber's clan. They were familiar to the Israelites through the connection of Jethro to Moses, and their skill as metalworkers was welcomed wherever they camped. Both sides in the conflict would have considered the Kenites a neutral party. C.E. Schenk notes that Sisera was Jael's guest, \\"was in the sanctuary of her home, and protected by the laws of hospitality.\\"Schenk, C. E., \\"Jael\\", International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, (James Orr, ed.) 1915 According to Herbert Lockyer she may have acted out of practical necessity. Sisera was in flight and Barak in pursuit. It would not have been wise to allow Barak to find Sisera in her tent. She also knew that Sisera would be killed if captured, therefore she would kill him and thus cement a friendship with the victor.Lockyer, Herbert. \\"Jael\\", All the Women of the Bible, Zondervan, 1967 Biblical commentaries have viewed Jael as either a heroine or someone much less so. Newsom and Ringe consider her a survivor caught up in her husband's politics.Newsom, Carol Ann and Ringe, Sharon H., Women's Bible Commentary, Westminster John Knox Press, 1998, p.76 Parallels between the details of Jael's actions and Ehud's assassination of Eglon have led van Wijk-Bos to propose Jael as killing Sisera in a manner similar to his conquering army's use of rape. Christian moral theorists during the Renaissance extensively referred to Jael as example of tyrannicide. Artistic depictions of Jael Jael and Sisera, by Artemisia Gentileschi. Medieval images of Jael, mostly in illuminated manuscripts, depicted her as both a defender of Israel and a prefiguration of the Virgin Mary. This can be seen in the Stavelot Bible, the Speculus Darmstadt, as well as several other texts. When not shown in the act of killing Sisera, she carries her hammer and sometimes the spike, making her easy to identify. In the Renaissance the subject is one of the most commonly shown in the Power of Women topos, with other biblical women who triumphed over men, such as Judith or Delilah. Here she was used to show the risk for men in following women, in groupings including positive figures and scenes such as Judith beheading Holofernes, but mostly ones with females depicted as over-powerful, such as Phyllis riding Aristotle, Samson and Delilah, Salome and her mother Herodias and the Idolatry of Solomon. More positively, Jael was included in sets of the female Nine Worthies, such as the prints by Hans Burgkmair.H Diane Russell (ed), Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints, pp. 36-39, 147-148, 154-155, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990, Ladies sometimes chose to have their portraits painted as Jael, a transformation achieved by holding a hammer and spike.One illustrated below; see also this example from Amsterdam in 1640 In the Baroque period, Jael continued to be a sexual figure in art. Works by Gregorio Lazzarini and Artemisia Gentileschi are two examples of an attractive Jael, shown in the act of killing her foe. Jael is portrayed in the French silent film Jael and Sisera (1911), directed by Henri Andr√©ani.Ja√´l et Sisera at IMDb.com, December 15, 2010.

He was a second baseman in Major League Baseball between 1882 and 1897. His final game took place on June 14, 1897. During his career he played for the Troy Trojans (1882), Chicago White Stockings (1883‚Äì1889), Chicago Pirates (1890), Chicago Colts (1891, 1896‚Äì1897), Louisville Colonels (1892‚Äì1895) and New York Giants (1896). Pfeffer was one of the last barehanded fielders in baseball, and he was the first player to foil a double steal by cutting off a catcher's throw to second base and returning it to home plate. Known as an organizer among players, Pfeffer was active in establishing the Players' League in 1890 and was involved in an attempt to reestablish the American Association in 1894. He was a manager at the collegiate and minor-league levels, and after his baseball career he ran a successful Chicago bar until Prohibition. Early life Pfeffer was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and little is known about his family. However, his parents likely came to the U.S. from Germany, as Pfeffer spoke German fluently into adulthood. He began a three-year stint with a semipro baseball team in Louisville in 1879. In 1881, Pfeffer asserted himself as a staunch opponent to racial integration in baseball, walking off the field with teammate John Reccius when an opposing team tried to play black catcher Moses Fleetwood Walker. Early career Pfeffer debuted in the major leagues with the Troy Trojans on May 1, 1882. Pfeffer was teammates with four future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, but the Trojans finished in seventh place and the team was dissolved that December. After a successful trial during an exhibition series, Pfeffer was signed by the Chicago White Stockings, and he became a fan favorite among the city's German population; they dubbed him \\"Unser Fritz\\" (\\"Our Fritz\\"). Pfeffer (top row, far right) with the 1885 Chicago White Stockings For the next seven seasons, Pfeffer was a member of Chicago's \\"stonewall infield\\". He became known as a strong defensive player who could make difficult throws from his back or his knees. Pfeffer was one of the last players who refused to wear a baseball glove. When the opposition attempted a stolen base, he was the first major-league infielder to cut off throws from the catcher and return the ball to home plate to avoid the double steal. Pfeffer was often among the league leaders in errors, but these totals were influenced by the fact that he was able to come close to the ball on some impossibly difficult plays. Most of his peers could not get near such difficult balls, so they were actually charged with fewer errors. Pfeffer was sometimes known as \\"Dandelion\\" because of his ability to \\"pick\\" ground balls hit in the infield. In a game against the Detroit Wolverines on September 6, 1883, Pfeffer, Tom Burns and Ned Williamson each collected a record-breaking three hits in one inning for Chicago. The White Stockings got 18 hits and 18 runs in that inning and they won the game 26‚Äì6. No other major-league player had three hits in an inning until 1953. In 1888, Pfeffer was a member of an American all-star baseball team that went on a world tour to Australia. The next year, Pfeffer wrote Scientific Ball, which focused on the importance of baserunning and defense. It was one of the first books about baseball. In 1890, he was also one of the organizers of the Chicago Pirates of the upstart, short-lived Players' League. He bragged that he had raised $20,000 in twenty minutes in support of the league, and he said that he could have raised five times that amount. His efforts led to the signing of Charles Comiskey as the Pirates' manager. Later career When the Players' League folded after the 1890 season, Pfeffer fell back under contract with Chicago. Pfeffer's relationship with Chicago manager Cap Anson had long been strained, and when Anson harshly criticized the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players (the union responsible for the formation of the Players' League), relations between Pfeffer and Anson deteriorated and the two were not on speaking terms for several years. He was traded to the Louisville Colonels in exchange for Jim Canavan before the 1892 season. In his first season with the Colonels, he served as player-manager for part of the year, assuming the managerial duties from Jack Chapman. Pfeffer played for the hapless squad through the 1895 season. Before his final year with the Colonels, Pfeffer had been forced out of the National League when it was discovered that he had been involved in an attempt to revive the American Association the year before. A petition was signed by 10,000 fans and the league allowed Pfeffer to return to the Colonels for 1895. That year he also led the University of Wisconsin baseball team to a 10‚Äì8 win-loss record in his only season as the team's manager, and he coached for Princeton University. After playing 11 games with Louisville in 1895, Pfeffer announced that he was retiring. He signed with the New York Giants in 1896, where owner Andrew Freedman quickly suspended him, ostensibly for being in poor physical condition. Realizing that he was being blacklisted, Pfeffer quit, leading to a protracted legal battle over his pay. More than a decade later, a court awarded Pfeffer $680 in back salary. Pfeffer re-signed with Chicago for the remainder of the 1896 season. He enjoyed significant playing time that year, but he was limited by injuries in 1897, his last year as a major-league player. After that, he played semipro baseball in Wisconsin for several years. He broke his arm while throwing a ball before the 1902 season, and that ended Pfeffer's playing career for good. Pfeffer entered coaching at the minor-league level. He managed the Decatur Commodores of the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League in 1902. After a long hiatus from managing, he was one of three men to manage a minor-league team in Pawtucket in 1914. After baseball Pfeffer owned Pfeffer's Bar, which was located behind McVicker's Theater in Chicago and which attracted both theater buffs and baseball fans. The bar was successful until the onset of Prohibition; the Chicago Tribune reported that he sold it in 1920 for $1.50. Late in his life he was a press box employee at racetracks in Chicago. Pfeffer died of heart disease at his Chicago home at age 72. He was survived by his wife, Ida. A Tribune column said that because baseball players earned unremarkable salaries, Ida had been left destitute. The Tribune said that it would forward any fan contributions to the widow.

After Cornwallis fought in Scotland, putting down the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, he was appointed Groom of the Chamber for King George II. He was then made Governor of Nova Scotia (1749‚Äì1752), one of the colonies in North America, and assigned to establish the new town of Halifax, Nova Scotia.... from 1713 to 1749 Nova Scotia was neglected by England, but the crafty designs of the French to acquire by fraud what they could not obtain by force drew the attention of the British public to the importance of the colony, and encouragements were held out to retired officers, &c.; to whom officers of grants of land were made; 3760 adventurers were embarked with their families for the colony; Parliament granted 40,000‚Ñì. for their support, and they landed at Chebucto harbour, where the town of Halifax was soon erected by the new emigrants under the command of their Governor the Hon. Edward Cornwallis Later Cornwallis returned to London, where he was elected as MP for Westminster and married the niece of Robert Walpole, Great Britain's first Prime Minister. Cornwallis was next appointed as Governor of Gibraltar. Cornwallis' administration in Nova Scotia implemented the first constitution in a Canadian colony, establishing both an Executive and Legislative Council. It instituted the first British law courts in Canada (court of General Sessions, County Court, and Supreme Court); erected forts at Grand Pre, Chignecto and Halifax; organized a militia of 840 men; established a public school for orphans; and respected religious diversity through separation of church and state. It also recruited immigrants to Halifax, establishing the first Jewish community (from negotiations with the emigration and colonization committee of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews‚Äô Congregation of London, England), the first ethnic German community, made up of Protestants from Germany and Switzerland, and the first Protestant dissenting congregation in a Canadian colony.Sheldon Godfrey and Judy Godfrey. \\"Search Out the Land\\", The Jews and the Growth of Equality in British Colonial America, 1740‚Äì1867.

The \\"Foreign Protestants\\" and the Settlement of Nova Scotia: The History of a Piece of Arrested British Colonial Policy in the Eighteenth Century. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1961 Cornwallis is commemorated in Nova Scotia in the naming of its rivers, parks, streets, towns, and buildings. Such historic commemoration of Cornwallis has become controversial because of his extirpation proclamation of 1749 during hostilities with the indigenous MiÍûåkmaq peoples of peninsular Nova Scotia. Some Nova Scotians have objected to honouring him and have supported protests at a statue of Cornwallis in a downtown Halifax park. This sculpture has been removed by the city and placed into storage. In a related action, the Halifax Regional School Board removed Cornwallis's name from a junior high school. The Halifax city government has struck a committee to discuss how Cornwallis should be commemorated. Early life Cornwallis' grandfather, Charles Cornwallis, 3rd Baron Cornwallis, was First Lord of the Admiralty. His maternal grandfather was Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Arran, a Governor of Ireland (1682-1684). Cornwallis was the son of Charles, 4th Baron Cornwallis, and Lady Charlotte Butler, daughter of the Earl of Arran and his wife. The Cornwallis family possessed estates at Culford in Suffolk and the Channel Islands. His nephews were Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, James Cornwallis, 4th Earl Cornwallis, and William Cornwallis. Cornwallis and his twin brother, Frederick Cornwallis, were made royal pages at the age of 12. They were enrolled at Eton at age 14. Their older brother, Stephen Cornwallis, the third son born, was a career officer and rose to the rank of major-general in the Army. Initially it was not determined which twin brother would enter the church and which the military. The matter was decided by accident: one day, Frederick fell and the injury paralysed his arm. He would take the religious path. At age 18, in 1731, Edward was commissioned into the 47th Regiment of Foot. Military career  In the 20th regiment, led by Brig. General Thomas Bligh, Edward Cornwallis participated in the Battle of Fontenoy during the War of the Austrian Succession. He fought under Colonel Craig, who was killed in action. Cornwallis took over command of the regiment and organised a retreat. Cornwallis's regiment lost eight officers and 385 men. While the retreat was respected by the military, the British public chided expedition for their losses. Cornwallis played an important role in suppressing the Jacobite rising of 1745. After fighting with the victorious government soldiers at the Battle of Culloden, he led a regiment of 320 men north for the pacification of the Scottish Highlands. The Duke of Cumberland ordered him to \\"plunder, burn and destroy through all the west part of Invernesshire called Lochaber.\\" Cumberland added: \\"You have positive orders to bring no more prisoners to the camp.\\" Cumberland's campaign was later described by one historian as one of unrestrained violence. Cornwallis ordered his men to chase off livestock, and destroy crops and food stores. Against Cornwallis' orders, some soldiers raped and murdered non-combatants in an incident to intimidate Jacobites from further rebellion. In 1747 Cornwallis was made a Groom of the Bedchamber, serving in the households of both kings George II and George III until 1764. Governor of Nova Scotia =Founding of Halifax= Province House was later also built on this site and it is furnished still with his Nova Scotia Council table.) The British Government appointed Cornwallis as Governor of Nova Scotia with the task of establishing a new British settlement to counter France's Fortress Louisbourg. In this period, governors were frequently selected from senior officers. He sailed from England aboard HMS Sphinx on 14 May 1749, followed by a settlement expedition of 15 vessels (including HMS Baltimore and HMS Winchelsea) carrying about 2500 settlers. Cornwallis arrived at Chebucto Harbour on 21 June 1749, followed by the rest of the fleet five days later. The expedition suffered only one death during the passage, due to careful preparations, good ventilation on the ships, and good luck. This was remarkable at a time when the lengthy transatlantic expeditions regularly lost large numbers of persons to infectious disease. Cornwallis immediately had to decide where to site the town. Settlement organizers in England had recommended Point Pleasant, due to its close access to the ocean and ease of defence. His naval advisers opposed this site because it lacked shelter and had shallows preventing the docking of ocean-going ships. They wanted the town to be located at the head of Bedford Basin, a sheltered location with deep water. Others favoured Dartmouth. Cornwallis decided to land the settlers and build the town at the site of present-day Downtown Halifax; it was halfway up the harbour with deep water, and protected by a natural, defensible hill (later known as Citadel Hill). By 24 July, the plans of the town had been drawn up. In August lots were drawn to award settlers their town plots in a settlement that was to be named \\"Halifax\\" after Lord Halifax, the President of the Board of Trade and Plantations. Lord Halifax (likely his staff) had drawn up the expedition plans for the British Government. =Father Le Loutre's War= The table first used by Edward Cornwallis and the Nova Scotia Council (1749), The Red Chamber of Province House When Cornwallis arrived in Halifax, there had already been a decades-long history of the Mi'kmaq participating in raids on British settlements in present-day Maine, often allied with French colonists in continuing national tensions. Both sides took captives, sometimes for ransom or adoption by First Nations. (See the Northeast Coast Campaigns 1688, 1703, 1723, 1724, 1745, 1746, 1747). During this time period, various British governors had issued proclamations against the Mi'kmaq for their participation in the raids. One of Cornwallis's first priorities was to renew early treaties with the Mi'kmaq and other indigenous tribes in the region. He met with chiefs of the Maliseet, Passamaquoddy and Mi'kmaq (Mi'kmaw) from Chignecto in the Summer of 1749. They agreed with the British to end fighting and renewed an earlier 1725 treaty drafted in Boston, redrafted as the Treaty of 1749. Cornwallis's efforts to have other Mi'kmaq tribes sign treaties were rejected. Most Mi'kmaq leaders in Nova Scotia had aligned themselves with French forces. Mi'kmaq leaders met at St. Peters in Cape Breton in September 1749 to respond to these British actions. They composed a letter to Cornwallis making it clear that, while they tolerated the small garrison at Annapolis Royal, they completely opposed settlement at Halifax: > \\"The place where you are, where you are building dwellings, where you are > now building a fort, where you want, as it were, to enthrone yourself, this > land of which you want to make yourself absolute master, this land belongs > to me\\". Mi'kmaq leaders regarded the Halifax settlement as \\"a great theft that you have perpetrated against me.\\" Cornwallis sought to project British military power throughout Nova Scotia by establishing forts in the largest Acadian communities, at Pisiguit (Windsor) (Fort Edward), Grand Pr√© (Fort Vieux Logis), and Chignecto (Fort Lawrence). The French erected forts at present- day Saint John, Chignecto (Fort Beaus√©jour), and Port Elgin, New Brunswick. The fighting started when Acadians and Mi'kmaq responded by attacking the British at Chignecto, Canso and Dartmouth. To stop the raids on the British settlements and pressure the natives into submission, Cornwallis announced an extirpation proclamation to remove the Mi'kmaq from peninsular Nova Scotia. As part of the proclamation, he offered a bounty for the capture or scalps of Mi'kmaw men. Later instructions offered a bounty for the capture of women and children: the bounty promised a reward for \\"every Indian you shall destroy (upon producing his Scalp as the Custom is) or every Indian taken [prisoner], Man, Woman or Child.\\"Olive Dickason, LOUISBOURG AND THE INDIANS: A STUDY IN IMPERIAL RACE RELATIONS, 1713‚Äì1760, University of Ottawa, 1971, at p. 138, referencing Cornwallis' instructions to Capt. Silvanus Cobb, commanding the sloop York, 13 January 1750For some contemporary commentators, the original proclamation's reference to the bounty applying to \\"every Indian\\" created confusion over whether or not the bounty targeted only Mi'kmaw men or all Mi'kmaw people. Cornwallis' later instructions to Cobb clarifies that the initial bounty was offered only for Mi'kmaw males and the instructions added a reward for taking Mi'kmaw women and children as captives. Despite the bounty, the British forces and settlers had virtually no encounters with the Mi'kmaq and their raids against the British continued. Cornwallis increased the bounty dramatically for Mi'kmaw warriors. Settlers brought in only one scalp in the next nine months. Note: The newspaper article has the date of the increase of the bounty wrong, saying that the amount was increased \\"four months\\" from the day the letter was written, but it was nine months later. Over the next two years, the indigenous and Acadian raids continued against the British at rand Pre, Chignecto, Dartmouth and once on Halifax. Fort Edward, named after Edward Cornwallis In May 1751, the Mi'kmaq mounted their largest attack on British settlers with the Raid on Dartmouth. With this raid, the Mi'kmaq stopped British expansion and they stopped attacking. Cornwallis interpreted the cessation of attacks as the Mi'kmaq wanting peace. Cornwallis laid the foundation for and was at the signing of the Treaty of 1752 with Major Cope, attending at Cope's request. Having committed to being Governor only for two years, Cornwallis eventually resigned his commission and left the colony in October 1752. The treaty was ultimately rejected by most of the other Mi'kmaq leaders. Cope burned the treaty six months after he signed it. As Governor, Cornwallis reported to the Board of Trade of Britain. The Board repeatedly expressed concern to Cornwallis for overspending: over the amount of bread delivered, the cost of arming Chignecto. In March 1751, Cornwallis was told that he would lose the confidence of parliament unless he refrained from overspending in the future. Cornwallis replied that the Board had underestimated the task of establishing Halifax under such hostile conditions and that to ‚Äúflatter Your Lordships with hopes of savings‚Äù would be ‚Äúdissimulation of the worst kind.‚Äù Cornwallis left Nova Scotia in October 1752. This was three years before the end of Father Le Loutre's War. He was appointed Colonel of the 24th Regiment of Foot and was elected to parliament in 1753. Seven Years' War Edward Cornwallis, etching of John Giles Eccardt portrait In November 1756 Cornwallis was one of three colonels who were ordered to proceed to Gibraltar and from there embark for Menorca, which was then under siege from the French. Admiral John Byng called a council of war, which involved Cornwallis, and advised the return of the fleet to Gibraltar leaving the garrison at Menorca to its fate. Byng, Cornwallis and the other officers were arrested when they returned to England. A large, unruly mob attacked the officers as they left their ships in Portsmouth and later burned effigies of Cornwallis and the other officers. The officers faced court martial on \\"suspicion of disobedience of orders and neglect of duty.\\"The Report of the General Officers, Appointed to enquire into the conduct of Major General Stuart, and Colonels Cornwallis and the Earl of Effingham, 8 December 1756. Byng was found guilty and executed. Cornwallis testified that he had not disobeyed orders, but that it was \\"impracticable\\" to land at Menorca due to stiff French defences. Further, he said he was following Byng's command. \\"I looked upon myself as under the command of the admiral and should have thought it my duty to have obeyed him\\", he testified. Cornwallis was judged to have been a passenger under the control of Byng and was thus exonerated. Cornwallis was also one of the senior officers in the September 1757 Raid on Rochefort which saw a failed amphibious descent on the French coastline. The vast force massed on the Isle of Wight before sailing for Rochefort. The fleet stopped at √éle D'Aix and examined the French defences. General Sir John Mordaunt, head of the land forces, decided the defences were too strong to attack. He called a council of war. Cornwallis voted to retreat, while Admiral Edward Hawke, head of the naval forces, and James Wolfe, quartermaster general, voted to attack. Mordaunt and Cornwallis carried the day and the mission was abandoned. Mordaunt was arrested and faced court martial. Cornwallis testified that an attempted landing at Rochefort would have been \\"dangerous, almost impracticable and madness.\\"The Proceedings of a General Court-Martial held at Whitehall upon the Trial of Lieutenant-General Sit John Mordaunt. James Wolfe wrote to his father in November 1757 and said Cornwallis \\"...has more zeal, more merit, and more integrity than one commonly meets with among men.... Cornwallis is a man of approved courage and fidelity.\\" Governor of Gibraltar Cornwallis served as the Governor of Gibraltar from 14 June 1761 to January 1776 when he died at the age of 63. His body was returned to England and laid to rest at Culford Parish Church in Culford, near Bury St. Edmunds on 9 February 1776. Both of his family titles are now extinct. In 1899, MacDonald wrote, \\"His name is fast coming under the category of ‚ÄòBritain's forgotten worthies'.\\" Personal life Edward Cornwallis' wife, Mary Townshend In 1763, Cornwallis married Mary Townshend, daughter of Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend and Dorothy Townshend (Walpole), the sister of Robert Walpole. His marriage to Mary did not produce any children. His brother, Charles Cornwallis, 1st Earl Cornwallis married Mary's half sister, Elizabeth, daughter of Charles and his first wife, Elizabeth Pelham. Through his brother's marriage, he became uncle of Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis.  Commemorations in Nova Scotia  Several buildings, (Canadian Forces Base Cornwallis, a former Canadian Forces Base located in Deep Brook, Nova Scotia) places (Cornwallis Street in Halifax, Cornwallis Street in Shelburne, Cornwallis street in Lunenburg, the Cornwallis River, and Cornwallis Park), and landmarks have been named after Cornwallis. A number of ships were named after Cornwallis, including the 1944 harbour ferry and the Canadian Coast Guard Ship . As a tourism initiative, a statue of Cornwallis was erected in 1931 at the centre of Cornwallis Park in downtown Halifax, also named for Cornwallis. These commemorations of Cornwallis have become controversial in Nova Scotia. Cornwallis Junior High School was renamed Halifax Central Junior High in January 2012, In 2018, the Cornwallis Street Baptist Church changed its name to New Horizons Baptist Church to disassociate itself from Cornwallis. The statue became the site of several Mi'kmaw protests in 2017 and the city established a committee to determine how to deal with the issue. Disturbed by lack of progress, in January 2018 the Assembly of Mi'kmaq Chiefs called for immediate removal of the statue. The Cornwallis statue was covered with a tarpaulin, then removed by order of Halifax Regional Council on 30 January 2018 and placed into storage. Council worked with Mi'kmaw Chiefs to establish a task force to examine the commemoration of Cornwallis and the final disposition of the statue, as well as how best to commemorate Indigenous history in the Halifax Regional Municipality. On 28 January 2019, a Nova Scotia school teacher was awarded the Governor General's History Award for her class's proposal to return the statue to Cornwallis Park as part of a larger commemoration of regional ethnic groups. They suggested that the Cornwallis statue be installed among three other statues: Acadian No√´l Doiron; Viola Desmond, a civil rights activist and Black Nova Scotian; and Mi'kmaw Chief John Denny Jr.. The four statutes would be positioned as if in a conversation with each other, discussing their accomplishments and struggles.

City of Vancouver Archives. Hogan's Alley was the local, unofficial name for Park Lane, an alley that ran through the southwestern corner of Strathcona in Vancouver, British Columbia during the first six decades of the twentieth century. It ran between Union and Prior Streets from approximately Main Street to Jackson Avenue. While Hogan's Alley and the surrounding area was an ethnically diverse neighbourhood during this era, home to many Italian, Chinese and Japanese Canadians, this was home to a number of black families, black businesses, and the city's only black church, the African Methodist Episcopal Fountain Chapel. As such, Hogan's Alley was the first and last neighbourhood in Vancouver with a substantial concentrated black population. A possible reason these families settled there was because of the close proximity to the train stations since sleeping car porters were predominantly black men.Sarah-Jane (Saje) Mathieu, \\"North of the Colour Line: Sleeping Car Porters and the Battle Against Jim Crow on Canadian Rails,1880-1920,\\" Labour/Le Travail no. 47 (Spring 2001). A 1957 study by the City of Vancouver Planning Department described the black population of Strathcona as such: \\"The Negro population, while numerically small, is probably a large proportion of the total Negro population in Vancouver. Their choice of this area is partly its proximity to the railroads where many of them are employed, partly its cheapness and partly the fact that it is traditionally the home of many non-white groups.\\"Vancouver Redevelopment Study (Vancouver: City of Vancouver Planning Department, 1957) 49. Prior to 1935, Hogan's Alley was a red light district, owing to Mayor L. D. Taylor's \\"open town policy,\\" which was that police resources would be concentrated on major crimes, not victimless vice crimes. As a result of this policy, illegal drinking establishments, brothels, and gambling dens operated here, as they did in various other non-white sections of town like Chinatown and Japantown, but also in non-ethnically defined areas nearby such as Gastown, East Hastings and lower Mount Pleasant. This policy also earned Taylor a reputation for being soft on vice crime and he faced accusations of corruption. This was the basis of his electoral defeats in 1929 and 1934. Hogan's Alley long outlived Taylor's career in civic politics until it faced demolition to make way for a freeway.Excerpt from Daniel Francis's L. D. in the Vancouver Courier, Most of Hogan's Alley was destroyed circa 1970 by the Non-Partisan Association civic government's construction of the Georgia Viaduct, the first phase of a planned interurban freeway originally through Hogan's Alley and much of Chinatown and Gastown.John Atkin, Strathcona: Vancouver's First Neighbourhood (Vancouver: Whitecap Books, 1994) 78-79. The freeway was stopped by an alliance of Strathcona community activists and Chinatown businesspeople. The freeway was blocked, and Strathcona, Chinatown and Gastown were saved from the wrecker's ball, but not before Hogan's Alley was mostly demolished. Today, the block or so that is left of the alley itself bears little to no mark that there was ever a black presence there, and is an indistinct part of Strathcona facing an empty lot adjacent to the busy Main Street on-ramps to the viaduct. One remaining landmark that suggests a black community was active in the Strathcona neighbourhood during the first six decades of the twentieth century is the Jimi Hendrix Shrine. The shrine, located on the corner of Union and Main, was created to celebrate the connection between Hendrix and Vancouver. Nora Hendrix, born in Knoxville, Tennessee and grandmother to the late musician, migrated to Vancouver in 1911 and lived in and around Hogan's Alley.Daphne Marlatt and Carole Itter, \\"Opening Doors: Vancouver's East End\\" (Victoria: Sound Heritage, 1979) 59-63. The alley was recreated in virtual form in the 2014 interactive work Circa 1948.

Baseball career Burkett made his debut for the San Francisco Giants late in the 1987 season, and pitched six innings in the majors. He was returned to the minors, where he remained for the next two years. His first full season for the Giants was 1990, during which he went 14‚Äì7 with a 3.79 ERA in 204 innings. Burkett's best season came in 1993 when he went 22‚Äì7 with a 3.65 ERA for the Giants. Burkett was a National League All-Star in 1993 and 2001. His 1996 postseason complete game win over the eventual World Series Champion New York Yankees was the first complete game in Divisional Series history, and the first postseason win in Texas Rangers history. After being released in Spring Training by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2000, he was picked up by the Atlanta Braves and resurrected a career thought by many to be over.

In 2010, he became its president and deputy group chief executive; and in January 2011, succeeded John Varley as group chief executive of Barclays. Diamond resigned as chief executive of Barclays after a Bank of England hearing on July 3, 2012, following controversy over manipulation of Libor interest rates by traders employed by the bank. Early years and education One of nine children, Diamond grew up in a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent. His parents, Anne and Robert Edward Diamond, Sr., were both teachers. He finished his schooling from Concord-Carlisle High School in 1969 and in 1973, obtained a B.A. in economics with honours from Colby College in Waterville, Maine. He was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity at Colby. He was awarded an MBA from the University of Connecticut Business School, graduating first in his class. Banking career =Early years and Morgan Stanley: 1976 to 1992= Diamond began his career as a lecturer at the School of Business, University of Connecticut from 1976 to 1977. Diamond then briefly worked for United States Surgical Corporation in Norwalk, Connecticut, in the IT department. He joined Morgan Stanley in 1979 and held several positions.

Based in Tokyo, he was chairman, president and chief executive officer of CS First Boston Pacific, responsible for investment banking, equity, fixed income and foreign exchange for the Pacific region. Diamond was formerly vice chairman and head of global fixed income and foreign exchange. =Barclays PLC: 1996 to 2012= Diamond joined Barclays on July 4, 1996, and in September 1997 became a member of the executive committee of the company, Britain's second largest banking group.\\"about-us/bob-diamond\\", defunct Barclay's web page http://group.barclays.com/about-barclays/about-us/bob-diamond. Diamond was appointed chief executive of corporate & investment banking and wealth management, comprising Barclays Capital, Barclays Corporate and Barclays Bank, and was an executive director of the boards of Barclays Plc and Barclays Bank Plc. Diamond became a leading candidate to succeed Matthew Barrett as group chief executive of Barclays Plc in 2004, but that post instead went to John Varley, who was five years younger than Diamond. In 2005, Diamond was appointed president of Barclays Plc and joined its board of directors, while also remaining chief executive of Barclays Capital. On 30 June 2006, The Wall Street Journal ran a front page, column one, article detailing how Barclays Capital was making a giant portion of its income not through legitimate investment banking activities but through a tax dodge, a so-called \\"double dip\\", which was essentially paid for by the British and American taxpayer.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115150753537093095 The revelation angered Parliament, the Bank of England, and UK and US tax authorities and the scam was outlawed. It also contributed to Lord Mandelson, UK Business Secretary, labelling Diamond \\"the unacceptable face of banking\\". Diamond headed Barclays' bid to purchase Lehman Brothers in September 2008, but that was stymied by the Bank of England. Diamond then sealed an agreement with Lehman Brothers President and COO Bart McDade to purchase key assets of that firm after it filed for bankruptcy, which instantly gave Barclays an investment banking foothold on Wall Street. Diamond became deputy group chief executive on October 1, 2010, and then succeeded John Varley as Group Chief Executive on January 1, 2011.\\"Date of CEO succession brought forward\\" , Barclay's press release, December 17, 2010. On July 2, 2012, Barclays' chairman, Marcus Agius, resigned following the heavy fine that Barclays suffered as a result of some of their company employees being involved in manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate, which became known as the LIBOR scandal. Just 24 hours later, on July 3, Diamond resigned his post with immediate effect.\\"Board changes\\" , Barclay's press release, July 3, 2012. Diamond's longtime protege, Jerry del Missier, who had been appointed chief operating officer of Barclays on June 22, 2012, resigned on July 2, 2012.  \\"Double Dip\\" tax scams  The \\"Double Dip\\" tax scams were fairly simple - in a typical case, Barclays and an American bank would loan, say, an airline for the purchase of a jumbo jet. A subsidiary without any employees would be set up owned by Barclays and the American bank to handle the transaction, and the subsidiary would pay income tax on the interest income. The scam would come into effect when both Barclays and the American bank would claim the same full tax credit amount with their respective UK and American tax authorities, i.e. essentially Barclays' income from the scam was being paid for by British and American taxpayers without the respective governments and tax authorities knowing what was going on. Barclays was making over ¬£1 billion a year from the practice. This all came to a grinding halt when The Wall Street Journal published an expos√© of the dodge in a front page, column one, article on 30 June 2006 by Carrick Mollenkamp, which ensured that Parliament, the Bank of England, and the UK Inland Revenue and the American Internal Revenue Service would see it and become aware of the scam, and the practice was subsequently outlawed, thus eliminating a major source of income for Barclays. It also resulted in Diamond's reputation being tarnished with Parliament and The Bank of England and the beginning of his being branded \\"the unacceptable face of banking\\".  Libor scandal investigation  In June 2012, Barclays was fined ¬£59.5 million by the FSA (¬£290 million in total) for \\"serious, widespread breaches of City rules relating to the Libor and Euribor rates\\". The bank had been found to have lied, sometimes to make a profit, and other times to make the bank look more secure during the financial crisis. The UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA), which levied a fine of ¬£59.5 million (US$92.7 million), gave Barclays the biggest fine it had ever imposed in its history. The FSA's director of enforcement described such behaviour as \\"completely unacceptable\\", adding \\"Libor is an incredibly important benchmark reference rate, and it is relied on for many, many hundreds of thousands of contracts all over the world.\\" Liberal Democrat politician Lord Oakeshott criticised Diamond, saying: \\"If he had any shame he would go. If the Barclays board has any backbone, they'll sack him.\\" The U.S. Department of Justice had also been involved in the investigation. Diamond announced on June 29, 2012, that he would not resign over the bank's role in the fraud. Diamond voluntarily gave up his bonus for 2012 but initially maintained that he would remain as chief executive. However, following widespread anger at his refusal to step down and amidst concerns that his presence could be harmful to the Barclays brand, he resigned as chief executive on July 3, 2012. According to an article in The New York Times published July 16, 2012, a former senior Barclays executive claimed he had received instructions from Robert Diamond to lower Libor rates after Diamond's discussions with Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, in which they had discussed the bank's financial position at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Diamond, who reported that he was \\"sickened\\" by news of the Libor scandal, was surprised to see calls for his departure since Barclays had taken the advice of its lawyers to cooperate in the investigation and be first bank to settle the charges. Diamond's resignation under pressure was controversial. The New York Times noted that Diamond's role in the scandal was minimal and suggested that the real reason for his sacking was that he had become the \\"unacceptable face of banking\\". The Financial Times reported that \\"After the financial crisis, the British establishment became very divided over what's the model for the big banks that we want to see. Bob represented investment banking big time. He represented the success of it ‚Äî but also the sense that investment banking is dicey and not a completely sound business. He represented a way of doing business that we've become very uncomfortable with.\\" In March 2013, Diamond was set to be paid about ¬£2m ($3m) in July, a year after he left the bank following its Libor interest rate fixing scandal. =Atlas Mara Limited: 2013 to date= On November 28, 2013, Diamond and Rwandan-based entrepreneur Ashish Thakkar founded Atlas Mara, a company whose geographical area of focus is banking in the African continent.Atlas Mara Co-Nvest Limited 2013 Prospectus Page 51 to 53 The company was listed on the Alternative Investment Market in the UK on December 17, 2013 through an IPO which raised US$325 million.

It then encodes the ramification data for prime ideals of the ring of integers. It was introduced by Richard Dedekind in 1882., p. 102 Definition If OK is the ring of integers of K, and tr denotes the field trace from K to the rational number field Q, then : x \\\\mapsto \\\\mathrm{tr}~x^2 is an integral quadratic form on OK. Its discriminant as quadratic form need not be +1 (in fact this happens only for the case K = Q). Define the inverse different or codifferent or Dedekind's complementary module as the set I of x ‚àà K such that tr(xy) is an integer for all y in OK, then I is a fractional ideal of K containing OK. By definition, the different ideal Œ¥K is the inverse fractional ideal I‚àí1: it is an ideal of OK. The ideal norm of Œ¥K is equal to the ideal of Z generated by the field discriminant DK of K. The different of an element Œ± of K with minimal polynomial f is defined to be Œ¥(Œ±) = f‚Ä≤(Œ±) if Œ± generates the field K (and zero otherwise): we may write :\\\\delta(\\\\alpha) = \\\\prod \\\\left({\\\\alpha - \\\\alpha^{(i)}}\\\\right) \\\\ where the Œ±(i) run over all the roots of the characteristic polynomial of Œ± other than Œ± itself. The different ideal is generated by the differents of all integers Œ± in OK. This is Dedekind's original definition. The different is also defined for a finite degree extension of local fields. It plays a basic role in Pontryagin duality for p-adic fields. Relative different The relative different Œ¥L / K is defined in a similar manner for an extension of number fields L / K. The relative norm of the relative different is then equal to the relative discriminant ŒîL / K. In a tower of fields L / K / F the relative differents are related by Œ¥L / F = Œ¥L / KŒ¥K / F. The relative different equals the annihilator of the relative K√§hler differential module \\\\Omega^1_{O_L/O_K}: \\\\delta_{L/K} = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in O_L : x \\\\mathrm{d} y = 0 \\\\text{ for all } y \\\\in O_L \\\\\\\\} . The ideal class of the relative different Œ¥L / K is always a square in the class group of OL, the ring of integers of L. Since the relative discriminant is the norm of the relative different it is the square of a class in the class group of OK: indeed, it is the square of the Steinitz class for OL as a OK-module. Ramification The relative different encodes the ramification data of the field extension L / K. A prime ideal p of K ramifies in L if the factorisation of p in L contains a prime of L to a power higher than 1: this occurs if and only if p divides the relative discriminant ŒîL / K. More precisely, if :p = P1e(1) ... Pke(k) is the factorisation of p into prime ideals of L then Pi divides the relative different Œ¥L / K if and only if Pi is ramified, that is, if and only if the ramification index e(i) is greater than 1. The precise exponent to which a ramified prime P divides Œ¥ is termed the differential exponent of P and is equal to e ‚àí 1 if P is tamely ramified: that is, when P does not divide e. In the case when P is wildly ramified the differential exponent lies in the range e to e + eŒΩP(e) ‚àí 1., p. 114 The differential exponent can be computed from the orders of the higher ramification groups for Galois extensions:, p. 115 ::\\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty (G_i-1). Local computation The different may be defined for an extension of local fields L / K. In this case we may take the extension to be simple, generated by a primitive element Œ± which also generates a power integral basis. If f is the minimal polynomial for Œ± then the different is generated by f'(Œ±). Notes References * * .

Turun normaalikoulu (or Norssi for short) is a school in Varissuo, an eastern suburb of Turku, Finland. It provides education from primary school (age 7) to upper secondary school (age 19). The school is authorized by the International Baccalaureate to teach in both the Middle Years Programme and the Diploma Programme. Founded in 1892, the school is one of the oldest and most prestigious in Turku. The school holds a unique position as the only school in Turku not managed by the city's educational authorities, being federally funded and controlled by the University of Turku, who use it as one of their teacher training schools. It is the largest such establishment in Finland. There are usually approximately 1,300 people working at the school, of which 900 are students, 300 teacher trainees, and the rest teachers and other staff. During Autumn 2015, the school started renovation, which lasted until Winter 2017.  History  The school was founded in 1892, under the name K√§kisalmen reaali- ja porvariskoulu. It was located in the town of K√§kisalmi on the Karelian Isthmus (now Priozersk, Russia). It was later renamed to K√§kisalmen yhteiskoulu, and as the Winter War between Finland and Russia broke out in 1939, the school moved to Turku in South-Western Finland. In 1957, the school was moved to the administrative hierarchy of the University of Turku and made into its teacher training school. It was transferred into a newly constructed building on Mestarinkatu, and retitled Turun normaalilyseo. However, only upper secondary school (ages 16‚Äì19) classes were taught until 1980, when the school was relocated to Varissuo and received its current name. The Varissuo building is designed by architect Bj√∂rn Krogius and completed in 1980.Laaksonen, Mikko& Nummelin, Juri: Turun seudun arkkitehtuuriopas, 2013. Page 243. .

The dish is similar to chicken √† la Proven√ßale, but with the addition of egg and crayfish, which are traditional to Chicken Marengo but are now often omitted. The original dish was named to celebrate the Battle of Marengo, a Napoleonic victory of June 1800. History According to a popular myth, the dish was first made after Napoleon defeated the Austrian army at the Battle of Marengo at Marengo south of Alessandria, Italy, when his chef Dunand foraged in the town for ingredients (because the supply wagons were too distant) and created the dish from what he could gather.Steven Gilbar, Chicken a la King and the Buffalo Wing: Food Names and the People and Places That Inspired Them (2008), p. 29-30. According to this legend, Napoleon enjoyed the dish so much he had it served to him after every battle, and when Dunand was later better-supplied and substituted mushrooms for crayfish and added wine to the recipe, Napoleon refused to accept it, believing that a change would bring him bad luck. This colorful story, however, is probably myth; Alan Davidson writes that there would have been no access to tomatoes at that time, and the first published recipe for the dish omits them. The more plausible explanation for the origin of the dish is that it was created by a restaurant chef to honor Napoleon's victory. Recipe Pellegrino Artusi's recipe in his Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well is as follows (it lacks tomatoes, crayfish and eggs): :Take a young chicken, remove the neck and legs, and cut into large pieces at the joints. Saut√© in 30 grams (about 1 ounce) of butter and one tablespoon of olive oil, seasoning with salt, pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. When the pieces have browned on both sides, skim the fat and add a level tablespoon of flour and a deciliter (about 7 fluid ounces) of wine. Add broth and cover, cooking over low heat until done. Before removing from the fire, garnish with a pinch of chopped parsley; arrange on a serving dish and squeeze half a lemon over it. The result is an appetizing dish.Pellegrino Artusi, Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well (University of Toronto Press trans.). p. 209 See also * List of chicken dishes * List of French dishes Notes Category:Italian chicken dishes Category:French chicken dishes ","title":"Chicken Marengo"},{"id":"2371814","text":"Seaforth is a district in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England.

Another theory for the name of the area is that it was taken from Seaforth House, named after Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth, who built the mansion in 1813 for his daughter and her husband, Sir John Gladstone, father of William Ewart Gladstone, four times Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

From 1918 to 1950 Seaforth was within the Parliamentary constituency known as Waterloo, a safe seat for the Conservative Party, and then until 2010 within the Crosby constituency, whose MP from 1997 to 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, of the Labour Party. Prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered a Conservative Party stronghold, like its predecessor seat, with Tory MPs elected at every election, except for the 1981 Crosby by-election, when Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election, the Crosby constituency was abolished and Seaforth was included in the expanded Bootle constituency, represented by the Labour MP Joe Benton. For elections to Sefton Council, Seaforth is within the Church electoral ward and is represented by three councillors, all members of the Labour Party. Geography Montgomery House, Alexander House and Churchill House. In April 2016 Churchill House and Montgomery House were demolished. The implosion on Montgomery House failed causing the area to be evacuated. Seaforth is between Waterloo in the north, Litherland to the east, Bootle to the south, and the River Mersey and the Port of Liverpool to the west. It is mainly an area of Victorian terraced housing. Transport Seaforth is served by Seaforth and Litherland railway station on the Liverpool to Southport branch of Merseyrail's Northern Line. Principal roads include the A565 and the A5036. .

The supporting cast features Tom Berenger, Charles S. Dutton, Polly Walker, Robert Patrick, Stephen Lang, Jeffrey Wright, Courtney B. Vance and Kris Kristofferson. The film had a limited release in the United States on September 20, 2002, under the title Eye See You by DEJ Productions. The film is based on the 1999 novel Jitter Joint written by Howard Swindle. Plot While FBI agent Jake Malloy pursues a serial killer who targets police officers, his former partner becomes a victim. At his partner's home, the murderer calls Malloy from Malloy's home. The killer says Malloy pursued him earlier for a series of prostitute murders; in revenge, he kills Mary, Malloy's girlfriend. Malloy pursues the killer, only to find that he appears to have committed suicide. Three months later, Malloy descends into alcoholism. After a suicide attempt, Malloy's best friend and supervising officer, Agent Chuck Hendricks, enrolls Malloy in a rehabilitation program for law enforcement officers run by Dr. John \\"Doc\\" Mitchell, a former cop and recovering alcoholic. Hendricks stays in Wyoming to ensure Malloy will be okay. Malloy meets several other officers who are patients in the clinic, including Peter Noah, an arrogant and paranoid ex-SWAT officer; Frank Slater, a cynical, opinionated British police officer; Willie Jones, a religious homicide detective; Jaworski, an alcoholic narcotics cop who attempted suicide; Lopez, a foul-mouthed LAPD officer; and McKenzie, an elderly member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who witnessed his partner's murder. He meets several staff members, including Doc's assistant and mechanic Hank and compassionate resident psychiatrist and nurse Jenny Munroe, with whom Malloy develops a bond. A blizzard seals everyone in the rehab center without outside communication. Jenny finds the body of Connor, a troubled patient who apparently killed himself, but Jenny believes Connor would have sought help. The next morning Hank finds another apparent suicide, but Malloy believes otherwise. Doc locks up the surviving patients while he reviews their files. Jenny informs Doc that Jack Bennett, an orderly who was a former patient, is missing. After an axe-wielding man kills Doc, everyone but Malloy and Jenny suspect Jack. Malloy returns the cops' sidearms. Hendricks finds a dead cop in a frozen lake and returns to the clinic with the owner of a nearby fishing shop. Hank, the clinic's cook Manny, and helper Gilbert, volunteer to drive through the blizzard to get help. While driving away, Hank veers away from something. The truck slides off the icy road and crashes. Malloy and Jenny hear the crash, and Malloy hands a gun to Jenny before investigating. Malloy finds Manny murdered and also found Jack's body, which caused the crash. Gilbert, alive but scared, flees while Malloy rushes back to the clinic. The killer electrocutes McKenzie, deactivating the building's power and heating system. Malloy forces everyone except Jenny to their cells, realizing a murderer is impersonating a cop. Suspecting this is Mary's killer, Malloy finds evidence on Connor's body to support this. As Malloy and Jenny return to the cells, Hank, suspecting Malloy, knocks him out. He locks Malloy in Slater's cell and releases everyone else. Malloy finds a matchbook in Slater's cell from a Seattle restaurant frequented by cops, identifying him as the killer. Malloy realizes Slater has been observing him and other policemen at the restaurant. Malloy escapes and finds the missing badges above Slater's room, which he collects as trophies. After establishing his innocence, Malloy has Jones and Lopez conduct patrol while Jaworski stays with Jenny. Malloy heads into the tunnels beneath the facility. Unaware that Slater is the killer, Hank and Noah help him retrieve logs in the tunnels for heating. Slater convinces them to split up before killing each. As Malloy patrols the tunnels, Slater taunts him over a CB radio and lures Malloy to Noah's hanged body, where he finds the other radio. While leaving the clinic, Slater hears Jenny call Malloy. Malloy learns Slater is at the tunnel's trapdoor and rushes to save Jenny. Outside the installation, Hendricks and the fishing shop owner find Gilbert alive and take him to the rehab center. Hendricks follows Jenny's footprints. Jenny runs to a nearby quonset hut, hiding from Slater. Malloy arrives, telling Jenny to stay inside the shed. Slater catches Hendricks before Malloy catches him from behind. Slater jumps into the shed, knocks Jenny out, and wounds Hendricks. After a fight, Malloy finally kills Slater. Jenny regains consciousness and helps Hendricks walk to the clinic with Malloy. Malloy puts his engagement ring on a tree branch and walks away.

The film was then shelved for quite some time while re-shoots and story changes were being done. Composer John Powell wrote two complete scores for the film, one of which was rejected. With the film delayed and relegated to a European release by Universal due to the studio's dissatisfaction with the film in general, most of Powell's score was replaced with additional music by William Ross, Geoff Zanelli, and Nick Glennie-Smith as an attempt to make the film salvageable. A new ending was also filmed in which the main villain is killed in a different way. Even after re-shoots and title changes, Universal did not care for the film and after test screenings for the new version also got negative response from audiences, they shelved it. DEJ Productions acquired domestic distribution rights from Universal and released it over three years after it was originally finished but in a limited release. In an interview with Ain't It Cool News in December 2006, Sylvester Stallone was asked why the film did not get a wide release and then answered: > It‚Äôs very simple why D-Tox landed in limbo. A film is a very delicate > creature. Any adverse publicity or internal shake-up can upset the > perception of ‚Äì and studio confidence in ‚Äì a feature. For some unknown > reason the original producer pulled out and right away the film was > considered damaged goods; by the time we ended filming there was trouble > brewing on the set because of overages and creative concerns between the > director and the studio. The studio let it sit on the shelf for many months > and after over a year it was decided to do a re-shoot. We screened it, it > tested okay, Ron Howard was involved with overseeing some of the post- > production‚Ä¶ but the movie had the smell of death about it. Actually, if you > looked up, you could see celluloid buzzards circling as we lay there dying > on the distributor's floor. One amusing note: It was funny, when we were met > at the airport by the teamsters they'd have a sign in front of them saying > DETOX, and all these actors like Kris Kristofferson, Tom Berenger and myself > looked like we were going into rehab rather than a film shoot. Release =Home media= The DVD release of the film includes eight deleted scenes as bonus feature, but the original ending is not included. Theatrical trailers show several deleted and alternate scenes, including some that are not included in DVD, like more nudity by Dina Meyer during her shower scene. Reception =Critical response= The film has an approval rating of 18% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews. Danny Graydon of BBC Films said: \\"Clearly, Hollywood's confidence in this film is lower than Pee-Wee Herman's Oscar chances, and their instincts are right: a boring, formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash, this will not reinvigorate Sylvester Stallone's action hero status or loosen his maniacal destruction of the quality control button\\".

He is best known for his work with David Bowie from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, having played on more Bowie albums than any musician other than pianist Mike Garson. He has also performed with Duran Duran side project Arcadia, on the album So Red the Rose. History The son of a Pentecostal minister, Alomar was raised in New York. From the age of ten he taught himself to play the guitar, and started playing professionally at age sixteen. In the 1960s he performed during \\"Amateur Hour\\" at the Apollo Theater, eventually joining the house band, backing Chuck Berry and many leading soul artists. Around 1968‚Äì69 he toured for eight months in James Brown's live band, eventually quitting after being docked wages for missing a musical cue. In 1969 Alomar formed a group called Listen My Brother with vocalists Luther Vandross, Fonzi Thornton (later to work with Chic and Roxy Music), and Robin Clark. Alomar and Clark later wed and had a daughter named Lea.Carlos Alomar. 2011. Retrieved 13 October 2011. Alomar subsequently played as a session musician for RCA Recording Studios, and others including Ben E. King (\\"Supernatural Thing\\", 1975) and Joe Simon (\\"Drowning in the Sea of Love\\"). He also met drummer Dennis Davis while they were both playing with jazz artist Roy Ayers. Alomar then toured with the band The Main Ingredient. Collaboration with David Bowie Alomar met David Bowie in early 1974, during sessions for Lulu's recording of the Bowie-penned song \\"Can You Hear Me?\\". Bowie was keen for Alomar to join his band for the Diamond Dogs tour, but negotiations with Bowie's management stalled and Alomar stayed with The Main Ingredient. During a six-week break from his tour in mid-1974, Bowie recorded a series of songs for a new album in Sigma Sound Studios with Alomar, who brought in Vandross, Clark, Davis, and bassist Emir Kassan to contribute to the recordings as well. Most of the material for the Young Americans album was recorded during these sessions, and Alomar joined Bowie for the second leg of the Diamond Dogs tour (dubbed \\"The Philly Dogs Tour\\") in September‚ÄìDecember 1974. In January 1975, Bowie and John Lennon recorded \\"Across the Universe\\" at Electric Lady Studios and from this session resulted the impromptu song \\"Fame\\", which evolved from the guitar riff Alomar had originated for the song \\"Foot Stompin'\\" during the Philly Dogs shows. With writing credit divided between Bowie, Alomar and Lennon (and funky guitar riffs later copied for James Brown's 1975 recording \\"Hot (I Need to be Loved)\\"), \\"Fame\\" gave Bowie his first US#1 single, and its parent album Young Americans (1975) marked Carlos Alomar's first appearance on a David Bowie album. This began a long period of collaboration in which Alomar led the rhythm section of Alomar/Dennis Davis/George Murray that would underpin Bowie's recordings for the next half-decade, behind a variety of lead guitarists, including Earl Slick, Stacey Heydon, Ricky Gardiner, Robert Fripp, and Adrian Belew.Carlos Alomar. Stevens Institute of Technology. College of Arts and Letters. Institute of Music & technology. 2011. Retrieved 13 October 2011. Alomar played on Bowie's next album, Station to Station (1976), designing the riffs that opened the songs \\"Golden Years\\" and \\"Stay\\", and touring with Bowie for the Station To Station tour of 1976. This was Alomar's first Bowie tour as musical director; around this time, Alomar, Bowie, and Iggy Pop wrote the song \\"Sister Midnight\\"; originally performed by Bowie during the 1976 tour, it was later recorded by Bowie and Iggy as the opening track on Iggy's album The Idiot (1977) before being re-written by Bowie as \\"Red Money\\" for his album Lodger (1979). Alomar played on Bowie's groundbreaking \\"Berlin Trilogy\\" of albums‚ÄîLow (1977), \\"Heroes\\" (1977) and Lodger; he also co-wrote the \\"Heroes\\" track \\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" and the Lodger track \\"DJ\\" with Bowie and Brian Eno. In the Lodger single \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\", Alomar swapped instruments with Dennis Davis and played drums. Alomar played guitar on Iggy Pop's two Bowie-produced albums of 1977, The Idiot and Lust For Life, and in 1978, he joined Bowie for the world tour which resulted in the live album Stage. On this tour, Alomar was again the musical director, swapping his guitar for a baton to conduct the band during the drum-free instrumental pieces from Low and \\"Heroes\\". Scary Monsters (1980) marked the last time Alomar would play alongside George Murray and Dennis Davis on a Bowie album; a planned Scary Monsters tour was aborted and Alomar instead joined Iggy Pop's band for a series of shows in October‚ÄìDecember 1981 (the show from San Francisco on 25 November has been released on VHS and DVD). Alomar did not play on Bowie's album Let's Dance (1983) ‚Äì the role of rhythm guitarist was undertaken by that album's co-producer, Nile Rodgers ‚Äì but he re-joined Bowie as rhythm guitarist and musical director for the mammoth Serious Moonlight world tour in 1983. In 1984, Alomar played on Bowie's album Tonight; he also co-wrote the album's closing track, \\"Dancing With the Big Boys\\", with Bowie and Iggy Pop. In 1987, Alomar played on Bowie's album Never Let Me Down; the album's title track ‚Äì released as a single and credited to Bowie/Alomar ‚Äì was originally an Alomar composition entitled \\"I'm Tired,\\" before it was re- written by Bowie. Alomar was the musical director/rhythm guitarist for Bowie's infamous and highly theatrical Glass Spider Tour in 1987 (beginning every show with a frenzied guitar solo), but Bowie ended his long-running creative association with Alomar after the critical panning of Never Let Me Down and the Glass Spider tour. The two men would not record together again until January‚ÄìFebruary 1995, during sessions in New York for Bowie's album Outside (1995). In the meantime, Alomar recorded and released his first solo album, Dream Generator, in 1988. Alomar toured with Bowie's band for the first leg of the Outside Tour (September 1995 ‚Äì February 1996). The tour was not a pleasant experience for Alomar, who found Bowie inaccessible and didn't get along with musical director Peter Schwartz, and he did not re-join Bowie when the tour resumed in June 1996. However, Alomar later played guitar on the Bowie tracks \\"Everyone Says 'Hi'\\" (from the album Heathen in 2002) and \\"Fly\\" (a bonus track on the limited edition version of the album Reality in 2003). Collaboration with artists apart from Bowie Alomar has performed with a number of other famous musicians including Paul McCartney, Simple Minds, Graham Parker, Mick Jagger, Iggy Pop, The Pretenders for their album Get Close in 1986, and Argentine rock band Soda Stereo. In all, Alomar has played on a total of 32 Gold and Platinum albums. He is currently the director of Boombacker Records. He was the bandleader on the short-lived TV chat show, The Caroline Rhea Show (2002‚Äì2003) and is also the president of the New York chapter of The Recording Academy, the organization responsible for the Grammy Awards. In 2005, Alomar joined the teaching staff of Stevens Institute of Technology (Hoboken, New Jersey) as an adjunct professor of Music & Technology, producing several tracks for the inaugural release of the school's Castle Point Records label's Delusions of Grandeur (2006). In 2010 Carlos Alomar was made their first \\"Distinguished Artist in Residence\\" and in 2011 he was awarded an honorary Bachelor of Arts. Alomar collaborated with Scissor Sisters for their second album Ta-Dah, and one track from these recording sessions, \\"Transistor\\", which ultimately featured on the second disc of the deluxe edition of the album, featured his wife Robin and daughter Lea on backing vocals. In October 2008, he performed with Richard Barone at Carnegie Hall, as a special guest in Barone's theatrical concert, \\"FRONTMAN: A Musical Reading\\". In 2010 Alomar performed as guitarist on Alicia Keys album The Element of Freedom.

It is the successor to the John Player Portrait Award. It is the most important portrait prize in the world, and is reputedly one of the most prestigious competitions in contemporary art. History British Petroleum took over sponsorship of the competition in 1989 from John Player & Sons, a tobacco company which had sponsored it from its inception in 1980, and has sponsored it since. The presence of both sponsors has triggered protests, with the group Art Not Oil (part of the international Rising Tide network) being responsible for most of those against BP. In 2016, The Museums Association conducted a formal investigation into BP's sponsorship when Art Not Oil alleged that the company influenced curatorial decisions and used its association with the National Gallery to further its political interests both domestic and international. The exhibition opens in June each year and runs until September. First prize is typically ¬£30,000. In the early years of the century, the prize went up from ¬£5,000, and its catchment area was gradually extended from residents of the UK and is now unrestricted. Until 2006, the competition has been open to under-40s only. Since 2007, it is open to anyone over the age of 18 and a separate BP Young Artist Award is granted to the best portrait artist between 18 and 30. In 1993, Tom Hallifax was used to advertise the awards. In 2012 the competition received 2,187 entries from 74 countries (including 1,500 from the UK) of which 55 paintings were selected to be exhibited.

At the time these ships were active, the mission of the ships was covert and discussion of the true mission was prohibited (\\"classified information\\"). The mission of the ships was publicly given as conducting research into atmospheric and communications phenomena. However, the true mission was more or less an open secret and the ships were commonly referred to as \\"spy ships\\".  Function  These ships carried a crew of U.S. Navy personnel whose specialty was intercepting wireless electronic communications and gathering intelligence from those communications (signals intelligence, communications intelligence, and electronic signals intelligence (SIGINT)). In the 1960s those personnel had a U.S. Navy rating of Communications Technician (later changed to Cryptologic Technician), or CT. In order to transmit intelligence information that had been gathered back to United States for further processing and analysis, these ships had a special system named Technical Research Ship Special Communications, or TRSSCOM (pronounced tress-com). This Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) communications system used a special gyroscope- stabilized parabolic antenna, which can be seen aft of the main superstructure in the accompanying photographs of Belmont and Liberty. Radio signals were transmitted toward the moon, where they would bounce back toward the Earth and be received by a large parabolic antenna at a Naval Communications Station in Cheltenham, Maryland (near Washington, D.C.) or Wahiawa, Hawaii. Communications could occur only when the moon was visible simultaneously at the ship's location and in Cheltenham or Wahiawa. The gyro stabilization of the antenna kept the antenna pointed at the moon while the ship rolled and pitched on the surface of the ocean. These ships were classified as naval auxiliaries with a hull designation of AGTR, which stands for Auxiliary, General, Technical Research. Five of these ships were built with hull numbers of 1-5\\\\. The first three ships of this type (Oxford, Georgetown, and Jamestown) were converted from World War II-era Liberty ships. The last two ships (Belmont and Liberty) were converted from Victory ships.

An image is considered to be good if the location of the performers can be clearly identified; the image is considered to be poor if the location of the performers is difficult to locate. A well-made stereo recording, properly reproduced, can provide good imaging within the front quadrant. More complex recording and reproduction systems such as surround sound and Ambisonics can offer good imaging all around the listener and even including height information. Imaging is usually thought of in the context of recording with two or more channels, though single-channel recording may convey depth information convincingly. The quality of the imaging arriving at the listener's ear depends on numerous factors, of which the most important is the original miking, that is, the choice and arrangement of the recording microphones including the size and shape of the microphone diaphragms, and microphone placement and orientation relative to other microphones. For many listeners, good imaging adds markedly to the pleasure of reproduced music. One may speculate that this is due to the evolutionary importance to humans of knowing where sounds are coming from, and that imaging may, therefore, be more important than some purely aesthetic considerations in satisfying the listener.

It may include for example holding hands, cuddling, hugging, kissing, giving massages, and sharing a bed, without sexual intercourse or other physical sexual expression. In historical scholarship, the term may be used to describe a very close relationship between people of the same sex during a period of history when homosexuality did not exist as a social category. In this regard, the term was coined in the later 20th century in order to retrospectively describe a type of relationship which until the mid-19th century had been considered unremarkable but since the second half of the 19th century had become rarer as physical intimacy between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety. Romantic friendship between women in Europe and North America became especially prevalent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, with the simultaneous emergence of female education and a new rhetoric of sexual difference. Shimer College founders Cindarella Gregory and Frances Shimer in 1869; their extremely close relationship has been characterized as a \\"passionate friendship\\". Historical examples The study of historical romantic friendship is difficult because the primary source material consists of writing about love relationships, which typically took the form of love letters, poems, or philosophical essays rather than objective studies. Most of these do not explicitly state the sexual or nonsexual nature of relationships; the fact that homosexuality was taboo in Western European cultures at the time means that some sexual relationships may be hidden, but at the same time the rareness of romantic friendship in modern times means that references to nonsexual relationships may be misinterpreted, as alleged by Faderman, Coontz, Anthony Rotundo, Douglas Bush, and others. =Shakespeare and Fair Youth= The content of Shakespeare's works has raised the question of whether he may have been bisexual. Although twenty-six of Shakespeare's sonnets are love poems addressed to a married woman (the \\"Dark Lady\\"), one hundred and twenty-six are addressed to an adolescent boy (known as the \\"Fair Youth\\"). The amorous tone of the latter group, which focuses on the boy's beauty, has been interpreted as evidence for Shakespeare's bisexuality, although others interpret them as referring to intense friendship or fatherly affection, not sexual love. Among those of the latter interpretation, in the preface to his 1961 Pelican edition, Douglas Bush writes: Bush cites Montaigne, who distinguished male friendships from \\"that other, licentious Greek love\\",Rollins 1:55; Bush cited Montaigne's 1580 work \\"On Friendship,\\" in which the exact quote was: \\"And this other Greeke licence is justly abhorred by our customes.\\" . as evidence of a platonic interpretation. =Montaigne and Etienne de La Bo√©tie= The French philosopher Montaigne described the concept of romantic friendship (without using this English term) in his essay \\"On Friendship.\\" In addition to distinguishing this type of love from homosexuality (\\"this other Greek licence\\"), another way in which Montaigne differed from the modern viewJohn Ruskin's 1865 essay \\"On Queen's Gardens\\" is a good example of the later view that emotionality was a female province; Kate Millet analyzes this essay in Sexual Politics (1969, 1970, 1990, 2000), University of Illinois Press, . Many modern books such as Carmen Renee Berry's Girlfriends: Invisible Ties (1998), Wildcat Canyon Press, , argue that intensity in friendship is a female capacity. was that he felt that friendship and platonic emotion were a primarily masculine capacity (apparently unaware of the custom of female romantic friendship which also existed): Lesbian-feminist historian Lillian Faderman cites Montaigne, using \\"On Friendship\\" as evidence that romantic friendship was distinct from homosexuality, since the former could be extolled by famous and respected writers, who simultaneously disparaged homosexuality. (The quotation also furthers Faderman's beliefs that gender and sexuality are socially constructed, since they indicate that each sex has been thought of as \\"better\\" at intense friendship in one or another period of history.) = Alexander Hamilton and John Laurens = Shortly after his marriage, while in George Washington's camp during the American Revolutionary Era, John Laurens met and became extremely close friends with Alexander Hamilton. They exchanged many letters during the several years when different assignments and Laurens' capture by the British kept them apart; for example, when the terms of Laurens' parole prevented him from being present at Hamilton's wedding to Elizabeth Schuyler in December 1780, even though Hamilton had invited him. While emotional language was not uncommon in romantic friendships among those of the same gender in this historical period, Hamilton biographer James Thomas Flexner stated that the intensely expressive language contained in the Hamilton-Laurens letters \\"raises questions concerning homosexuality\\" that \\"cannot be categorically answered\\". Stating that \\"one must tread gingerly in approaching this matter,\\" Hamilton biographer Ron Chernow wrote that it is impossible to say \\"with any certainty\\" that Laurens and Hamilton were lovers, noting that such an affair would have required the exercise of \\"extraordinary precautions\\" because sodomy was a capital offense throughout the colonies at the time. Chernow concluded that based on available evidence, \\"At the very least, we can say that Hamilton developed something like an adolescent crush on his friend.\\" According to Chernow, \\"Hamilton did not form friendships easily and never again revealed his interior life to another man as he had to Laurens\\", and after Laurens' death, \\"Hamilton shut off some compartment of his emotions and never reopened it.\\" In contrast to Hamilton's effusive letters, surviving letters from Laurens to Hamilton were notably less frequent and less passionately worded, although some letters written by Laurens have been lost or may have been destroyed. =Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed= Some historians have used the relationship between Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed as another example of a relationship that modern people see as ambiguous or possibly gay, but which was most likely to have been a romantic friendship. Lincoln and Speed lived together, shared a bed in their youth and maintained a lifelong friendship. David Herbert Donald pointed out that men at that time often shared beds for financial reasons; men were accustomed to same-sex non- sexual intimacy, since most parents could not afford separate beds or rooms for male siblings. Anthony Rotundo notes that the custom of romantic friendship for men in America in the early 19th century was different from that of Renaissance France, and it was expected that men would distance themselves emotionally and physically somewhat after marriage; he claims that letters between Lincoln and Speed show this distancing after Lincoln married Mary Todd. Such distancing is still practiced today. = Romantic friendships in women's colleges = As the American suffrage movement succeeded in gaining rights for white middle- and upper-class women, heterosexual marriage became less of a necessity, and many more women went to college and continued to live in female-centric communities after graduation. The all-women peer culture formed at women's colleges allowed students to create their own social rules and hierarchies, to become each other's leaders and heroes, and to idolize each other. These idolizations often took the forms of romantic friendships, which contemporaries called \\"smashes\\", \\"crushes\\" and \\"spoons.\\" The practice of \\"smashing\\" involved one student showering another with gifts: notes, chocolates, sometimes even locks of hair. When the object of the student's affections was wooed and the two of them began spending all their time together, the \\"aggressor\\" was perceived by her friends as \\"smashed\\". In the early twentieth century, \\"crush\\" gradually replaced the term \\"smash\\", and generally signified a younger girl's infatuation with an older peer. Historian Susan Van Dyne has documented an \\"intimate friendship\\" between Mary Mathers and Frona Brooks, two members of the Smith College class of 1883. Mathers and Brooks exchanged tokens of affection, relished time spent alone together, and celebrated an anniversary. Romantic friendships kindled in women's colleges sometimes continued after graduation, with women living together in \\"Boston marriages\\" or cooperative houses. Women who openly committed themselves to other women often found acceptance of their commitment and lifestyle in academic fields, and felt comfortable expressing their feelings for their same-sex companions. At the turn of the century, smashes and crushes were considered an essential part of the women's college experience, and students who wrote home spoke openly about their involvement in romantic friendships. By the 1920s, however, public opinion had turned against crushes. Biblical and religious evidence Proponents of the romantic friendship hypothesis also make reference to the Bible. Historians like Faderman and Robert Brain believe that the descriptions of relationships such as David and Jonathan or Ruth and Naomi in this religious text establish that the customs of romantic friendship existed and were thought of as virtuous in the ancient Near East, despite the simultaneous taboo on homosexuality. The relationship between King David and Jonathan, son of King Saul, is often cited as an example of male romantic friendship; for example, Faderman uses 2 Samuel 1:26 on the title page of her book: \\"Your love was wonderful to me, passing the love of women.\\"2 Samuel 1:26. Ruth and her mother-in-law Naomi are the female Biblical pair most often cited as a possible romantic friendship, as in the following verse commonly used in same-sex wedding ceremonies: Faderman writes that women in Renaissance and Victorian times made reference to both Ruth and Naomi and \\"Davidean\\" friendship as the basis for their romantic friendships. While some authors, notably John Boswell, have claimed that ecclesiastical practice in earlier ages blessed \\"same sex unions\\", the accurate interpretation of these relationships rests on a proper understanding of the mores and values of the participants, including both the parties receiving the rite in question and the clergy officiating at it. Boswell himself concedes that past relationships are ambiguous; when describing Greek and Roman attitudes, Boswell states that \\"[A] consensual physical aspect would have been utterly irrelevant to placing the relationship in a meaningful taxonomy.\\" Boswell's own interpretation has been thoroughly critiqued, notably by Brent D. Shaw, himself a homosexual, in a review written for The New Republic: Historian Robert Brain has also traced these ceremonies from Pagan \\"blood brotherhood\\" ceremonies through medieval Catholic ceremonies called \\"gossipry\\" or \\"siblings before God,\\" on to modern ceremonies in some Latin American countries referred to as \\"compadrazgo\\"; Brain considers the ceremonies to refer to romantic friendship. Reception in 1990s American gay and lesbian subculture Several small groups of advocates and researchers have advocated for the renewed use of the term, or the related term Boston marriage, today. Several lesbian, gay, and feminist authors (such as Lillian Faderman, Stephanie Coontz, Jaclyn Geller and Esther Rothblum) have done academic research on the topic; these authors typically favor the social constructionist view that sexual orientation is a modern, culturally constructed concept.See Faderman's introduction in the 1998 edition of Surpassing the Love of Men; Coontz's The Way We Never Were has as its thesis the social construction of a variety of family and relationship traditions, whereas Geller advocates for the abolition of marriage and a renewed focus on friendship for feminist reasons ().

Written by Nunnally Johnson, the film is loosely based on the life of Jesse James, the outlaw from whom the film derives its name. The supporting cast features Henry Hull, John Carradine, Brian Donlevy, Jane Darwell and Lon Chaney, Jr.. The American Humane Association began to oversee filmmaking after a horse died when it was driven off a cliff on set. It has been described by the British Channel 4 website as being \\"notorious for its historical inaccuracy.\\"  Plot  A railroad representative named Barshee (Brian Donlevy) forces farmers to give up the land the railroad is going to go through, giving them $1 per acre (much less than fair price) for it. When they come to Jesse's home, Barshee is told by Jesse (Tyrone Power) that his mother Mrs Samuels (Jane Darwell) is the farm's owner. Barshee repeatedly tries to force her into selling, until her other son Frank James (Henry Fonda) gets involved. Frank fights and easily beats Barshee, but Jesse shoots Barshee in the hand, in self-defence. When arrest warrants are issued for Frank and Jesse, Major A. Rufus Cobb (Henry Hull), an editor in nearby Liberty, Missouri and uncle of Zerelda (Zee) Cobb (Nancy Kelly), Jesse's lover, quickly comes to tell them to leave. Frank and Jesse learn that Barshee is responsible for the death of their mother and Jesse kills him in revenge. This begins Frank and Jesse's career as outlaws. They are pursued relentlessly by the unscrupulous railway boss, McCoy (Donald Meek). Three years later, with a $5,000 reward on his head, Jesse marries Zee and turns himself in, at her insistence, having been promised a light sentence by Marshall Will Wright (Randolph Scott). But McCoy manages to manipulate the situation through his connections, by having the judge dismissed pre-trial, and installing a new judge, who is likely to favour McCoy's recommendation of imposing the death penalty for Jesse. Frank breaks Jesse out of jail, and the James gang continue their life of crime. Eventually Zee leaves him, taking their son Jesse Jr. with her. Years later, following an unsuccessful robbery, a wounded Jesse returns home and Zee joins him in the belief that they will escape to California. Meanwhile, Bob Ford (John Carradine), an old member of the James gang, together with his brother Charlie Ford (Charles Tannen), contact Jesse, claiming that Frank sent them to ask Jesse to participate in their next robbery. They assert that the job will earn them all a large sum of money for very little risk. Jesse nevertheless refuses the Ford brothers' offer, and the brothers exit the house. However, sensing an opportunity to claim the generous reward for Jesse's death, Bob Ford sneaks back inside, and shoots Jesse in the back, thereby killing him.

The town's historic Old McDonald County Courthouse, a National Register of Historic Places site, was featured in the film serving as a stand in for the Liberty, Missouri courthouse. Pineville still celebrates Jesse James Days annually in homage to the film and the movie stars who descended on the small town to make it. In their off time from filming, the films' stars and crew, including Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda and Randolph Scott, would seek out relaxation at the Shadow Lake resort in Noel, Missouri, on the shores of Elk River (Oklahoma). Reception Jesse James was the third highest-grossing film of 1939, behind Gone with the Wind and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. A sequel, The Return of Frank James, directed by Fritz Lang with Henry Fonda reprising his role as Frank James along with other actors playing the same characters as they had in Jesse James, was released in 1940. The film was on continuous release in the United States for more than 15 years. The film was reissued in March 1946 and was released for a fourth time in July 1951. By May 1954, it had played over 52,000 bookings in the United States and Canada. A remake was directed by Nicholas Ray in 1957, The True Story of Jesse James. Animal cruelty The film gained a measure of notoriety for a scene in which a horse falls to its death down a rocky slope toward the end of the film. This scene was one of many cited by the American Humane Association against Hollywood's abuse of animals, and led to the association's monitoring of filmmaking. However, according to Leonard Mosley's biography Zanuck: The Rise and Fall of Hollywood's last Tycoon, none of \\"the horses [had] been injured. Under Zanuck's direction, a short distance down the cliff, on a conveniently broad platform, the unit roper had arranged a soft landing for the horses.\\" The most difficult riding stunts were performed for high fees by Cliff Lyons who doubled both costars.Hollywood Stuntmen blogspot, Cliff Lyons post, 8 Sept. 2013; Western Clippings, Action Actors by Neil Summers, Lyons page.

This econometric find was the result of Wassily W. Leontief's attempt to test the Heckscher‚ÄìOhlin theory (\\"H‚ÄìO theory\\") empirically. In 1953, Leontief found that the United States‚Äîthe most capital-abundant country in the world‚Äîexported commodities that were more labor-intensive than capital-intensive, contrary to H-O theory. Leontief inferred from this result that the U.S. should adapt its competitive policy to match its economic realities.  Measurements  * In 1971 Robert Baldwin showed that U.S. imports were 27% more capital-intensive than U.S. exports in the 1962 trade data, using a measure similar to Leontief's. * In 1980 Edward Leamer questioned Leontief's original methodology for comparing factor contents of an equal dollar value of imports and exports (i.e. on real exchange rate grounds). However, he acknowledged that the U.S. paradox still appears in Baldwin's data for 1962 when using a corrected method comparing factor contents of net exports and domestic consumption. * A 1999 survey of the econometric literature by Elhanan Helpman concluded that the paradox persists, but some studies in non-US trade were instead consistent with the H‚ÄìO theory. * In 2005 Kwok & Yu used an updated methodology to argue for a lower or zero paradox in U.S. trade statistics, though the paradox is still derived in other developed nations.  Responses to the paradox  For many economists, Leontief's paradox undermined the validity of the Heckscher‚ÄìOhlin theorem (H‚ÄìO) theory, which predicted that trade patterns would be based on countries' comparative advantage in certain factors of production (such as capital and labor). Many economists have dismissed the H-O theory in favor of a more Ricardian model where technological differences determine comparative advantage. These economists argue that the United States has an advantage in highly skilled labor more so than capital. This can be seen as viewing \\"capital\\" more broadly, to include human capital. Using this definition, the exports of the United States are very (human) capital- intensive, and not particularly intensive in (unskilled) labor. Some explanations for the paradox dismiss the importance of comparative advantage as a determinant of trade. For instance, the Linder hypothesis states that demand plays a more important role than comparative advantage as a determinant of trade‚Äîwith the hypothesis that countries which share similar demands will be more likely to trade. For instance, both the United States and Germany are developed countries with a significant demand for cars, so both have large automotive industries. Rather than one country dominating the industry with a comparative advantage, both countries trade different brands of cars between them. Similarly, New Trade Theory argues that comparative advantages can develop separately from factor endowment variation (e.g., in industrial increasing returns to scale).

Created by writer Kurt Busiek and artists Brent Anderson and Alex Ross, Jack- in-the-Box is a prominent superhero of Astro City. He is motivated by a powerful desire for justice based on his own family history, with a strong sense of responsibility to society based on his expertise, capabilities and the sheer enjoyment of being a superhero. A conflicting sense of responsibility to his own family, however, combine with reminders of his own mortality to make him question his superheroic mission. Origin and History Jack Johnson, an inventive genius, was one of the first African Americans to break the color barrier in the toy manufacturing industry in the early 1960s, winning a job with the Whamco corporation. Though he faced pay discrimination in comparison to his white colleagues, his true disillusionment came with the discovery that Whamco was exploiting his inventions for criminal purposes. His protests merely resulted in the termination of his employment in 1964, together with the kidnapping of his father to ensure his silence. Jack fought back by adapting his inventions into a personal arsenal and taking on the secret identity of the clown-costumed hero Jack-in-the-Box, in which guise he freed his father and other hostages and eventually exposed Whamco's criminal operations. By this time an established superhero, he continued his double life. Over the years, Johnson fought supervillains such as Steeljack, organized crime figures like the Underlord, and common criminals. Meanwhile, in civilian life, he established his own independent toy company, married and had a son, Zachary Johnson. For several years, he balanced his responsibilities to his family, career and heroic mission successfully, keeping his son and possibly even his wife ignorant of his secret identity. But his luck ran out in 1983, during a conflict with the villainous Underlord. He ended his career as he began it, rescuing innocents held hostage by criminals, knowingly entering a trap set by his enemy to do so. Caught in an explosion, his fate was a mystery, with the authorities and media speculating both that he might have been killed and that he might have escaped. As time passed and Jack-in-the-Box did not reappear, hope for his survival dimmed, though it was thought that he had at least taken his enemy down with him. In fact, Johnson had indeed perished, while his foe survived, retiring his villainous identity but continuing his nefarious activities in secret. In the Johnson home, Jack's wife held a funeral for her missing husband, and their son Zachary was traumatized by his father's mysterious disappearance. Only years later, after his mother died of cancer and he was settling the estate, did Zachary discover his father's paraphernalia and journals and discover that Jack Johnson had been the missing superhero Jack-in-the-Box. His father's journals also revealed the Underlord's civilian identity, from which Zachary learned that the villain was still alive. Determined to bring his father's killer to justice, Zachary adopted the Jack-in-the-Box identity and set about taking him down. Thus, in 1989, the harlequin crime-fighter returned. Despite speculation, the public at large remained in ignorance as to whether this was the original Jack-in-the-Box returned or a new one. Zachary purposely maintained the pretense that he was indeed the first Jack-in-the-Box come again. Zachary did indeed take down the Underlord, proving his ability to fill Jack Johnson's shoes. He continued to do so both as a superhero and a toy company owner, and later married television news personality Tamara Dixon. Mindful of the turmoil and stress his father's secret and disappearance had put him through, he was careful to make her his complete confidant. After many years as Jack-in-the-Box, Zachary was led to reassess his priorities and heroic career by his wife's pregnancy, coupled with visitations from the Box, the Jackson and Jerome Johnson, three alternate future versions of the child she might bear. Zachary's visitors indicated that he was soon to be killed in action, leaving his infant son to grow up fatherless as he had, but with far more tragic results. In two of the possible futures they represent, the boy becomes an insane super-vigilante; in the third, the \\"best\\" alternative, a lonely, emotionally crippled college professor. Zachary, unwilling to subject his family to a fate similar to what he had endured, ultimately decided to give up his role as Jack-in-the-Box. Equally unwilling to leave society defenseless against the threats from which he protected it, he simultaneously groomed Roscoe James, founder of the Trouble Boys, as his prot√©g√© to take over from him and become the third Jack-in-the-Box. Overview In all his incarnations, Jack-in-the-Box has been a loner hero, commonly working solo and declining membership in such high-profile superhero teams as Honor Guard. He has, however, worked with other heroes in the course of various cases, natural disasters, and other crises. On one such occasion, he worked with the Astro City Irregulars to prevent a future ecological catastrophe referred to as the Wasting. Other sometime allies include the Trouble Boys, a street gang devoted to emulating and tormenting Jack-in-the-Box. Jack-in-the-Box has gone up against a colorful assortment of antagonists. His most persistent foes have characteristics and noms de guerre complementing his own. Notable antagonists include the Junkman, an inventive genius like himself, forced out of the workforce by age discrimination who turned his fertile mind to crime to seek vengeance on society; the Human Weasel, a wiry athletic thief who does indeed appear to have weasel-like characteristics, including fur and teeth; and the Brass Monkey, a metallic simian statue possessed and animated by the mind of a deceased janitor, who uses his new body to steal. Skills and abilities Jack-in-the-Box is an extraordinarily accomplished athlete and acrobat, capable of midair maneuvers to combat flying opponents, and even to dodge aerial explosions. He displays a deductive mind and a talent for invention, able to maintain and augment the arsenal of gimmicks and devices inherited from his father and to utilize them expertly in furtherance of his crimefighting career. He is also fond of wisecracks and wordplay. The new Jack, Roscoe, lacks the brilliance and experience of his predecessors, but is a promising athlete with street smarts. Weaponry Jack-in-the-Box's basic arsenal consists of his \\"footapaults\\", \\"handsprings\\", entangling streamers and \\"electro-noses\\". His footapaults are telescoping boots capable of catapulting him into the air and leaping him rapidly through and over a variety of terrains and urban environments. (Sometimes, covers will show them also acting as stilts, while the actual stories only portray them as being used to make leaps.) Similarly, his handsprings are telescoping gloves which extend his reach and grip (and punch). He can also project from them a multicolored plastic solution which solidifies on contact with the air into streamers, and can be used to impede and ensnare his foes. His \\"electro-noses\\" are rubber clown noses which, when deftly applied to an opponent's face, delivers a jolt from a built-in electroshock weapon, knocking the recipient unconscious. Jack also carries a purse-like satchel which may carry other devices or equipment as necessary, such as a freezing device he once jerry-rigged from some air compressors and cans of refrigerant. While the first Jack-in-the-Box stories always showed both Jacks with this satchel, current Astro City stories show the original Jack without it, suggesting a retcon which makes the satchel an add-on by Zachary.

As a super-villain, he was a member of the Terrifying Three. After serving his time, he was tapped by former associates as a private investigator to solve a string of murders in the super-villain community. Other versions During the \\"Dark Age\\" arc of Astro City, it was revealed that one of the original Jack-in-the-Box's enemies had somehow acquired blood samples of him, and at one point attempted to grow a clone, hoping to create the perfect henchman. Instead, the result was Gloo, a green, amorphous blob with vesitigal heads/limbs. Possessing a twisted sentience and memories of being a hero, Gloo was feared by criminals as an unstoppable killing machine, attacking anyone it could discern as an armed and dangerous threat. Gloo would often use powers and tactics which morbidly copied old comedy tropes, such as exhaling acid onto his victims much like a slapstick comedian would spray people with a seltzer bottle, or crush gangs together to fit them into a compact car, forming a gruesome clown car. Gloo was operating up until 1984 at least, but when, how, or even if Gloo was destroyed, or if Zachary Johnson ever encountered it, has not yet been shown in the series.

Biography He was born in Nuremberg. His father was a musician and the boy studied various instruments, but finally devoted himself to the violin. In 1815, he received some lessons from Louis Spohr, and then studied the violin for two years at the University of Munich under Pietro Rovelli. Career In 1820, Molique succeeded Rovelli as court violinist in Munich and, after several successful tours, in 1826 he became music director at Stuttgart. His pupils there included the violinist Henry Blagrove and the violinist, conductor and composer Alfred Mellon. Molique was well received on a visit to London when he played his own Piano Concerto No 5 on 14 May 1840. He visited England several other times before settling in London from 1849 until 1866. He died in Cannstatt in 1869. Compositions As a composer, Molique was unapologetically self-taught. His music displays the influence of Beethoven, Mozart, Mendelssohn and, especially, Louis Spohr. The then radical developments represented by Berlioz (who publicly praised his violin playing) and the New German School () left Molique untouched, however. As well as the five piano concertos Molique wrote six violin concertos (the fifth especially admired by Joachim) and a popular Cello Concerto that was successfully played in Baden-Baden, by L√©on Jacquard, conducted by Hector Berlioz, on August 27, 1860. He also wrote a Symphony (1837‚Äì42), eight string quartets, the Piano Trio op.27 (championed by Hans von B√ºlow) and the Concertina Concerto as well an oratorio Abraham (performed in England, 1861), two masses and many songs.Grove Music Online =Selected Compositions= *Chamber music **String Quartets, Opp. 16 (in G) and 17 (the latter in C minor)Both in Bloomington Music Library, Indiana. **Three String Quartets, Op. 18Recorded on cpo in 2003-2004 & 2006 (published 1843) **First grand trio concertante for piano, violin and violoncello, Op. 27Library of the Univ Bibl Johann Christian Senckenberg **Sixth String Quartet, Op. 28 in F minorAlso in Bloomington Music Library **Quintet for flute, violin, violas, violoncello, Op. 35, D major **Seventh String Quartet in B-flat major Op. 42 (published 1854) **Eighth String Quartet, Op. 44 in A minor (published by Kistner of Leipzig by 1853)At Bloomington Music Library, Indiana **Second Piano Trio, Op. 52 in F major (published 1858)Juilliard School Library. **Sonata for Concertina and Piano, Op. 57 (1857) **Piano Quartet, Op. 71 in E-flat major (published 1870) *Concertante works **Concertino in F minor for violin, Op. 1 **Violin Concerto no. 1 in E major Op. 4 (published 1830) **Violin Concerto no. 2 in A major, Op. 9 (published 1833)Newberry Library Catalog Listing **Violin Concerto no. 3 in D minor, Op. 10 **Violin Concerto no. 4 in D major Op. 14 (published 1839)At Yale University Library. **Violin Concerto no. 5 in A minor, Op. 21 (published 1845)Los Angeles Public Library. **Violin Concerto no. 6 in E minor Op. 30 (c. 1847?) **Cello Concerto in D, Op. 45 (published 1854) **Concertino for Oboe and Orchestra in G minor **Flute Concerto in D minor, Op. 69 **Clarinet Concerto in F minor, 1824 *Oratorio **Abraham, op. 65. *Liturgical **Mass in F minor, op. 22.(published 1846.)Dates from searches at Hofmeisters Monatsbericht online (http://www.hofmeister.rhul.ac.uk ).Library of Congress listing.

Early years Born in St. Louis in 1967, Cooper attended Pattonville High School in nearby Maryland Heights, Missouri, where he was a standout at baseball, and played on their 1986 state championship team. He was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the third round of the 1986 MLB draft. Career Cooper rose through the Red Sox minor league system, playing for the Elmira Pioneers (1986), Greensboro Hornets (1987), Lynchburg Red Sox (1988), New Britain Red Sox (1989), and Pawtucket Red Sox (1990‚Äì1991). =Boston Red Sox= Cooper made his major league debut with the Red Sox on September 5, 1990, as the Red Sox hosted the Oakland Athletics at Fenway Park. Appearing for Carlos Quintana as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning of a 10‚Äì0 A's win, Cooper struck out looking, which was his only MLB at bat that season. Appearing in 14 games with Boston in , Cooper hit .457 (16-for-35) with seven RBI. His first MLB hit came September 12, 1991, as a pinch hitter for Jody Reed, singling off New York Yankees pitcher Rich Monteleone in the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium. He picked up the first of his 33 career home runs on September 4, 1992, hitting a solo shot off A's star Dave Stewart in Oakland. With future Hall of Fame third baseman Wade Boggs playing for the Red Sox, Cooper struggled to find time on the active roster and in ballgames. In 1992, Cooper played 62 games at first base; in 123 total games that season, he hit .276 with five home runs and 33 RBI over 337 at bats. When Boggs signed with the Yankees as a free agent in the offseason, Cooper became the starting third baseman and was selected to two All-Star teams. Cooper's Red Sox career ‚Äî the most productive seasons of his career ‚Äî ended when he and reliever Cory Bailey were traded to the St. Louis Cardinals on April 9, 1995, for pitcher Rheal Cormier and outfielder Mark Whiten. Hitting for the cycle On April 12, 1994, Cooper hit for the cycle in a 22‚Äì11 victory over the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium. Batting seventh and playing third base, Cooper hit a two-run double off Kevin Appier in the first inning, homered in the third inning, tripled off Hip√≥lito Pichardo in the fifth inning (Cooper was called out at the plate trying to stretch it into an inside-the-park home run), reached on an error in sixth inning, hit another two-run double in the seventh inning off Jeff Montgomery, and singled in the ninth inning off infielder-turned-pitcher David Howard. Cooper hit the 18th cycle in Red Sox history, and was the first player to do so since Mike Greenwell in . All-Star games In and , Cooper was the lone Red Sox player named to the American League All-Star teams. In 1993, Cooper entered the game as a replacement for former teammate Wade Boggs at third base in the sixth inning of the All-Star game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore. Cooper went 0-for-2, hitting a flyout to left field off Steve Avery in the sixth inning and striking out against Rod Beck in the seventh inning. In 1994, Cooper again came into the game for Boggs in the sixth inning of the Midsummer Classic, which was played at Three Rivers Stadium that year. Cooper went 1-for-2 with a run scored and a RBI in the exhibition game. In the seventh inning, Cooper hit a RBI double off Danny Jackson in the seventh inning and grounded out to second base off reliever Randy Myers in the ninth inning. Cooper went 1-for-4 with a double, a run scored and a RBI in his two All-Star game appearances. =St. Louis Cardinals= Cooper's Cardinals career got off to a good start when he made his debut with St. Louis on April 26, 1995, in a 7‚Äì6 Cards win over the Philadelphia Phillies at Busch Stadium. Hitting in the cleanup spot, Cooper went 3-for-5 in his Cardinals debut and hit a two-run walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth to secure the St. Louis victory. He finished the day with one run scored and four RBI. He continued to hit well early in the season, having a .302 average on May 25 only to finish the year with a .230 average, three homers, 40 RBI and 29 runs over 118 games. While he struggled in 1995, Cooper was paid a career-high $1,525,000 for the season. Cooper filed for free agency at the end of the season but found himself without a job in MLB for 1996, instead signing a one-year deal with the Seibu Lions in Japan. =Seibu Lions= Unable to find a job in Major League Baseball in , Cooper signed on with the Seibu Lions of the Pacific League in Japan. Appearing in 81 games with the Lions, Cooper hit .243 with seven home runs, 27 RBI and 27 runs scored. It was with the Lions that he was given the nickname \\"Super Duper Cooper Scooper\\" in recognition of his tremendous defense. =Kansas City Royals= On December 16, 1996, Cooper signed with the Kansas City Royals, earning $375,000 for the season. In 1996, the Royals had finished last in American League Central division at 75‚Äì86, 24 games behind the Cleveland Indians. Cooper was signed just three days after the Royals traded incumbent third baseman Joe Randa and three other players to the Pittsburgh Pirates for infielders Jay Bell and Jeff King. Cooper went to spring training as a non-roster invitee, and made the team. Cooper hit just .201 with three home runs, 15 RBI and 12 runs over 159 at bats in 75 games for the 1997 Royals. By the end of the season, Cooper was primarily a defensive replacement and pinch hitter. In the last two games of his career, he appeared as a defensive replacement at third base without getting an at bat. His final MLB at bat came September 26, 1997, at Comiskey Park, striking out as a pinch hitter against Chicago White Sox lefty Jim Abbott. A free agent at season's end, Cooper signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers, but was released in March 1998, without appearing in a game with the club. Post- playing career In 1999, Cooper was named head coach of the Fontbonne College baseball team. He led the team for several seasons, and was named coach of the year for the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SLIAC) in 2003. In 2005, Cooper became part-owner of a baseball training facility in the St. Louis area. In 2007, Cooper joined the staff of the St. Louis Gamers, a baseball program for 10 to 18 year-old players.

Applications depend on the correct assignment and interpretation of permissions in order to function properly. Repairing permissions involves checking the permissions of a set of files and folders on a volume with macOS installed against a list of correct POSIX permissions and correcting any discrepancies. The list of correct permissions is compiled by consulting the various bill-of-materials (.bom) files. Typically, these files are stored within reduced-size Installer package (.pkg) files in the Receipts folder in the local Library directory () on the volume being checked. Whenever a user installs software that uses the macOS Installer package format, a bill-of-materials file is created which can be consulted for future permission repair. Files whose permissions have been incorrectly altered by an administrator, an administrator operating with root privileges, or a poorly designed installer package (installed with similar privileges) can cause a wide array of problems ranging from application errors to the inability to boot macOS. Repairing permissions can become necessary, but has become increasingly less so for versions after Panther (10.3). In OS X El Capitan, Apple introduced a security feature called System Integrity Protection. With it enabled, root privileges are no longer able to change system files and folders, including their permissions. Permissions repairs are instead performed automatically upon system installs and updates. To that end, Disk Utility as well as the corresponding command-line utility lost the ability to repair permissions. Usage In systems prior to OS X El Capitan, a permissions repair can be performed by selecting a startup volume and clicking the \\"Repair Disk Permissions\\" button in the \\"First Aid\\" section of Disk Utility. The operation can also be performed by using the command-line utility. In El Capitan, the user can instead use two command-line utilities: to repair particular packages or to repair a standard set of system packages. In both cases, the user has to disable System Integrity Protection to change permissions of system files and directories. In macOS Sierra, is not available. Permissions can also be repaired using third-party utilities such as The Apotek's AppleJack or Prosoft Engineering's Drive Genius.

It was settled positively: * By Tait, using a semantic technique for proving cut-elimination, based on work by Sch√ºtte (Tait 1966); * Independently by Takahashi by a similar technique (Takahashi 1967); * It is a corollary of Jean-Yves Girard's syntactic proof of strong normalization for System F. Takeuti's conjecture is equivalent to the consistency of second-order arithmetic in the sense that each of the statements can be derived from each other in the weak system PRA; consistency refers here to the truth of the G√∂del sentence for second-order arithmetic.

A metadata repository is the database where metadata is stored. The registry also adds relationships with related metadata types. Use of metadata registries Metadata registries are used whenever data must be used consistently within an organization or group of organizations. Examples of these situations include: * Organizations that transmit data using structures such as XML, Web Services or EDI * Organizations that need consistent definitions of data across time, between databases, between organizations or between processes, for example when an organization builds a data warehouse * Organizations that are attempting to break down \\"silos\\" of information captured within applications or proprietary file formats Central to the charter of any metadata management programme is the process of creating trusting relationships with stakeholders and that definitions and structures have been reviewed and approved by appropriate parties. Common characteristics of a metadata registry A metadata registry typically has the following characteristics: * Protected environment where only authorized individuals may make changes * Stores data elements that include both semantics and representations * Semantic areas of a metadata registry contain the meaning of a data element with precise definitions * Representational areas of a metadata registry define how the data is represented in a specific format, such as in a database or a structured file format (e.g., XML) Clear separation of semantics and system- specific constraints Because metadata registries are used to store both semantics (the meaning of a data element) and systems-specific constraints (for example the maximum length of a string) it is important to identify what systems impose these constraints and to document them. For example the maximum length of a string should not change the meaning of a data element. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published standards for a metadata registry called ISO/IEC 11179 and also ISO15000-3 and ISO15000-4 ebXML registry and repository (regrep) EbXML RegRep ISO standards There are two ISO standards which are commonly referred to as metadata registry standards: ISO 11179 and ISO 15000-3. There are some who believe that ISO 11179 and ISO 15000-3 are interchangeable or at least in some way similar. e.g. \\"Of interest is that the ISO 11179 model was one of the inputs to the ebXML RIM (registry information model) and so has much functional equivalence to the \\"registry\\" region of the ISO 11179 conceptual model.\\" This is however incorrect. Although the specification ebRIM v2.0 (5 december 2001) says at the beginning in its Design Objectives: \\"Leverage as much as possible the work done in the OASIS [OAS] and the ISO 11179 [ISO] Registry models\\" by the time of ebRIM v3.0 (2 May 2005) all reference to ISO/IOEC 11179 is reduced to a mention under informative references on page 76 of 78. It was recognised by some team members that the ebXML RIM data model had no place to store \\"fine grained artifacts\\" ie. the data elements which are at the heart of ISO/IEC 11179, but not until 2009 can an explicit and definitive statement from the team be found. =ISO/IEC 11179= ISO/IEC 11179 says that it is concerned with \\"traditional\\" metadata: \\"We limit the scope of the term as it is used here in ISO/IEC 11179 to descriptions of data - the more traditional use of the term.\\" Originally the standard named itself a \\"data element\\" registry. It describes data elements: \\"data elements are the fundamental units of data\\" and \\"data elements themselves contain various kinds of data that include characters, images, sound, etc.\\" It also describes a registry with an analogy: \\"This is analogous to the registries maintained by governments to keep track of motor vehicles. A description of each motor vehicle is entered in the registry, but not the vehicle itself.\\" =ebXML= The ebXML RIM says about its Repository and Registry that it is * \\"... capable of storing any type of electronic content such as XML documents, text documents, images, sound and video ‚Ä¶ RepositorytItems (sic) are stored in a content repository\\". It also says that it is * \\"... capable of storing standardized metadata that MAY be used to further describe RepositoryItems\\" which metadata \\"‚Ä¶ are stored in the registry\\". It also describes itself with \\"...this familiar metaphor. An ebXML Registry is like your local library. The repository is like the bookshelves in the library. The repository items in the repository are like book (sic) on the bookshelves.\\" It goes on to say \\"The registry is like the card catalog ‚Ä¶ A RegistryObject is like a card in the card catalog.\\" What should be immediately apparent is that something which holds catalogue cards is not \\"like\\" a catalogue, it IS a catalogue. Unfortunately for a number of organisations that have implemented ebXML RIM to satisfy a requirement for an ISO/IEC 11179 registry, ebXML RIM * is neither a registry * nor does it store metadata. It is * a \\"content repository\\" * and a \\"metacontent catalogue\\". Metadata registry roles A metadata registry is frequently set up and administered by an organization's data architect or data modeling team. Data elements are frequently assigned to data stewards or data stewardship teams that are responsible for the maintenance of individual data elements through a secure system. Metadata element workflow Metadata registries frequently have a formal data element submission, approval and publishing approval process. Each data element should be accepted by a data stewardship team and reviewed before data elements are published. After publication change control processes should be used. Metadata navigation, search and publishing Metadata registries are frequently large and complex structures and require navigation, visualization and searching tools. Use of hierarchical viewing tools are frequently an essential part of a metadata registry system. Metadata publishing consists of making data element definitions and structures available to both people and other systems.

It lies east of Cottbus, on the river Lausitzer Nei√üe which is also the German-Polish border, the Oder- Neisse line. It is the capital of the Spree-Nei√üe district. It is known for its rose garden and textile museum. The town's population is 18,651. In Forst, there is a railway bridge across the Nei√üe belonging to the line Cottbus‚Äì≈ªary which is serviced by regional trains and a EuroCity train between Hamburg and Krak√≥w (2011). There is also a road bridge across the river north of Forst.  Overview  Part of the region of Lusatia, Forst was awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia in the 1815 Congress of Vienna. The town was subsequently administered within the Province of Brandenburg. After World War II it became part of the German Democratic Republic. Forst has experienced severe problems as a result of the 1990 German reunification, most notably from extreme unemployment. In the past, the town was known for textile manufacturing, but all of the textile plants and factories have closed down.  History  A short distance to the south of the old Sorbian village of Altforst, the town probably originated around 1150 at a river crossing point on the important west-east route (known as the Salzstra√üe / Salt Road) connecting Halle and G≈Çog√≥w. By 1265 it was developing into a permanent trading settlement round the Church of St Nicholas. The commercial importance of Forst increased with the development of a north-south route connecting to Guben, downstream along the Neisse River. In the fourteenth century the council was able to take on responsibility for the lower courts locally. In 1352 of Ileburg took over the overlordship of Forst from Frederick III of Mei√üen.

It once again featured Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield. The special was first broadcast November 22, 1989 on CBS and was nominated for Outstanding Animated Program at the 42nd Primetime Emmy Awards. It has been released on both VHS and DVD home video. On overseas DVD copies of Garfield's Holiday Celebrations, this special is replaced with Garfield in the Rough. This was the tenth of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991.  Plot  Garfield and Odie scare Jon out of bed with military music and drill sergeant attitudes as he demands pancakes the size of Australia and plenty of coffee for breakfast. After the meal, Garfield decides to take a nap but changes his mind to kick Odie off the table. Along the way, Garfield checks the calendar date and discovers to his horror that he has an appointment with the vet that day. When he removes the date hoping to make Jon forget, he then notices that tomorrow is Thanksgiving and instantly demands Jon to buy the Thanksgiving food. On the way home from the supermarket, though, Jon remembers the vet appointment, and this causes Garfield to scream all the way to the office. While at the vet, Dr. Liz Wilson examines Garfield while Jon attempts to talk her into going out on a date with him. Liz reports Garfield is too fat and must be put on a diet, even though he is healthy. She tells what the diet is composed of. After this moment Garfield enters a panic, and then he screams. Jon threatens to suffocate his way through the rest of the visit until Liz says she'll go out with him. When Garfield and Jon simultaneously faint, an exasperated Liz agrees to the date out of annoyance, and Jon invites her to his house for Thanksgiving dinner. Back home, Jon is excited that Liz is coming over, but Garfield is absolutely miserable at being put on a diet. After eating half a leaf of lettuce for lunch, Garfield tries to raid the refrigerator but is stopped by Odie, whom Jon has assigned to make sure the cat himself doesn't try to cheat on his diet. Later, Garfield weighs himself on his talking weight scale and destroys it for comparing him to Orson Welles, then is repeatedly foiled by Odie when he tries to steal cookies, flour, salt and sugar. Garfield wonders if the lack of food is making him hallucinate. The next morning, Garfield is even grumpier than usual, but Jon pays him no mind as he begins preparing the Thanksgiving meal. However, Jon doesn't have a clue on how to prepare such a dinner because he didn't thaw the turkey overnight, doesn't bother to make stuffing, rubs butter on his skin instead of the turkey, and roasts it at 500 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 325. Garfield helps ruin the meal further by putting garlic powder in the vegetables. Jon shaves and picks a suit, just in time for Liz to arrive and notice he's not wearing pants. As Jon leaves to check on the meal, Liz spends a bit of time to inspect Garfield and wonders if perhaps she was a bit too hard on him with the diet. After Garfield pretends to be suffering from every single withdrawal symptom Liz casually mentions, she eventually decides that the diet is too strict for Garfield and lets him off, instantly cheering him up... until he remembers about Jon's horrible cooking of the feast. In the kitchen, Jon is faced with a still frozen turkey and the realization that he doesn't know how to prepare a Thanksgiving dinner, and he has no idea what to do now. Garfield manages to convince Jon to call Grandma, who arrives seconds later and shoos Jon out of the kitchen. As Jon distracts Liz by giving her a history lesson about Thanksgiving, Grandma proceeds to cook the meal: she cuts the turkey into slices with a chainsaw, adds white sauce then batters and deep fries the slices into what she calls her famous turkey croquettes, prepares sweet potatoes by covering them with butter, brown sugar and marshmallows, and finishes with \\"split-second cranberry sauce\\" and pumpkin pie. Once everything is ready, Grandma tells Garfield that Liz couldn't have found a better man than Jon and that she'd better not blow it, then asks Garfield to eat a piece of pie for her as she leaves. Garfield tells Jon, who has put Liz to sleep with his boring stories, that everything is ready, and they all proceed into the dining room to eat. Afterwards, Liz declares that it was a wonderful meal and agrees to come back next year, then thanks Jon for inviting her with a kiss on the cheek. Once Liz leaves, Jon, Garfield and Odie declare it was a great day and they're thankful for Grandma. They decide to head out for a walk to work off the meal, but Odie is too bloated from overeating to get off the couch. Jon immediately puts Odie on a diet, and Garfield gleefully torments Odie into doing push-ups as payback for yesterday.

Garfield is also weak and suffers from insomnia, resulting in a sleepless night. * More of Jon's self-ruined Thanksgiving dinner is shown. In the end, the turkey he did not thaw or butter is in terrible state, the sabotaged vegetables are smoking, and the pie he made is burnt. Jon is the one to decide to call Grandma without needing Garfield to offer the idea. * At the end, there is no mention of any new diets.

Its system was one of three considered in a series of FCC hearings from September 1949 to May 1950. Background Unlike the winning field-sequential color system by CBS, the line sequential CTI system was all-electronic with no color scanning disk, and fully compatible with existing black and white receivers. Unlike the dot sequential RCA system, it used only one scanning tube in the camera and one picture tube in the receiver. CTI's camera used three lenses, behind which were mounted red, blue, and green color filters that produced three images side by side on a single scanning tube. At the receiver, the three images were received on three separate areas of a picture tube, each area treated with different phosphorescent compounds that glowed in red, blue, or green. Superimposing lenses were used to merge the separate images into a single color image on a rear projection screen in the television set. History The CTI system was first demonstrated to the FCC in Washington, D.C., on February 20, 1950, by which time CTI had spent $600,000 to develop the system.\\"Color TV's Just Confusin',\\" The Washington Post, Feb. 26, 1950, p. L1. The CBS, RCA, and CTI systems were compared side by side three days later. Billboard reported that FCC insiders said that CTI's system came in third place, on the basis of color registry and definition. \\"CTI's sets lacked intensity,\\" it said, \\"but while its colors were of a hazy blue-violet cast, some engineers believed that it showed potentialities.\\"\\"Color Show Proves Little; FCC May Split Hue, Freeze\\", Billboard, March 4, 1950, p. 6. A writer for Popular Science similarly reported that the colors were not true, nor were they in register.\\"You'll Get Color TV Sooner Than You Think\\", Popular Science, June 1950, p. 108, 110. On August 29, CTI declared in a petition to the FCC that it had invented a \\"wholly new\\" color system, which it called \\"uniplex\\".\\"New Color TV Is 'Superior,' Firm Asserts,\\" The Washington Post, Aug 30, 1950, p. B11. \\"Color Television, Inc., Comes Up With 'Wholly New' System,\\" The Wall Street Journal, August 30, 1950, p. 2. Nonetheless, the FCC released a report on September 1 strongly favoring the CBS system. The FCC issued its final report, choosing CBS, on October 11. In reply to CTI's petition to reopen the hearings, the FCC said that \\"new ideas and new inventions are matters of weekly, even daily, occurrence,\\" and therefore the Commission had to make a decision at some point. But it held the door open, adding that it \\"cannot refuse to consider\\" improved color systems are they are developed.\\"Color Television,\\" The Wall Street Journal, Oct. 12, 1950, p. 3.

Career Campbell's film career began in 1950, with a small part in the John Garfield film, The Breaking Point. After several years of similar supporting performances in a number of films, including as a co-pilot in William Wellman's The High and the Mighty (1954), he won his first starring role in Cell 2455 Death Row (1955), a low-budget prison film for Columbia Pictures. He played a death row inmate, based loosely on the true story of Caryl Chessman, who staunchly proclaimed his innocence and obtained numerous reprieves over many years until finally being executed. Campbell's surprisingly powerful performance received generally good notices from critics, but it did very little for his career; his next several roles were again providing support to lead actors, including A Man Without a Star (1955), Love Me Tender (1956) in which he became the first person to lip sync portions of a song onscreen (actually recorded on August 24, 1956 by the Ken Darby Trio) with Elvis Presley and the 1958 film version of Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead. In 1958, Campbell co- starred with Paul Birch in Cannonball, a short-lived television series about truck drivers. After that, he toiled for more years in small parts in increasingly lower grade movies. Campbell made two guest appearances on Perry Mason in 1959 and 1960. In his first appearance he played the title character and murder victim Allen Sheridan in \\"The Case of the Artful Dodger,\\" then he played murderer and title character Jim Ferris in \\"The Case of the Ill-Fated Faker.\\" In 1963, Campbell began a brief association with Roger Corman, starring in the director's The Young Racers that year. The auto-racing-themed movie, written for the screen by Campbell's brother Robert Wright Campbell, was shot in Ireland. After production was completed, the film's sound man, Francis Ford Coppola, talked Corman into allowing Coppola to remain in Ireland with a small crew and direct a low-budget horror film, to be produced by Corman. Coppola promised it would be the cheapest film Corman was ever involved in. Shot for approximately $40,000, the resultant film, Dementia 13 (1963), was an atmospheric and violent horror thriller clearly made in imitation of Psycho. Campbell starred as a moody loner who at one point becomes the chief suspect in a series of gruesome axe killings; Patrick Magee and Luana Anders led the supporting cast. Many years later, Campbell would provide an audio commentary for the film's DVD release. Campbell also starred in another Corman-produced horror yarn. Filmed in 1963 in Yugoslavia under the title Operacija Ticijan, again with Magee in the cast, the film was never released in its original form. It was re-edited, re-dubbed, and briefly shown on television as Portrait in Terror. Years later, additional footage was shot in California, first by Jack Hill, then by Stephanie Rothman, transforming what was once a spy thriller into the story of a vampire stalking the streets of Venice, California. Retitled Blood Bath, although it also became known as Track of the Vampire, the film received a limited theatrical release in 1966. Campbell also filmed The Secret Invasion in Yugoslavia that was directed by Roger Corman and written by his brother Robert Wright Campbell. Campbell was the only one of the team of commandos not given screen credit above the title. One year previously in 1965 he landed a supporting role as a reporter in the classic suspense horror; Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte. In Blood Bath Campbell's character was an artist who killed women and hid their bodies inside his sculptures; he is also a vampire who can freely walk during the daylight in search of victims. However, the fanged vampire was confusingly played by another actor who did not resemble Campbell. Like Dementia 13, the film has managed to develop a following despite its deficiencies. In the early 1990s, Video Watchdog magazine devoted lengthy articles in three separate issues painstakingly detailing the convoluted production history of this strange but fascinating movie. Campbell had guest starring roles in the Star Trek franchise, appearing first as the mischievous super-being Trelane, in an episode of the original series called \\"The Squire of Gothos\\". Campbell also appeared twice as the Klingon Captain Koloth. Campbell first played Koloth on the original Star Trek series in the episode \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\". He reprised the role on the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode entitled \\"Blood Oath\\", some thirty years later. Campbell appeared at several Trek conventions in the 1980s and 1990s. His last appearance was at the convention organized by Creation Entertainment at the Las Vegas Hilton in August 2006. Personal life and death Campbell served in the U. S. Navy during World War II on a minesweeper in the Pacific theater. Campbell was married three times. His first marriage was to Judith Exner in 1952. They divorced in 1958. His second wife was Barbara Bricker. They were married from 1960‚Äì1961. He married his third wife, Tereza, in 1962 (although some accounts have them marrying in 1963). They were married until his death. Campbell died on April 28, 2011, at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.

Viborg Johan Otto von Spreckelsen (4 May 1929 ‚Äî 16 March 1987) was a Danish architect, best known for designing the Grande Arche of La D√©fense in Puteaux, near Paris. He directed the creation of several modern churches in Denmark.  Life  He was born in Viborg and studied at the Viborg Katedralskole and Royal Academy of Arts in Copenhagen. He later became associate professor at the Academy and from 1978 he was professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture. He later served as director up to the time of his death.  Churches  He directed the creation of several modern churches in Denmark: Vangede Kirke near Copenhagen (1974), Stavnsholt Kirke at the city of Farum (1981) and two Roman Catholic churches including one in Esbjerg (1969), St Nikolaj Church, and Hvidovre (1960), also consecrated to Saint Nicholas. He was modest about his accomplishments. Once in an interview, he declared that he was an architect who built three churches and one Arch. He relied heavily on simple geometrical figures, especially the quadrant, which can be seen in his churches, in the interior decorations even of church organs.  La D√©fense  His design won the international competition of the Grande Arche in Puteaux, France, as the French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand felt it was the best because of its 'purity and strength'. This work of 110 meters of height, which was inaugurated in 1989, two years after his death, used with remarkable ability the technology of its time, and was inspired by the nearby Arc de Triomphe. The monument, located in the heart of the financial district of La D√©fense, is built of granite and of Carrara marble. From its terrace, it is possible to admire a panoramic view all along the Axe historique with the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs-√âlys√©es, the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde and the gardens of the Tuileries and the Louvre beyond.

A Lifetime Membership level of paid subscription was added in February, 2006, granting Open Diary Plus privileges for the life of the site for a price of $100 USD (raised to $150 in 2009).The DiaryMaster ‚Äì Please Help OD (February 2, 2006). A need for additional revenues to cover server and security costs resulting from the 2004 hacking attack was cited as the reason for adding this option. Teen Open Diary and Quit Smoking Diary were discontinued in May 2006, and members were given the option of transferring their diary to the main Open Diary site.The DiaryMaster ‚Äì Teen Open Diary Import (May 25, 2006). Also in 2006, the OD Boards were added to the site, a set of community forums that were moderated by volunteer Open Diary members.The DiaryMaster ‚Äì Open Diary Boards (April 27, 2006). In February 2008, new administrative volunteers were added to the staff to help with technical support, rules monitoring, and communications with the users.The DiaryMaster ‚Äì New Support Staff (February 7, 2008). On October 20, 2008, the site celebrated its tenth anniversary online.The DiaryMaster ‚Äì Happy Birthday OD! (October 20, 2008). Open Diary 6.0, a broad upgrade to the site, was released on February 23, 2009.The DiaryMaster ‚Äì Welcome to OD 6.0 (October 20, 2008). This version included a new interface, new navigation, picture storage for Plus users, entry tagging, and several more new features. On May 29, 2009, an additional version of the site optimized for mobile devices was released.https://web.archive.org/web/20121113110110/http://www.opendiary.com/entryview.asp?authorcode=C100003&entry;=20258 As of spring 2012, the site's helpdesk software was taken down due to lack of funds, leaving the administrators fewer tools to communicate with users and provide service. On January 28, 2014 it was announced that Open Diary was shutting down within two weeks. On February 7, 2014 the site went offline at 12:02 AM EST. The associated Facebook page and Twitter account were also taken offline at the same time. On October 19, 2017, the Open Diary Outage Board (ODOB)https://www.facebook.com/odoutageboard/ posted that the site went into testing mode for a new service. In its FAQ page,https://www.opendiary.com/faq/ Open Diary promises to start a new subscription-only mode this year (according to the ODOB, on New Year's Eve (in another post of the same day)). Old members are promised to be notified once the site is ready to serve diarists. According to the site, all diary entries from when the site shut down have been preserved. Open Diary re-launched publicly on January 26, 2018, offering a reclaim mechanism for ex-members to regain access to their diaries. Open Diary now functions as a subscription website, with the first thirty days free and then a $3.99 (USD) per month subscription after that. Features Open Diary allowed users to create diaries that are public, private, or friends- only. Within a diary, individual entries were either public, private, or friends-only, if the level of overall diary privacy allowed it. Users were able to post an unlimited number of entries in their diaries. Diary entries on the site accepted user comments, which were linked back to the noter's diary. Notes left on diaries were either set to public or private (only visible to the entry author), and diaries were set to accept anonymous notes from people outside of Open Diary, or from members only. The Diary Circles feature provided a place where diary entries of a similar nature could be posted together. These circles were linked to the Open Diary Boards, a message board component that was added to the site on April 27, 2006. Entries recommended by Open Diary users were listed on the Reader's Choice page. Users created a \\"favorites\\" list bookmarking other diaries of interest. They added a list of \\"interests\\" to their profile, and search for diarists who have expressed interest in a particular topic. Open Diary also provided a free email service, which was not limited to Open Diary members.Open Diary Free Email Security The Open Diary website was the victim of two major hacking attacks. On September 11, 2004, the Open Diary database server was hacked, resulting in the loss of eleven weeks worth of diary entries for all members. Bruce Ableson offered a cash bounty for information leading to the arrest of the hacker, and the FBI was involved in the investigation.The DiaryMaster ‚Äì Back in Business (September 14, 2004). On February 2, 2006, Ableson introduced $100 Lifetime subscriptions, stating that this new membership level was created to raise money after declining subscription rates in the period following the 2004 hacker attack caused Open Diary to go into debt. Lifetime members were told they would be given extra features, communication, and consideration beyond the OD Plus level. However, as of Spring 2012, these subscriptions are no longer available due to lack of responsiveness from site administrators. On August 28, 2008, Open Diary was again hacked. Ableson took the site offline, with a message on the front page stating that there had been a security breach and the email addresses and passwords of some users had been compromised, but that no diary content had been lost. The site went back online on August 29, with a post from Ableson stating that over 2,000 users' email addresses and passwords had been compromised by a script exploiting a weakness in the site's security.The DiaryMaster ‚Äì Password Problems (August 29, 2008). Affected users were assigned temporary passwords and notified by email.

Early life and education Newton was born in Deal, Kent, England and educated at Sir Roger Manwood's School. After graduating from the University of Leeds with a B.A., he moved to the United States for further study at Purdue University in Indiana and the University of Illinois, where he earned his M.A. in 1960. Summer jobs at the Vancouver Festival in 1959, and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, the next two summers, led Newton into acting. Bucknell University hired him as acting head of theatre department, where he continued to learn acting on the job.\\"Newton, Christopher.\\" Legend Library Interview . Career Newton performed with the Canadian Players, at the Manitoba Theatre Centre, the Vancouver Playhouse and the Stratford Festival. At Stratford, he played such roles as 'Oberon' in A Midsummer Night's Dream and 'Aramis' in The Three Musketeers. He also appeared on Broadway in Peter Shaffer's The Private Ear. In 1968, Newton founded Theatre Calgary where he served as artistic director until 1971. In 1973, he was appointed artistic director of the Vancouver Playhouse Theatre Company. There, he founded the Playhouse Acting School with his friend and mentor Powys Thomas. The Shaw Festival In 1979, after thrice refusing, Newton accepted an appointment as artistic director of the Shaw Festival. During his tenure, Newton continued the work to expand and enrich the Shaw Festival repertory company, turning it into one of the finest repertory companies in the world. He is acknowledged to be the finest and most inspirational Canadian theatre director of the 20th and 21st century due to his sensitive and enlightened handling of both plays and actors. Newton directed a number of critically acclaimed productions, including George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra (1983), Heartbreak House (1985), Major Barbara (1987), Man and Superman (1989), Misalliance (1990), Pygmalion (1992), Candida (1993) and You Never Can Tell (1995), as well as Henry Arthur Jones's The Silver King, William Gillette's Sherlock Holmes, Harold Brighouse's Hobson's Choice, Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, St. John Hankin's The Return of the Prodigal, and No√´l Coward's Cavalcade. He also continued to appear as an actor at The Shaw, taking a series of small roles in one of the company's greatest successes, Derek Goldby's production of Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, as well as playing lead roles in No√´l Coward's Private Lives and Granville Barker's The Secret Life. As artistic director, he brought in such directors such as Tadeusz Bradecki, Derek Goldby, Denise Coffey, Jackie Maxwell and Neil Munro. Newton also carefully developed the acting company, cultivating talented younger actors with challenging roles and effectively turning company members Jim Mezon, Heath Lamberts, and Fiona Reid into stars. Newton also widened the mandate of the Shaw Festival (the performance of plays written and set in Bernard Shaw's lifetime, 1856‚Äì1950) by programming the works of lesser known playwrights such as Granville Barker, whose entire oeuvre was performed at the Shaw Festival in a series of highly praised productions directed by Neil Munro. Christopher Newton's final season as artistic director of the Shaw was in 2002, and he invited Jackie Maxwell to join him for the season as artistic director designate to ensure a careful transition of leadership. Since his departure, he has worked as a freelance director and actor for companies such as the Canadian Opera Company, the Vancouver Playhouse, Theatre Calgary, and the Stratford Festival. He has also returned to the Shaw Festival in 2004 to direct Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest and in 2005 to direct R. C. Sherriff's Journey's End. Honours Newton was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 1995. He was named an Officer in 2018. Christopher Newton's other awards include the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts (2000), the Molson Prize; and, from the United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT), the Thomas DeGaetani Award, all honouring his lifetime contribution to the theatre.

The trail connects the easternmost portions of Arlington County, the City of Alexandria, and Fairfax County, and travels mostly on dedicated trail with a small portion on city streets. As part of U.S. Bike Route 1, the MVT opened in April 1972 as a gravel path and was subsequently expanded and paved. The MVT is part of the much larger mid-Atlantic Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail. History Separate bridle and footpaths were included in the 1890 and 1930 plans for the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway, as the George Washington Parkway was called before opening. Provisions for such paths were included in the construction of key bridges, such as the Boundary Channel Bridge on south Columbia Island and some short paths were built before 1970 in busier areas, but none of these were suitable for long bike rides. One early path was built in 1940 between the Arlington Memorial Bridge and the Navy - Merchant Marine Memorial and that path was eventually connected to the George Mason Memorial Bridge. In 1969, that path was paved and renamed the Lady Bird Trail, in honor of Lady Bird Johnson. Before construction of the Mount Vernon Trail, cyclists frequently rode on the parkway. On Sundays, one lane would be roped off for the exclusive use of cyclists. In fact in 1971, cyclists held a \\"bike-in\\" along the parkway. Because the route was so popular, and because the addition of concrete barriers in some places would create space, the National Park Service, after being lobbied by local civic groups led by Ellen Pickering and Barbara Lynch, decided in 1971 to build a full trail along the side of the parkway. The trail idea was not new as the Park Service had been seeking money for a trail to Gravelly Point as far back as 1967. The Mount Vernon Trail was originally built by the Park Service in two phases. The first section, a compacted gravel path from the Mason Bridge and the existing Lady Bird Trail to Slaters Lane in Alexandria was opened on April 15, 1972. On April 21, 1973, it was extended 7.5 miles south from I-495 to Mount Vernon with a surface of compacted fly ash from the PEPCO plant in Alexandria. The first section was 6 feet wide and cost only $27,000 to build due to the work of numerous volunteers who, after NPS bladed the base, spent every weekend for four months spreading gravel. Because it only went to Alexandria, it was referred to as the Alexandria Bike Trail, not taking on the name Mount Vernon Trail until the second section was completed. The second section was 8 feet wide, cost $135,000 to build and received help from the U.S. Army Engineer Center at Ft. Belvoir which helped to build the timber bridges and boardwalks. Since the Mount Vernon Trail opened it has been expanded, widened, connected to and improved many times. In 1976, the City of Alexandria acquired a deed from Norfolk Southern to build a section of the trail from Pendleton Street to E. Abingdon Drive. This extension moved the on-road portion through Alexandria from Pitt Street to Union Street. In 1978, the Park Service built a new, $305,000, 1.8 mile paved section of trail on the west side of the parkway from Alexandria Avenue to Fort Hunt Road, a controversial project that was held up by legal action over safety and environmental concerns by neighbors. Previously the trail in that area had been on-road. In 1978, the Airport Authority built a connection from the trail to the airport's bicycle parking. In 1979, the original section between Alexandria and Memorial Bridge was paved and in 1980 the section south of Fort Hunt and the one between Alexandria and Alexandria Avenue was paved. In 1980, as part of the construction of seven bridges across Four Mile Run, including bridges for Potomac Yard railroads, Route 1 and the George Washington Parkway, the Army Corps of Engineers built an extension of the Four Mile Run Trail that connected the trail to the Mount Vernon Trail. In 1982, Alexandria built a small section of trail in the area under and near the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. In 1982-83, a new trail route was built around the east side of the Potomac River Generating Station, on a cantilevered section between the river and the power plant, with costs paid for by the power utility because they were facing legal action for illegally storing coal on federal land. On December 7, 1988, the Park Service expanded the trail north from Arlington Memorial Bridge to Roosevelt Island where a new bridge over the parkway, which opened on June 11th of that year, connected it to the Custis Trail. Later that same year a new trail segment was built in Fort Hunt Park where the trail had been on road. That represented the last new section of trail. However, many sections of trail have been improved, and several new connections to the trail have been built. In March 1992, work began on the Crystal City Connector Trail that connected the trail to Crystal City via a pedestrian tunnel that had been built when the railway was moved nearly a decade beforehand. The Connector opened on August 22, 1992. Between 1994 and 1999, Arlington County built a trail connection between the Mount Vernon Trail at Memorial Circle and the sidewalk along Washington Boulevard that would eventually become the Washington Boulevard Trail. In 2003, the Wilkes Street Tunnel Trail, which was constructed between 1980 and 1999 was connected to the on-street portion of the trail at Union Street. In 2006, after it was determined that the bridge over the north entrance to National Airport was deteriorating and that the Mount Vernon Trail was a safety concern because of its close proximity to the roadway, the bridge was rebuilt and the trail was realigned and widened in the area. That section opened in 2007. In June 2009, the trail on the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge opened with a connection to the Mount Vernon Trail and in July 2012, the trail beneath the bridge and approaching it was rebuilt. In 2011, the National Park Service rebuilt the Humpback Bridge, which involved changes to the roadway, widening the Mount Vernon Trail, adding a barrier to separate the trail users from the traffic, lowering the grade across the bridge to improve sight distance, and adding a pair of trail tunnels under the bridge for safer passage between the Columbia Island Marina, the Mount Vernon Trail and, in the future, Boundary Channel Drive. The trail lane opened on March 18th. In 2012, the Park Service realigned the trail at Memorial Circle, moving the crossing of Washington Boulevard a few hundred feet south and creating a crossing at a right angle to the road. In June of 2016, the section of the trail next to the airport was realigned, widened and separated from the parkway. On May 24, 2017, the National Park Service opened a rebuilt Roosevelt Island parking lot that created a new route, with smoother curves for the Mount Vernon Trail, and the trail was also widened. The National Park Service has considered expanding the trail. In 2002, they performed a feasibility study on expanding it north to the American Legion Bridge. The design proposed was a mostly on-street route, with a pair of trail segments west of Glebe Road. Description The trail parallels the George Washington Memorial Parkway and the western bank of the Potomac River. Most of the northern half of the trail is open with views of the river and of Washington, D.C. The southern below Alexandria is largely wooded with limited river views. From its northern trailhead at a parking lot near Theodore Roosevelt Island, the MVT travels south near the Potomac River until it turns inland to pass between the parkway and the west side of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Before reaching the airport, the trail passes through Gravelly Point, where there are often views of arriving and departing airplane. A connecting trail travels through the airport and provides access to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Metro Station and the Abingdon Plantation historic site. The Mount Vernon Trail at Belle Haven After passing the airport, the trail crosses Four Mile Run and continues south on city streets into Old Town Alexandria. After crossing under the Woodrow Wilson Bridge and over Hunting Creek, the trail continues south along the Potomac River, traveling near Belle Haven, the west side of Dyke Marsh and the east side of Fort Hunt Park. The last mile before reaching Mount Vernon is a curving uphill inland climb. Connecting trails The Mount Vernon Trail connects to other area hiker/biker routes including: * East Coast Greenway - a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida. * Woodrow Wilson Bridge Trail, which crosses the Potomac River and provides access to National Harbor in Prince George's County, Maryland. * Four Mile Run Trail, a paved trail that begins near the boundary between Arlington County and the City of Falls Church and travels east to meet the Mount Vernon Trail south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. * Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail, a paved rail trail that travels northwest from the Arlington County/Alexandria boundary to Purcellville, Virginia (accessed from the Four Mile Run Trail). * Rock Creek Park Trail, a paved trail that travels north through Washington, D.C., and Montgomery County, Maryland and ends near Lake Needwood (accessed from the Arlington Memorial Bridge). * Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath, an unpaved path that travels northwest from Georgetown in Washington, D.C., for to Cumberland, Maryland (accessed from the Francis Scott Key Bridge). * Capital Crescent Trail, a partially paved rail trail that travels east and south for from Silver Spring, Maryland through Bethesda, Maryland to Georgetown (accessed from the Francis Scott Key Bridge). * Custis Trail, a paved trail that begins in Rosslyn at the end of the Mount Vernon Trail, travels west alongside I-66 and connects to the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail. * Northern Extension (Potomac Heritage Trail):, a unpaved hiking trail beginning at the end of the Mount Vernon Trail northwest of Theodore Roosevelt Island and traveling northwest through Arlington and Fairfax Counties in and near the Potomac River gorge and near the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The trail travels near the shoreline of the Potomac River, crosses under the Francis Scott Key Bridge and passes Chain Bridge. The trail then travels inland along Pimmit Run, passes Fort Marcy Park, returns to the Potomac's shoreline and passes Turkey Run Park. The trail ends after passing beneath the American Legion Memorial Bridge, which carries the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) over the Potomac River.

It documents the standardization and registration of metadata to make data understandable and shareable.  Intended purpose  Organizations exchange data between computer systems precisely using enterprise application integration technologies. Completed transactions are often transferred to separate data warehouse and business rules systems with structures designed to support data for analysis. A de facto standard model for data integration platforms is the Common Warehouse Metamodel (CWM). Data integration is often also solved as a problem of data, rather than metadata, with the use of so- called master data. ISO/IEC 11179 claims that it is a standard for metadata- driven exchange of data in an heterogeneous environment, based on exact definitions of data.  Structure of an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry  The ISO/IEC 11179 model is a result of two principles of semantic theory, combined with basic principles of data modelling. The first principle from semantic theory is the thesaurus type relation between wider and more narrow (or specific) concepts, e.g. the wide concept \\"income\\" has a relation to the more narrow concept \\"net income\\". The second principle from semantic theory is the relation between a concept and its representation, e.g., \\"buy\\" and \\"purchase\\" are the same concept although different terms are used. A basic principle of data modelling is the combination of an object class and a characteristic. For example, \\"Person - hair color\\". When applied to data modelling, ISO/IEC 11179 combines a wide \\"concept\\" with an \\"object class\\" to form a more specific \\"data element concept\\". For example, the high-level concept \\"income\\" is combined with the object class \\"person\\" to form the data element concept \\"net income of person\\". Note that \\"net income\\" is more specific than \\"income\\". The different possible representations of a data element concept are then described with the use of one or more data elements. Differences in representation may be a result of the use of synonyms or different value domains in different data sets in a data holding. A value domain is the permitted range of values for a characteristic of an object class. An example of a value domain for \\"sex of person\\" is \\"M = Male, F = Female, U = Unknown\\". The letters M, F and U are then the permitted values of sex of person in a particular data set. The data element concept \\"monthly net income of person\\" may thus have one data element called \\"monthly net income of individual by 100 dollar groupings\\" and one called \\"monthly net income of person range 0-1000 dollars\\", etc., depending on the heterogeneity of representation that exists within the data holdings covered by one ISO/IEC 11179 registry. Note that these two examples have different terms for the object class (person/individual) and different value sets (a 0-1000 dollar range as opposed to 100 dollar groupings). The result of this is a catalogue of sorts, in which related data element concepts are grouped by a high-level concept and an object class, and data elements grouped by a shared data element concept. Strictly speaking, this is not a hierarchy, even if it resembles one. ISO/IEC 11179 proper does not describe data as it is actually stored. It does not refer to the description of physical files, tables and columns. The ISO/IEC 11179 constructs are \\"semantic\\" as opposed to \\"physical\\" or \\"technical\\". The standard has two main purposes: definition and exchange. The core object is the data element concept, since it defines a concept and, ideally, describes data independent of its representation in any one system, table, column or organisation.  Structure of the ISO/IEC 11179 standard  The standard consists of seven parts: * ISO/IEC 11179-1:2015 Framework (referred to as ISO/IEC 11179-1) * ISO/IEC 11179-2:2005 Classification * ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013 Registry metamodel and basic attributes * ISO/IEC 11179-4:2004 Formulation of data definitions * ISO/IEC 11179-5:2015 Naming and identification principles * ISO/IEC 11179-6:2015 Registration * ISO/IEC 11179-7:2019 Metamodel for data set registration Part 1 explains the purpose of each part. Part 3 specifies the metamodel that defines the registry. Part 7 is released per December 2019 and provides an extension to part 3 for registration of metadata about data sets. The other parts specify various aspects of the use of the registry.  Overview of 11179 Data Element  The data element is foundational concept in an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry. The purpose of the registry is to maintain a semantically precise structure of data elements. Each Data element in an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry: * should be registered according to the Registration guidelines (11179-6) * will be uniquely identified within the register (11179-5) * should be named according to Naming and Identification Principles (11179-5) See data element name * should be defined by the Formulation of Data Definitions rules (11179-4) See data element definition and * may be classified in a Classification Scheme (11179-2) See classification scheme Data elements that store \\"Codes\\" or enumerated values must also specify the semantics of each of the code values with precise definitions. Adoption of 11179 standards Software AG's COTS Metadata Registry (MDR) product supports the ISO 11179 standard and continues to be sold and used for this purpose in both commercial and government applications (see Vendor Tools section below). While commercial adoption is increasing, the spread of ISO/IEC 11179 has been more successful in the public sector. However, the reason for this is unclear. ISO membership is open to organizations through their national bodies. Countries with public sector repositories across various industries include Australia, Canada, Germany, United States and the United Kingdom. The United Nations and the US Government refer to and use the 11179 standards. 11179 is strongly recommended on the U.S. government's XML website. and is promoted by The Open Group as a foundation of the Universal Data Element Framework.Universal Data Element Framework The Open Group is a vendor-neutral and technology-neutral consortium working to enable access to integrated information within and between enterprises based on open standards and global interoperability. Extensions to the ISO/IEC 11179 standard Although the ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry is 6-part standard comprising several hundreds of pages, the primary model is presented in Part-3 and depicted in UML diagrams to facilitate understanding, supported by normative text. The eXtended Metadata Registry initiative, XMDR led by the US, explored the use of ontologies as the basis for MDR content in order to provide richer semantic framework than could be achieved by lexical and syntax naming conventions alone. The XMDR experimented with a prototype using OWL, RDF and SPARQL to prove the concept. The initiative resulted in Edition 3 of ISO/IEC 11179. The first part published is ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013. The primary extension in Edition 3 is the Concept Region, expanding the use of concepts to more components within the standard, and supporting registration of a Concept system for use within the registry. The standard also supports the use of externally defined concept systems. Edition 3 versions of Parts 1, 5, and 6 were published in 2015. Part 2, Classifications, is subsumed by the Concept Region in Part 3, but is being updated to a Technical Report (TR) to provide guidance on the development of Classification Schemes.

Currently, he is a standing committee member of Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Ahmed was elected as a Jatiya Sangsad member total five times from Noakhali-1 and Noakhali-5 constituencies. Ahmed served as the post master general of Bangladesh after independence. Since the eighties he has held numerous political offices for short stints in the Government of Bangladesh, including Deputy Prime Minister (1976‚Äì1978 and 1987‚Äì1988), Prime Minister of Bangladesh (1988‚Äì1989), Vice President of Bangladesh (1989‚Äì1990) and Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs (2001‚Äì2006). Early life and career Ahmed was born in 1940 in the Bengal Presidency during the British Raj. His father was a Sufi Islamic scholar and imam in Paribagh, Dacca. Ahmed obtained his BA and MA in political science from the University of Dacca. He was called to the English Bar at Lincoln's Inn in London in 1966. While in the UK, Ahmed was part of a growing intellectual movement among East Pakistani students in envisioning an independent Bangladesh. After returning to Dacca, he joined the legal team of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the Agartala Conspiracy Case trial in 1968. He accompanied the Bengali delegation led by Sheikh Mujib to the Rawalpindi Round Table Conference with Field Marshal Ayub Khan in 1969. Ahmed witnessed many important developments in the run up to Bangladesh's independence. He joined the Provisional Government of Bangladesh in Calcutta during the 1971 Liberation War. He worked in its External Publicity Division. Ahmed addressed many humanitarian rallies for Bengali genocide victims. He once stirred an entire rally in London holding up a Daily Mirror article titled Birth of a Nation and crying out \\"we are alive, but we are not yet free\\". In the post-independence years, Ahmed became a leading barrister. His clients included prominent businessmen like Aziz Mohammad Bhai. He irked the Awami League when he acted as a defense lawyer for secular opposition figures targeted by the government. Ahmed was one of the founding members of the 33 member Committee for Civil Liberties and Legal Aid which was established to protect the opposition politicians and members of civil society who were facing the wrath of the government on 31 March 1974. Ahmed was jailed on orders from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in December 1974, but was later released. BNP and Jatiyo Party In the late 1970s, Ahmed was courted by Lt General Ziaur Rahman, the first military dictator of Bangladesh. Between 1976 and 1978, he served as Deputy Prime Minister. In 1977, he led the Bangladeshi delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. He was elected to parliament from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1979. Ahmed's feud with Shah Azizur Rahman led to him being sacked by Zia. In 1985, Ahmed joined the newly formed Jatiyo Party of Lt General Hussain Muhammad Ershad. He was appointed again as Deputy Prime Minister in the cabinet and held the portfolios of the Industries Ministry and the Communications Ministry. President Ershad appointed Ahmed as Prime Minister in 1988. Serving for a year in the office of premier, he oversaw relief operations during the catastrophic 1988 Bangladesh flood. Ahmed was invited for talks with several Western leaders, including with Margaret Thatcher at 10 Downing Street. However, Ershad replaced Ahmed with the pro-Chinese leftwinger Kazi Zafar Ahmed in 1989. Ahmed was elevated to the post of Vice President of Bangladesh in 1989. He resigned in December 1990 to make way for Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed to become acting president and lead the transition to parliamentary democracy. After serving a stint in prison following Ershad's ousting, Ahmed was invited by Khaleda Zia to return to the BNP in 1996. He was elected to parliament while in jail in 1996. He was reelected for the fifth time in 2001. Begum Zia appointed him as Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs in 2001. He was a leading spokesman of the BNP administration between 2001 and 2006, during which he defended the Bangladeshi government's track record on combating militancy. In 2007, the military-backed caretaker government arrested Ahmed on charges of illegal alcohol possession. But the case was dismissed at the Supreme Court in 2008. After his release from prison, Ahmed received a jubilant reception at his constituency in Noakhali. He was reelected to parliament in 2008. He was arrested again in 2013 by the Awami League government. His family told The Guardian that the country was turning into a prison under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Ahmed joined his party in boycotting the 2014 general election. Under the current Awami League administration, Ahmed and his brother Monzur have faced charges of illegally occupying their properties in the posh Gulshan area of Dhaka. They maintain that the case is politically motivated. Personal life and family Ahmed is married to Hasna Jasimuddin Moudud, a daughter of the Bengali poet Jasimuddin. They have a daughter, poet Ana Kashfiya Moudud. Their eldest son, Asif Momtaz Moudud, died at the age of 3. Another son, Aman Momtaj Moudud, died of dengue fever in 2015. Ahmed is a practicing barrister in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. He is a fellow at Heidelberg University in Germany and a visiting fellow at Harvard University in the United States. In the fall of 1997, he was the Bland Visiting Professor at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs. He was also a member of the Elliott School's International Council.  Publications  Ahmed is the author of nine books.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some of Chicago's most prominent families attended this church. It is renowned for its interior, completely redone in the Arts and Crafts style after a disastrous fire in 1900. The sanctuary is one of America's best examples of an unaltered Arts and Crafts church interior, fully embodying that movement's principles of simplicity, hand craftsmanship, and unity of design. It also boasts nine imposing Tiffany windows. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and later designated a Chicago Landmark on September 28, 1977. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in March 2013. History of the congregation Second Presbyterian Church organized in 1842 as an offshoot of the city's first Presbyterian congregation, which had formed in 1833. From 1851 until 1871, the congregation worshipped in a church at the northeast corner of Wabash Avenue and Washington Street in downtown Chicago. Known as the spotted church because of the tar deposits in its limestone blocks, this building was designed by the noted eastern architect, James Renwick, Jr. Renwick later designed St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and the original building of the Smithsonian Institution. Already in the late 1860s, downtown Chicago was becoming more commercial and less residential, and Second Presbyterian's leaders prepared plans to follow its membership to the near South Side. Just a few weeks before the Great Chicago Fire in October 1871, which destroyed the spotted church, the congregation had merged with another congregation and had relocated to the South Side. Many wealthy Chicago residents attended Second Presbyterian, including members of the George Pullman, Silas B. Cobb, Timothy Blackstone, and George Armour families. These were men who moved to Chicago from New England or New York State in the mid- nineteenth century to make their fortunes and build a new metropolis on the prairie. Proud of their adopted city, they endowed cultural institutions like the Art Institute of Chicago and the University of Chicago. Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's son, was also a church trustee. When the South Side emerged in the 1870s as the city's premier residential neighborhood, the business elite built imposing houses on South Prairie Avenue, South Michigan Avenue, South Calumet Avenue and other streets. Original appearance of the church For its new building on South Michigan Avenue at 20th Street (now Cullerton), the congregation again turned to James Renwick. Renwick designed a church based on early English Gothic examples, with a high-pitched gable roof, a rose window in the east wall, and a corner bell tower. The exterior is clad in limestone with sandstone trim. Sculpture on the exterior is limited; the Four Evangelists and the head of Jesus appear on the entry wall on Michigan and gargoyles loom from the bell tower. The interior was also thoroughly Gothic, with pointed arches leading to the side aisles, slender iron columns supporting the balcony, and extensive stenciling adorning the walls. The sanctuary in the new building was dedicated in 1874. In March 1900, fire gutted the sanctuary. The church turned to one of its members, Howard Van Doren Shaw, for the rebuilding. Shaw, 31 at the time, was a graduate of Yale University and the architecture program of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After working briefly in the office of Chicago's skyscraper pioneer William Le Baron Jenney, Shaw established his own practice. Shaw also had traveled extensively in Britain and was familiar with the work of Arts and Crafts architects like Philip Webb and C.F.A. Voysey. The remodeled interior View of the remodeled sanctuary, c. 1902 Shaw, working with his friend, the painter Frederic Clay Bartlett, and several other designers and craftsmen, gave Second Presbyterian a sanctuary firmly rooted in Arts and Crafts principles. Abandoning the original neo-Gothic approach, Shaw lowered the pitch of the roof and moved the support columns closer to the side walls to visually increase the width of the space, and used warm stained oak and plaster panels throughout. He planned an auditorium-style sanctuary, with no central aisle. This was appropriate for a congregation that emphasized preaching and musical worship. For the same reason, the pews are gently curved, providing good sight lines to the pulpit. The decorative program of the interior is rich, but subdued, emphasizing brown, buff, dusky crimson, and dull gold. The church's figurative art, with dozens of angels in glass, wood, and plaster, and two brightly colored saints in the lobby windows, is perhaps surprising for a Presbyterian congregation. This congregation, however, was culturally sophisticated and well-traveled. Many members had seen the great cathedrals of Europe and wanted their home church to make an equivalent artistic statement. In line with the Arts and Crafts ethos, Shaw and Bartlett designed every element of the new interior to work together to create a restful and harmonious whole. Attention was paid to every detail of pew carving, plaster casting, and fixture design. Leading Chicago area designers and craftsmen were employed for elements like the seven-armed electric candelabra flanking the pulpit (William Lau) and the four stately heralding angels standing atop the organ case (Beil & Mauch). Electric lighting was used throughout the sanctuary, and Shaw embraced the naked bulbs as design elements in the circular chandeliers and the fixtures hanging over the side aisles. A number of recurring motifs tie the various interior elements together. The most obvious is that of the angel. Some 175 grace the interior, including the four heralding angels above the organ loft and those carved into the brackets from which the chandeliers hang. Another recurring motif is the grapevine, found in the pew ends, the light screen at the sanctuary's rear, many of Bartlett's murals, and the dull gold of the screen concealing the organ pipes. The congregation installed a Hutchins-Votey organ following the 1900 fire. The Austin Organ Co. reworked the instrument in 1917 as its Opus 767, providing it with a two-manual console and ten ranks. The organ today has 43 ranks and 2,600 pipes. Second Presbyterian Church occupies a prominent place in Chicago's social and industrial history and its artistic heritage. Its glorious interior is now being seen by a wider audience after decades of semi- obscurity. Tours featuring the art and architecture of the building are offered on a regular schedule. Friends of Historic Second Church, organized in 2006, was formed to guide the accurate restoration of the building and to oversee tours and events. =Murals= Detail of Bartlett mural Bartlett's pre-Raphaelite murals are one of the glories of the sanctuary, and they were widely published after their completion. From a well-to-do Chicago family, Bartlett had studied painting at Munich's Royal Academy and with masters in Paris. For Second Presbyterian, Bartlett sought inspiration in the work of medieval church painters. He consciously rejected the post-Renaissance artistic tradition, with its emphasis on perspective and verisimilitude. Bartlett preferred to focus on expressiveness and spirituality, which he found in the flat and serene figures painted on the walls of medieval Italian churches. Bartlett painted directly on the dry plaster of the sanctuary's vertical walls. The paintings in the ceilings of the arches were done on canvas in his studio and then mounted in the church. Bartlett's figures have bold outlines and sumptuous robes of muted blue, crimson, and green. He used gold leaf extensively and supplied relief to features like haloes with a plaster technique known as pargeting. The majestic 40-foot-wide mural behind the altar represents the tree of life surmounted by a heavenly rainbow. Above that is a celestial orchestra in medieval robes. Bartlett's care in blending decoration to the sanctuary's architecture is evident; his rainbow echoes the curve of the ceiling. Bartlett's work in the twelve bays of the balcony centers on the themes of praise, abundance, and sacred music. Texts from scripture are painted on the walls below the figures. =Windows= When the sanctuary was rededicated in 1901, many of its arched openings contained simple windows with small, stylized floral designs by Shaw and executed by the firm of Gianini and Hilgart. Soon the bays began to be filled with specially commissioned memorial windows. Now, only the last bay on the north side of the church displays Shaw's work. Members of the congregation gave the other windows in memory of departed loved ones. Nine of the windows are by Louis Comfort Tiffany‚Äôs firm and display many of the innovative glass-working techniques that he pioneered. Tiffany looked to get artistic effects from the character of the glass itself rather than by painting on the glass. He used folded glass, confetti glass, striated glass, and multiple layers of glass. The windows portray a variety of Biblical scenes, landscapes, and ornamental designs. In the east end of the church is a boldly colored representation of the Ascension, designed by William Fair Kline. Below it are the five scourges or Arma Christi of Jesus. Other sanctuary windows were designed by Louis J. Millet and McCully & Miles. File:Pastoral Window.jpgPastoral window by Tiffany Studios, 1917 File:Ascension window.JPGAscension window by William Fair Kline, 1903 File:St Cecilia narthex.jpgSt. Cecilia window by Edward Burne-Jones, late 19th century The two Edward Burne-Jones windows in the lobby tie Second Presbyterian directly to the British Arts and Crafts Movement. Burne-Jones was a close associate of William Morris, founder of the Arts and Crafts in Britain. Morris and Co. crafted these two windows from the designs of Burne-Jones. The subjects are St. Margaret of Antioch, in robes of rich crimson, and St. Cecilia, in blue robes, a portable organ in her arms. These windows were displayed in the William Morris Memorial Room of Chicago's Tobey Furniture Co. before being purchased by the Franklin Darius Gray family and made into memorials. Burne-Jones windows are rare in the United States; these are the only ones known outside of the East Coast.

But first of all, we present to you life's most delicious, charming and respected greetings. To this effect, be our support and our assistance. You are for us, in Africa, those to whom it is necessary to request relief. We implore you, for the love of your continent, for the feeling that you have towards your people and especially for the affinity and love that you have for your children whom you love for a lifetime. Furthermore, for the love and meekness of our creator God the omnipotent one who gave you all the good experiences, wealth and ability to well construct and well organize your continent to become the most beautiful one and most admirable among the others. Messrs. members and officials of Europe, we call out for your solidarity and your kindness for the relief of Africa. Do help us, we suffer enormously in Africa, we have problems and some shortcomings regarding the rights of the child. In terms of problems, we have war, disease, malnutrition, etc. As for the rights of the child in Africa, and especially in Guinea, we have too many schools but a great lack of education and training. Only in the private schools can one have a good education and good training, but it takes a great sum of money. Now, our parents are poor and it is necessary for them to feed us. Furthermore, we have no sports schools where we could practice soccer, basketball or tennis. This is the reason, we, African children and youth, ask you to create a big efficient organization for Africa to allow us to progress. Therefore, if you see that we have sacrificed ourselves and risked our lives, this is because we suffer too much in Africa and that we need you to fight against poverty and to put an end to the war in Africa. Nevertheless, we want to learn, and we ask you to help us in Africa learn to be like you. Finally, we appeal to you to excuse us very, very much for daring to write this letter to you, the great personages to whom we owe much respect. And do not forget it is to you whom we must lament about the weakness of our abilities in Africa. Written by two Guinean children, Yaguine Koita and Fod√© Tounkara.

Nous vous en supplions, pour l'amour de votre continent, pour le sentiment que vous avez envers votre peuple et surtout pour l'affinit√© et l'amour que vous avez pour vos enfants que vous aimez pour la vie. En plus, pour l'amour et la timidit√© de notre cr√©ateur Dieu le tout-puissant qui vous a donn√© toutes les bonnes exp√©riences, richesses et pouvoirs de bien construire et bien organiser votre continent √† devenir le plus beau et admirable parmi les autres. Messieurs les membres et responsables d'Europe, c'est de votre solidarit√© et votre gentillesse que nous vous crions au secours en Afrique. Aidez-nous, nous souffrons √©norm√©ment en Afrique, nous avons des probl√®mes et quelques manques au niveau des droits de l'enfant. Au niveau des probl√®mes, nous avons la guerre, la maladie, le manque de nourriture, etc. Quant aux droits de l'enfant, c'est en Afrique, et surtout en Guin√©e nous avons trop d'√©coles mais un grand manque d'√©ducation et d'enseignement. Sauf dans les √©coles priv√©es o√π l'on peut avoir une bonne √©ducation et un bon enseignement, mais il faut une forte somme d'argent. Or, nos parents sont pauvres et il leur faut nous nourrir. Ensuite, nous n'avons pas non plus d'√©coles sportives o√π nous pourrions pratiquer le football, le basket ou le tennis. C'est pourquoi, nous, les enfants et jeunes Africains, vous demandons de faire une grande organisation efficace pour l'Afrique pour nous permettre de progresser. Donc, si vous voyez que nous nous sacrifions et exposons notre vie, c'est parce qu'on souffre trop en Afrique et qu'on a besoin de vous pour lutter contre la pauvret√© et pour mettre fin √† la guerre en Afrique. N√©anmoins, nous voulons √©tudier, et nous vous demandons de nous aider √† √©tudier pour √™tre comme vous en Afrique. Enfin, nous vous supplions de nous excuser tr√®s tr√®s fort d'oser vous √©crire cette lettre en tant que Vous, les grands personages √† qui nous devons beaucoup de respect. Et n'oubliez pas que c'est √† vous que nous devons nous plaindre de la faiblesse de notre force en Afrique. Ecrit par deux enfants guin√©ens, Yaguine Koita et Fod√© Tounkara.

NIEM represents a collaborative partnership of agencies and organizations across all levels of government (federal, state, tribal, and local) and with private industry. The purpose of this partnership is to effectively and efficiently share critical information at key decision points throughout the whole of the justice, public safety, emergency and disaster management, intelligence, and homeland security enterprise. NIEM is designed to develop, disseminate, and support enterprise- wide information exchange standards and processes that will enable jurisdictions to automate information sharing. NIEM is an outgrowth of the United States Department of Justice's Global Justice XML Data Model (GJXDM) project. NIEM is now being expanded to include other federal and state agencies such as the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, United States Department of Defense, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and others. Introduction NIEM is designed to facilitate the creation of automated enterprise-wide information exchanges which can be uniformly developed, centrally maintained, quickly identified and discovered, and efficiently reused. Key concepts The following key concepts are essential to understanding the purpose, architecture, processes, and other capabilities of NIEM, as well as to establish a common knowledge base with which to develop the ability to use NIEM effectively. Data Components. The fundamental building block of NIEM is the data component. Data components are the basic business data elements that represent real-world objects and concepts. Information exchanged between agencies can be broken down into individual components ‚Äì for example, information about people, places, material things, and events. Components that are frequently and uniformly used in practice are specified in NIEM and can then be reused by practitioners for information exchanges, regardless of the nature of their business or the operational context of their exchanges, provided they are semantically consistent. Information Exchange Package Documentation. The information that is commonly or universally exchanged between participating domains can be organized into information exchange packages (IEPs) in the form of XML Schemas. An example of this collection of information is data associated with an arrest. The data to be exchanged includes not only descriptive and personal identification data regarding the individual arrested (i.e., the person component described above) but also information about the person's alleged offense, the location of the offense, the arresting officer, etc. The IEP represents a set of data that is actually transmitted between agencies for a specific business purpose (e.g., initiating a charging document by the local prosecutor). It includes the actual XML instance that delivers the payload or information. Additional information regarding this specific exchange can be further documented in the form of an information exchange package documentation (IEPD), which also contains data describing the structure, content, and other artifacts of the information exchange. An IEPD supports a specific set of business requirements in an operational setting. NIEM Core. Data components within an information exchange that are universally shared and understood among all (or almost all) domains are identified as universal components (e.g., person, address, and organization). To become a universal component, consensus by all domains is needed on the semantics and structure of the component. The set of NIEM universal components is stable (once established) and relatively small. Domains. For purposes of NIEM, a domain refers to a business enterprise broadly reflecting the agencies, units of government, operational functions, services, and information systems which are organized or affiliated to meet common objectives. NIEM domains are organized to facilitate governance, and each has some measure of persistency. Each domain traditionally includes a cohesive group of data stewards who are subject matter experts (SMEs), have some level of authority within the domains they represent, and participate in the processes related to harmonizing conflicts and resolving data component ambiguities. Communities of Interest. Communities of interest (COIs) are collaborative groups of users who exchange information in pursuit of shared goals, interests, missions, or business processes and who therefore must have a shared vocabulary for the information they exchange. COIs reuse data components and artifacts found in NIEM to document their information exchanges. One or more COIs can coordinate to develop new domain content as they identify gaps in the data components needed for documenting information exchanges. NIEM Conformance. There are NIEM conformance rules that serve as guidelines for agencies utilizing NIEM to implement their information sharing exchanges. Grantees developing inter- agency XML-based exchanges must comply with the special condition language contained in the grant, and follow the associated NIEM implementation guidelines. Organizational support =NIEM Program Management Office= The NIEM Program Management Office (PMO) operates to: *Bring stakeholders, agencies, and the domains and COIs that they represent together to identify information sharing requirements in daily operational and emergency situations; *Develop information sharing standards, a common lexicon, and an online repository of information exchange package documentation and data components that support information sharing; *Provide technical tools, processes, and methodologies to support the analysis, development, discovery, dissemination, and reuse of exchange standards and documents; and *Provide training, technical assistance, communication, outreach, and implementation support services for NIEM-based information sharing. =Training and other technical resources= NIEM is a continually evolving program, and new agencies and COIs are joining the effort all the time. As new stakeholders come on board, they need to receive information to gain understanding and knowledge of the core capabilities of NIEM and how to engage in NIE information exchanges. NIEM.gov provides training materials, such as briefings and process-related documentation, as well as other resources, such as the National Information Sharing Standards Help Desk and Knowledge Base. Training provides the knowledge and know-how stakeholders need to use the tools and other capabilities provided by NIEM. NIEM tools and training opportunities are further described below. Other training materials, such as executive briefings, marketing material, and briefings for conferences and workshops, are offered from time to time and are tailored depending on the audience. A selection of online materials are also available both from the main NIEM.gov web site and resources such as Youtube.com (search on NIEM training). =NIEM.gov website= The NIEM Web site serves as a primary means by which NIEM can provide the latest documentation and downloads to those interested in NIEM. It also serves as a starting point for those wishing to contact NIEM staff with questions, support, and information requests. As related projects, tools, and support resources develop around NIEM, the Web site will expand as the hub for these supplemental resources. Technical standards NIEM adopts standard XML schema constructs and methods, such as roles, associations, and augmentation from industry standards, such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML Schema language. =NIEM schemas= The NIEM reference schemas are a set of interrelated schemas that define NIEM data components. Each schema defines its own target namespace. Schemas in the reference set may import one another by namespace in order to use (or reuse) components they define. In general, domain reference schemas import schemas from the Core. The NIEM reference schema set represents the full set of data components in NIEM. The following kinds of XML schemas are associated with the NIEM architecture: *NIEM reference schemas: Schemas containing content created or approved by the NIEM steering committees are periodically released in schema distributions. *Subset Schema: a NIEM-conformant schema, containing only the parts of the reference schemas needed to support a particular exchange. *Support schemas: NIEM includes three special schemas, appinfo, structures and proxy, for annotating and structuring NIEM-conformant schemas. *Extension Schema: a NIEM- conformant schema which adds domain- or application-specific content to the base NIEM model. *Exchange Schema: a NIEM-conformant schema which specifies a document in a particular exchange. *Constraint Schema: a NIEM-conformant schema which adds additional constraints to NIEM-conformant instances, but which is assumed to validate in concert with existing NIEM-conformant or subset schemas. A constraint schema need not validate constraints that are applied by other schemas. *Codelist Schemas: a NIEM-conformant schema which provides a list of acceptable values that a data element will be constrained to. The only mandatory schemas for validation are the NIEM reference schemas or a correct subset, however the IEPD specification requires that an IEPD include an exchange schema (along with the reference schemas or subsets) to be considered a complete IEPD. The NIEM schemas may import additional schemas, such as code table schemas, as needed. An optional extension schema may be used to add extended types and properties for components not contained in NIEM, but which are needed for the exchange. =NIEM Naming and Design Rules (NDR)= The naming and design rules for NIEM are documented in the NIEM NDR, which specifies the data model, XML components, and XML data for use with NIEM and provides a basis for NIEM conformance. The current version is NDR v4.0, which was released on July 13, 2017). NIEM is based on several concepts from the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 11179, which provides guidelines for the naming and definition of data elements, as well as information about the metadata captured about data elements. Part 5 of the ISO 11179 standard establishes a methodology for naming items in data dictionaries. The ISO 11179-based NIEM NDR naming convention uses object class, property, and representation terms to constitute a multiple-part name as shown in the figure below: Example of an ISO standard data element name Object Class Term: Represents the object to which the property is applicable. In NIEM, we interpret that object to be the real-world object. (An object class refers to a group of objects that share the same attributes, operations, methods, relationships, and semantics.) Property Term: Identifies the property that the data element represents (e.g., last name, expiration date, height, total). Representation Term: Describes the form of the data represented. This term is taken from a list of electronic business XML (ebXML) representation terms, including amount, code, date, time, graphic, identifier, indicator, measure, name, percent, picture, quantity, rate, time, and numeric. Qualifier Term: The object class and property terms can have qualifiers; i.e., a word or words that help define and differentiate the element name. =NIEM modeling and schema concepts= The NIEM technical modeling and schema concepts and mechanisms which support building new data components that meet specific requirements and reusing existing NIEM data components are briefly described below. More detail can be found in the NIEM User Guide and the NIEM NDR. Data elements, classes, types, and properties The NIEM data model uses concepts originating from object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP defines a class as a specific entity in the data model, which may represent a real-world object but may also represent any conceptual object, such as relationships and messages. An object's properties are said to describe the object. When the NIEM XML Schemas are generated from the NIEM data model, data model classes are represented as XML Schema types, and data model properties are represented as XML elements and attributes. Extension techniques There are two approaches for extending the NIEM data model for use in information exchange schemas and documents. * Creating new NIEM types to represent new concepts * Adding new data to existing NIEM types, to extend existing concepts Specialization with inheritance Specialization is used when a base object class (type) contains or can be subcategorized into a more specific subclass. When this can be done, the subclass derived from the base class inherits the properties of the more general base or parent class. This mechanism is used to share or reuse properties between the general data component and its specialization. For example, a vehicle type (or class) is identified as a data component with properties of vehicle identification number (VIN), make, and model. Truck type (or class) is a specialization of vehicle and thus inherits the vehicle's properties but also has its own characteristic properties, such as truck bed length. Specialization is time independent and is generally used only when the base class and subclass always exist. Roles A role is a special type which represents a particular function, purpose, context, or activity for an entity. Roles are generally time dependent and, therefore, temporary. A new type can be created for a role when the role has specific data associated with it and its own life cycle. A role type has a property, RoleOf, which indicates what object is assuming this role. A single entity may assume multiple roles. For example, many different entities may assume the role of a weapon. Therefore, if a vehicle is used as a weapon (to attempt to injure or kill a person), then an instance of WeaponType would contain the property, RoleOf, which references the vehicle instance used as the weapon. The WeaponType (the role) might also contain properties that describe the persons and activities involved, dates and times of involvement, and how the entity was used as a weapon. Associations An association type is an object that represents a relationship between data components. For example, two PersonType instances, Abigail and Bob, could be referenced by a MarriageAssociationType to represent the fact they are married. The MarriageAssociationType could contain its own properties, such as date of marriage, number of children, date of divorce, death of one spouse, etc. Augmentation Augmentation of a NIEM data type allows the addition of domain- or model-specific information to the concept embodied in the NIEM type, without creating a new NIEM type. It would be impractical and unwieldy to include all possible domain model-specific properties in NIEM Core schemas for general use. Instead, domain modelers need to be able define data for their use, independently from common definitions. Furthermore, that data needs to be applicable to the NIEM data object itself, and reusable in multiple exchanges. The augmentation approach built into NIEM utilizes XML Schema constructs to reuse the existing XML schema representations for the data model, by allowing them to be augmented with the new information. Element substitution NIEM uses several techniques from XML Schema to allow as- needed element substitutions for pre-existing NIEM properties and into pre- existing NIEM types. Element substitution techniques allow the substitution of new XML Schema elements, representing derived NIEM properties that can be used where the parent properties are expected. There are three XML Schema techniques that support the NIEM use of element substitutions: * use of substitution groups * creation of abstract, type-less elements, and * use of abstract elements in reference schemas. Adapting external standards In addition to adding new NIEM types and properties to NIEM, it is possible to adapt existing external (non-NIEM) namespaces for use in the NIEM framework. This allows the use of external standards within NIEM IEPDs, without requiring that the external standards themselves be NIEM-conformant. The intent here is to allow use of external standard components exactly as they were defined. Metadata Metadata, or data about data, defines information that supports the actual content of XML instances. The metadata feature provides a mechanism for attaching structured properties that describe the pedigree or source (when reported, who reported, how reliable, etc.) of instance data to any data component of the model (type or object, property, association, role, or augmentation) in any namespace. It allows sets of metadata to be extended with additional properties for local requirements and enables metadata properties to be repeated. = EIEM dictionary concepts = NIEM has introduced the concept of Enterprise Information Exchange Model (EIEM) dictionaries to allow NIEM implementers to position local collections of components specific to their own enterprise. Typically these may be drawn from an Enterprise Data Model (EDM) and then exported and refactored as XML components that conform to the NIEM NDR. See Tools section below for information on creating EIEM dictionaries. Tools NIEM provides a reference set of tools freely available with each NIEM release. The tools implement all of the structural and content features of the release, including the NIEM NDR. NIEM's well-defined interfaces and output products also support the development of independent third-party tools. Example supporting third party tools are listed below. =NIEM XML data dictionary spreadsheet= The NIEM XML data dictionary spreadsheet is a tangible representation of the entire NIEM data dictionary. It includes all of the element names that are organized hierarchically under core data components (person, property, organization, etc.) with hyperlinks to related elements. This spreadsheet also provides information on the type of data being represented (date, integer, string, etc.) and a precise, context-rich definition of each dictionary component. =Information exchanges mapping tool= The Information Exchanges Mapping Tool allows the user to specify metadata and upload XMI domain models associated with NIEM IEPDs, map components within domain models to NIEM components, and generate artifacts based on mappings, including mapping reports, wantlist, exchange schemas, extension schemas, and subset schemas. =Schema Subset Generation Tool= The Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT) enables users to search through the NIEM data model and build a NIEM subset. The NIEM data model covers several domains and typically not all of the data model is usable in an exchange. It is useful to make a schema subset of NIEM components to use in an exchange. It helps to limit the scope of developing an IEPD and can be built to the specific requirements of an exchange. With this tool users can: *Search the data model from the Search Page. *Navigate through the data model. *Download already generated subsets from each domain. *Build a schema subset containing the components required by their exchange. *Save a list of components required for a subset. *Upload a list of requested components to continue to edit it. *Download a schema subset based on a list of required components. *Create IEPD with current subset. *Change the NIEM release used for building a schema subset. =IEPD tool= The IEPD tool enables the user to upload or enter the artifacts required for an IEPD (schemas, documentation, and metadata) and assembles into a package according to the IEPD specification. It can also validate that minimum artifacts and metadata are present. The user creates an account and is granted a work space (\\"My IEPDs\\"). Inside this work space, the user can upload the artifacts to construct any number of IEPDs (complete or partial); share them with other account holders; or search, discover, and download IEPDs that other account holders have marked for sharing. A Model Package Description Specification specifies the artifacts to be included in an IEPD or other Information Exchange Model (IEM). Additionally see Third Party NIEM tools section below for IEPD tools that can automate much of the IEPD artifact generation. 3rd Party IEPD tool support includes automatic generation of NIEM cross-reference, wantlist.xml, exchange and subset schema, XML examples, rules documentation and NDR evaluation. IEPDs which have been published to the IEPD Clearinghouse are available for reuse by other organizations. Status , NIEM 4.2 is the current release. It was released on October 1, 2019, and contains minor changes. NIEM 2.1 was released on September 28, 2009 and includes a number of enhancements: * Three new domains--Maritime; Family Services; and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) * Updates to the Justice, Infrastructure Protection, and Emergency Management domains * Harmonization to reduce overlapping and duplicate data elements between domains * Completion of plain-English definitions for all components * 35% more content than NIEM 2.0 , development of NIEM 3.0 is in progress and is planned for release in fall 2013.

The puppy was created using a cell from an ear from an adult Afghan hound and involved 123 surrogate mothers, of which only two produced pups (Snuppy being the sole survivor). The Department of Theriogenology and Biotechnology at Seoul National University, which cloned Snuppy, was led by Woo Suk Hwang. Snuppy has since been used in the first known successful breeding between cloned canines after his sperm was used to artificially inseminate two cloned females, which resulted in the birth of 10 puppies in 2008. In 2017, 4 clones of Snuppy were made by Sooam, and were the first clones made of a cloned dog, to investigate potential health effects of cloning.Kim et al 2017, \\"Birth of clones of the world‚Äôs first cloned dog\\"  History  After Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996, scientists had managed to clone numerous other animals, including cats, cows, gaur, horses, mice, mules, pigs, rabbits and rats but had been unsuccessful in cloning a dog due to the problematic task of maturing a canine ovum in an artificial environment. After several failed attempts by other scientists, Woo Suk Hwang, a lead researcher at Seoul National University, created a clone using tissue from the ear of a 3-year-old Afghan hound. 123 surrogate mothers were used to carry the embryos, of which 1,095 were implanted, the procedure resulted in only three pregnancies; one resulted in a miscarriage, the other pup was born successfully but died of pneumonia three weeks after birth, the successful clone was carried by a Labrador Retriever. From the original 1,095 embryos to the final two puppies, this placed the success rate of the project at less than two tenths of a percent. Snuppy was named as a portmanteau of the initials of the Seoul National University (SNU) and the word \\"puppy\\".  Process  As the eggs in a female canine are only fertile during the estrus phase of the estrous cycle, the eggs could only be harvested during a three- week period each year. Due to complexities with removing eggs from canine ovaries the eggs had to be extracted from the oviduct, which required constant monitoring to achieve. The nucleus of each egg was replaced with the cell from the ear of the adult dog and then electrified and fused using a chemical reaction. The embryos were then transferred to the surrogate dogs. Three of the surrogate mothers became pregnant and two gave birth. Snuppy, the first to be born, survived while the other died two weeks after birth. This process of cloning Snuppy took nearly three years of intensive effort.  Reaction  Snuppy was named as Time Magazine's \\"Most Amazing Invention\\" of the year in 2005. Particular recognition was given to the cloning technique used in the process, which Time stated was \\"embodied by a history-making puppy\\". Despite numerous labs performing mammalian cloning, they hailed the achievements of Hwang's team as \\"extraordinary\\". The experiment was criticized by Robert Klitzman, director of Columbia University's Masters in Bioethics program, who said that the process raised the question of whether humans are \\"just a mass of cells and biological processes?\\" Hwang himself criticized the process, stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate (one in 123), did not make it ethical to clone family pets. Ian Wilmut, the scientist behind the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep, said that the successful cloning of Snuppy proved that any mammal could be cloned in the correct environments and that a global ban on human cloning needed to be quickly implemented because of this. The Kennel Club criticised the entire concept of dog cloning, on the grounds that their mission is to \\"To promote in every way the general improvement of dogs\\" and no improvement can occur if replicas are being created.  Controversy  Between late 2005‚Äì2006 Hwang was accused of a series of incidents of misconduct. The first allegations related to his work prior to Snuppy‚Äîthe claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of the eggs came from his employees, which would constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought serious doubts about the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed on the grounds that they were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.  Developments  Veterinary professor Byeong Chun Lee took over leadership of the team behind Snuppy. In 2008, Snuppy became involved in the first known successful breeding between cloned canines, after sperm taken from Snuppy was used to artificially inseminate two cloned females, which resulted in the birth of 10 puppies. Nine of the puppies survived. The SNU team, under Lee, have gone on to clone over 30 dogs and five wolves. SNU, which claimed to own the patent for the process used to clone Snuppy, formed a license agreement with RNL Bio, a commercial pet cloning company. Hwang entered into a partnership with RNL Bio's competitor, BioArts International, which caused an ongoing legal battle into who owns the patent rights although Bio Arts withdrew from dog cloning in 2009. RNL completed the first commercial cloning in August 2008 but ran into financial trouble in 2013. The world's first cloned sniffer dogs (all of which are named Toppy) were put to work by South Korean customs in July 2009. Supporters of Hwang founded a company called Sooam Biotech where Hwang developed proprietary techniques based on a licence from ViaGen's subsidiary Start Licensing (which owns the original Dolly patent) and created cloned dogs for owners whose dogs had died, charging $100,000 a time Sooam Biotech was reported to have cloned 700 dogs by 2015 and to be producing 500 cloned embryos of various species a day in 2016. Death Snuppy died in May 2015 at the age of 10.

In 1962, it moved to 2 St. Marks Place, until closing in 1967. Its friendly, non-commercial, low-key atmosphere, with affordable drinks and food, and cutting edge bebop and progressive jazz attracted a host of avant-garde artists and writers. It was a venue of historic significance as well, a Mecca for musicians, both local and out-of- state, who packed the small venue to listen to many of the most creative composers and performers of the era. Early history In 1937, Salvatore Termini (b. 1884) purchased what was then known as the Bowery Caf√©, a working- class bar located under the Third Avenue El. In 1946, two of Termini's sons, Joe and Ignatze (Iggy), returned from the war and helped run the bar. In 1951, the sons purchased the business from their father and renamed it the No. 5 Bar. In late 1955, the Third Avenue El was demolished and the city embarked on a revitalization of the Bowery, which had deteriorated to become a skid row. During this time, many artists were drawn to the area due to the cheaper rents, as compared to Greenwich Village. Pianist Don Shoemaker was among the influx of artists who moved to the Bowery. Occupying a studio at 1 Cooper Square above the No. 5 Bar, Shoemaker hosted jam sessions during which he would purchase beer from the Terminis. Shoemaker eventually told Joe that if the bar would purchase a piano, he and his band would play. Joe bought a used upright piano, received a cabaret license on August 30, 1956, and opened a week later under the name the Five Spot Caf√©. Leading jazz venue Many musicians lived nearby and frequented the sessions, including Elvin Jones and Blossom Dearie. Some, like Lester Young, hung out, while others, such as Cannonball Adderley, sat in. It shared many patrons with the nearby Cedar Tavern; artists including David Smith, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Joan Mitchell, Alfred Leslie, Larry Rivers, Grace Hartigan, Jack Tworkov, Michael Goldberg, Roy Newell, and Howard Kanovitz, as well as writers and poets Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O'Hara, Ted Joans, and Gregory Corso who began to frequent the club. The Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter was a regular. Even Paul Newman came to get a better understanding of the \\"scene.\\" The first official engagement at the Five Spot was Cecil Taylor, whose band featured Buell Neidlinger on bass and Dennis Charles on drums. Later, Steve Lacy (then known as Steve Lackritz) was added to the band. Originally, Taylor's band was initially hired to accompany Dick Whitmore, but Whitmore quit after three nights, giving the job to Taylor. The booking lasted from 29 November 1956 to 3 January 1957. Not long afterward, Charles \\"Big Charlie\\" Turyn, a Holocaust survivor, began bartending and waiting tables at the club, and became another fixture, a walking repository of information about the music of the era and the club.Charles Charlie Turyn-Learning on the job, Jazz Times, Sylvia Levine Leitch, April 28, 2011. Retrieved August 1, 2018. On 18 July 1957, Thelonious Monk's quartet began a six-month residency at the club. The group featured John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Wilbur Ware on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums. It was Monk's first engagement in New York City following a long suspension of his cabaret card, a problem which was resolved with assistance from the Terminis. Monk had another extended booking at the club a year later, this time with Coltrane replaced by Johnny Griffin, Ware by Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and Wilson by Roy Haynes. That group was recorded and issued on the albums Thelonious in Action and Misterioso, (both 1958). On 17 November 1959, the Ornette Coleman Quartet from Los Angeles made its New York debut at the Five Spot. The Quartet featured Coleman on alto saxophone, Don Cherry on cornet, Charlie Haden on bass, and Billy Higgins on drums. The engagement was originally scheduled to last two weeks, but due to its success was extended to ten weeks, ending in late January 1960. Musicians such as Leonard Bernstein, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane were among the attendees on the opening night. On 5 April 1960, the quartet returned to the Five Spot for a second engagement which lasted four months ending in late October 1960. This second engagement featured Ed Blackwell on drums instead of Higgins. The original Caf√© was demolished in 1962 to make way for senior housing and the club moved to nearby 2 St. Marks Place. That location discontinued live music in 1967 and the brothers let their cabaret license lapse as live jazz dipped in popularity.\\"The Highs and Lows of a Great Jazz Club\\" by Gary Giddons.

Along with the rest of the Fourteenth Amendment, this clause became part of the Constitution on July 9, 1868. Text of the clause The clause states: Drafting and adoption The primary author of the Privileges or Immunities Clause was Congressman John Bingham of Ohio. The common historical view is that Bingham's primary inspiration, at least for his initial prototype of this Clause, was the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article Four of the United States Constitution, which provided that \\"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States\\". On February 3, 1866, the Joint Committee on Reconstruction (also known as the \\"Joint Committee of Fifteen\\") voted in favor of a draft constitutional amendment proposed by Bingham. The draft constitutional amendment provided: This language closely tracked the existing language in the Privileges and Immunities Clause. On February 28, 1866, Bingham expressed his opinion that this draft language would give Congress power to \\"secure to the citizens of each State all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States in the several States\\", and he added that, \\"The proposition pending before the House is simply a proposition to arm the Congress‚Ä¶with the power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the constitution today. It hath that extent‚Äîno more‚Ä¶If the State laws do not interfere, those immunities follow under the Constitution\\".Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1088, 1095 (1866). Congress lacked the power to enforce the Privileges and Immunities Clause under the original, not amended U.S. Constitution according to Bingham. That's why Bingham wanted that privileges and immunities of United States citizens became a part of the Fourteenth Amendment. On May 14, 1868 Bingham stated that Privileges or Immunities Clause aim is that the constitution of a U.S. state \\"never should be so construed, and never should be so enforced as to deprive any citizen of the United States of the rights and privileges of a citizen of the United States within the limits of that State. The fourteenth article of the amendments of the Constitution secures this power to the Congress of the United States.\\" As stated by Bingham on January 30, 1871 in the House Report No. 22 from the House Judiciary Committee, led by John Bingham, the Privileges or Immunities Clause was deemed necessary for the enforcement of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as an express limitation upon the powers of the States. The rights and privileges of a citizen of the United States were defined by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1866: Subsequently, on April 28, 1866, the Joint Committee of Fifteen voted in favor of a second draft proposed by Congressman Bingham, which would ultimately be adopted into the Constitution. The Joint Committee no longer tracked the existing language in Article Four as the Committee had previously done. On May 10, 1866, in the closing debate on the House floor, Bingham nevertheless quoted Article IV: The Fourteenth Amendment was approved by the House later that day. Michigan Senator Jacob M. Howard introduced the amendment in the Senate, and gave a speech in which he discussed the meaning of this clause.Senator Jacob Howard, Speech Introducing the Fourteenth Amendment, Speech Delivered in the U.S. Senate, May 23, 1866\\" via Yale University. Retrieved 2013-05-17. Howard noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had never squarely addressed the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, which therefore made the effect of the new Privileges or Immunities Clause somewhat uncertain.On May 23, 1866. Howard said: \\"It would be a curious question to solve what are the privileges and immunities of citizens of each of the States in the several States. . . . I am not aware that the Supreme Court have ever undertaken to define either the nature or extent of the privileges and immunities thus guarantied. . . . But we may gather some intimation of what probably will be the opinion of the judiciary by referring to . . . Corfield vs. Coryell . . . , 4 Washington's Circuit Court Reports, page 380.\\" This comment by Howard was quoted by Justice Hugo Black in Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46 (1947). Congress gave final approval to the Privileges or Immunities Clause when the House proposed the Fourteenth Amendment to the states for ratification on June 13, 1866. There was much discussion of this proposed clause as the amendment awaited ratification by the states. For example, according to a November 15, 1866 pseudonymous letter published in the New York Times:Letter from \\"Madison\\", New York Times (November 15, 1866). This was the second of several parts by \\"Madison\\", and in the first part that author took a broad view of the rights already guaranteed by the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV ‚Äî rights with which Madison said \\"states cannot constitutionally interfere\\" according to his understanding of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. \\"Madison\\", New York Times (November 10, 1866). Madison also cited the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford as persuasive authority regarding the inability of states to make people citizens of the United States.

The clause, together with the rest of the Fourteenth Amendment, became part of the Constitution in July 1868. Interpretation after adoption Many judges and scholars have interpreted this clause, and the Slaughter-House Cases decided in 1873 have thus far been the most influential. =Pre-Slaughter- House= On January 30, 1871, the House Judiciary Committee, led by John Bingham, released a House Report No. 22, which was authored by Bingham himself, interpreting the Fourteenth's privileges or immunities this way (Emphasis added):Curtis, Michael Kent. No State Shall Abridge, the 14th Amendment and the Bill of Rights, p. 168 (Duke Univ. Press 1986). > The clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \\"No State shall make or enforce any > law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the > United States,\\" does not, in the opinion of the committee, refer to > privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States other than those > privileges and immunities embraced in the original text of the Constitution, > article four, section two. The Fourteenth Amendment, it is believed, did not > add to the privileges or immunities before mentioned, but was deemed > necessary for the enforcement as an express limitation upon the powers of > the States. It had been judicially determined that the first Eight > Amendments of the Constitution were not limitations on the power of the > States, and it was apprehended that the same might be held of the provision > of the second section, fourth article. Shortly thereafter, on March 31, 1871, Bingham elaborated: > I hope the gentleman now knows why I changed the form of the amendment of > February, 1866. Mr. Speaker, that the scope and meaning of the limitations > imposed by the first section, fourteenth amendment of the Constitution may > be more fully understood, permit me to say that the privileges and > immunities of citizens of the United States, as contradistinguished from > citizens of a State, are chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to > the Constitution of the United States.Curtis, Michael Kent. \\"Bill of Rights > as a Limitation on State Authority: A Reply to Professor Berger\\", 16 Wake > Forest L. Rev. 45 (1980). Bingham's full speech is here in the Congressional > Globe. One of the earliest judicial interpretations of the Privileges or Immunities Clause was Garnes v. McCann, Ohio Sup. Ct., in 1871. In it Judge John Day interpreted the clause to protect enumerated constitutional rights such as those listed in the Bill of Rights, but not unenumerated common-law civil rights. He wrote: > This [case] involves the equity as to what privileges or immunities are > embraced in the inhibition of this clause. We are not aware that this has > been as yet judicially settled. The language of the clause, however, taken > in connection with other provisions of the amendment, and of the > constitution of which it forms a part, affords strong reasons for believing > that it includes only such privileges or immunities as are derived from, or > recognized by, the constitution of the United States. A broader > interpretation opens into a field of conjecture limitless as the range of > speculative theories, and might work such limitations of the power of the > States to manage and regulate their local institutions and affairs as were > never contemplated by the amendment. =Slaughter-House= The Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is unique among constitutional provisions in that some scholars believe it was substantially read out of the Constitution in a 5‚Äì4 decision of the Supreme Court in the Slaughter-House Cases of 1873.In Re Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. 36 (1872) The Clause has remained virtually dormant since, but in 2010 this clause was the basis for the fifth and deciding vote in the case of McDonald v. Chicago, regarding application of the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution to the states. In the Slaughter-House Cases the court recognized two types of citizenship. The rights citizens have by being citizens of the United States are covered under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment, while the rights citizens have by being citizens of a state fall under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article Four. The Supreme Court did not prevent application of the Bill of Rights to the states via the Privileges or Immunities Clause in Slaughter-House, but rather addressed whether a state monopoly statute violated the natural right of a person to do business and engage in his trade or vocation. In other words, no provision of the Bill of Rights was at issue in that case, nor was any other right that followed under the U.S. Constitution. In obiter dicta, Justice Miller's opinion in Slaughter- House went so far as to acknowledge that the privileges or immunities of a citizen of the United States include at least some rights listed in the first eight amendments: \\"The right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances...are rights of the citizen guaranteed by the Federal Constitution\\". The Privileges or Immunities Clause was perhaps originally intended to incorporate the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights against the state governments, while also incorporating other constitutional rights against the state governments such as the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. However, that incorporation has instead been achieved mostly by means of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. =Post- Slaughter-House= In the 1947 case of Adamson v. California, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black argued in his dissent that the framers intended the Privileges or Immunities Clause to apply the Bill of Rights against the states. Black argued that the framers' intent should control the Court's interpretation of the 14th Amendment, and he attached a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from John Bingham's congressional statements.Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 92-118 (1947) However, Black's position on the Privileges or Immunities Clause fell one vote short of a majority in the Adamson case. In the 1948 case of Oyama v. California,332 U.S. 633 (1948). a majority of the Court found that California had violated Fred Oyama's right to own land, a privilege of citizens of the United States. Legal scholars disagree about the precise meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, although there are some aspects that are less controversial than others. William Van Alstyne has characterized the coverage of the Privileges or Immunities Clause this way:Van Alstyne, William. The Second Amendment and the Personal Right to Arms, 43 Duke L.J. 1236-1255 (1994) Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute has said that the meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment depends upon the meaning of its counterpart in Article IV: the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Pilon further urges that the Article IV Clause should be reinterpreted as protecting a wide variety of natural rights, despite \\"its more recent history of interpretation or enforcement\\".Shankman, Kimberly and Pilon, Roger. Reviving the Privileges or Immunities Clause to Redress the Balance Among States, Individuals, and the Federal Government Cato Policy Analysis No. 326 (1998) On the other hand, Kurt Lash of the University of Illinois College of Law has argued that, at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the privileges and immunities of \\"citizens of the United States\\" as referred to in the Fourteenth Amendment were understood as a class distinct from the privileges and immunities of \\"Citizens in the several States\\" as referred to in Article IV. Under this interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as an \\"antebellum term of art\\", Slaughter-House is consistent with the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.Lash, Kurt T. The Origins of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, Part I: 'Privileges and Immunities' as an Antebellum Term of Art (2009) Like Roger Pilon, some of the framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause anticipated that it could protect (from state infringement) a broad range of rights far exceeding what had been enumerated in the Bill of Rights. However, as Pilon notes, that was often because of their interpretation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause in the original unamended Constitution. Regarding that interpretation of the older clause, Justice Clarence Thomas has noted that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment realized the Supreme Court had not yet \\"undertaken to define either the nature or extent of the privileges and immunities\\" in the original unamended Constitution.Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999). Several analyses of the Privileges or Immunities Clause were noted by Justice Thomas in the Saenz case, including these: *Currie, David. The Constitution in the Supreme Court 341-351 (1985) (Clause is an antidiscrimination provision) *Crosskey, William. Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States, Volume 2, pp. 1089-1095 (1953) (Clause incorporates first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights) *Siegan, Bernard. Supreme Court's Constitution 46-71 (1987) (Clause guarantees Lockean conception of natural rights) *Ackerman, Bruce. Constitutional Politics/Constitutional Law, 99 Yale Law Journal 453, 521-536 (1989) (same) *Berger, Raoul. Government by Judiciary 30 (2d ed. 1997) (Clause forbids race discrimination with respect to rights listed in the Civil Rights Act of 1866) *Bork, Robert. The Tempting of America 166 (1990) (Clause is inscrutable and should be treated as if it had been obliterated by an ink blot) The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment left that matter of interpretation in the hands of the judiciary. In the 2010 case of McDonald v. Chicago, Justice Thomas, while concurring with the majority in declaring the Second Amendment applicable to state and local governments, declared that he had reached the same conclusion only through the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Legal scholar Randy Barnett argues that since no other justice, either in majority or dissent, attempted to question his rationale, this constitutes a revival of the Privileges or Immunities Clause.Barnett, Randy. Privileges or Immunities Clause alive again. In the 2019 case of Timbs v. Indiana where the court incorporated the Eighth Amendment against excessive fines against state governments, Justice Thomas again argued in a concurrence that the right should have been incorporated via the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Justice Gorsuch also agreed in a separate concurrence that the Privileges or Immunities Clause \\"may well [have been] the appropriate vehicle for incorporation.\\" In the 2020 case of Ramos v. Louisiana, Justice Thomas again argued in favor of the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than the Due Process Clause. Redundancy issues One of the arguments against interpreting the Privileges or Immunities Clause as a requirement that the states comply with the Bill of Rights has been that such an interpretation would render the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment redundant, due to the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Although constitutional scholars such as Raoul Berger have raised this question, Akhil Amar argues that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment wanted to extend the due process right not only to citizens, but to all other persons as well, which required a separate Due Process Clause.Amar, Akhil. The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment , 101 Yale Law Journal 1193, 1224-1225 (1992). The Fifth Amendment refers to \\"persons\\" and not \\"citizens\\" within its text, but it would only be incorporated by the Privileges or Immunities Clause as to citizens. An alternative or additional rationale for explicitly including the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment is that the Privileges or Immunities Clause only forbids states from making or enforcing laws, and therefore does not bar states from harming people outside the legal process. Another redundancy issue is posed by an interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause that views it as simply a guarantee of equality. Proponents of that interpretation acknowledge that, \\"the natural response to this approach is to say that ... any equality-based reading of the clause is redundant because the Equal Protection Clause provides the necessary ground and more.\\"Harrison, John. Reconstructing the Privileges or Immunities Clause, 101 Yale Law Journal 1385, 1418 (1992). Right to travel The right of citizens to travel from one state to another was already considered to be protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the original, unamended Constitution. Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. 168 (1868): \\"it gives them the right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them.\\" For example, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, the Supreme Court listed a number of rights of citizens which \\"it cannot be supposed that [the founders] intended to secure\\" for free black people, one of which was \\"the right to enter any other State whenever they pleased.\\"60 U.S. 393, 417 (1857). Moreover, the right to travel has additional components, such as the right to take up residence and become a citizen of a different state. The Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause addresses residency: \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\\" In the 1999 case of Saenz v. Roe, Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, said that the \\"right to travel\\" also has a component protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: Justice Samuel Freeman Miller had written in the Slaughter-House Cases that the right to become a citizen of a state by residing in the state \\"is conferred by the very article under consideration.\\" See also * Oyama v.

Malartic is a town on the Malartic River in northwestern Quebec, Canada, in the La Vall√©e-de-l'Or Regional County Municipality. It is located about east of the centre of Rouyn- Noranda along Quebec Route 117 and the Canadian National Railway. In addition to the main settlement of Malartic, the municipality also includes the smaller settlement of Norrie. History At the time when the Abitibi region was being surveyed and organized in 1907, the name Malartic was chosen for the geographic township and lake, following the pattern of assigning names of regiments and officers of General Montcalm's army. It was named after Anne Joseph Hippolyte de Maur√®s, Comte de Malartic, aide de camp to Montcalm. The discovery of major gold deposits in 1923 led to a gold rush in the Abitibi region, attracting settlers (exclusively men during the first six years) to the area in 1928. In 1935, the Canadian Malartic Gold Mines began operation, employing people from all over the province, Canada, and several east European countries. Together with Eastern Malartic and Malartic Goldfields that began operating in 1937 and 1939 respectively, these three became Quebec's largest gold mines. But newly arriving workers were not permitted to settle near the mines and would build a squatter camp on Crown land about 4 km north of Malartic, that became the community of Roc d'Or. The two settlements grew concurrently, duplicating services. But the parishes (Saint-Martin-de-Tours in 1928), railway station, and post office (1936) were established near the mines in Malartic.Gourd, Benoit-Beaudry. \\"Malartic\\", in The Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig Publishing, 1988), Volume 2, p.1287. In 1939, the Town of Malartic was incorporated under the auspices of the Quebec Ministry of Mines, in an attempt to halt the proliferation of squatter camps in the Abitibi region. In 1943, the entire community of Roc d'Or was ordered to move to Malartic by the provincial government and the settlement was demolished. Despite a mining accident in April 1947 that killed 12 miners in an underground fire, Malartic was thriving throughout the 1950s, reaching a peak of nearly 7000 residents. But in 1965, Canadian Malartic and Malartic Goldfields closed their mines, followed by the Barnat and East Malartic mines in the 1980s. This led to rapid decline in the economy and population. In 2008 and 2009, renewed exploration by Osisko Mining revealed an untapped new gold deposit, estimated at approximately 9 million ounces, beneath the town. The company received approval from the government of Quebec to launch what would become Canada's largest ever open pit gold mine.Rh√©al S√©guin, \\"Tiny Quebec town is sitting on a gold mine\\". The Globe and Mail, July 14, 2009. The project, which will have an estimated cost of $1 billion if approved, would see most of the portion of the town lying south of Route 117, consisting of about 200 houses and several of the town's public facilities, relocated to a new housing development in the north end of town. This move was featured in season 4 of the television show Monster Moves. As of late 2009, most of the relocation work had been completed, and this, before the end of public consultations by Quebec's Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks.Osisko Mines website Government As of January 2011, the municipal government consists of mayor Andr√© Vezeau and councillors Jude Boucher, Sylvie Daigle, Martin Ferron, Daniel Magnan, Guy Morrissette, and Jean Turgeon.

In his early film appearances, he was credited as Charles Jones. Early life, military service Charles Frederick Gebhart was born on the outskirts of Vincennes, Indiana, on December 12, 1891---some sources indicate December 4, 1889, but his marriage license and military records confirm the 1891 date.Buck Jones at www.b-westerns.com In 1907 he joined the United States Army a month after his 16th birthday: his mother had signed a consent form that gave his age as 18. He was assigned to Troop G, 6th Cavalry Regiment, and was deployed to the Philippines in October 1907, where he served in combat and was wounded during the Moro Rebellion. Upon his return to the US in December 1909, he was honorably discharged at Fort McDowell, California. Jones had an affection for race cars and the racing industry and became close friends with early driver Harry Stillman. Through his association with Stillman he began working extensively as a test driver for the Marmon Motor Car Company. Yet by October 1910 he had re-enlisted in the United States Army. Because he wanted to learn to fly, he requested a transfer to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps in 1913, without knowing that only an officer could become a pilot. He received his second honorable discharge from the Army in October 1913. Cowboy, stuntman, beginning of film career Arizona Bound (1941). Following his military service he began working as a cowboy on the 101 Ranch near Bliss, Oklahoma. While attending equestrian shows he met Odille \\"Dell\\" Osborne, who rode horses professionally. The two became involved and married in 1915. Both had very little money, so the producers of a Wild West Show they were working on at the time offered to allow them to marry in an actual show performance, in public, which they accepted. While in Los Angeles, and with his wife pregnant, Jones decided to leave the cowboy life behind and get a job in the film industry. He was hired by Universal Pictures for $5 per day as a bit player and stuntman. He later worked for Canyon Pictures, then Fox Film Corporation, eventually earning $40 per week as a stuntman. With Fox his salary increased to $150 per week, and company owner William Fox decided to use him as a backup to Tom Mix. This led to his first starring role, The Last Straw, released in 1920. Stardom In 1925 Jones made three films with a very young Carole Lombard. He had more than 160 film credits to his name by this time and had joined Hoot Gibson, Tom Mix, and Ken Maynard as the top cowboy actors of the day. By 1928 he formed his own production company, but his independently-produced film The Big Hop (a non-Western) failed. He then organized a touring Wild West show, with himself as a featured attraction, but this expensive venture also failed due to the faltering economy of late 1929. With the new talking pictures replacing silent films as a national pastime, outdoor Westerns fell out of favor briefly. The major studios weren't interested in hiring Buck Jones. He signed with Columbia Pictures, then just a lowly \\"B\\" picture studio, starring in Westerns for $300 a week, a fraction of his top salary in the silent-film days. His voice--a rugged baritone--recorded well and the films were very successful, re-establishing him as a major movie name. During the 1930s he starred in Western features and serials for Columbia and Universal Pictures. His star waned in the late 1930s when singing cowboys became the rage and Jones, then in his late 40s, was uncomfortably cast in conventional leading-man roles. He rejoined Columbia in the fall of 1940, starring in the serial White Eagle (an expansion of his 1932 feature of the same name). The new serial was a hit and Jones was again re-established. His final series of Western features, co-produced by Jones and his friend Scott R. Dunlap of Monogram Pictures, featured The Rough Riders trio: Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, and Raymond Hatton. Radio In 1937 Jones starred in Hoofbeats, a 15-minute radio program syndicated via electrical transcription. The program was produced in the studios of Recordings, Inc., with Grape Nuts Flakes as sponsor. Merchandising Buck Jones lent his name and likeness to various product endorsements, including Post Grape-Nuts Flakes (his radio sponsor) and Daisy Outdoor Products. His licensing also extended to the Big Little Book series, for example: * Buck Jones and The Two Gun Kid (1937) ‚Äì Big Little Book #1404.

Author: Gaylord Du Bois Jones was also a consultant for Daisy, which issued a Daisy \\"Buck Jones\\" model pump-action air rifle. Incorporating a compass and a \\"sundial\\" into the stock, it was one of Daisy's top-end air rifles and sold well for several years. There was some confusion decades later with the release of the film A Christmas Story, due to author Jean Shepherd's erroneous recollection that the Daisy Red Ryder BB Gun had a compass and sundial in the stock; the BB gun never had them except for the two specially made for the film. Death Buck Jones was one of the 492 victims of the Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston, Massachusetts on November 28, 1942. He died two days later on November 30, at age 50. Some news reports said that he had successfully escaped but had gone back into the building to save others and was trapped. Family Buck Jones's daughter, Maxine Jones (born 1918) was married to Noah Beery, Jr. from 1940 to 1966. After her divorce to Noah Beery Jr., she married Nicholas Firfires, a Cowboy Hall of Fame Western Artist, on August 11, 1969. Maxine and Nicholas never had any children but were married until her death in 1990. References in popular media On his album When I Was a Kid, Bill Cosby has a routine called \\"Buck Jones\\", in which he talks about seeing Buck Jones movies as a kid. He says that Jones had a horse named Silver, like the Lone Ranger, and that he would chew gum to signal that he was getting angry. Cosby mentions a specific movie in which a saloon tough picks a fight by pouring redeye liquor over Jones. On \\"Merv Griffin's '60s Retrospective\\" DVD, John Wayne in 1970 states that Buck Jones is his hero. He also states that Jones went in the fire to help people. Recognition In 1997, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated In 1960, Jones was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture industry.

He died in a Paris hospital aged 76. Seen as pro-French and careful not to break his country's alliance with Morocco, he failed to make peace with the Polisario (which had reacted to Daddah's downfall by entering into a unilateral ceasefire on the assumption that Mauritania would want to withdraw peacefully from the conflict). He also failed to address racial tension between southern Mauritanian Blacks and the northern Arab Moors, discriminating heavily in favour of the latter group, of which he was himself a member. Consequently, he became increasingly isolated within the regime. On April 6, 1979, a second coup by Colonels Ahmad Ould Bouceif and Muhammad Khouna Haidallah reduced Ould Salek to a figurehead President in the replacement junta, the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN).

On 26 June 1988, the plane crashed while making a low pass over Mulhouse‚ÄìHabsheim Airport (ICAO airport code LFGB) as part of the Habsheim Air Show. Most of the crash sequence, which occurred in front of several thousand spectators, was caught on video. The cause of the crash has been the source of major controversy. This particular flight was the A320's first passenger flight (most of those on-board were journalists and raffle winners). The low-speed flyover, with landing gear down, was supposed to take place at an altitude of ; instead, the plane performed the flyover at , skimmed the treetops of the forest at the end of the runway (which had not been shown on the airport map given to the pilots) and crashed. All the passengers survived the initial impact, but a woman and two children died from smoke inhalation before they could escape. Official reports concluded that the pilots flew too low, too slow, failed to see the forest and accidentally flew into it. The captain, Michel Asseline, disputed the report and claimed an error in the fly-by-wire computer prevented him from applying thrust and pulling up. In the aftermath of the crash, there were allegations that investigators had tampered with evidence, specifically the aircraft's flight recorders (\\"black boxes\\"). This was the first fatal crash of an A320. Aircraft The accident aircraft, an Airbus A320-111, registration F-GFKC, serial number 9, first flew on 6 January 1988 and was delivered to Air France on 23 June, three days prior to its destruction. It was the third A320 delivered to Air France, the launch customer.  Flight deck crew  Captain Michel Asseline, 44, had been a pilot with Air France for almost twenty years and had the following endorsements: Caravelle; Boeing 707, 727, and 737; and Airbus A300 and A310. He was a highly distinguished pilot with 10,463 flight hours. A training captain since 1979, Asseline was appointed to head the company's A320 training subdivision at the end of 1987. As Air France's technical pilot, he had been heavily involved in test flying the A320 type and had carried out maneuvers beyond normal operational limitations. Asseline had total confidence in the aircraft's computer systems. First Officer Pierre Mazi√®res, 45, had been flying with the airline since 1969 and had been a training captain for six years. He was endorsed on the Caravelle, Boeing 707 and 737, and had qualified as an A320 captain three months before the accident. Mazi√®res had 10,853 hours of flight time.  Flight plan  At the time of the incident, only three of the new aircraft type had been delivered to Air France, and the newest one (in service for two days) had been chosen for the flyover. The aircraft was to fly from Charles de Gaulle Airport to Basel‚ÄìMulhouse Airport for a press conference. Then, sightseeing charter passengers would board and the aircraft would fly the short distance to the small Habsheim aerodrome. The captain would make a low-level fly-pass over Runway 02, climb up and turn back, and repeat the fly-pass over the same runway in the reciprocal direction (Runway 20). This would be followed by a sightseeing trip south to Mont Blanc before the passengers would be returned to Basel‚ÄìMulhouse Airport. Finally, the aircraft would return to Paris. The pilots had each had a busy weekend and did not receive the flight plan until the morning of the flight. They received no verbal details about the flyover or the aerodrome itself.  Flyover  The flight plan was that as they approached the airfield, they would extend third-stage flap, lower the landing gear, and line up for level flight at . The captain would slow the aircraft to its minimum flying speed with maximum angle of attack, disable the \\"alpha floor\\" (the function that would otherwise automatically increase engine thrust when the angle of attack reached 15¬∞) and rely on the first officer to adjust the engine thrust manually to maintain 100 feet. After the first pass, the first officer would then apply the takeoff/go-around switch (TOGA) power and climb steeply before turning back for the second pass. \\"I've done it twenty times!\\" Asseline assured his first officer. The flyover had been approved by Air France's Air Operations Directorate and Flight Safety Department, and air traffic control and Basel tower had been informed. Habsheim aerodrome was too small to be listed in the aircraft's flight computer, thereby requiring a visual approach; both pilots were also unfamiliar with the airfield when they began their descent from only from the field. This distance was too short for them to stabilise the aircraft's altitude and speed for the flyover. Additionally, the captain was expecting from the flight plan to do the pass over runway 02 ( long, paved) and was preparing for that alignment. But as the aircraft approached the field, the flight deck crew noticed that the spectators were gathered beside runway 34R ( long, grass). This last-minute deviation in the approach further distracted the crew from stabilising the aircraft's altitude and they quickly dropped to . From higher up, the forest at the end of 34R had looked like a different type of grass. But now that the aircraft was performing its flyover at only thirty feet, the crew noticed the aircraft was lower than the now-identified hazard that they were fast approaching. The cockpit voice recorder recorded the first officer's call: :First officer: \\"TOGA power! Go-around track!\\" Followed by: :Cockpit area microphone (CAM): [Increase in engine speed] :Captain: \\"Oh sh.......!\\" :CAM: [Noises of impact in the trees] :END OF TAPE The crew applied full power and Asseline attempted to climb. However, the elevators did not respond to the pilot's commands because the A320's computer system engaged its \\"alpha protection\\" mode (meant to prevent the aircraft from entering a stall). Less than five seconds later, the turbines began ingesting leaves and branches as the aircraft skimmed the tops of the trees. The combustion chambers clogged and the engines failed. The aircraft fell to the ground. Traditionally, pilots respect the inherent dangers of flying at low speeds at low altitude, and normally, a pilot would not attempt to fly an aircraft so close to stalling with the engines at flight idle (minimum thrust setting in flight). In this instance, however, the pilots involved did not hesitate to fly the aircraft below its normal minimum flying speed because the purpose of the flyover was to demonstrate that the aircraft's computer systems would ensure that lift would always be available regardless of how the pilots handled the controls. Asseline's experience of flying the aircraft type at the outer limits of its flight performance envelope may have led to overconfidence and complacency.  Crash and evacuation  During the impact, the right wing was torn off, and the spilling fuel ignited immediately. Two fire trucks at the airshow set off and an ambulance followed. Local emergency services were informed by radio communication. Inside the aircraft, many of the passengers were dazed from hitting their heads on the backs of the seats in front of them. Some passengers had difficulty unfastening their seatbelts because they were unfamiliar with the mechanism (which differs from the type used in car seatbelts). The purser went to announce instructions to the passengers but the public address system handset had been torn off. He then tried to open the left-side forward door, which was blocked by trees. The door opened partway, and the emergency escape slide began inflating while it was stuck partly inside the fuselage. The purser, a passenger, and a flight attendant (a guest from another airline) managed to push the door fully open. In the process, the purser and the passenger were thrown out of the fuselage with the slide landing on top of them. The flight attendant then began evacuating the passengers but they soon began to pile up at the bottom of the slide as their route was blocked by trees and branches. The egress of the passengers was temporarily halted while the purser and another flight attendant began clearing the branches. When the evacuation continued, the flight attendant stayed at the door, helping passengers, until she began suffering from smoke inhalation. By this time, the fire had entered the right side of the fuselage through the damaged floor section between seat rows 10 and 15. A passenger tried to open the left-side overwing exit. It would not open, which was fortunate as there was by that time a fire on the left wing. The panicking passengers now began pushing toward the front of the cabin. A flight attendant standing in the centre of the cabin at seat 12D was pushed into the aisle by a severely burnt passenger from 12F. Then, as she was helping another passenger whose clothes were on fire, she was carried forward by the surge of people rushing to escape. After the rush of people had left and the interior was fast becoming toxic, she stood at the front door and called back into the cabin. There was no reply and the thick black smoke made a visual check impossible, so she exited the fuselage. The evacuation from the rear door had been fast and smooth thanks to the instructions from the flight attendants at the rear of the aircraft. The medical team from the airshow arrived and began examining the passengers. Ten minutes after the crash, the first of the fire trucks arrived. But because of the forest, only the smaller vehicles were able to reach the wreckage. Apart from the tail section, the aircraft was consumed by fire. Of 136 people on board, three did not escape. One was a disabled boy in seat 4F who was unable to move. Another was a girl in seat 8C, who was unable to remove her seatbelt (her younger brother had removed his own seatbelt but was carried away by the rush of people before he could help his sister). The third was a woman who had reached the front door and then returned to help the girl. Thirty-four passengers required hospitalisation for injuries and burns. Both pilots received minor head injuries and also suffered from smoke inhalation and shock.  Accident investigation  The official investigation was carried out by the Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the French air accident investigation bureau, in conjunction with Air France and Airbus. Although the official investigation was written in French, the BEA released an English version on 29 November 1989. The translated version of the report can be found on the Aviation Accidents Database. =Flight recorders= The plane's flight recorders were found still attached in the unburnt tail section. The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) continued to operate for about 1.5 seconds after the initial impact. The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) continued to operate for about one second, then recorded nonsensical data for another two seconds. Interruption of the power occurred forward of the tail section‚Äîmost probably in the wheel-well area, which was heavily damaged. The CVR was read during the night of 26 June at the BEA. The transcription was later clarified with the assistance of the pilots involved. The tape speed was set using the 400 Hz frequency of the aircraft's electrical supply and then synchronised with the air traffic control recordings, which included a time track. The DFDR was read the same night by the Br√©tigny sur Orge Flight Test Centre: * 12:43:44 - the aircraft begins its descent from , initially at a rate of per minute with 'Flaps 1'. * 12:44:14 - the engine power is reduced to flight idle. Three seconds later, the undercarriage is extended. A further ten seconds later, 'Flaps 2' is selected. * 12:44:45 - 'Flaps 3' is selected as the aircraft descends through at an airspeed of 177 knots. * 12:45:06 - the aircraft descends through at an airspeed of 155 knots. * 12:45:15 - the aircraft, now at , begins a deviation to the right (maximum bank angle: 30¬∞) to line up with the grass strip 34R. * 12:45:23 - the aircraft completes the deviation at a height of and an airspeed of 141 knots. During this manoeuvre, a fluctuation in the radio altimeter height corresponds to the aircraft passing over a patch of trees (whereas before and after this fluctuation, the readings of the radio altimeter and those of the barometric altimeter match perfectly). Three seconds later, the aircraft descends through at an airspeed of 132 knots. The Captain begins to flare the aircraft (he lifts the nose 4¬∞) to level its flight. The aircraft levels off at . * 12:45:30 - nose-up attitude increases to 7¬∞. * 12:45:35 - nose-up attitude is now 15¬∞ and speed is 122 knots. TOGA power is applied. Four seconds later, the aircraft begins striking the treetops. =Aircraft and engines= Investigators found that the aircraft had been airworthy, that its weight and centre-of-gravity had been within limits, and that there was no evidence of mechanical or electronic systems failure. The flight deck crew believed that the engines had failed to respond to the application of full power. With the CFM56-5 engines, four seconds are required to go from 29% N1 (flight idle) to 67%. It then takes one second more to go from 67 to 83% N1. From the engine parameters recorded on the DFDR and spectral analysis of the engine sounds on the CVR, it was determined that five seconds after TOGA power was applied, the N1 speed of N¬∫1 engine was 83% while that of N¬∫2 engine was 84%. Spectral analysis of the engine sounds indicated that 0.6 seconds later, both engines had reached 91% (by this stage, they were starting to ingest vegetation). This response of the engines complied with their certification data. =Official report= The official report from BEA concluded that the probable cause of the accident was a combination of the following: * Very low flyover height, lower than surrounding obstacles; * Speed very slow and reducing to reach maximum possible angle of attack; * Engines speed at flight idle; and * Late application of go-around power. Furthermore, the bureau concluded that if the descent below 100 feet was not deliberate, it may have resulted from a failure by the crew to take proper account of the visual and aural information available to them regarding the elevation \\"above ground level\\" (AGL) of the aircraft. () The report further recommended that: * Passengers should be banned from all demonstration flights * Flight crews should be provided with - and ensure - proper reconnaissance of airfields * Airline company procedures should be reviewed to ensure they comply with official regulations concerning altitude =Prosecutions= Captain Asseline, First Officer Mazi√®re, two Air France officials and the president of the flying club sponsoring the air show were all charged with involuntary manslaughter. All five were found guilty. Asseline was initially sentenced to six months in prison along with twelve months of probation. The others were sentenced to probation. During the appeal process, Asseline's sentence was increased to ten months of imprisonment along with ten months of probation. Asseline walked free from the court and said he would appeal to France's highest court, the Cour de Cassation. According to French law, Asseline was required to submit himself to the prison system before his case could be taken up by the Cour de Cassation. =Alternative explanation= The television documentary series Mayday also reports claims in Season 9 Episode 3 that the plane's flight recorder might have been tampered with and indicated that four seconds had been cut from the tape; this was shown by playing back a control tower tape and comparing it to the remaining tape. Asseline argues that he attempted to apply thrust earlier than indicated in the flight recorder data. When he increased throttle to level off at 100 ft, the engines did not respond. Asseline claims that this indicated a problem with the aeroplane's fly-by-wire system rather than pilot error. After a few seconds, Asseline claims, he became worried that plane's the completely computerised throttle control had malfunctioned and responded by pulling the throttle all the way back then forward again. By that time the aircraft had touched the trees. Mayday also looks at the theory that it was the computer at fault, not the pilots. Because the aircraft's altitude had fallen below 100 ft, the plane's computers were programmed to believe it was landing and therefore they would not allow any drastic manoeuvres from either pilot. When the crew suddenly asked the plane for more power and lift, it simply ignored them. It was also claimed by the Institute of Police Forensic Evidence and Criminology, based in Switzerland, that the flight data recorders may have been switched and were not the original ones in the airplane. Airbus made a detailed rebuttal of these claims in a document published in 1991, contending that the independent investigator employed by the filmmakers made an error when synchronising the recordings based on a misunderstanding of how the \\"Radio Transmit\\" parameter on the flight data recorder functioned.  Dramatization  The episode \\"Blaming the Pilot\\" of the TV series Survival in the Sky featured the accident. The Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic TV series Mayday featured the accident and subsequent investigation in a season 9 episode titled \\"Pilot vs. Plane\\". The episode \\"Disastrous Descents\\" of the TV series Aircrash Confidential produced by WMR Productions and IMG Entertainment, featured the accident and included an interview with Captain Michel Asseline.

Biography  Marcovicci was born in Manhattan, to Helen Stuart, a singer, and Eugen Marcovicci, a physician and internist of Romanian descent. Her father was 63 when she was born and died when she was 20. In her teens she decided that she wanted to be a singer, but instead majored in drama.\\"What a beautiful thing it is to be alive!\\" by M.J. Bevans, Afternoon TV, July 1972. Pp. 32-35 & 58. In a 1972 interview, she looked back at this period without enthusiasm: Marcovicci left school and started making her way into show business as a singer, appearing on The Mike Douglas Show and The Merv Griffin Show. As an actress, she debuted in commercials and soon became better known as Dr. Betsy Chernak Taylor on the television soap opera Love is a Many Splendored Thing from 1970‚Äì1973. She appeared in the second pilot film for the television series Harry O, titled Smile Jenny, You're Dead. She was nominated for a Golden Globe award for the New Star of the Year in 1977 for the film, The Front (1976). Marcovicci had a recurring role on Hill Street Blues. She has appeared on Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Kojak, The Incredible Hulk, Magnum, P.I., Cybill, Arli$$, Taxi, Voyagers! (as Cleopatra), Baretta, Mannix, and Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers. She starred on both Trapper John, M.D. and Berrenger's. Marcovicci appeared onstage on Broadway in Ambassador. Her film roles include The Front (1976), The Concorde ... Airport '79 (1979), Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone (1983) and Jack the Bear (1993).

A very special 60th Birthday concert followed in May 2009 at Town Hall in NYC, celebrating Andrea‚Äôs contribution to the American Songbook. To commemorate this event her personal record label, Andreasong Recordings, Inc., released a compilation CD titled As Time Goes By: The Best of Andrea Marcovicci, her 17th album and/or CD. At the end of 2011, Marcovicci celebrated her 25th season at the Oak Room with \\"No Strings\\", a collection of songs about travel. Her closing performance of \\"No Strings\\" was the final cabaret event at the Oak Room, as the Algonquin's new owner decided to turn the space into a lounge for \\"preferred\\" customers. Marcovicci celebrated her 65th birthday, November 18, 2013, by playing two shows at Joe's Pub, part of the Public Theater.  Awards  She is the recipient of several awards and honors including the Mabel Mercer Foundation‚Äôs 2007 Mabel Award and three Lifetime Achievement Awards‚Äîhonored by the Manhattan Association of Cabarets and Clubs, the Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation, and by a Bob Harrington Backstage Bistro Award. In recognition of her accomplishments in the arts, Andrea has received honorary degrees from Trinity College in Hartford, CT and the Memphis College of Art.

The band takes their name from the Videotape format war of the 1970s and 1980s, where Sony's Beta format competed with JVC's VHS. Overview Their self-released debut EP Le Funk found some success on the charts, but the band became better known in the wake of the 2004 album Night on Fire. After two and half years of touring, VHS or Beta recorded 2007's Bring on the Comets in Asheville, North Carolina, marking a slight change in direction towards a more straightforward pop sound, achieved without sacrificing their trademark dance sensibility. Later singles \\"Feel It When You Know\\" (2009) and \\"All Summer in a Day\\" (2010) were issued on their own Chromosome Records label. The band's third album Diamonds and Death was released in September 2011 by Krian Music Group, followed by a dub version of the album in 2012. The band's core members are guitarist/vocalist Craig Pfunder and bassist Mark Palgy. Guitarist Zeke Buck and drummer Mark Guidry, both founding members, left the band in 2006 and 2010, respectively. Guitarists Mike McGill and Eric Rodgers, keyboardists Chea Beckley and Jerome Miller, and drummers Jim Orso and Chris Berry have all toured and/or recorded with the band. Palgy and Pfunder were in early 1990s band Raze with former Elliott and current Wax Fang drummer Kevin Ratterman. In 2005, VHS or Beta opened for Duran Duran on a leg of the latter's 2005 North American tour. In popular culture The band's song \\"Night on Fire\\" was featured in Grandma's Boy and on The O.C., in addition to Mack Dawg Production's 2006 Follow Me Around. It was also used as part of the soundtrack for the videogame MLB 06: The Show. \\"Burn It All Down\\" was featured on the soundtrack for the 2009 documentary The September Issue.

In 1999, the founders of Play Along (among them Charlie Emby, Jay Foreman, and Larry Geller) chose the Britney Spears Doll line as the first licensing venture with their new company. The choice proved successful and was followed by other celebrity dolls including Aaron Carter, Venus Williams, Serena Williams and Mandy Moore. In 2001 Play Along partnered with toy design studio Art Asylum for production of the studio's toys. Then, in 2002, Play Along decided to bring back one of the plush doll lines of the 1980s, the Care Bears. This brand, for which Play Along was awarded \\"License of the Year 2002\\" by the Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association (LIMA). As the company's toy lines continued to grow, so did the Play Along team, having grown from a staff of five into a company with more than 100 employees, both in the U.S. and Hong Kong, producing toys for multiple brands including the Care Bears, The Dog and Friends, The Lord of the Rings: Armies of Middle-earth, The Cat in the Hat, Teletubbies, Curly Q's, Doodle Bear, Sky Dancers and the Cabbage Patch Kids. The success of the company and its licenses made it an attractive target for others, with Jakks Pacific buying the privately owned company in 2004, Play Along now run as a division within Jakks. In Fall of 2007, Play Along released dolls and playsets based on Disney Channel TV series, Hannah Montana, and movie, the Cheetah Girls. The lines were very popular during the Christmas season. As of Fall 2008, more products have been added onto the Hannah Montana line, including the 2008 Holiday Popstar doll and Malibu Beach House playset; also, dolls based on the Disney Channel movie, Camp Rock, were launched.

It is the episcopal seat of the ≈†ibenik diocese. It is also the most important architectural monument of the Renaissance in the entire country. Since 2000, the cathedral has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List. It is often known as \\"St. Jacob's\\", because Croatian, like many other languages, uses the same name for both \\"James\\" and \\"Jacob\\". It is dedicated to Saint James the Greater. Construction =First masters= The building of the church was initiated in 1402, though plans on its construction had already begun in 1298, when ≈†ibenik became a municipality. The actual work to transform the older Romanesque cathedral began in 1431. Built entirely of stone (limestone from a nearby stone quarry and marble from the island of Braƒç), it was completed in three phases, from 1433 to 1441, when the Grand City Council entrusted the work to local and Italian masters Francesco di Giacomo, Lorenzo Pincino, Pier Paolo Bussato, Bonino da Milano, and Giorgio da Sebenico (Juraj Dalmatinac) and to Croatian ones Andrija Budƒçiƒá and Grubi≈° ≈†lafƒçiƒá. =Giorgio da Sebenico= Initially, it was conceived as a simple church. In the period between 1441 and 1473 the construction was directed by Giorgio, who was invited to come from Venice as the investors were not satisfied with the beginning of the work. His first contract in 1441 was concluded for a period of 6 years to build just a simple church, but another contract of 10 years followed the first one in 1446. The investors considered that too little for the money spent, so Giorgio altered the plan: he enlarged the cathedral with a side nave and apses, so that the ground plan of the cathedral was in the shape of a cross, and prepared it for the dome, built the presbytery, sanctuary and his masterpiece, the baptistery. With tremendous skill, Giorgio da Sebenico combined architectural and decorative elements to create a unified entity. Giorgio combined several artistic elements in the ground plan: the Lion Gate was inspired by the abbey of San Leonardo di Siponto, the central nave by Trogir cathedral, an eagle over the main entrance as the John the Evangelist's symbol, the San Marco cathedral in Venice as one side nave and the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople as the other side nave. He constructed the western main portal, the northern portal (The Lion Gate) and the first chapel. The western main portal was decorated by Bonino da Milano, first master mason, with statues of Christ and the twelve apostles. The current bronze door was created in 1967 by the ≈†ibenik sculptor Grga Antunac. The motif of the northern portal, called the Lion Gate, are Adam and Eve standing on two lions, which is also seen at the Trogir Cathedral, but here Adam and Eve are on columns over the lions. These statues, together with St. Jacob and St. Peter, are the work of Juraj Dalmatinac, as he is called in Croatia. The statue of Eve draws the attention of onlookers as she has a belly button, while, according to the Bible, she was conceived from a rib of Adam. The bronze doors were made in 1967 by the ≈†ibenik sculptor Grga Antunac. The coats of arms of two bishops and of the procurator of then-church of St. Saviour in ≈†ibenik were placed over the Lion Gate. The Lion Gate The two Renaissance putti at the northern end of the cathedral bear an inscription of the consecration in 1443 of the cathedral. Under their feet is his only remaining signature: \\"Hoc opus cuvarum fecit magister Georgius Matthei Dalmaticus\\". He also designed the baptistery in the 1440s. He built it next to the southern apse in the form of a quatrefoil. The upper part is covered with lacelike sculptures, the first Renaissance sculptural work in Croatia. The flat niches are vaulted with corrugated seashells of St. James. On the baldachins between them hold two statues: King David and the prophet Simon. The vault ribs end in the keystone representing the Father God, surrounded by angels and the dove (symbol of the Holy Ghost). The baptismal font, made from reddish breccias, is supported by three angels. Two Renaissance putti The apses are decorated on the outside with various sculptural decorations, including 74 small Renaissance portraits immortalising important contemporaries and figures who had for some reason particularly impressed the architect or that he deemed to tight to help foot the bill for the cathedral's construction.Robin McKelvie, Jenny McKelvie, Croatia: Globetrotter Travel Guide, pg. 103, New Holland Publishers Ltd (2006), Some of these heads on the facade have a damaged nose, probably due to vandalism. Indeed, until Justinian II this was the expression to discredit the reputation of someone, and so it was necessary that this individual remained anonymous. Giorgio worked probably on the cathedral up to his death in 1475 and certainly until 1473.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pgs. 198/200, Zagreb (1999), =Niccol√≤ di Giovanni Fiorentino= Between 1475 and 1505 the work was overseen by Tuscan master Niccol√≤ di Giovanni Fiorentino (Nicola Firentinac), from the Donatello school of sculpture who developed as a sculptor and builder in Dalmatia. He continued the building in the Tuscan Renaissance style, completing the extensive galleries, building the vault in the central nave, the outer sculptures of St. Michael, St. James and St. Mark. The barrel roof is made from a line of enormous stone slabs and considered a marvel of construction at the time,Jonathan Bousfield, The Rough Guide to Croatia, pg. 278, Rough Guides (2003), and the upper fa√ßade. He also built the triforias (parallel galleries) and worked on the presbytery and sanctuary. Dome of the cathedral and sculpture of St. Michael Although the dome of ≈†ibenik Cathedral was built after the dome in Florence, Niccol√≤ di Giovanni Fiorentino used an octagonal drum in its construction, before Bramante and Michelangelo, in its original function as the transition from the square base to the circular dome. The execution of the cupola is considered one of the best achievements of Renaissance architecture. Inside the Cathedral Inside the cathedral there are four large, evenly matched columns on which the dome rests. The builder decorated the capitals and came to arrangements with the nobles who were to finance the building of chapels, on condition that they would be free to choose their own builders. In the first chapel on the right-side, there is the sarcophagus of the bishop, humanist and writer Juraj ≈†i≈ægoriƒá (1420-1509) which is the work of Andrija Ale≈°i based on a design by Juraj Dalmatinac. Ale≈°i also created the statue of St. Elijah which stands behind the bishop's throne. On the left-hand side is the sarcophagus of Bishop Ivan ≈†tafiliƒç, during whose life the cathedral was completed. Beneath the choir there are the graves of two bishops, with reliefs: on the right Bishop Calegari and on the left, Bishop Spingarola. The latter is the work of the local artist Antun Noguloviƒç. View of the High altar Opposite the famous Altar of the Holy Cross (Sveti Kri≈æ) made by Juraj ƒåulinoviƒç (Giorgio Schiavone) is buried (1433 or 1446-1505). On the altar there is a painting by Felipe Zaniberti. Amongst other altars to the left of the entrance is the Altar of the Holy Three Kings with a painting by Bernardo Rizzardi, according to the ground plan of Juraj Dalmatinac (see above). The fragments of the mosaic of the Holy Three Kings in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice are now in the Museo Marciano in Venice. The sides of the altar are decorated with reliefs of two angels holding the scroll of Nikola Firentinac, set into shell-shaped niches. The Cathedral Treasury includes works by the Renaissance master Horacije Fortezza of ≈†ibenik (1530-1596), an exceptional goldsmith and miniaturist. After Fiorentino died in 1505, the construction was finally completed in 1536 by two other craftsmen, Bartolmeo of Mestra and his son Jacob, completely following Nicholas' instructions. The cathedral officially became consecrated in 1555 after a multitude of Venetian and local craftsmen had worked on it, in Gothic style.  Subsequent work  As Sibenik cathedral has no bell-tower, a tower on the adjoining city walls served this purpose until its demolition at the end of 19th century. Most of the restoration was done between 1850 and 1860. and subsequently between 1992 and 1997. The dome of the church was heavily damaged by the JNA-supported Serb forces during the shelling of ≈†ibenik in September 1991. Within years it was quickly repaired with no damage visible.  In popular culture  *Since the interior of Sibenik cathedral was extensively 3D recorded for documentation and restoration purposes, its 3D model is often used for graphic and especially video modelling purposes. *The Cathedral of St. James in ≈†ibenik served as a backdrop for the Iron Bank in the ninth episode of the fifth season of Game of Thrones. ≈†ibenik portrayed Braavos, the city where the Iron Bank is located.

Early years His family moved to Poulsbo, Washington, a Scandinavian town on the Kitsap Peninsula, where he pitched for North Kitsap High School. He helped lead the North Kitsap Vikings to the 1988 state championship. College career Sele was drafted out of high school in the 37th round by the Minnesota Twins, but he chose to attend Washington State University where he played college baseball for the Cougars and head coach Bobo Brayton. Another incoming freshman was catcher Scott Hatteberg. During Sele and Hatteberg's three years at Washington State, they won three conference titles. In Sele's sophomore year, 1990, the Cougars ended a surprising season ranked 18th in the nation. Sele won his first seven decisions and finished at 12-3 with 2.22 ERA. He was named a third-team All- American by Baseball America. In the summer of 1990, Sele pitched for Team USA and, in one game, shut out the Cuba on three hits and eight strikeouts. Baseball career =Boston Red Sox= Sele was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the first-round (#23 overall) of the 1991 Major League Baseball draft. He had a team-best 4 complete games at Winter Haven and also pitched in the Florida Instructional League. He was a co-winner of the Tony Latham Memorial Award for player with the most enthusiasm. Sele advanced quickly through the Red Sox farm system, with stops at Lynchburg and New Britain in 1992. Sele began his third pro season with Triple-A Pawtucket and pitched a one-hit 7-inning shutout in his first Triple-A start on April 10 at Columbus and was 4-0, 1.98 in final 6 starts. He was purchased from Pawtucket on June 22, . Sele defeated Minnesota, 3-1 in his major league debut on June 23 at Fenway Park (7 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 0 ER). He struck out future Hall of Fame member Dave Winfield for his first major league strikeout. Sele was 6-0, 2.72 (15 ER/49.2 IP) in his first 8 MLB starts. He was the third Red Sox rookie to ever win as many as his first 6 decisions. This streak ended on August 12 against the New York Yankees. He had 7 consecutive no decisions, August 22-September 22, despite a 2.38 ERA in that span, and fanned 11 on September 28 against the Detroit Tigers. He allowed 3 or fewer earned runs in all 18 starts and held opponents to a .237 batting average (.229 vs. left-handers). Despite making only 18 starts, he was selected as the AL Rookie Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News and the Red Sox Rookie of the Year. He finished 3rd in BBWAA AL Rookie of the Year voting and was named to Major League Rookie All-Star team by Baseball Digest and also named International League pitcher of the year and the starting pitcher on the IL's post-season all-star team by Baseball America. On September 6, 1993 while pitching against the White Sox in Chicago, Sele was involved in one of baseball's more memorable fights. After two consecutive inside pitches, George Bell charged the mound. Sele, seeming to have a plan, did not move until Bell was feet from him, about to throw a punch. At the last second, Sele ducked to his left as Bell threw the punch and the burly Mo Vaughn, having rushed to the mound from first base, ran into Bell. Bell flipped backwards, crashing to the ground as both of the benches emptied and the teams made their way to the mound . In , Sele finished 2nd on the Red Sox staff in starts, complete games, innings, and strikeouts and tied for 2nd in wins. He went 5-1, 2.29 in 1st 8 starts through May 18 before going 3-6, 4.79 in final 14 outings despite allowing 3 or fewer earned runs in 8 of final 14 games. His complete games came in consecutive starts, May 11 against Milwaukee and May 18 in Baltimore. Sele was the Opening Day starter in , April 26 against Minnesota, and worked 5 scoreless innings in a 9-0 victory. He made just six starts, going 3-1, 3.06 and allowing right-handed batters to hit just .194 (13-67). He experienced soreness in his right arm after start on May 23 at Seattle and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 2 (retroactive to May 24). He made 2 rehab starts each at Sarasota, Trenton, and Pawtucket from June 21-August 22, going 0-1, 3.60 (20.0 IP, 8 ER) but continued to experience soreness and was moved to the 60-day disabled list for the remainder of the season on August 31. In , Sele ranked fourth on the Boston staff in starts, innings, strikeouts, and wins. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 16 (retroactive to August 14) with a strained muscle in his left rib cage and made one start on rehab assignment on August 26 for Pawtucket before being activated on September 1. Sele led the Red Sox in in wins and starts while ranking third in innings and strikeouts. He was 4-1, 3.72 in his first 7 starts through May and 4-1, 3.93 in a span of 5 outings from June 12 to July 3. He held right-handed batters to a .224 average, 7th best among AL starters, and tied his then-career high with 11 strikeouts on July 12 against Toronto. He was among the league leaders in hit batters (2nd, 15), walks (10th), and runs allowed (T10th) and allowed the most baserunners per 9 innings among AL starters (14.8). =Texas Rangers= Sele was traded to the Texas Rangers with Mark Bradenburg and Bill Haselman on November 6, 1997, for Damon Buford and Jim Leyritz. Sele tied for 4th in the AL with a career- high 19 wins in , matching the 4th most in Rangers' history. He also tied for 5th in the league with 2 shutouts, set career highs for complete games, shutouts and innings pitched and led the majors with 13 victories at home. His first 2 career complete game shutouts came in a span of 3 starts, a 3-hitter on April 9 in Chicago and a 4-hitter on April 21 against Tampa Bay, the 2 lowest-hit complete games of his big league career. He won his first 5 starts of the season, going 5-0, 2.00 (36.0 IP, 8 ER) through April 26. This streak ended with a loss in Boston on May 1, snapping an overall 6-game winning streak over 2 seasons. The streak matched his career high. He was the majors' first 8-game (May 23) and 11-game (June 23) winner, as well as the first pitcher in the AL with 9 (June 8), 10 (June 18), and 12 (July 4) victories. He was 12-5, 4.04 in 18 starts in the 1st half to earn his first selection to the AL All-Star team. However, he did not see action in the July 7 game at Colorado. Beginning August 19, he was 6-1, 2.41 in his final 8 games and had a string of 13.2 straight scoreless innings over 2 starts on September 9 and 14. He fanned 7.07 batters every 9 innings, the 8th best ratio among AL qualifiers, and did not issue a homer in his last 8 regular season starts and 54 innings overall after Chuck Knoblauch's 5th inning blast on August 14 in New York. Sele followed up his 19 win season with an 18 win season, finishing 18-9 in his last season with the Rangers. He finished fifth in Cy Young voting. =Seattle Mariners= Sele agreed to a free agent contract with the Baltimore Orioles, but they backed out of the deal due to issues noticed during his physical examination.http://lubbockonline.com/stories/011100/pro_011100021.shtml#.Vs4-DvkrLIU Sele instead signed with the Seattle Mariners. He became the first Mariners right-hander to make the All-Star team, earning his second All-Star appearance. He was among the AL leaders in wins, starts and innings pitched and won at least 17 games for the third consecutive season. He allowed just 2 hits, both singles, in 14-0 win May 15 vs. Minnesota, facing just 25 batters in 7.0 innings pitched. He allowed just 1 unearned run and no extra-base hits in 6-2 win vs. Colorado June 5. He earned win #10 on July 2 in Texas, becoming the first Mariner right-hander with 10 wins before the All-Star break. He lost his first three starts of the second half, going 0-3, 7.50 (18.0 IP, 15 ER). He earned win #11 July 30 vs. Toronto, giving up six hits and four earned runs in 6 innings, snapping a three-game losing skid. He retired 12 of the first 15 batters faced for his 16th win September 20 at Tampa Bay. Despite getting the no-decision, helped Seattle clinch the Wild Card, pitching 5.2 innings and scattering six hits for two earned runs October 1 at Anaheim. In his second season as a Mariner, Sele had his best statistical season of his career. He finished 15-5 with career bests in ERA (3.60), Innings (215) and WHIP (1.24). =Anaheim Angels= Sele signed a contract with the Anaheim Angels and in his first season (2002) he finished with an 8-9 record in 27 starts over 160 innings. The Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in the World Series that year. In , he began his 13th pro season and second with the Angels on 15-day disabled list. Sele underwent surgery (October 18, ) to repair partial tear of the supraspinatus muscle and labrum in his right rotator cuff (performed by Angels Medical Director Dr. Lewis Yocum). He was placed on the disabled list March 26 due to recovery from surgery and activated May 9. Sele set a career high in ERA and career lows in starts and strikeouts (53). His seven wins equaled his fewest in his major league career (1996; based on 25-or-more starts), had more walks (58) than strikeouts for first time as professional, tied for club lead with 12 hit batters (Ram√≥n Ortiz), which tied for second in AL, and tied Angels' season high six hits allowed in an inning, September 2 at Minnesota. He had nine runs allowed in the same game equaling his career high (May 16, 1999, vs. Baltimore; 2.1 IP), pitched into the seventh inning in one of 25 starts, won season-best three straight decisions, June 29-July 10, lost three straight decisions twice, and his longest outing was seven innings pitched, June 7 at Florida (9-2 win). Sele opened the season in the bullpen for the first time in his ML career. His appearance April 9 at Texas marked just the second relief appearance of his career (April 18, 2001, vs. Texas). After allowing five earned runs in 3.1 IP of his first relief outing of the season, he allowed just one earned run over his next three relief outings (7.0 IP). Sele returned to the starting rotation on May 1 and proceeded to go 4-0 with a 2.10 ERA (34.1 IP, 8 ER) in six starts. He became the first Angel in club history to open a season with a 7-0 record (19 games, 15 starts). He left the June 10 game vs. Milwaukee after six innings due to right shoulder fatigue and was placed on the 15-day disabled list from June 11-June 26 with right shoulder fatigue. =Return to Seattle= He made 21 starts in for Seattle and went 6-12 with a 5.66 ERA in 21 starts. He won back-to-back starts on May 22 and 28, allowing one earned run in 15.2 innings. He was signed to a minor league contract with Texas on August 6 and made two starts for Triple-A Oklahoma, going 1-1. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Sele was a pleasant surprise for the 2006 NL Wild Card Champions. He pitched in 28 games, 15 of which were starts, while pitching a total of 103.3 innings. He won 8 games and had an ERA of 4.53. He was the winning pitcher of the September 18 game in which the Dodgers hit 4 consecutive home runs and won in extra innings on Nomar Garciaparra's walk-off home run. =New York Mets= On January 25, 2007, Sele signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets, and received a non-roster invitation to spring training. On March 29, 2007, the Mets purchased Sele's contract and placed him the 25-man roster. Sele served as the long man from the bullpen for the team. Post-playing career On October 31, 2008, the Los Angeles Dodgers named Sele their minor league pitching instructor for the 2009 season. In 2012 the Dodgers named him as a Special Assistant, Player Personnel. After the 2017 season, he left the Dodgers organization to become a special assignment scout for the Miami Marlins. Sele received only one vote in the 2013 Baseball Hall of Fame voting and will no longer appear on the ballot.

A hooker, he was also a former captain of the France national team. Early life Iba√±ez was born in Saugnac-et-Cambran, Landes. He began his playing career in his home town of Dax before moving to Perpignan and Castres. Club career After his first international retirement following the 2003 World Cup, he moved to Saracens. In 2005 he moved to Wasps on a two- year deal. In the first match of the following season, he was made captain as replacement for the injured Lawrence Dallaglio. He was also heavily responsible for London Wasps' win in the 2007 Heineken Cup final, playing in the same side as fellow Six Nations captain Phil Vickery. Wasps beat long-time rivals Leicester at Twickenham and Ibanez scored one of Wasps's tries. The following season he also started as Wasps won the 2007‚Äì08 Premiership Final in former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio's last match. Iba√±ez continued to play for Wasps until suffering a series of what ultimately proved to be career-ending head injuries in late 2008. On 28 February 2008, Wasps announced that Iba√±ez and the club had agreed on a contract extension that would see him serve as a specialist forwards coach in the London Wasps Academy, as well as play for the senior side, during the 2008‚Äì09 season. On 5 August 2008 Ibanez was named as successor to Lawrence Dallaglio to take over the captaincy at London Wasps On his 36th birthday, 17 February 2009, Ibanez announced his retirement from all rugby as a player. He suffered a concussion in a match against Worcester Warriors in September 2008, and suffered further head injuries in two later games. Whilst completing a two-month rest period, he continued to suffer symptoms from his injuries during training sessions, and ended his playing career on medical advice. International career He made his debut against Wales in 1996 and went on to win 72 caps for his country, including 27 as captain, before his first retirement from international rugby in 2003. He won successive Grand Slams with France in 1997 and 1998 and led them to the World Cup Final in 1999. Iba√±ez retired from international rugby after the 2003 World Cup, but French coach Bernard Laporte made it one of his priorities to bring him back into the fold, especially after fellow hooker William Servat was ruled out of the autumn schedule with a neck injury. He added 26 more France Test caps, 15 of them as captain, before announcing his second and final international retirement in 2008. Iba√±ez served as France captain for the 2007 Six Nations, taking over from the injured Fabien Pelous for France's first two matches, and then being named captain for the remainder of the competition after Pelous' injury ruled him out of France's remaining three fixtures. Also in the 2007 Six Nations Iba√±ez became the first player to score a try in the 82,300 capacity Croke Park after the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) modified their Rule 42 in 2005 which banned foreign sports from being played in Croke Park. Under the modified rule both the Ireland national rugby union team and Republic of Ireland national football team were allowed to play their home games in Croke Park while renovations were carried out on Lansdowne Road (reopened as the Aviva Stadium). After Pelous' injury troubles continued, Iba√±ez was named as France captain for the 2007 World Cup, with Pelous as his unofficial vice-captain. France went on to finish fourth in the 2007 World Cup. Iba√±ez announced his second retirement from Test rugby on 10 January 2008. Media work Ibanez has published two books and is also a regular guest in the BBC 6 nations studio. He also comments the Six Nations for the French channel France 2. Personal life In his spare time he enjoys fly-fishing and extreme sports like rock climbing and kayaking.

His solution models the gravitational field outside an uncharged rotating massive object, including a rotating black hole.Cracking the Einstein Code by Fulvio Melia, 2009 His solution to Einstein's equations predicted spinning black holes before they were discovered.Martin Rees, Just Six Numbers ‚Äì The Deep Forces that Shape the Universe, Phoenix, 1999, , page 41Review of Cracking the Einstein Code Early life and education Kerr was born in 1934 in Kurow, New Zealand. He was born into a dysfunctional family, and his mother was forced to leave when he was three. When his father went to war, he was sent to a farm. After his father's return from war, they moved to Christchurch. He got into St Andrew's College, a private school, as his father had served under a former headmaster. Kerr's mathematical talent was first recognised while he was still a high school student at St Andrew's College. Although there was no maths teacher there at the time he was able in 1951 to go straight into third year Mathematics at the Canterbury University College of the University of New Zealand, the precursor to the University of Canterbury. Their regulations did not permit him to graduate until 1954 and so it was not until September 1955 that he moved to the University of Cambridge, where he earned his PhD in 1959. His dissertation concerned the equations of motion in general relativity. Career and research After a stint as a postdoctoral researcher at Syracuse University, where Einstein's collaborator Peter Bergmann was professor,APS site: Peter Bergmann receives Einstein prizeObituary of Peter Bergmann he spent some time working for the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Kerr speculated that the \\"main reason why the US Air Force had created a General Relativity section was probably to show the U.S. Navy that they could also do pure research.\\" =Work at Texas and Canterbury= In 1962 Kerr joined Alfred Schild and his Relativity Group at the University of Texas at Austin. As Kerr wrote in 2009: :By the summer of 1963, Maarten Schmidt at Caltech had shown that certain starlike objects (now called quasars) were actually distant objects emitting enormous amounts of energy. Nobody understood how they could be so bright. In an effort to unravel this mystery, several hundred astronomers, astrophysicists, and general relativists gathered for a conference in Dallas, held in early December that year. This would be the First (of what since then has become the biennial) Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics.Roy Kerr (2009) Afterword, page 125 of Cracking the Einstein Code by Fulvio Melia Kerr presented to the Symposium his solution to the Einstein field equations.Kerr, R.P., 1963, Physical Review Letters, 11, 237. In 1965, with Alfred Schild, he introduced the concept of Kerr-Schild perturbations and developed the Kerr- Newman metric. During his time in Texas, Kerr supervised four PhD students. In 1971, Kerr returned to the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. Kerr retired from his position as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Canterbury in 1993 after having been there for twenty-two years, including ten years as the head of the Mathematics department. =Awards and honours= * Hector Medal (1982) \\"for his work in theoretical physics. ... an exact solution of Einstein's equations of general relativity, ...\\" * Hughes Medal (1984) \\"for his distinguished work on relativity, especially for his discovery of the so-called Kerr Black Hole, which has been very influential.\\" * Rutherford Medal (1993) \\"For his outstanding discoveries in the extra- terrestrial world of black holes.\\" * Marcel Grossmann Award (2006) \\"for his fundamental contribution to Einstein's theory of general relativity: ...\\" * Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to astrophysics (2011) * Albert Einstein Medal (2013) \\"for his 1963 discovery of a solution to Einstein's gravitational field equations.\\" * Crafoord Prize (2016) \\"for fundamental work on rotating black holes and their astrophysical consequences.\\" * Canterbury Distinguished Professor (2016) In 2008 Kerr was appointed to the Yevgeny Lifshitz ICRANet Chair in Pescara, Italy.

Early life Hundley grew up in Illinois where his father, Randy, was a catcher for the Chicago Cubs. Despite this, he grew up a fan of the New York Mets. Hundley attended William Fremd High School in Palatine, Illinois where he played on the school baseball and hockey teams. As a switch-hitting junior, he led his team in runs batted in and had a batting average of .357. Professional career The Mets selected Hundley in the second round of the 1987 MLB draft. Hundley made his major league debut with the New York Mets on May 18, 1990 when he was 20 years old. He came up with great fanfare but did not hit very well in his first few years in the Major Leagues. Hundley described himself as overmatched early in his career. After a few years and a few injuries, his hitting increasingly improved to match his defense. He began to break out in the strike-shortened 1994 season and that breakout continued into the following seasons. In 1996, Hundley hit 41 home runs, setting the Mets single-season home run record (previously set by Darryl Strawberry in 1988) and the single-season record for catchers (previously set by Roy Campanella in 1953). Carlos Beltr√°n subsequently tied the team record in 2006 and Pete Alonso broke it in 2019. Javy L√≥pez broke the positional record in 2003. Hundley was named to the National League All-Star team for the first time in 1996 and then again 1997. He also received votes for the Most Valuable Player Award in 1996. The Mets' acquisition of perennial All-Star Mike Piazza in May 1998 combined with a career-threatening elbow injury brought his tenure with the Mets to a close. With Piazza on the roster, the Mets moved Hundley to left field where he had little success. He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 1, 1998 in a three-team trade that brought Armando Ben√≠tez and Roger Cede√±o to the Mets while also sending fellow catcher Charles Johnson to the Baltimore Orioles. Rob Neyer later summarized the trajectory of Hundley's tenure with the Mets as \\"overmatched, dangerous, hurt, Piazza, gone.\\" While playing for the Dodgers in 2000, Hundley became the first visiting player to hit a home run into McCovey Cove at what was then Pacific Bell Park. After two seasons in Los Angeles, Hundley signed with the Chicago Cubs for four years and $23.5 million in December 2000. Hundley spent two seasons in Chicago where he was both unproductive on the field and unpopular with fans. Only two years into his contract, he was traded back to Los Angeles with Chad Hermansen for Eric Karros and Mark Grudzielanek before the 2003 season. His final season came in 2003. Despite not playing in 2004, he was paid $7 million. In 2007, the Mitchell Report revealed that Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski sold Deca-Durabolin to Hundley prior to his 1996 record-breaking season. Personal life , Hundley and his wife, Tiffany, had two children and his wife was eight months pregnant with a third. By August 2005, he and Tiffany were divorced. In August 2005, Hundley was arrested and charged in Lake County, Illinois with driving under the influence and endangering the life and health of children after being pulled over in his Hummer H2 with his two daughters in the backseat and failing field sobriety tests. Hundley attributed his condition to the prescription painkiller Vicodin. Hundley married Jodi A. Contreras on March 2, 2006 in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. In May 2012, Hundley sold his six-bedroom Glenview, Illinois home for $1.4 million, $200,000 less than his 2004 purchase price.

They are alleged to be a chronicle of the Dacians, but are considered by most scholars to be modern forgeries. The plates were written in the Greek alphabet with a few other character additions. History The origin of the Sinaia lead plates is obscure. The first known mention of them was when the 200 lead plates were discovered in the warehouse of the Bucharest Museum of Antiquities, Romania, in the 19th century. Of the 200 pieces originally in the collection of plates, only 35 are known to remain today, but there are some photos of some of the rest.Petan, Aurora, A possible Dacian royal archive on lead plates, Antiquity Journal, Vol 79 No 303, March 2005 (part of Antiquity's non-peer reviewed \\"Project gallery\\" When discovered they were ignored and considered to be forgeries because they appeared new, with no traces of corrosion. They were not considered valuable enough to be evacuated with the rest of the Romanian Treasure to Russia in 1916. However, some renewed interest in the plates among non-scholars has been shown more than a century later, following the publication of a report about them by engineer Dan Romalo in 2003. According to \\"an oral tradition\\", the lead plates are in fact copies made at the Nail Factory of Sinaia in 1875 from the originals, which were allegedly made of gold, and they were kept for a while at the Sinaia Monastery. Allegedly, the gold was used either in the building of Pele≈ü Castle, or the plates were part of the Romanian Treasure which was never returned by Russia after World War I.Dumitru Manolache, ‚ÄûTezaur dacic de la Sinaia - legendƒÉ sau adevƒÉr ocultat?‚Äù Editura Dacica, Bucure≈üti, 2006 An analysis made at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Bucharest concluded that the composition of the plates is very similar to printing lead manufactured in the 19th century. Description Most of the plates are roughly rectangular, with the exception of one round plate. They have dimensions between 93mm x 98mm and 354mm x 255mm. Most are written using scriptio continua in the Greek alphabet, with a few additional signs; the text includes \\"V\\" from the Latin alphabet and signs for palatal \\"c\\" and \\"g\\" resembling those of the Cyrillic script. They also include text written in some unknown scripts that do not resemble any known written alphabet. In addition to the text, the plates also contain many complex illustrations, including those of armies, kings, cities, temples and buildings. Language The language appears to have some Indo- European traits, but it has nothing in common with what linguists expect to be Dacian language, as no correlation with the Romanian language substrate can be found. Also, unlike any known Indo-European language, it appears to have almost no inflections, nor declensions. In addition, almost all nouns end in \\"-o\\", including names which had other endings in Latin and Greek, e.g. Boerobiseto, Dacibalo, Napoko and Sarmigetuzo. There are some words borrowed from Greek (basileo from basileus, chiliarcho, from chiliarchos) and Latin, but some important words such as the alleged words for \\"king\\" (mato) and \\"priest\\" (kotopolo) do not appear to have any known Indo-European cognates. Debate and author The scholarly consensus is that they are modern forgeries.Dan Dana, Zalmoxis de la Herodot la Mircea Eliade, Polirom, Bucure≈üti, 2008, p. 384 According to the director of the Institute of Archaeology, Alexandru Vulpe, it is obvious they were made in 19th century and this was the opinion of both Vasile P√¢rvan and the archaeologists who studied them after him, some believing they were created by Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, who is known to have made other forgeries as well.Din tainele istoriei - Misterul tablitelor de plumb, Formula As, n. 649; 2005 According to Vulpe, the tablets include only what was known before 1900, for example, it uses the spelling \\"Comidava\\" for a Dacian town, although now it is known that the correct spelling is \\"Cumidava\\", as found in 1942 in an honorific inscription dedicated to Julia Mamaea.Mihail Macrea, \\"Cumidava\\" in AISC 4, 1941-1943, pp. 234-261  See also  *TƒÉrtƒÉria tablets *Gradeshnitsa tablets References  Bibliography  *Dumitru Manolache, Tezaurul dacic de la Sinaia - legendƒÉ sau adevƒÉr ocultat?, Editura Dacica, 2006 * Bucurescu, Adrian, Tainele tƒÉbli»õelor de la Sinaia, Editura Arhetip, 2005 * Romalo, Dan, Cronica apocrifƒÉ pe plƒÉci de plumb?, Arvin Press, Bucure»ôti, 2003 * Romalo, Dan, Cronica getƒÉ apocrifƒÉ pe plƒÉci de plumb, Editura Alcor, Bucure»ôti, 2005 * Velcescu, Cornelia, Inscrip»õii rupestre din Mun»õii Carpa»õi, Editura MIRACOL, Bure»ôti, 2002 * Horia Turcanu (Formula AS): ‚ÄûMisterul tƒÉbli»õelor de plumb‚Äù * Academia Republicii Populare Rom√Æne, Documente privind istoria Rom√Æniei: Introducere, 1956 * Emil V√Ærtosu, Paleografia rom√¢no-chirilicƒÉ, Ed. »òtiin»õificƒÉ, 1968 * Horace Gray Lunt, Old Church Slavonic Grammar, Walter de Gruyter, 2001 * Isaac Taylor, History of the Alphabet: Aryan Alphabets, Kessinger Publishing, 2003 (1899) * Isaac Taylor, Greeks and Goths a Study on the Runes, Kessinger Publishing, 2004 (1879) * Winfred Philipp Lehmann, Historical Linguistics: An Introduction, Routledge, 1992 (1962)  External links  * Photo Gallery at Bibliotheca Dacica [broken link] * A possible Dacian royal archive on lead plates * Dacian Lead Tablets and Codex Rochonczi, Fake or Real? * Din tainele istoriei: misterul plƒÉcu≈£elor de la Sinaia (in Romanin, with photos of the plates) * 100 de placi din aur inscriptionate intr-o limba necunoscuta descoperite la Sinaia (in Romanian, with pictures of more than 20 of the plates) * Placute plumb (in Romanian, with photos) Category:Archaeological forgeries Category:Inscriptions of disputed origin Category:Sinaia ","title":"Sinaia lead plates"},{"id":"2372427","text":"CNBC World is an American pay television business news channel operated by NBCUniversal which provides coverage of world markets alongside the domestic CNBC service, using programmes from CNBC's international networks based in Europe, Asia, India, and other regions served by a domestic CNBC channel or affiliate.

Following the U.S.-launched 2003 invasion of Iraq, intercommunal violence between Iraqi Sunni and Shi'a factions became prevalent. In February 2006, the Sunni organization Al-Qaeda in Iraq bombed one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam‚Äîthe al-Askari Mosque in Samarra. This set off a wave of Shi'a reprisals against Sunnis followed by Sunni counterattacks. The conflict escalated over the next several months until by 2007, the National Intelligence Estimate described the situation as having elements of a civil war.In a 10 January 2007 address to the American people, President George W. Bush stated that \\"80% of Iraq's sectarian violence occurs within of the capital. This violence is splitting Baghdad into sectarian enclaves, and shaking the confidence of all Iraqis.\\". In 2008 and 2009, during the Sunni Awakening and the surge, violence declined dramatically. However, low-level strife continued to plague Iraq until the U.S. withdrawal in late 2011. Two polls of Americans conducted in 2006 found that between 65% to 85% believed Iraq was in a civil war; however, a similar poll of Iraqis conducted in 2007 found that 61% did not believe that they were in a civil war. In October 2006, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Iraqi government estimated that more than 370,000 Iraqis had been displaced since the 2006 bombing of the al- Askari Mosque, bringing the total number of Iraqi refugees to more than 1.6 million. By 2008, the UNHCR raised the estimate of refugees to a total of about 4.7 million (~16% of the population). The number of refugees estimated abroad was 2 million (a number close to CIA projections) and the number of internally displaced people was 2.7 million.UNHCR ‚Äì Iraq: Latest return survey shows few intending to go home soon . Published 29 April 2008. Retrieved 20 May 2008. The estimated number of orphans across Iraq has ranged from 400,000 (according to the Baghdad Provincial Council), to five million (according to Iraq's anti-corruption board). A UN report from 2008 placed the number of orphans at about 870,000.5 million Iraqi orphans, anti-corruption board reveals English translation of Aswat Al Iraq newspaper 15 December 2007 The Red Cross stated in 2008 that Iraq's humanitarian situation was among the most critical in the world, with millions of Iraqis forced to rely on insufficient and poor-quality water sources. According to the Failed States Index, produced by Foreign Policy magazine and the Fund for Peace, Iraq was one of the world's top 5 unstable states from 2005 to 2008. * A poll of top U.S. foreign policy experts conducted in 2007 showed that over the next 10 years, just 3% of experts believed the U.S. would be able to rebuild Iraq into a \\"beacon of democracy\\" and 58% of experts believed that Sunni‚ÄìShiite tensions would dramatically increase in the Middle East.  Ethno-sectarian composition  The population of Iraq can be divided into several main ideological or ethnic strands: * Shias (Arabic speaking): 55‚Äì65%: A majority of the population. * Sunnis (Arabic speaking): 20%: Politically dominated Iraq for centuries until the Coalition invasion of 2003. * Kurdish ‚Äì 26%: independent administration (mostly Sunnis, small Shi'ite, Yazidi, and other elements). * Assyrian ‚Äì 1%: This group has a minor role in the current situation (mostly Christians). * Turkoman ‚Äì 2%: This group has a minor role in the current situation (majority Sunni with large Shi'a minority), although Turkey is concerned about their overall treatment in Iraq. Religions: * Islam ‚Äì 95%: This is the primary religion in Iraq and serves as one of the primary sectarian distinctions. ** Sunni ‚Äì 30%: Majority Arabs with Kurds and Turkomans by 3 to 1. ** Shi'ite ‚Äì 65%: Mainly Arabs with a very small minority of Kurds and Turkomans. * Christian, Mandaeans and Yazidi ~ 5%: These groups have a minor role in the civil war situation. The main two participants in the violence were the Arab Sunni and Arab Shia factions, but conflicts within a single group also occurred. The Kurds were caught between the two religious groups, but as they were an ethnicity as opposed to a religious movement, they were often at odds with the Arabs that were settled in Iraqi Kurdistan by Saddam's Arabization policy.\\"US exit may lead to Iraqi civil war \\". 19 November 2003 Blurring this cohesion, though, were division of social, economic, political and geographic identities.  Participants  A multitude of groups formed the Iraqi insurgency, which arose in a piecemeal fashion as a reaction to local events, notably the realisation of the U.S. military's inability to control Iraq. Beginning in 2005 the insurgent forces coalesced around several main factions, including the Islamic Army in Iraq and Ansar al-Sunna. Religious justification was used to support the political actions of these groups, as well as a marked adherence to Salafism, branding those against the jihad as non-believers. This approach played a role in the rise of sectarian violence. The U.S. military also believe that between 5-10% of insurgent forces are non-Iraqi Arabs. Independent Shi'ite militias identified themselves around sectarian ideology and possessed various levels of influence and power. Some militias were founded in exile and returned to Iraq only after the toppling of Saddam Hussein, such as the Badr Organization. Others were created since the state collapse, the largest and most uniform of which was the Mahdi Army established by Moqtada al-Sadr and believed to have around 50,000 fighters.  Conflict and tactics  = Non-military targets = Attacks on non-military and civilian targets began in earnest in August 2003 as an attempt to sow chaos and sectarian discord. Iraqi casualties increased over the next several years. = Bomb and mortar attacks = Bomb attacks aimed at civilians usually targeted crowded places such as marketplaces and mosques in Shi'ite cities and districts.AFP: Bomb attack kills more than 40 near Iraq Shiite shrine The bombings, which were sometimes co-ordinated, often inflicted extreme casualties. For example, the 23 November 2006 Sadr City bombings killed at least 215 people and injured hundreds more in the Sadr City district of Baghdad, sparking reprisal attacks, and the 3 February 2007 Baghdad market bombing killed at least 135 and injured more than 300. The co-ordinated 2 March 2004 Iraq Ashura bombings (including car bombs, suicide bombers and mortar, grenade and rocket attacks) killed at least 178 people and injured at least 500.  Suicide bombings  Since August 2003, suicide car bombs were increasingly used as weapons by Sunni militants, primarily al-Qaeda extremists. The car bombs, known in the military as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), emerged as one of the militants' most effective weapons, directed not only against civilian targets but also against Iraqi police stations and recruiting centers. These vehicle IEDs were often driven by the extremists from foreign Muslim countries with a history of militancy, such as Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Egypt, and Pakistan. = Death squads = Death squad-style killings in Iraq took place in a variety of ways. Kidnapping, followed by often extreme torture (such as drilling holes in people's feet with drills) and execution-style killings, sometimes public (in some cases, beheadings), emerged as another tactic. In some cases, tapes of the execution were distributed for propaganda purposes. The bodies were usually dumped on a roadside or in other places, several at a time. There were also several relatively large-scale massacres, like the Hay al Jihad massacre in which some 40 Sunnis were killed in a response to the car bombing which killed a dozen Shi'ites. The death squads were often disgruntled Shi'ites, including members of the security forces, who killed Sunnis to avenge the consequences of the insurgency against the Shi'ite-dominated government. Iraq Body Count project data shows that 33% of civilian deaths during the Iraq War resulted from execution after abduction or capture. These were overwhelmingly carried out by unknown actors including insurgents, sectarian militias and criminals. Such killings occurred much more frequently during the 2006‚Äì07 period of sectarian violence.The Weapons That Kill Civilians ‚Äî Deaths of Children and Noncombatants in Iraq, 2003‚Äì2008 by Madelyn Hsiao-Rei Hicks, M.D., M.R.C.Psych., Hamit Dardagan, Gabriela Guerrero Serd√°n, M.A., Peter M. Bagnall, M.Res., John A. Sloboda, Ph.D., F.B.A., and Michael Spagat, Ph.D. The New England Journal of Medicine = Attacks on places of worship = On 22 February 2006, a highly provocative explosion took place at the al-Askari Mosque in the Iraqi city of Samarra, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by al-Qaeda in Iraq. Although no injuries occurred in the blast, the mosque was severely damaged and the bombing resulted in violence over the following days. Over 100 dead bodies with bullet holes were found on the next day, and at least 165 people are thought to have been killed. In the aftermath of this attack the U.S. military calculated that the average homicide rate in Baghdad tripled from 11 to 33 deaths per day. Dozens of Iraqi mosques were afterwards attacked or taken over by the sectarian forces. For example, a Sunni mosque was burnt in the southern Iraqi town of Haswa on 25 March 2007, in the revenge for the destruction of a Shia mosque in the town the previous day. In several cases, Christian churches were also attacked by the extremists. Later, another al-Askari bombing took place in June 2007. Iraq's Christian minority also became a target by Al Qaeda Sunnis because of conflicting theological ideas.http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100320/MAGAZINE/703199980/1298/MAGAZINE1 = Sectarian desertions = Some Iraqi service members deserted the military or the police and others refused to serve in hostile areas.Former CIA Officer Says Iraq Can Be Stabilized By Trained Security Forces PBS Newshour For example, some members of one sect refused to serve in neighborhoods dominated by other sects.

Growth in refugee flight  By 2008, the UNHCR raised the estimate of refugees to a total of about 4.7 million, with 2 million displaced internally and 2.7 million displaced externally. In April 2006 the Ministry of Displacement and Migration estimated that \\"nearly 70,000 displaced Iraqis, especially from the capital, are living in deteriorating conditions,\\" due to ongoing sectarian violence. Roughly 40% of Iraq's middle class is believed to have fled, the U.N. said. Most were fleeing systematic persecution and had no desire to return. Refugees were mired in poverty as they were generally barred from working in their host countries. A 25 May 2007 article noted that in the past seven months only 69 people from Iraq had been granted refugee status in the United States.Ann McFeatters: Iraq refugees find no refuge in America. Seattle Post-Intelligencer 25 May 2007  Use of \\"civil war\\" label  The use of the term \\"civil war\\" has been controversial, with a number of commentators preferring the term \\"civil conflict\\". A poll of over 5,000 Iraqi nationals found that 27% of polled Iraqi residents agreed that Iraq was in a civil war, while 61% thought Iraq was not.[] Two similar polls of Americans conducted in 2006 found that between 65% to 85% believed Iraq was in a civil war. In the United States, the term has been politicized.

Boston Globe. 11 July 2006 in a criticism of George W. Bush's 10 January 2007, President's Address to the Nation. Edward Wong on 26 November 2006 paraphrased a report from a group of American professors at Stanford University that the insurgency in Iraq amounted to the classic definition of a civil war. An unclassified summary of the 90-page January 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, titled Prospects for Iraq's Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead, states the following regarding the use of the term \\"civil war\\": : The Intelligence Community judges that the term \\"civil war\\" does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict in Iraq, which includes extensive Shia- on-Shia violence, al-Qa'ida and Sunni insurgent attacks on Coalition forces, and widespread criminally motivated violence. Nonetheless, the term \\"civil war\\" accurately describes key elements of the Iraqi conflict, including the hardening of ethno-sectarian identities, a sea change in the character of the violence, ethno-sectarian mobilization, and population displacements. Retired United States Army General Barry McCaffrey issued a report on 26 March 2007, after a trip and analysis of the situation in Iraq. The report labeled the situation a \\"low-grade civil war.\\" In page 3 of the report, he writes that:  See also  * Iraq conflict (2003‚Äìpresent) * Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 * Shia‚ÄìSunni relations * Iraqi insurgency * Refugees of Iraq Events: * 2 March 2004 Iraq Ashura bombings * 23 November 2006 Sadr City bombings * 22 January 2007 Baghdad bombings * 3 February 2007 Baghdad market bombing * Hay al Jihad massacre General: * Ethnic cleansing * Ethnic conflict * Sectarianism * Religion in Iraq * Religious war Films * Iraq in Fragments, documentary (2006)  References   Bibliography  * Iraq Study Group, The Iraq Study Group Report: The Way Forward ‚Äì A New Approach (2006) * Nir Rosen, In the Belly of the Green Bird: The Triumph of the Martyrs in Iraq (2006)  External links  * Refugees Report \\"The Iraqi Displacement Crisis\\" Refugees International, March 2008. * United States Dept. of Homeland Security Fact Sheet on admitting Iraqi refugees to the United States March 2008. * Sami Ramadani interview \\"Iraq is not a civil war\\" International Socialism, Spring 2007. * Taheri, Amir. \\"There is no Civil War in Iraq, Gulf News, 6 December 2006. * Phillips, David L., \\"Federalism can prevent Iraq civil war\\", 20 July 2005. * Hider, James, \\"Weekend of slaughter propels Iraq towards all-out civil war\\", The Times, 18 July 2005. * Ramadani, Sami, \\"Occupation and Civil War\\", The Guardian, 8 July 2005. * Phelps, Timothy M., \\"Experts: Iraq Verges on Civil War\\".

(1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. It is naturalised in North America. Description Dianthus armeria is an annual or biennial plant which grows to about tall and have a very slender appearance. It has widely spaced. paired leaves and above these it branches rather sparingly. At the ends of the stems there are short-stalked or stalkless clusters of deep pink flowers that are surrounded by erect, hairy, leaf-like bracts. These can also be located laterally. Each flower is in diameter and has 5 lanceolate petals which have irregular serrated edges and small white spotting on their upper surface. Its leaves are hairy, dark green in colour and slim in shape. Distribution Dianthus armeria is native to Europe where it is widespread as far north as 60¬∞N in Scandinavia and extends eastwards to Armenia and the Caucasus, it is found as far south as Spain and Sicily. It has been introduced to North America where it is now naturalised and is widespread. In Britain it is now extirpated as a native species from Scotland and is known from a few dozen sites in England and 4-5 sites in Wales, including a nature reserve in Flintshire, a quarry near Pontypridd in Rhondda Cynon Taf, near a reservoir in the vicinity of Port Talbot and along a farm track on a site near Llanelli. Habitat and ecology Dianthus armeria is a species of open and periodically disturbed sites, it is normally an annual but can be biennial or a short-lived perennial. New leaf rosettes form at the base of old plants from buds located on their roots demonstrating that this species is in fact a short-lived perennial and has a life-span of less than two and a half years. It flowers from July to September. Its flowers are scentless and do not appear to be insect pollinated often and self-pollination is the norm. Each plant gradually releases around 400 seeds from their pods, however, some plants may hold a small fraction of the seeds they produce over winter. It closes its blooms in the late afternoons. Cultivation and uses Seeds of Dianthus armeria It is widely grown as an ornamental plant in gardens. Populations have been introduced to and have become naturalised in New Zealand and much of North America. Name The name Deptford pink was coined in the 17th century by naturalist Thomas Johnson, who described a pink flower growing in Deptford in South-East London. However, it is very likely that Johnson was actually describing the related maiden pink, and it is unlikely that this species has grown in the area its named after since the city of London was built.

He was a co-founder of the \\"International Committee for Relief to the Wounded\\", which became the International Committee of the Red Cross after 1876. In 1864 he took over the position of President of the Committee from Guillaume-Henri Dufour, and he was also a major rival of the founder Henry Dunant. During his record long term of 46 years as president he did much to support the development of the Committee in the first decades after its creation.  Background  Moynier came from a rich and established Geneva family of merchants and bankers. He studied law in Paris and received his doctorate in 1850. Because of his Calvinist persuasion, he became interested in charity work and social problems early on. In 1859 he took over the chairmanship of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare. He was also active in around forty additional charitable organizations and groups involved in tasks from improving the conditions for prison inmates to caring for orphans. In 1862 Dunant sent him a copy of his book A Memory of Solferino. Moynier showed great interest in the realization of Dunant's ideas for the creation of a voluntary care organization for the assistance of the wounded in battle and opened a discussion about the book at the assembly of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare. This led to the creation of the \\"Committee of Five,\\" a commission of the Society set up to investigate the plausibility of Dunant's ideas. The additional members of the Commission, with Moynier as chairman, were Dunant, the doctors Louis Appia and Th√©odore Maunoir and the army general Guillaume- Henri Dufour. Soon afterwards, the members of the Committee changed the name to the \\"International Committee for Relief to the Wounded\\" and in 1876 it adopted its current name, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Dufour became the first president of the Committee, and Moynier became its vice-president.  Term as President of the ICRC  Monument to Moynier in Geneva's Parc des Bastions Differences between Moynier and Dunant developed early over the reach of the organization's authority and its legal and organizational formation. The key point of dispute was Dunant's idea to grant neutrality to wounded soldiers and medical staff in order to protect them. Moynier was a determined opponent of this plan, which he did not consider realistic and thought its insistence risked the collapse of the project. Dunant, however, was able to persuade powerful political and military figures in Europe of his ideas, and with the first Geneva Convention in 1864 had some success toward their implementation. In that same year however, Moynier took over the position of President of the International Committee. The increasing tensions between the pragmatist Moynier and the idealist Dunant led to Dunant's expulsion, led by Moynier, after Dunant's bankruptcy in 1867. While not proven, it is probable that Moynier used his influence to prevent Dunant, who from then on lived in rather poor conditions, from receiving financial assistance from his various supporters in Europe. For example, the gold medal of the Sciences Morales at the Paris World's Fair in 1867 was not awarded to Dunant but divided between Dunant, Moynier, and Dufour. The prize money was also not awarded to Dunant but given to the International Committee itself. An offer from Napoleon III to settle half of Dunant's debt if the other half would be taken over by Dunant's friends was thwarted by Moynier's efforts. In 1872 Moynier submitted, after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71, a proposal for the creation of an international arbitration court to penalize violations of International Humanitarian Law. Because of concerns by most national governments over state sovereignty, the measure was not adopted. Moynier was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902, 1903, and 1905 by Richard Kleen, a member of the Institut de droit international (Institute of International Law). However, unlike Dunant who was awarded the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 together with Fr√©d√©ric Passy, Moynier never received the prize. He died in 1910 two months before Dunant, without any sort of reconciliation between the two. Having been President of the Committee until his death, he was the Committee's longest-serving President in its history. Legacy The Rue Gustave-Moynier, in Secheron, Geneva's diplomatic quarter, is named after him and part of the nearby Parc Mon Repos is known as the Parc Moynier. There is a statue of Moynier in the Parc des Bastions, next to the University of Geneva.

Kurowsky served as a nurse in an American Red Cross hospital in Milan during World War I. One of her patients was the 19-year-old Hemingway, who fell in love with her. By the time of his release and return to the United States in January 1919, Kurowsky and Hemingway planned to marry within a few months in America. However, in a letter dated March 7, 1919, she wrote to Hemingway, who was living at his parents home in Oak Park, Illinois, that she had become engaged to an Italian officer. Although Kurowsky did eventually return to the United States, they never met again. Their story is shown in the 1996 film In Love and War. Hemingway used his experiences in Italy as the basis for ten short stories. Fictionalized characters based on Kurowsky appear in his short stories \\"A Very Short Story\\" and \\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\", as well as his novel A Farewell to Arms. Background Agnes von Kurowsky Stanfield was born on January 5, 1892, in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her parents met while her German-born fatherMeyers, Jeffrey (1977). Married to Genius, London Magazine Editions, p. 177 was teaching languages at the Berlitz school in Washington, D.C.. One of her uncles was the famous Chicago architect William Holabird, and her maternal grandfather was Gen. Samuel B. Holabird, who served as a Quartermaster in the United States Army. Although her family would move many times during her childhood, Agnes came to regard Washington as her home. She attended the Fairmont Seminary and a training program for the public library in Washington, and got her first job in 1910 as a cataloguer for the library there. In 1914 she decided to leave the library and attend nursing school. In her words, \\"The library was too slow and uneventful. My taste ran to something more exciting.\\" She decided to attend the Bellevue Nurses Training Program in New York City, and graduated in 1917. She then applied for service with the American Red Cross, and, on June 15, 1918, sailed for Europe. In Milan, at her first assignment for the Red Cross at the Army Hospital, she met Hemingway. She was seven years his senior, he only 19, but they became engaged. However several months after he had returned to the United States, in March of 1919, she rejected him through a letter informing him that she was engaged to an Italian officer. Agnes's identity as the basis for the fictional character was not widely known until Hemingway's brother, Leicester, published a book in 1961 about his brother. Leicester Hemingway visited Agnes in Key West while researching his book. Agnes gave him some photographs from her scrapbook that now reside at the Hemingway Foundation. Marriages and death Agnes von Kurowsky was married twice, but not to the Italian officer for whom (she wrote) she broke her engagement with Hemingway. She married Howard Preston (\\"Pete\\") Garner on November 24, 1928, while stationed with the Red Cross in Haiti. After her Haitian assignment was completed, she obtained a quick divorce. She married for the second time to William Stanfield in 1934. Stanfield was a hotel manager and widower with three children. During World War II, her husband and her stepson both served in the United States Navy. Agnes and her two stepdaughters went to New York City, where she worked at the Red Cross Blood Bank on Fifth Avenue. She remained married to Stanfield until her death in Gulfport, Florida, on November 25, 1984, at the age of 92. The cause of her death was not reported; her body was buried in the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery in Washington, D.C.Villard, Henry Serrano & Nagel, James. Agnes's letters to Hemingway are included in Hemingway in Love and War: The Lost Diary of Agnes von Kurowsky: Her letters, and Correspondence of Ernest Hemingway ( H/B/ P/B) She was honored for \\"her gallant and commendable services\\" with the American Red Cross during World War I.

Established in the early 18th century as the seat of Maryland's prominent Carroll family, it was home to Charles Carroll, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, during the late 18th century. A portion of the estate, including the main house, was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 11, 1971. It remains in the Carroll family and is not open to the public. History Doughoregan Slave Quarters Carriage House circa 1940 Doughoregan Manor is a colonial manor house built in the early 18th century. The slave plantation was founded on 7,000 acres patented to Charles Carroll I as \\"Doughoreagan\\" (sometimes spelled Doororegan) named for a family estate in Ireland, in 1702, and expanded to 10,000 acres as \\"Doughoreagan Manor\\" in 1717. The Georgian brick plantation house, built by Charles Carroll II around 1727, was enlarged and remodeled in 1832 by Charles Carroll V in the Greek Revival style. From 1766 to 1832, Doughoregan Manor was the country home of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, (Charles Carroll III) last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. He lies buried in the chapel attached to the north end of the mansion. Notable guests that have visited the manor include George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, James Monroe, and Marquis de Lafayette. In 1861, the manor became the home of John Lee Carroll, who became Governor of Maryland. In its current configuration the Manor is a brick, two-storied, U-shaped building. The roof is in gabled sections, some with balustraded decks, and in the center is an octagonal cupola. The front center entrance has a one-story tetrastyle Doric portico and is similar to the rear portico. The chapel and kitchen are attached to the main block by hyphens. The private chapel attached to the manor house was built at a time when the founding of Roman Catholic parish churches was prohibited in the colony. The chapel served as the primary meeting place for the local Catholic community until as late as 1855 when nearby parishes were founded. The chapel continued to be open to the public on Sunday mornings for Mass until the 1990s. A vineyard was planted by Charles Carroll of Annapolis in 1770 with four types of grapes. The vineyard was maintained into 1796, becoming one of the longest surviving colonial vineyards. A postal office served the manor from 18 September 1876 to 31 August 1907. The manor became the site for the yearly Howard County Horse Show through the 1930s, attracting thousands. The \\"Manor Dairy\\" opened in 1962 providing milk and dairy products. The Carroll family were enthusiastic horse breeders and raced thoroughbreds, competing with other well-to-do families at annual racing events, which also formed an important part of the social and political life of the colony. Charles Carroll of Annapolis's horse was beaten in 1743 by George Hume Steuart's \\"Dungannon\\" in the Annapolis Subscription Plate, established that year. In 1830, Emily Caton MacTavish donated 253 acres to build St. Charles College, Maryland, After a fire in 1911, Carroll family heirs sued to sell the property and divide the proceeds among the family. During the Civil war, the manor served as a hub for munitions for Southern supporters, also using nearby Mt. Pleasant as a substation. By 1931, the manor estate consisted of the mansion, overseer's house, horse stable, bank barn, 3 silos, corn house, 11 tenant houses, wash house, sheep house, coach house, brick barn and two barracks. Members of the Carroll family still own and live in the manor, which sits at the center of an of the original estate. Land was divided among the heirs each generation, sold for subdivisions, with at least owned by the family as late as 1971 and by 1977. According to a newspaper article: \\"As one family member put it a few years ago, 'Only God, the Indians and the Carrolls have owned this land.'\\" The estate and Manor Lane are closed to the public. Tax credits and development plans In 1971, the owner, Phillip Carroll, did not want to commit all 2,042 acres to landmark status, preferring to leave part of it for future development, so about 900 acres were designated landmark status, according to the National Register of Historic Places inventory sheet. However, with the 1976 Tax Reform Act, the owner changed his mind and requested the landmark status encompass all the acreage, which was granted. The 30-year tax credit and Maryland Historical Trust's easement expired in 2007. In an attempt to keep the majority of the property in the hands of the Carroll family, they struck a deal in 2008 with Erickson Retirement Communities to sell 150 acres, but the deal fell through the following year. Camilla Carroll, co-owner of the estate, insisted that \\"...there is no money now to restore anything, and historic buildings are falling down as we speak.\\" The County Commissioners voted in 2010 to pay the Carroll family about 19 million dollars over twenty years to place 500 acres in Howard County's Agricultural Preservation program. The council approved paying to expand the public water and sewer system to the development and the Carrolls would donate 34 acres to expand a county park. 221 acres of Doughoregan Manor were rezoned to allow 325 single-family homes to be built on the north-east side of the property. Many neighbors were concerned with the plans and a petition was filed in circuit court for judicial review of the zoning decision. In 2015, tax credits were awarded for work on an outbuilding at Doughoregan as one of the nine buildings listed in the 2015 Sustainable Communities Tax Credits of $10 million. Description The house was originally a -story brick house, about 30 feet deep and 66 feet wide, with a gambrel roof. A detached brick chapel stood to the north, while a brick kitchen stood to the south. The dependent buildings were incorporated into the main structure in the 1830s by Charles Carroll V, raising the main house's roof to make a two-story structure. The new roof was topped by a balustraded deck with an octagonal cupola. The front (east) facade gained a one-story portico with doric columns. A similar portico to the road was built with a room above, while a marble- floored veranda with iron columns extended to each side. The chapel's roof was raised and it was joined to the main house by a two-story passage, as was the kitchen. The work resulted in a Palladian style five-part house extending almost . The house's interior has a center-hall plan, with the oak-paneled main hall extending the full depth (30 feet) of the house. Stairs are located in a small side hall on the north side. A library, large parlor, small parlor and dining room occupy the first floor, with bedrooms on the second.

The series presented a group of DC's supervillains, mostly foes of the Justice League of America. The series was cancelled with issue #15 in July 1978, as part of the DC Implosion, a period when DC suddenly cancelled dozens of comics. In the decades following the cancellation of the original book, the fictional group has returned in many forms. Series conception Editor Gerry Conway created the team to be \\"a kind of 'evil' Justice League\\", inspired by the \\"Rogues Gallery\\" that fellow editor Julie Schwartz created for the Flash. Since other editors were somewhat possessive towards the more popular DC Comics supervillains, Conway resorted to sifting through DC's back issues in search of members, finally selecting a lineup of relatively obscure and/or forgotten villains. Conway said, \\"Obviously, this was lifted from Dick Tracy, but having costumed villains with a shared goal ‚Äî even if it was simply the destruction of their common enemy ‚Äî seems to be something that was unique to DC.\\" The first issue of Secret Society of Super Villains was drafted with artwork by Pablo Marcos. Then, according to Conway's assistant Paul Levitz: In the original story, Darkseid (demanding to be called the Director) founds the group under the title of the Brotherhood of Crime in a bid to hold the world ransom by stealing the world's deadliest nerve gas. The group, made up of Captain Cold, Gorilla Grodd, Clayface, Star Sapphire, and a clone of the Manhunter, turns on their benefactor when the Manhunter raises the issue of Darkseid's history of trying to enslave humanity. Darkseid is revealed to be an android. The Manhunter suspects Darkseid controls it from afar and suggests forming the Secret Society of Super Villains to combat Darkseid while pursuing their own goals. In the revised first issue, the team's lineup included Captain Cold, Gorilla Grodd, Star Sapphire and the Manhunter from the original conception, and added the Mirror Master, the Copperhead, Sinestro, the Shadow Thief and the Wizard. Starting from the second issue, the comic's standard hero is Captain Comet. Conway said, \\"I wanted a regular 'lead hero' for the villains to interact with.\\" The inclusion of a regular hero in the book helped to avoid Comics Code Authority concerns about presenting villains in a positive light. Publication history Due to the delays caused by having to redo the first issue from scratch, Conway assigned David Anthony Kraft to script the next three issues of Secret Society of Super Villains over his plots. After issue #4, both Conway and Kraft abruptly left DC, leading to a mad scramble to produce a fill-in issue. Jack C. Harris took over as editor, and Conway returned as writer only with issue #8, but artists on the series rotated nearly as often as the lineup of the titular supergroup, with Rich Buckler, Mike Vosburg, and Dick Ayers all contributing short stints as pencilers, while inkers changed from issue to issue. Harris felt that the series' mediocre sales might have been partly his fault: \\"The cover concepts were one of my editorial duties. Rich Buckler turned my ideas into the best he could do, but I never felt as if my ideas were good enough for his art. I think there was a ‚Äòsameness‚Äô to my ideas which might have hurt the title in that casual readers might have missed buying an issue because they thought they‚Äôd already seen it\\". Secret Society of Super Villains was cancelled with issue #15 as part of the DC Implosion. Issue #16 was already at the printer at the time of the cancellation and would have been the final issue, but writer Bob Rozakis appealed to DC to pull the issue since it was the beginning of a three-part story and he did not want to leave the readers hanging. Issue #17 was near completion at the time, and both it and issue #16 would see publication (of a sort) in the privately printed Cancelled Comics Cavalcade #2. Issue #18, which concluded the three-part story, was scripted but never drawn. Rozakis later revealed where the story would have gone had the series not been cancelled in a weekly column for Silver Bullet Comics. This series, along with the unpublished issues #16 and 17, were collected in a two-volume hardcover edition, with the volumes published in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Fictional history =Darkseid's Society= Cover to Secret Society of Super Villains #3, art by Ernie Chan First organized by Darkseid, the Secret Society of Super Villains were based out of the Sinister Citadel in San Francisco. From early on, the team was plagued with power struggles. Lex Luthor, the Wizard, Gorilla Grodd, and Funky Flashman all sought to control the powerful team; the Manhunter (the team's first leader) and Captain Comet, on the other hand, sought to divert the villains' evil ways into a more positive channel. After discovering the true identity of their benefactor, the team rebelled against the alien overlord. To quash their uprising, Darkseid sent Mantis and Kalibak. At the end of the struggle, the Manhunter sacrificed himself to seemingly kill Darkseid. After this, the team splintered, with Luthor, the Wizard, Gorilla Grodd and Flashman leading the team at different times. However, the Wizard proved to be the most tenacious and created the definitive incarnation of the SSoSV. They went on to fight the original Crime Syndicate of America of Earth-Three and the Justice Society of America. While traveling between dimensions, back on Earth-1 the Silver Ghost, the Mirror Master and the Copperhead formed yet another team and fought the Freedom Fighters.Secret Society of Super Villains #1-15. DC Comics. The Wizard's group eventually returned from Earth-2 and battled against the Justice League of America aboard their satellite headquarters. At one point in the battle, the two teams swapped bodies, allowing the supervillains to discover the true identities of their enemies. After gaining the upper hand, the Justice League wiped the memories of the supervillains, precipitating Identity Crisis and the formation of the current Society years later.Justice League of America #166‚Äì168. DC Comics. Also notable in this series' run is the first appearance of Captain Comet in over 20 years, as well as the introduction of a new Star Sapphire. Both were regular, recurring characters. =The Ultra-Humanite's Society= The Secret Society on the cover to Justice League of America #195, art by George P√©rez The next incarnation of the Secret Society appeared in 1981, headquartered in a new Sinister Citadel in Nepal, and was created by the Ultra-Humanite, who organized foes of both Earth-One's Justice League and Earth-Two's Justice Society. This version of the Society consisted of the Ultra-Humanite, Brainwave I, Killer Frost I, the Cheetah II, the Signalman, the Floronic Man, the Monocle, the Rag Doll I, the Mist I, and the Psycho- Pirate II, and marked the first appearance of the now-classic albino ape body of the Ultra-Humanite.Justice League of America #195. DC Comics. After capturing and sending 10 heroes of the JSA and JLA to Limbo, the Society was betrayed by the Ultra-Humanite, who had his own agenda.Justice League of America #196. DC Comics. In response, the betrayed villains of Earth-1 freed the 10 heroes and attacked the Ultra-Humanite. The entire Secret Society of Super-Villains was incarcerated in Limbo by the JLA and JSA.Justice League of America #197. DC Comics. The Ultra-Humanite contacted his younger self in 1942, who helped to break out the SSoSV using the power of Brainwave. The ape Ultra-Humanite attacked Infinity, Inc. in the modern day, while the rest of the SSoSV battled against the All-Star Squadron in 1942. The villains were defeated and returned to their proper times.All-Star Squadron #26. DC Comics. =Underground= The SSoSV in time grew into a large underground group with dozens of villains holding membership in various scattered cells. After the reformation of the JLA, the seven superheroes decided to infiltrate and shut down this new Society. Disguising himself as the deceased Brainwave I, the Martian Manhunter lured the villains to one spot where they were defeated by the JLA. As the tale was told by the Rainbow Raider to Sonar III, it is uncertain whether this tale actually happened. At the very least, there may have been some embellishment.JLA 80-Page Giant #1. DC Comics. =Alexander Luthor Jr.'s Society= After the defeat of the last incarnation of the SSoSV, a great amount of time would pass before villains would band together in any sort of large organization. Fueled by rumors of the mindwiping of Dr. Light, a new Society emerged. This Society was founded by Alexander Luthor Jr. posing as Lex Luthor, along with five other supervillains: the Calculator, Doctor Psycho, Deathstroke the Terminator, Talia al Ghul, and Black Adam. The Society's council, cover to Villains United #1, art by J. G. Jones Alexander Luthor Jr.'s intent was to gather together a cadre of supervillains to retrieve several key superheroes who have ties to the Multiverse, in order to harness their residual temporal vibrations to recreate the Multiverse through a giant \\"tuning fork\\" tower similar to the ones seen in Crisis on Infinite Earths. Only the Psycho-Pirate II, who remembered the Multiverse, knew of this plan, as Alexander Luthor Jr. lied to the members of his inner circle, telling them that he was building a massive mind-erasing machine to use against all of the heroes in the DC Universe. Playing on the fear of superheroes, retaliation for refusal, and the desire for power, Alexander created a Society the size of which (over 500 members) is larger than all previous incarnations combined. Out of all the villains in the DC Universe, the only one not even offered an invitation was the Joker on the grounds that he was \\"too wild\\". The group, referred to simply as the Society, was featured in the miniseries Villains United as background characters and foils for the new Secret Six (consisting of six villains recruited by the real Lex Luthor, who refused their invitation to join the Society). The follow-up one-shot issue Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special #1 focused on the Society itself as they enacted Alexander Luthor Jr.'s back-up plan to conquer Earth in the event that his main plan failed. This led to a final battle, referred to as the Battle of Metropolis, where the Society, led by Doctor Psycho and Doomsday, made their final battle against the various heroes of the DC Universe. At the end of Infinite Crisis, Alexander Luthor Jr. was killed by the Joker (as his revenge on Alexander Luthor Jr. for not including him in the Society), who was brought to him by Lex Luthor. Black Adam, betrayed by Alexander Luthor Jr., fought the Society in the Battle of Metropolis, tearing off Amazo's head, and returned to Khandaq to rule full-time. =One Year Later= One Year Later, most of the Society's inner circle is either in prison or has resigned from the group. Doctor Psycho was captured by the authorities after the Battle of Metropolis and is on trial in the Manhunter series; he has also appeared in Secret Six and Wonder Woman. Deathstroke the Terminator was apprehended by the Green Arrow, but escaped and started recruiting members for the Titans East. With Talia returning to rule the League of Assassins, the Calculator remains the only original member of the \\"inner council\\" left running the Society. =Final Crisis= Not long after the Society's dissolution, Checkmate instigated a crackdown on all villains in the DC Universe, who were captured and exiled to a prison planet as seen in the Salvation Run miniseries. The group included almost every villain in the DC universe, with rare exceptions. Though the villains escaped back to Earth, their desire for revenge drives the Society to depose Lex Luthor and replace him with a leader who promises them what they desire...the mysterious Libra. Libra, a follower of Intergang's \\"Religion of Crime\\" and secretly an agent of Darkseid, leads the Secret Society in their role as Darkseid's ground troops as part of the Final Crisis storyline. Promising to fulfill the hearts desires of his subordinates, Libra murders the Martian Manhunter for new recruit the Human Flame. He also arranges for Clayface to cause an explosion at the Daily Planet, killing and maiming dozens of Superman's closest friends and mortally wounding his wife Lois in the process, to try to seduce the disgruntled Luthor to his side and draw Superman to Libra. With most of the Society, including Vandal Savage, behind him, Libra reveals his true self to Lex Luthor as the villain turns on the Human Flame by forcing a mind-control helmet onto the villain's face, exposing him to the Anti-Life Equation and turning him into a mindless slave warrior known as a Justifier. Faced with the threat of being forced to become a Justifier himself, Luthor agrees to become Libra and Darkseid's servant. With help from Doctor Sivana and the Calculator, Lex Luthor ultimately turns against Libra and forces him to retreat. With Sivana's help, Luthor and the mind-controlled legions of Justifiers helped Superman in battle against the last remaining forces of Darkseid, the Fury Riders. Luthor and Sivana then proceed to help Superman build the Miracle Machine to save the Earth, though the two are only allowed to work on sections of the machine due to the risk of them stealing the designs for future villainous schemes. In Final Crisis: Revelations, the third Spectre kills Doctor Light and melts the Effigy before trying to take on Libra. Sister Wrack of the Religion of Crime impales Vandal Savage with the Spear of Destiny, causing Vandal Savage to be reborn as Cain. Cain then seeks out the Spectre and easily overwhelms him, followed by Cain impaling the Spectre with the Spear of Destiny. It separates the Spectre from host Crispus Allen as Renee Montoya and Radiant carry his body into the church. Cain later controls the Spectre and has it recite the Anti-Life Equation to recreate the world in Darkseid's name. Cain manages to stab Renee with the Spear of Destiny. Renee manages to grab the Spear and use its powers to restore the world and Crispus' life. Reuniting with the Spectre, Crispus uses his judgement to kill Cain's followers, but could not kill Cain. The Spectre casts Cain out into the world with no chance of peace until God decides to grant him otherwise. In Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge, the Rogues withdraw from Libra's Society and plot to take revenge on a movement-restored Inertia before they retire. However, Libra uses his New Rogues to target the Rogues and forces them to join up with Libra by doing various things to those close to them. Even with the New Rogues slain by the Rogues, Libra does not give up that easily. They still turn down Libra even after Zoom is de-powered by Inertia, who is then killed by the Rogues. From an idea by T. O. Morrow during and after Final Crisis, the Cheetah III assigned several scientific members of a new Secret Society (such as Professor Ivo and Doctor Poison) to collect soil samples from various regions of Earth in which acts of genocide occurred. They plan to use the soil to form a new villain named Genocide.DC Universe #0. DC Comics. Genocide is brought to life through a combination of science and the magic of Felix Faust. They are successful in doing so, but soon after an enraged Wonder Woman defeats a small team of members consisting of Shrapnel, the Firefly, Phobia and T. O. Morrow. After telling them to disband the team, Wonder Woman then destroys their home base skyscraper building.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #26. DC Comics. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Secret Society's origins are traced to two shadowy figures (one of whom is later revealed to be Professor Ivo) who meet to discuss the growing superhero community. The Secret Society is officially uncovered five years later by the Green Arrow, who is injured while trying to infiltrate the organization under the name the Dark Hunter on behalf of the Justice League of America (at that time, a state- sponsored group, separate from the Justice League led by Superman). The mysterious leader of the Secret Society, originally only known as \\"the Outsider\\", spreads out photographs of the different supervillains in front of him and says \\"It's recruitment time starting with Scarecrow\\".Justice League (vol. 2) #17. DC Comics. The mysterious leader successfully convinces the Scarecrow to join the Secret Society.Justice League of America (vol. 3) #2 The Justice League of America sends the Catwoman to infiltrate the Secret Society by sending her to Arkham Asylum and then letting her escape. When she does, she runs into the Blockbuster I and the Signalman on the rooftops, where she ends up knocked out and wakes up strapped to a chair in an empty room.Justice League of America (vol. 3) #3. DC Comics. While waiting for a meeting with the leader of the Secret Society, the Catwoman frees herself from the chair that she was strapped to. When the Catwoman meets with Professor Ivo, who plans to bring her to the banquet hall to meet the leader of the Secret Society, she knocks out Professor Ivo, only for her to be strangled into unconsciousness by the Copperhead moments later. The Catwoman wakes up strapped to the chair again, with a pale man clad in purple standing in front of her. He demands to know what she and her friends are doing there. He is aware of the Justice League of America's encounter with the Shaggy Man (this version being created by Professor Ivo) and Dr. Light's attempts to access their communication systems. He warns that Arthur Light is about to receive an unpleasant call. As Arthur Light begins hearing a voice from the object, the pale man puts a gun to the Catwoman's head and orders her to start talking. Instead, she warns that if he kills her, the Batman will stop at nothing to find them. This, however, is exactly what the Secret Society wants. Dr. Light is suddenly knocked back by a burst of light, just as the pale man pulls the trigger, leaving the Catwoman apparently dead on the floor of the concrete room.Justice League of America (vol. 3) #4. DC Comics. The Secret Society's leader has the Signalman and the Copperhead drop off the Catwoman's body at the Batman's doorstep. The Catwoman soon comes back to life and it is discovered that the Catwoman present is actually the Martian Manhunter in disguise. The Martian Manhunter and the Catwoman then fight the Outsider and the Blockbuster. When the Manhunter and the Catwoman finish with the Blockbuster, they hunt down the Outsider, who seems to know all about their real identities. However, his identity is still a mystery to them. The Martian Manhunter attempts to use his telepathy to discover it, but he senses he is blocked from doing so. Despite that, the Outsider allows the Martian Manhunter the opportunity to see into his mind. The Martian Manhunter is surprised to learn this man watched his world die as he did. While pursuing Professor Ivo, the Green Arrow finds him in a room with the captive A.R.G.U.S. agent Chronos trapped in a chair with electric energy. When the engine he is stuck in is activated (and it has just been) Chronos causes a temporal neutral field to envelope the manor, causing it to freeze in place throughout time, while Earth turns...which means Earth moves, not the manor. Thanks to the coins the Society have been given, they are able to stay within the manor without issue, but the Justice League of America will face a very painful death if they do not leave the house soon. After the Justice League of America escape from the manor, the Outsider comments to the Martian Manhunter that it was nice to see him \\"again\\".Justice League of America (vol. 3) #5. DC Comics. At the start of the \\"Trinity War\\" storyline, the Outsider has sent Plastique to prevent Madame Xanadu from warning the Justice League of her vision. The Outsider states that Pandora will soon be in the clutches of the Secret Society of Super Villains.Justice League (vol. 2) #22. DC Comics. The Outsider calls his fellow members telling them \\"it's time\\".Justice League of America (vol. 3) #6. DC Comics. Madame Xanadu is revealed to have been captured by the Outsider, who tells her that the Justice Leagues and the Trinity of Sin are all pieces in his game, with Superman and the Question (referred to as the pawns), the Batman, the Phantom Stranger, and Wonder Woman (referred to as the knights), all moving away from Pandora (referred to as the queen), leaving her unprotected. Madame Xanadu retorts that she does not need to see the future to know that the Justice League will defeat him. The Outsider replies that he has already won, since he has a mole in the Justice League.Justice League Dark #22. DC Comics. The Outsider orders Plastique to infiltrate A.R.G.U.S. to plant a bomb on Doctor Light's body.Justice League of America (vol. 3) #7. DC Comics. It is revealed at the end of the storyline that the Outsider is actually the Alfred Pennyworth of Earth-3 and he uses Pandora's Box to open a gateway to allow the Crime Syndicate of America to arrive on Prime Earth. The formation of the Secret Society was to have members ready for the Crime Syndicate once they arrived.Justice League (vol. 2) #23. DC Comics. During the \\"Forever Evil\\" storyline, the Crime Syndicate furthers their goals by springing inmates from Arkham Asylum, Belle Reve Penitentiary, and Iron Heights Penitentiary in order to expand the Secret Society of Super Villains and establish their rule over this reality.Forever Evil #1. DC Comics. =DC Rebirth= The Society reappears in DC Rebirth, where its members consist of Vandal Savage, Hector Hammond, the Riddler, Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash, Black Manta, the Ultra-Humanite, Deadline, the Raptor, and Killer Frost, with Lex Luthor being established as a former member. They place Deathstroke the Terminator on trial while debating whether he is truly reformed or not; however, the Riddler proves via Hammond's telepathic abilities that Deathstroke is 'evil'.Deathstroke (vol. 4) #25. DC Comics. Members Other versions =Justice Underground= The Justice Underground is a fictional superhero team in the DC Multiverse. The Justice Underground is an alternative version of the Secret Society of Super Villains from the Anti-Matter Universe. Fictional history The Underground experienced some temporary victories in their battles with the Syndicate, both as a team and individually. For example, the Quizmaster's underground connections allowed him to interfere with the supplies needed by the Crime Syndicate for various operations, such as the speed serum that Johnny Quick requires to maintain his super speed. One by one the Justice Underground members were all defeated, captured or killed. For example, Ultraman (the antimatter Superman) rendered Sir Solomon Grundy inert on a Saturday, and Lady Sonar sustained massive injuries from having her sonic abilities reflected back to her by Power Ring (the antimatter Green Lantern). Lady Sonar was forced to replace much of her shattered body with bionic implants. It was in this form that she resided as the guardian of Modora, the final free nation of the Anti-Matter Earth. Upon her home's invasion, Lady Sonar was successful in defeating Johnny Quick (the antimatter Flash) by temporarily shifting his body out of phase with reality. She was eventually destroyed by the Owlman (the antimatter Batman) and the rest of the Crime Syndicate when they finally conquered Modora. She was placed into cryogenic storage alongside her teammates, ready to be reanimated in a zombified state if the Syndicate decides it necessary. Their remains are located in the Crime Syndicate's Panopticon on the Moon's surface. The Justice Underground was released by the Martian Manhunter as a team of associate JLA members reversed back into the matter universe. It is unclear how they were able to recover from their injuries, though it could be inferred that the Owlman healed their injuries while they were in stasis. Members * the Quizmaster (the antimatter Riddler) ‚Äì The Quizmaster is the leader and the smartest man alive. He does not have any superpowers.

Collected editions The original comic book series was scheduled to be collected into a trade paperback entitled Showcase Presents: The Secret Society of Super Villains (collects SSoSV #1‚Äì17, 520 pages, ), but that project was cancelled. Instead, it was collected into two hardcover volumes. They are: * The Secret Society of Super Villains Volume 1 (collects SSoSV #1‚Äì10), August 2011, . * The Secret Society of Super Villains Volume 2 (collects SSoSV #11‚Äì15, DC Special #27, DC Special Series #6, Super-Team Family #13‚Äì14, Justice League of America #166‚Äì168 and the unpublished SSoSV #16‚Äì17 from Cancelled Comics Cavalcade #2), March 2012, In other media =Television= * The Secret Society made numerous appearances in the DCAU. ** In Justice League, Gorilla Grodd and Giganta (who was fiercely loyal to Grodd) formed the Secret Society with Killer Frost (who just likes to kill people), Sinestro (who has sworn a blood oath against all Green Lanterns), the Parasite (who simply hated Superman) and the Shade (who was offered the chance by Grodd to be a criminal). In its formation, Grodd took pains to encourage a more cohesive organization in order to avoid the infighting of Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang. His first plan was to rescue Clayface from Morgan Edge's mansion, where Killer Frost froze Morgan. Grodd tells Clayface that he will help him find a way to return him to his true identity of Matt Hagen after they defeat the Justice League. The Secret Society defeated the Justice League the first time, but The Secret Society was defeated by the Justice League in the second battle. ** In Justice League Unlimited, Grodd renewed his attempts to create a new Secret Society, with a swamp-based headquarters resembling the Legion of Doom's Hall of Doom, to take on the expanded Justice League by recruiting Lex Luthor and any villain he could obtain. Grodd succeeded with the creation of a massive co-operative, where he would manage the villains and have them provide each other with backup in case of Justice League intervention (in exchange for Grodd getting a cut of the profits of any successful schemes). To keep anyone from finding out about the Secret Society, every member had their brains shielded from telepathy and wired to short out in case a member was captured and forced to reveal details about the Secret Society. After the revelation that Grodd's ultimate plan in the creation of the team was the ludicrous transformation of humanity into apes, Lex Luthor ousted him and assumed the position as leader, with no objections from the membership. During the two-part series finale, Lex Luthor tried to resurrect Brainiac by ordering the crew to transform the base into a spaceship, so that they could travel to the site of Brainiac's ruined asteroid base. With Tala's help, Grodd attempted a coup to retake control of the Society, leading to a battle between members loyal to either Grodd or Luthor. As the battle ends, the members who were loyal to Grodd were frozen by Killer Frost. When the Secret Society reaches the site of Brainiac's defeat, Luthor used Tala's magic to restore Brainiac, despite a sudden warning from the New God Metron. Luthor accidentally resurrected Darkseid instead, who rewards Luthor for his help by destroying the Secret Society's base in a fiery explosion. However, force fields produced by Star Sapphire and Sinestro saved Luthor's crew. Lightray, another of the Gods of New Genesis, spotted the explosion, and was subsequently robbed of his Mother Box, which allowed the remnants of the Secret Society to make it back to Earth to warn the Justice League of Darkseid's return. *** The episode \\"Epilogue\\" included a futuristic version of the Secret Society known as the Iniquity Collective. Its members include Batman Beyond's enemies Inque, Shriek, the Stalker, and a monstrous future version of the Parasite. * In the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Deep Cover for Batman!\\", a version of the alternate Secret Society group Justice Underground appears. This group is led by the Red Hood (this reality's Joker) and had alternate versions of Black Manta, the Clock King, Doctor Polaris, the Gentleman Ghost, Gorilla Grodd, and Sinestro, while the alternate versions of the Brain and the Kite Man appear in a flashback. After a battle with the Injustice Syndicate, most of the group was captured, but the Red Hood remained free as he attempted to contact the Batman's world to look for new allies. The Batman soon arrived (while disguised as his evil counterpart the Owlman) and was able to help free the heroes and help capture the Injustice Syndicate. * In Young Justice, a group of villains known as the Light, have similarities to, and motives comparable with those of, the Secret Society of Super Villains: they implement plans to, as they put it, make the people of Earth \\"see the light\\". The group was founded by Vandal Savage to counteract the Justice League's role in preserving society's \\"calcified status quo\\". In his view, the League directly inhibited mankind by protecting it from disaster, crime, and tragedy‚Äîfactors needed for humanity to evolve. To counteract this, the Light worked on creating or co-opting networks of recruited operatives, placing various key individuals into various key positions, and exploring the boundaries of any and all new technologies, across the globe. This would enable them to expose humankind to the aforementioned factors and allow them to accelerate human evolution with as little resistance as possible from the League. Genetic engineering, biochemical engineering, robotics, nano-robotics, techno-sorcery, and all conceivable means of mind control were all explored by the Light in this quest, with a resurgent Earth \\"taking its rightful place at the center of the cosmos\\" appearing to be the Light's ultimate goal, and they are responsible for almost every threat \\"the Team\\" faces in the series. The members of The Light in the first season are Vandal Savage, Ra's al Ghul, Lex Luthor, the Queen Bee, the Ocean Master, the Brain, and Klarion, with the Sportsmaster acting as their enforcer. In season 2, Black Manta replaces the Ocean Master, and Deathstroke replaces the Sportsmaster as their enforcer, while the Reach and Darkseid have become their silent partners. After the Reach was defeated in season 2, as per the Light's plans, Darkseid is left as the Light's only partner. In season 3, Deathstroke, the Ultra-Humanite, and Granny Goodness, posing as an earthling named Gretchen Goode, replace Ra's Al Ghul, the Brain, and Black Manta, respectively, while Lady Shiva takes Deathstroke's place as their enforcer. Near the end of the season however, Darkseid moves against the Light to fulfill what has been his ultimate goal, to acquire the Anti-Life Equation and use it to spread his influence across the entire universe. Despite Vandal Savage helping the Team to locate and get to Granny Goodness, who is testing the Equation's effects, Darkseid's servant succeeds in using said Equation to enslave both the young heroes and a majority of the Justice League, before using it to begin enslaving the universe. However, with some initial help by an intervention from the Outsiders, Victor Stone allows the heroes to be freed from the equation's control, and thus they foil the plan. After this, the Light and Darkseid seemingly agree to reconcile their partnership, though Vandal Savage can secretly confirm how much of a potential threat Darkseid is now. By the end of the season, Markovian ambassador Zviad Baazovi replaces Granny Goodness, using his psionic powers to assist them in future endeavors, like having Geo-Force be made the new King of Markovia. =Film= * A version of the alternate Secret Society group the Justice Underground appears in Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths. The group's lineup includes a heroic Lex Luthor and the Jester (this reality's Joker) along with his monkey sidekick Harley. After the Jester sacrifices himself to take out two Crime Syndicate members in an explosion, the heroic Lex Luthor evades the Syndicate's leaders and flees to the Justice League's Earth to seek their help. =Video games= * Justice Underground appears in DC Universe Online under the leadership of Alexander Luthor of Earth-3. * An alternate reality version of the Secret Society of Super Villains appears in Injustice 2. Led by Gorilla Grodd, the group consists of Bane, Poison Ivy, the Scarecrow, Deadshot, the Cheetah, Captain Cold and Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash. Although the Catwoman was originally considered to be one of its members, it is revealed that she is a double agent working for the Batman. The \\"Society\\" intend to fill the power void left after the Justice League and the Insurgency defeated High Councillor Superman and his Regime. Also, Grodd is serving Brainiac and sends the Society members to keep the Justice League busy, while Brainiac continues ravaging the planet. The Society is disbanded after its members learn that Brainiac's goal is to destroy the planet, rather than to conquer it.Injustice 2: Gorilla Grodd =Miscellaneous= * A team called the Brotherhood of Justice (an alternate version of the Brotherhood of Evil) appears in Teen Titans Go! #48. This roster consists of parallel Earth counterparts of General Immortus, Psimon, Mammoth, Doctor Light and Madame Rouge. Only the parallel Earth Madame Rouge has a name, that being Gemini. All the other members have the same names as their counterparts. Their appearances are altered, however. General Immortus is powerless, has blue hair and resembles a military general with a blue uniform, Doctor Light is female and based on Kimiyo Hoshi, Psimon has apricot skin, his brain is not exposed (with hair replacing the jar containing it) and he wears a white face guard with three red dots in the center (resembling Braniac's), and Mammoth has a younger appearance, visible pupils in his eyes, and a yellow M-shaped band formation. Gemini wears a blue costume and has lighter skin. Gemini served as a double agent to the Teen Tyrants (the parallel Earth Teen Titans), posing as Blackfire (the parallel Earth Starfire, whose location and existence are unknown) to infiltrate them. After the Teen Titans are defeated by their counterparts, Gemini reveals herself and brings in the rest of the Brotherhood to defeat the Teen Tyrants, which they succeed in doing.

The municipality is bordered on the north and southeast by the state of Zacatecas. On the northeast, it shares its border with the municipality of Colotl√°n and on the west it is bordered by the municipalities of Villa Guerrero and Chimaltit√°n. The municipality covers an area of . Its hydrology is defined by the Bola√±os river, which demarcates its northern border with Zacatecas and the Cartagenas River which crosses the municipality and flows into the latter. There are five dams in the municipality: Candelaria, Magallanes, Temasti√°n, La Boquilla and Agua Zarca and smaller ones in Romita, San Francisco, and Totolco. Population The population of the municipality of Totatiche was 4,217 inhabitants in 2005, of which 1,287 lived in the municipal seat Totatiche. In 2000, there were 1,372 economically active individuals. Of these, the largest percentage (37.2%) were employed in ranching and agriculture, followed by the manufacturing sector (12.9%), commerce (10.9%) and construction (10.7%). History Totatiche is located in what was historically the convergence of territories of various indigenous tribes, namely tribes of the Tepehuan, Caxcan and Zacatec. This area, north of the Lerma-Santiago river, was known by the Mexica and later by the Spaniards as the Chichimeca, and the ethnic groups of the area, collectively referred to as Chichimecs, were considered bellicose and uncivilized. In April 1530, Captain Pedro Alm√≠ndez Chirino is sent from El Teul towards Zacatecas by Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n. On his return from Zacatecas, Alm√©ndez Chirinos was to meet Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n in Tepic. The route from Zacatecas to Tepic led Alm√©ndez Chirinos through the area of what is now Totatiche and west toward the Bola√±os Canyon. Upon his arrival in Tepic, he informed Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n of the area's wealth of silver. Totatiche was founded in April 1595 by Captain Miguel Caldera, Justice Major and protector of the pacified Chichimec tribes. The Viceroy of New Spain had sent several hundred Tlaxcaltec families to settle nearby Colotl√°n in 1591, in order to populate the region and help pacify the still unruly Chichimecs of the region. It is believed that some of these families were later moved to Totatiche with similar goals. After founding the convent in nearby Colotl√°n in August 1591, Fray Juan G√≥mez proceeded with the conversion of local indigenous tribes to Christianity. At that time, there were a mere seven haciendas in the region: Acatepulco, founded in 1571, Santa Mar√≠a de Gracia, Totolco, El Salitre, Juanacatic, Patagua and Cartagena. At the end of the 17th century the small Spanish population in the area was centered on Cartagena and a hacienda owned by the De La O family. A number of land grants in the region were made to Spaniards at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century. Among the grantees were Felipe Lemus, Juan Jose Pinedo and Francisco Gutierres del Palacio. In April 1711, Fray Antonio Margil de Jes√∫s embarked on a mission in Totatiche whose historical legacy is the local vocation to the Virgen del Rosario, the town and the parish's patron saint. Population began to grow considerably after 1730 due to the local wealth created by the silver mines in nearby Bola√±os. Totatiche depended on Colotl√°n for administrative and religious purposes until 1755 when a local parish was established. Construction on the currently standing parish temple in the town center was finished in 1901. Totatiche hosts an auxiliary seminary of the Archdiocese of Guadalajara. The seminary was founded in 1915 by Saint Crist√≥bal Magallanes Jara, who was arrested in the town in 1926 and later executed in neighboring Colotl√°n as part of the persecution of clergy during the Cristero Rebellion.

Aphex Systems was founded in 1975 in Massachusetts. The company changed its name to Aphex in 2010. About Aphex Formerly Aphex Systems, the company was acquired in mid-2015 by Freedman Electronics, parent company of R√∏de Microphones. Aphex moved in 2011 to Burbank, California, and in 2014 moved its main offices to Salt Lake City, Utah. Aphex manufactures pro audio products, primarily in the Burbank and L.A. area, with a few products manufactured in Asia. Aphex has design and engineering facilities located in Salt Lake City and California. Aphex builds products for the professional audio, broadcast, fixed installation, touring-sound and home-recording markets. It has developed a number of technologies and products, such as the Aural Exciter, Compellor, Dominator, Expander/Gate and Expressor, plus the Model 1100 Two-Channel and Model 1788 Eight-Channel Ultra-Precision Remotely Controllable Microphone Pre- Amplifiers, and the Model 2020 Mk III Broadcast Audio Processor. A key element of all the dynamics processing products is the voltage-controlled attenuator, the Aphex VCA 1001. Another key element is Aphex' input and output circuitry, using electronic balancing techniques instead of transformers. In late 2000, Aphex introduced a digital signal transport product, the Anaconda 64-Channel Bidirectional Digital Snake. Today, Aphex is focused on its latest Exciter and Big Bottom processing and Compellor compression technologies, with new patents pending and new products in the line. Key among these are a series of USB connected products: * Microphone X - a USB mic with Aphex Aural Exciter, Big Bottom and Compression technology built in. * IN2 - a USB computer interface with Aphex amplification and processing built in, allowing music and voice to be converted to digital and taken into the computer work place (Pro Tools, etc.) * USB Rack 500 - a USB connected 500 Series rack allowing 500 Series modules to go directly into the computer DAW. * 500 Series Modules - Aphex also offers a variety of 500 dries modules that bring Aphex processing technologies to the 500 Series user. * 19-inch rack products ‚Äì Aphex still makes a variety of professional rack products for studio, live and broadcast applications. Effects The Aural Exciter adds phase shift and musically related synthesized harmonics to audio signals. The Big Bottom circuit combines a low-pass filter and dynamics processor to compress and delay incoming low-frequency information. The process is reverse amplitude dependent, meaning that more is applied as the input level drops and less as the signal gets hotter. Together the dynamics processor and time delay create sustained bass frequencies that are perceived as being louder yet do not noticeably increase peak output. Aphex started selling the professional units, and introduced two low-cost models: Type B and Type C. The Aural Exciter circuit is now licensed by several manufacturers. The so-called Big Bottom circuit was added in 1992. Later revisions of the Aphex Aural Exciter included the Model 104 Type C and Type C2 units. The most recent version is the Model EXCITER Aural Exciter and Optical Big Bottom. Functionally similar units from competing manufacturers are generically known either as 'psychoacoustic processors' or more commonly just as 'enhancers'. Broadly comparable products are now available from BBE, Joemeek, SPL, and Behringer, implemented using either analogue or digital hardware, or software. =Applications= Aphex has also released several audio effects apps that apply the Aphex processing to digital music in iTunes. Licensing Aphex continues to expand its licensing activities and has contracts with a variety of audio, music and other OEMs. References External links * Category:Manufacturers of professional audio equipment Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United States ","title":"Aphex Systems"},{"id":"2372460","text":"Mikhail Aslanovich Pogosyan (; born 18 April 1956 in Moscow, Russia) is a Russian aerospace engineer.

It is native to France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Bulgaria and Russia.Tela Botanica, Armoise maritime, Artemisia maritima L. in French In its many variations of form it has an extremely wide distribution in the northern hemisphere of the Old World, occurring mostly in saltish soils. It is found in the salt marshes of the British Isles, on the coasts of the Baltic, of France and the Mediterranean, and on saline soils in Hungary; thence it extends eastwards, covering immense tracts in Southern Russia, the region of the Caspian Sea and Central Siberia to Chinese Mongolia. In Britain it is found as far as Wigton on the West and Aberdeen on the East; also in north-east Ireland and in the Channel Islands. It can be also found in Italy, on the Northern Adriatic coast. The plant somewhat resembles Artemisia absinthium, the absinthe wormwood, but is smaller. The stems rise about a foot or 18 inches in height. The leaves are twice pinnatifid, with narrow, linear segments, and, like the whole plant, are covered on both sides with a coat of white cottony fibers. The small, oblong flower heads, each containing three to six tubular florets, are of a yellowish or brownish tint; they are produced in August and September, and are arranged in racemes, sometimes drooping, sometimes erect. Popularly this species is called Old Woman, in distinction to Old Man or southernwood, Artemisia abrotanum, which it somewhat resembles, though it is more delicate-looking and lacks the peculiar refreshing scent of 'Old Man.' Dr. Hill says of this species: \\"This is a very noble bitter: its peculiar province is to give an appetite, as that of the Common Wormwood is to assist digestion; the flowery tops and the young shoots possess the virtue: the older Leaves and the Stalk should be thrown away as useless .... The apothecaries put three times as much sugar as of the ingredient in their Conserves; but the virtue is lost in the sweetness, those will not keep so well that have less sugar, but 'tis easy to make them fresh as they are wanted.\\" The plant abounds in salt marshes in which cattle have been observed to fatten quickly, and thus the herb has acquired the reputation of being beneficial to them, but they do not eat it generally, and the richness of maritime pasturage must be regarded as the true reason of their improvement under such circumstances. This plant is the botanical symbol of Saint Ninian. It is known locally around Whithorn in southwest Scotland as apple-ringy due to its scent. The flowering tops and young shoots are used, collected and dried in the same manner as Wormwood. The plant possesses the same properties as the other Wormwoods but is less powerful. It is a bitter tonic and aromatic. Although it is not now employed in regular medical practice, it is often made use of by country people for intermittent fever, and for various other medicinal purposes instead of the true Wormwood. The plant is a source of the sesquiterpenoid santonin. Thornton, in his Family Herbal, tells us that \\"'beat up with thrice its weight of fine sugar, it is made up into a conserve ordered by the London College, and may be taken where the other preparations disgust too much.\\" It acts as a tonic and is good in worm cases, and the seventeenth century botanist Nicholas Culpeper gives the following uses for it: \\"Boiling water poured upon it produces an excellent stomachic infusion, but the best way is taking it in a tincture made with brandy. Hysteric complaints have been completely cured by the constant use of this tincture. In the scurvy and in the hypo-chondriacal disorders of studious, sedentary men, few things have a greater effect: for these it is best in strong infusion. The whole blood and all the juices of the body are affected by taking this herb. It is often used in medicine instead of the Roman Wormwood, though it falls far short of it in virtue.\\" References External links *Plants for a Future *Natural Medicinal Herbs *Henriette's Herbal Homepage maritima Category:Medicinal plants of Asia Category:Medicinal plants of Europe Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Artemisia maritima"},{"id":"2372498","text":"{ +Wyreema } Wyreema was an Australian steamship named after the town of Wyreema, Queensland.

Conceived by Vector Motors founder and chief designer Gerald Wiegert as a successor to the W8.Vector Avtech WX3 ‚Äì TopSpeed, 17 May 2007 Production plans for the WX-3 included a range of three engine configurations ranging from up to 1200 hp (895 kW) from a proprietary 7.0L DOHC V8 engine. Originally painted silver, the WX-3 coup√© prototype was later re-painted teal by Wiegert to match the teal-blue and purple logo of his Aquajet jet-ski company. The teal-blue coup√© and purple roadster are featured as promotional vehicles on the Aquajet website. The single finished prototype is powered by the same twin- turbocharged V8 engine as the W8, with an improved flow dual plenum and throttle-body intake tract rather than the Chevrolet Corvette-based system used on the W8 production cars. At high boost levels the engine was capable of a power output of . The WX-3 prototypes used a three-across seating arrangement that was an option on W8 export models although Vector stated that a production model would have used more conventional bucket seats. Wiegert had also planned a roadster version of the WX-3, named the WX-3R; both vehicles shared mechanical components from the W8. Like the model it was based on, the WX-3R did not pass the prototype stage. Both versions were shown at the 1993 Geneva Auto Show. Wiegert planned for the WX-3 to enter production in the 1990s, but after a hostile takeover initiated by Megatech, Wiegert was fired from his own company. The car was never produced and later removed from future plans of the company when Wiegert initiated lawsuits and copyrighted the designs, preventing Megatech from building and selling the car without his approval.

The mixing of TiCl4 with trialkylaluminium complexes produces Ti(III)-containing solids that catalyze the polymerization of ethene and propene. The nature of the catalytic center has been of intense interest but remains uncertain. Many additives and variations have been reported for the original recipes. =Homogeneous Ziegler‚ÄìNatta polymerization= In some applications heterogeneous Ziegler‚ÄìNatta polymerization has been superseded by homogeneous catalysts such as the Kaminsky catalyst discovered in the 1970s. The 1990s brought forward a new range of post-metallocene catalysts. Typical monomers are nonpolar ethene and propene. The development of coordination polymerization that enables copolymerization with polar monomers is more recent. Examples of monomers that can be incorporated are methyl vinyl ketones methyl acrylate and acrylonitrile. Illustrative metallocene-based coordination catalysts Kaminsky catalysts are based on metallocenes of group 4 metals (Ti, Zr, Hf) activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO). Polymerizations catalysed by metallocenes occur via the Cossee‚ÄìArlman mechanism. The active site is usually anionic but cationic coordination polymerization also exists. Simplified mechanism for Zr- catalyzed for ethene polymerization =Specialty monomers= Many alkenes do not polymerize in the presence of Ziegler‚ÄìNatta or Kaminsky catalysts. This problem applies to polar olefins such as vinyl chloride, vinyl ethers, and acrylate esters. =Butadiene polymerization= The annual production of polybutadiene is 2.1 million tons (2000). The process employs a neodymium- based homogeneous catalyst. =Principles= Coordination polymerization has a great impact on the physical properties of vinyl polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene compared to the same polymers prepared by other techniques such as free-radical polymerization. The polymers tend to be linear and not branched and have much higher molar mass. Coordination type polymers are also stereoregular and can be isotactic or syndiotactic instead of just atactic. This tacticity introduces crystallinity in otherwise amorphous polymers. From these differences in polymerization type the distinction originates between low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or even ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Coordination polymerization of other substrates Coordination polymerization can also be applied to non-alkene substrates. Dehydrogenative coupling of silanes of dihydro- and trihydrosilanes to polysilanes has been investigated, although the technology has not been commercialized. The process entails coordination and often oxidative addition of Si-H centers to metal complexes.

It is in the genus Asclepias, the milkweeds. This species is native to southern Canada and of much of the conterminous eastern U.S., east of the Rocky Mountains, excluding the drier parts of the prairies. It grows in sandy soils and other kinds of soils in sunny areas. It was one of the earliest North American species described in Jacques-Philippe Cornut's 1635 work Canadensium Plantarum Historia. The specific name was reused by Linnaeus due to Cornut's confusion with a species from Asia Minor. Description Common milkweed is a clonal perennial herb growing up to tall. Its ramets grow from rhizomes. All parts of common milkweed plants produce white latex when broken. The simple leaves are opposite or sometimes whorled; broad ovate-lanceolate; up to long and broad, usually with entire, undulate margins and reddish main veins. They have very short petioles and velvety undersides. The highly fragrant, nectariferous flowers vary from white (rarely) through pinkish and purplish and occur in umbellate cymes.Liede, S., and F. Weberling. 1995. Plant Systematics and Evolution. 197: 99‚Äì109.Lawrence, G. H. M. 1951. Taxonomy of Vascular Plants. Macmillan Company, New York, NY. 823 pp. Individual flowers are about in diameter, each with five cornate hoods and five pollinia. The seeds, each with long, white flossy hairs, occur in large follicles. Fruit production from selfing is rare.Sparrow, F. K., and N. L. Pearson. 1948. Pollen compatibility in Asclepias syriaca. Journal of Agricultural Research 77:187‚Äì199 In three study plots, outcrossed flowers had an average of about 11% fruit set.  Ecology  Many kinds of insects visit A. syriaca flowers, and some kinds pollinate them, including Apis mellifera (Western honey bees) and Bombus spp. (bumble bees). In the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Region, the introduced A. mellifera was the most effective and most important diurnal pollinator with regard to both pollen removal and pollen deposition. However, when considering the self-incompatibility of A. syriaca, A. mellifera was not the most important pollinator because of its high self-pollination rate compared to Bombus spp. Additionally, the rate of self-pollination increased more rapidly with the number of flowers per inflorescence in A. mellifera than in native Bombus spp. Many insect species feed on common milkweed, including the red milkweed beetle (Tetraopes tetrophtalmus), large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), small milkweed bug (Lygaeus kalmii), milkweed aphid (Aphis nerii), milkweed leaf beetle (Labidomera clivicollis), milkweed stem weevil (Rhyssomatus lineaticollis), milkweed tiger moth (Euchaetes egle) and monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). Monarch larvae consume only milkweeds, and monarch populations may decline when milkweeds are eliminated with herbicides. Deforestation due to European settlement may have expanded the range and density of common milkweed. This plant can become invasive; it is naturalized in several areas outside of its native range, including Oregon and parts of Europe. However, in the last three decades mostly in the United States, milkweed populations have diminished dramatically due to factors such as increased habitat loss due to development, roadside median mowing, and herbicide use. Subsequently, this has played a significant part in the monarch butterfly's 90% population decline since the 1990 peak of 1B migrators as the milkweed can no longer survive among the corn and soybean rows. Cultivation Monarch Watch provides information on rearing monarchs and their host plants. Efforts to increase butterfly populations by establishing butterfly gardens and monarch waystations require particular attention to the target species' food preferences and population cycles, as well to the conditions needed to propagate their food plants.(1) . (2) . For example, in the Washington, D.C. area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States, monarch butterflies prefer to reproduce on A. syriaca, especially when its foliage is soft and fresh. As monarch reproduction in that area peaks in late summer when most of the plant's leaves are old and tough, the plant needs to be cut back in June ‚Äì August to assure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak.(1) . (2) . (3) . (4) . (5) . (6) . In the eastern United States, one can have such leaves in July, August, and early September during the main oviposition period in three ways. First, one can grow seedlings. Second, one can cut large shoots to about half their height in June and July before or after they bloom. Third, one can cut large shoots to the ground in June and July. Cut plants often produce new shoots from their rhizomes. A. syriaca is easily propagated by both seed and rhizome cuttings. The plant's seeds require a period of cold treatment (cold stratification) before they will germinate.(1) . (2) . (3) . (4) . Both seedlings and cuttings will usually bloom in their second year, although cuttings will occasionally bloom during their first year. The plant increases by underground shoots and can be invasive. It is ideal in semi-dry places where it can spread without presenting problems for other ornamental species. The nonnative Aphis nerii (oleander aphid) can become abundant on milkweed shoots. One can remove the insects by hosing them off with a spray of water or by pouring a solution of dish soap on them. .  Human uses  The plant's latex contains large quantities of glycosides, making the leaves and follicles (often called \\"seed pods\\", although they are not botanical pods) toxic to sheep and other large mammals, and potentially humans (though large quantities of the foul-tasting parts would need to be eaten). The young shoots, young leaves, flower buds and immature fruits are all edible raw. Concerns about milkweed bitterness and toxicity can be traced back to Euell Gibbons, author of Stalking the Wild Asparagus (1962). It is theorized that Gibbons inadvertently prepared common dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum), a poisonous somewhat similar-looking plant instead. He devised a method to remove the bitterness and toxicity by plunging the young shoots into boiling water (not cold) and cooking for one minute, repeating the procedure at least three times to make the plant safe to eat. Gibbons' method was copied from book to book, dominating edible plants literature for forty years. Most modern foragers consider the bitterness and toxicity issue a myth. The plants have no bitterness when tasted raw, and can be cooked like asparagus, with no special processing. Failed attempts have been made to exploit rubber (from the latex) and fiber (from seeds' \\"floss\\") production from the plant industrially. The fluffy seed hairs have been used as the traditional background for mounted butterflies and other insects. The compressed floss has a beautiful silk-like sheen. The plant has also been explored for commercial use of its bast (inner bark) fiber which is both strong and soft. U. S. Department of Agriculture studies in the 1890s and 1940s found that common milkweed has more potential for commercial processing than any other indigenous bast fiber plant, with estimated yields as high as hemp and quality as good as flax. Both the bast fiber and the floss were used historically by Native Americans for cordage and textiles. Milkweed has also been cultivated commercially to be used as insulation in winter coats.

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Clark College in Atlanta, Georgia in 1964. He received a Juris Doctor from Emory University School of Law in 1967. He is a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Cooper received a Master of Public Administration from Harvard University, John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1978. He also received a diploma from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in connection with a research proposal he developed. Military service He served in the United States Army from 1968 to 1970 reaching the rank of Staff Sergeant. He was decorated with the Bronze Star, a Certificate of Commendation, the National Defense Service Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal. State judicial career He was an Attorney, Atlanta Legal Aid Society, Georgia in 1967. He was an Assistant district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia in 1968 and from 1970 to 1975. He was a judge on the City of Atlanta Municipal Court, Georgia from 1975 to 1980. Cooper was the first African- American appointed to a full-time judgeship on the Atlanta Municipal Court and the first African-American ever elected to a county-wide judgeship on the Fulton Superior Court. He was also the first African American assistant district attorney hired to a State Prosecutor's office in Georgia in 1968. Judge Cooper was the presiding Judge in the trial of convicted Atlanta child murderer, Wayne Williams, for serial killings that occurred in 1979 through 1981. He was a judge on the Fulton Superior Court, Georgia from 1980 to 1990. He was a judge on the Georgia Court of Appeals from 1990 to 1994. Federal judicial service Cooper is a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Cooper was nominated by President Bill Clinton on March 9, 1994, to a seat vacated by Richard Cameron Freeman. Cooper was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 6, 1994, and received commission on May 9, 1994 and he assumed senior status on February 9, 2009. Cases Cooper ordered an Atlanta school system to remove stickers from textbooks which call the theory of evolution \\"a theory, not a fact.\\" In the case Selman v. Cobb County School District, he ruled that these stickers are an endorsement of religion and as such violate the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution. Cooper was assigned to the case of Whitaker v.

Ottawa Citizen, July 11, 1993. Although Barrett, the Antelope and other specific instances mentioned in the song are fictional, \\"Barrett's Privateers\\" is full of many authentic details of privateering in the late 18th century. The song was released on the album Fogarty's Cove in 1976 and has since gained popularity as a drinking song, with cover versions by many bands. It also appears on later Stan Rogers live albums Home in Halifax and Between the Breaks ... Live! The song makes use of mixed meter, regularly switching back and forth from to time. It is regarded as one of the Royal Canadian Navy's unofficial anthems, the unofficial anthem of Atlantic Canada and also often heard sung at many Atlantic universities including (west to east) Acadia University, University of New Brunswick, Mount Allison University, Dalhousie University, Saint Mary's University, University of King's College, St. Francis Xavier University, Cape Breton University, and Memorial University of Newfoundland.  Plot  \\"Barrett's Privateers\\" is sung from the point of view of a young fisherman who enlisted on Elcid Barrett's ill-fated Antelope. The Antelope is described as the \\"scummiest vessel [he'd] ever seen\\", and the song describes the many faults of the decrepit sloop. After describing the initial voyage to Jamaica seeking American merchantmen and the problems with the Antelope, the unnamed narrator sings about how they finally found one, loaded down with gold. Because of the poor state of the ship, it takes the Antelope two days to come within firing distance of the American vessel, which ultimately turns out to be far more heavily armed than they are. The Antelope's main-mast is knocked down with one volley from the American vessel, and Barrett is killed. The truck of the mainmast \\"carrie[s] off both [the narrator's] legs\\" leaving him a broken man. The last two stanzas find him \\"in (his) twenty-third year\\", having taken six years to make his way to Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Historical authenticity  From the very opening line of the song, Rogers paints a plausible and mostly authentic image of a privateering vessel. He sets the tale in 1778, at the height of the American Revolution, when privateering was a common activity on both sides of the war. Rogers's choice of names, nautical terminology, and details of weapons and places all accurately reflect historical fact, with some exaggeration on the loss of life. The song's mentions of Halifax, Nova Scotia, are also historically accurate, as Halifax was a well-known port for privateers operating on the east coast and out of Nova Scotia at that time. The meaning and accuracy of some parts are open to discussion. The refrain of \\"I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\" is one example. If he is referring to a town, then there is a conflict with the date of 1778, as the town of Sherbrooke, Nova Scotia was not founded until 1815, and Sherbrooke, Quebec not until 1818 (in any case, John Coape Sherbrooke, the namesake of both towns, was only 14 years old in 1778).Sherbrooke Village - Research / History Another possibility is that this reflects Stan Rogers's artistic license in tribute to his family origins near Sherbrooke, on Nova Scotia's eastern Shore. Others believe the line refers to the privateer brig Sir John Sherbrooke, one of the largest and most formidable privateers based in Nova Scotia. However, like the town of Sherbrooke, the Sir John Sherbrooke significantly post-dates the American Revolution, having been built in 1813.Dan Conlin, \\"Is the Song Barrett's Privateers True?\\", Canadian Privateering Homepage Perhaps he was referring to the community of New Ross, which was originally Sherbrooke but renamed after the War of 1812, rather than Sherbrooke village. These are actually two different locations: Sherbrooke village \\"nestled between Sherbrooke Lake and St. Mary's River\\" and the other (New Ross formerly Sherbrooke) located in the Chester Municipal District. Encounters of this nature were uncommon in privateering, as the aim was to capture an undamaged merchant ship. However, a privateer out of Halifax engaged in one of the bloodiest battles in the history of privateering in a naval battle off Halifax in 1780, resulting in 51 deaths and the disabling of both vessels. Other privateers (such as the Rolla) were lost with all hands in shipwrecks.Snider, C.H.J. Under the Red Jack, Musson Books (1926), p. 245 Some American privateers met with disastrous fates off Nova Scotia at the hands of the Royal Navy (e.g., see the story of Young Teazer, as well as the naval battle off Halifax of 1782). = The Antelope = \\"The Antelope\\" is described as a sloop in the song, with a total of 21 crew, all of whom were formerly fishermen. She is armed with several \\"cracked\\" four- pounder cannons. The Antelope has many other faults: she lists to port, and constant pumping is needed to keep ahead of the many leaks in the poorly maintained wooden hull. The Antelope's sails are described as being \\"in rags\\", likely the result of poor upkeep. Many vessels of the period bore the name \\"Antelope\\", including several in the British Royal Navy named HMS Antelope. As the name of a somewhat exotic animal, it conveyed a sense of the vessel's speed, although in this case it is an ironic moniker. Sloops were often used by privateers because they were good for short-range assaults. Their range was extremely limited by their small size, although even a small sloop normally warranted a crew of at least thirty, so that there might be enough men to crew a captured prize. Given the Antelope's state of repair, the smaller crew could be taken to mean that it was difficult to recruit for such an obviously unreliable vessel. The precise afflictions of the Antelope - listing to port, ragged sails, constant leaks, and an evidently incompetent crew - are all likely problems. Many ships either damaged in storms or barely seaworthy to begin with had constant rotations of crewmen pumping out water. While stored, sails could be damaged by rats or insects. Without good maintenance, they might also become eroded in the normal course of use. The cook is described as having the \\"staggers and jags\\", a euphemism for delirium tremens resulting from alcoholism; this was an all too common condition for sailors. Additionally, the listing to port could also have been caused by poor ballasting by the crew. The Antelope is armed with cracked \\"four-pounders\\", quite common privateer weapons. As smaller weapons, they allowed the privateer great speed, although it also meant that they lacked range. Given the poor armament of most merchantmen, a skilled captain could use them very effectively. While some debate has been raised over the fact that cracked cannons would be difficult to fire, resulting in a claim that Rogers's original was \\"crack four-pounders\\" using the slang of \\"crack\\" meaning \\"the best\\", recordings of Rogers show him singing \\"cracked\\". Furthermore, it is more in keeping with the description of the Antelope for the cannons to be in disrepair rather than exceptionally good. The assumed authenticity is often so great that other performers have either been confused by it or played off it to fool unsuspecting audiences. In one of their recorded performances of the song, famed Scottish folk singers The Corries state during a preamble that the song is in fact from the 18th century. However they also claim that it is the story of a Scottish exile, changing the line \\"I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\" to \\"I wish I was in Edinburgh now\\" even though no such references appear in the lyrics, and that the Antelope's captain was \\"Cid Barrett\\" not the correct \\"Elcid\\".  Cover versions  The popularity of \\"Barrett's Privateers\\" has inspired cover versions by many bands, such as the metal band Alestorm on their third album, Back Through Time. This cover also features a guitar solo by Heri Joensen from T√Ωr. The Australian band, Weddings Parties Anything and the folk group, Schooner Fare, also covered this song.

Unless the condition is met, the ruling becomes a decree absolute (rule absolute), and is binding. Typically, the condition is that an adversely affected party provide satisfactory evidence or argument that the decree should not take effect (i.e. the decree takes effect unless the party shows that it should not). For that reason, a decree nisi may also be called a rule, order or decree to show cause. Using the example of a divorce, the wording of such a decree is generally in the form of \\"that the marriage solemnized on (date) between AB and CD, be dissolved by reason of (grounds) UNLESS sufficient cause be shown to the court why this decree should not be made absolute within six weeks\\". This allows time for any party who objects to the divorce to come forward with those objections. When no objection is raised by either party, an automatic dissolution takes effect. The term is used in many common law jurisdictions, but is more common in the United Kingdom than in the United States.  Usages  In most common law jurisdictions, a decree nisi must be obtained in possession proceedings before the court will order foreclosure under a mortgage enforcement. This form of ruling has become a rarity in recent times, with few exceptions: in some jurisdictions, it is still a standard stage of divorce proceedings. In Hong Kong, and in England and Wales, section 1(5) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 provides that \\"Every decree of divorce shall in the first instance be a decree nisi and shall not be made absolute before the expiration of six months from its grant\\", and section 9(1) allows any person (including the Queen's Proctor), before the decree is made absolute, to \\"show cause why the decree should not be made absolute by reason of material facts not having been brought before the court\\". In England and Wales, the minimum interval between the granting of decree nisi and that of decree absolute was amended by the Family Law Act 1996 and is now six weeks. In practice, courts use an interval of six weeks and one day. Another exception regarding orders nisi is where a creditor seeks to place a charge on land for money owed. A court, on the production of certain evidence, will make a charging order nisi and a hearing date is set. If the court is satisfied at the hearing that the creditor is entitled to have a charge on the debtor's property, it will grant a charging order absolute.

The field of polymer science includes researchers in multiple disciplines including chemistry, physics, and engineering. Subdisciplines This science comprises three main sub-disciplines: * Polymer chemistry or macromolecular chemistry is concerned with the chemical synthesis and chemical properties of polymers. * Polymer physics is concerned with the bulk properties of polymer materials and engineering applications. * Polymer characterization is concerned with the analysis of chemical structure, morphology, and the determination of physical properties in relation to compositional and structural parameters. History of polymer science The first modern example of polymer science is Henri Braconnot's work in the 1830s. Henri, along with Christian Sch√∂nbein and others, developed derivatives of the natural polymer cellulose, producing new, semi-synthetic materials, such as celluloid and cellulose acetate. The term \\"polymer\\" was coined in 1833 by J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius, though Berzelius did little that would be considered polymer science in the modern sense. In the 1840s, Friedrich Ludersdorf and Nathaniel Hayward independently discovered that adding sulfur to raw natural rubber (polyisoprene) helped prevent the material from becoming sticky. In 1844 Charles Goodyear received a U.S. patent for vulcanizing natural rubber with sulfur and heat. Thomas Hancock had received a patent for the same process in the UK the year before. This process strengthened natural rubber and prevented it from melting with heat without losing flexibility. This made practical products such as waterproofed articles possible. It also facilitated practical manufacture of such rubberized materials. Vulcanized rubber represents the first commercially successful product of polymer research. In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet started the first artificial fiber plant based on regenerated cellulose, or viscose rayon, as a substitute for silk, but it was very flammable. In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic plastic, a thermosetting phenol-formaldehyde resin called Bakelite. Despite significant advances in polymer synthesis, the molecular nature of polymers was not understood until the work of Hermann Staudinger in 1922. Prior to Staudinger's work, polymers were understood in terms of the association theory or aggregate theory, which originated with Thomas Graham in 1861. Graham proposed that cellulose and other polymers were colloids, aggregates of molecules having small molecular mass connected by an unknown intermolecular force. Hermann Staudinger was the first to propose that polymers consisted of long chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds. It took over a decade for Staudinger's work to gain wide acceptance in the scientific community, work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953. The World War II era marked the emergence of a strong commercial polymer industry. The limited or restricted supply of natural materials such as silk and rubber necessitated the increased production of synthetic substitutes, such as nylon and synthetic rubber. In the intervening years, the development of advanced polymers such as Kevlar and Teflon have continued to fuel a strong and growing polymer industry. The growth in industrial applications was mirrored by the establishment of strong academic programs and research institute. In 1946, Herman Mark established the Polymer Research Institute at Brooklyn Polytechnic, the first research facility in the United States dedicated to polymer research. Mark is also recognized as a pioneer in establishing curriculum and pedagogy for the field of polymer science. In 1950, the POLY division of the American Chemical Society was formed, and has since grown to the second-largest division in this association with nearly 8,000 members. Fred W. Billmeyer, Jr., a Professor of Analytical Chemistry had once said that \\"although the scarcity of education in polymer science is slowly diminishing but it is still evident in many areas. What is most unfortunate is that it appears to exist, not because of a lack of awareness but, rather, a lack of interest.\\"Fred W.

The Great MƒÅhele was one of the most important episodes of Hawaiian history, second only to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. While intended to provide secure title to Hawaiians, it would eventually end up separating many of them from their land.  Bill of Rights  The 1839 Hawaiian Bill of Rights, also known as the 1839 Constitution of Hawaii, was an attempt by Kamehameha III and his chiefs to guarantee that the Hawaiian people would not lose their tenured land, and provided the groundwork for a free enterprise system. The document, which had an attached code of laws, was drafted by Lahainaluna missionary school alumnus Boaz Mahune, revised by the Council of Chiefs and by Kamehameha III in June 1839.  1840 Constitution of the Kingdom Hawaii  The 1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii established a constitutional monarchy. It stated that the land belonged to its people and was to be managed by the king. It established executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The document established allodial title property rights which maintained the lands in the hands of Hawaiian subjects to mƒÅlama (nurture and sustain). In order to protect Hawaiian lands from foreigners, Kamehameha III divided the lands among all the people of Hawai ªi. ali ªi, konohiki and maka ªainana alike. The Mahele changed the previous land system under which the kuleana (responsibility and obligation) ahupua ªa to mƒÅlama  ªƒÅina was given by the m≈ç ªƒ´ (king) to an ali ªi nui (high chief), his subordinate ali ªi and konohiki who received taxes and tribute from the people who worked the land collectively. Private land ownership did not exist. The Great MƒÅhele of March 7, 1848, relocated one-third of the land to the m≈ç ªƒ´ (monarch) Hawaiian crown lands. Another third was allocated among the ali ªi and konohiki (chiefs and managers of ahupua ªa). The remaining one-third was given to the maka ªƒÅinana (common people). The law required land claims to be filed within two years under the Kuleana Act of 1850, and many Hawaiians made no claim. Eventually most of the land was sold by the government of the Republic and settlers from the continental US or auctioned to The Big Five (Hawaii) corporations.Native Hawaiians Study Commission Report ‚Äì 1983 , p. 334 This resulted in Hawai ªi having about 32% of the land owned by the state, while another 4.8% is Hawaiian Homelands.Hawaii Statewide GIS Program  Acts of 1850  = Alien Land Ownership Act = While opponents Kamehameha IV, Kamehameha V and missionary physician Gerrit Judd were traveling, on July 10, 1850 the legislature passed the Alien Land Ownership Act. It allowed foreigners to hold title to land. The Act was written by Chief Justice William Little Lee. The justification was the promise of prosperity resulting from an influx of much- needed capital and labor. = Kuleana Act-August 6, 1850 = Another notable part of the Great Mahele was the Kuleana Act of 1850. Under this provision, commoners were allowed to petition for title to land that they cultivated and lived on (wikt:kuleana), similar to the homesteading laws used to manage land tenure in US territories in the nineteenth century. It also abolished the right of cultivation and pasturage on the larger, common lands of the ahupua ªa, title of which went to the chief, the crown or the government. Ownership of land was a previously unknown concept for ordinary Hawaiians. Many did not understand the need to make a claim for land where they already lived and/or worked. Communication depended upon word-of-mouth or the ability to read the written word. Making a claim required money to pay for a pre-claim land survey. The system required two witnesses to confirm that the claimant had worked the land. About 18,000 plots of 3 acres each were successfully claimed. The Kingdom's population at the time was some 82,000. Members of higher classes and ali ªi obtained title to most Hawaiian land. Due to the ongoing effect of western diseases and property taxes, many lost their property.

Historically, USIT is related to Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT), which originated in Israel and is related to TRIZ, the Russian methodology. It differs from TRIZ in several ways, but most importantly it is a simpler methodology, which makes it quicker to learn and easier to apply. It requires no databases or computer software. (But note that the purest application of TRIZ does not require databases or software either.) The goal of USIT is to enable a problem solver to invent multiple solution concepts in as short a time as possible for real-world problems (day-to-day technical problems in all fields). Key to this methodology is its ability to establish, quickly, unusual perspectives of a problem situation. Innovative results are achieved using tools (heuristics) designed to elicit complementary contributions from both cerebral hemispheres, generating logical and creative concepts. USIT tools and methods began their development in the Ford Motor Company Research Laboratory in a training program called structured inventive thinking that continues to be taught and applied in Ford Motor Company worldwide engineering locations (see History and Industrial Experience).  Introduction  Problem solving is most commonly used in professions such as, engineers, scientists, mathematicians, all of whom have academic degrees, and inventors who bear patents as proof to their talent. Engineering and science are mostly based on an algorithmic-type of problem solving developed by applied mathematicians. Inventing is not an algorithmic process; it is a result of unrestricted creative thinking‚Äîinspiration. Lacking in algorithmic processes, inventive-type problem solving methodology has eluded much of academia. Many methodologies have been developed and marketed for filling this gap. Though they may or may not involve algorithms, they often entail structured methodology. USIT has structure, but no algorithms.  History  The methodology known as systematic inventive thinking (SIT), now known as advanced systematic thinking (ASIT), was brought into Ford Motor Company in 1995. Dr. Roni Horowitz and colleagues developed SIT in the early 1990s with the goal of simplifying TRIZ. It was introduced into Ford by Dr. Ed Sickafus who modified the methodology for adaptation into an automotive environment and named it \\"structured inventive thinking\\", retaining the acronym SIT in honor of the earlier work. In 1997, Ford Motor Company approved the publication of a textbook, Unified Structured Inventive Thinking ‚Äì How to Invent by Dr. Ed. Sickafus. Since 2000, USIT has been taught outside of the company to non-Ford interests. It has been introduced to individuals, companies, and institutions in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Australia, and Europe. A newsletter containing mini-lectures on USIT is sent to 43 countries and is translated into three languages (see Resources).  Overview of USIT  It is recommended that one turn to USIT after conventional methodologies have waned. This encourages the rapid application of intuitive problem solving called brainstorming (in which technologists excel) and the quick collection of \\"low hanging fruit\\". It also sets the stage for beginning unconventional methodology that stresses left- brain/right-brain participation in problem solving (logic/creativity). USIT fits between problem identification and the selection of solution concepts found for a problem; both involve engineering and business decisions. Between these engineering-filtering events, a problem solver is free of such filters while searching solution concepts to be engineered. USIT emphasizes this distinct division enabling a problem solver to spend time focused on creative thinking without psychologically inhibiting filters‚Äîa problem simplification strategy. All aspects of USIT are derived from a unifying theory based on three fundamental components: objects, attributes, and the effects they support. Effects may be beneficial, called \\"functions\\", or not beneficial, called \\"unwanted effects\\". The methodology consists of three common phases: \\"problem definition\\", \\"problem analysis\\", and \\"application of solution concepts\\" with equal time spent in each phase. ;Problem definition: A well- defined problem is formulated in an iterative process, described in terms of objects, attributes, and a single unwanted effect. Objects are reduced to a minimum number required to contain the problem (not to \\"explain\\" the problem situation). Multiple root causes are discovered using the plausible root causes heuristic. Abstraction of the problem statement is achieved using verbal and graphic metaphors. Exercise of the \\"plausible root causes heuristic\\" carries the problem solver well into problem analysis. ;Problem analysis: Following plausible root causes analysis one of two lines of thinking is followed: 1) a \\"closed-world\\" analysis of the problem to understand intended functional connectivity of objects when no problem existed or 2) a \\"particles method\\" that begins from an ideal solution and works back to the problem situation. ;Solution techniques: Three strategies for problem solving are based on the metaphorical interaction of objects, attributes, and effects: \\"utilization\\", \\"nullification\\", and \\"elimination\\" of the unwanted effect (see Heuristics for Solving Technical Problems ‚Äî Theory, Derivation, Application). ;;;;object ‚Äì attribute ;;;;;;;;\\\\ ;;;;;;;;effect ‚Äì attribute ‚Äì object ;;;;;;;;/ ;;;;object ‚Äì attribute ;;Graphic metaphor for the interaction of objects and attributes. Five solution heuristics are used to support these strategies. 1) \\"Dimensionality\\" focuses on the \\"attributes\\" available and new ones discovered during problem analysis. 2) \\"Pluralization\\" focuses on \\"objects\\" being multiplied in number or divided into parts, used in different ways, and carried to extremes. 3) \\"Distribution\\" focuses on \\"functions\\" being distributed differently among objects in the problem situation. 4) \\"Transduction\\" uses \\"attribute-function-attribute links\\" to reach new solution concepts. This is modeled metaphorically after transducers, which convert information from one form to another. 5) \\"Uniqueness\\" characterizes effects of a problem according to their activity in \\"space\\" and \\"time\\". Each technique is logically tied to one or more of the underlying features in the well-defined problem: objects, attributes, and effects.  Industrial experience  Beginning in 1995, the problem-solving methodology has been taught to Ford's corporate technologists and management in monthly three-day classes. Weekly User-group meetings allow continued development of skills. A team of specialists was organized to apply the methodology to corporate problems worldwide. Their ideal goal was three 3-hour sessions, one for each phase of problem solving. Before starting a team program, the customer would be involved with the team in gathering necessary background information. Some of this experience can be read in Injecting Creative Thinking Into Product Flow (see Resources). Many Japanese companies are having their technologists trained in USIT, especially because of its streamlined nature and ease of understanding. A reward of USIT is its ability to enable a technologist to begin solving a problem so poorly worded as, \\"This gismo doesn't work. Fix it!\\" and, \\"Our competition just lowered their price. Now what?\\"  Resources  * Triz Home Page in Japan a provides freeley available case studies, forums, ebooks and newsletters on USIT and reprints of papers and essays.

The main production site of the Saras Group is the Sarroch refinery located on the island of Sardinia, one of Europe's only six supersites, with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day, representing 15% of refining capacity in Italy. In recent years, initially to enable independence of the Sarroch refinery from terms of energy, the Saras Group has entered into the production of electricity and is expanding its production of alternative energy sources, particularly in the field of wind energy, through its subsidiaries Sarlux and Sardeolica, the latter of which is controlled indirectly through the company Eolici Ulassai. From 1995 until 2013, Moratti was the chairman of F.C. Internazionale Milano. He is said to have spent around ‚Ç¨1.5 billion of his personal fortune in the transfer market, and was famous for signing numerous football superstars. He was Inter's honorary chairman, and also a United Nations goodwill ambassador. In 2013, he was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame. Life and career Moratti is the fourth son of industrialist Angelo Moratti, who was the chairman of Football Club Internazionale Milano during the team's \\"Golden Age\\" from 1955 to 1968. Born in the family villa in the Bosco Chiesanuova, close to Verona, he graduated from Libera Universit√† Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli with a master's degree in Political Science. Gian Marco, Massimo and Angelo Moratti in 1967 Letizia Moratti, his brother's wife, was the Mayor of Milan from 2006 until 2011. On his father's death, Moratti inherited his shares in the Saras Group, engaged in the refining of petroleum, where he is presently CEO. Moratti is also the owner of Sarlux, headquartered in Cagliari, which focuses on the production of electricity from waste oil. Married to the environmental activist Emilia Moratti (n√©e Bossi), the couple have five children. In September 2009, Sauro Gori announced that Moratti had been appointed a United Nations goodwill ambassador. In May 2011, Moratti supported Giuliano Pisapia's bid to become mayor of Milan against his sister-in-law Letizia. His call for 'change' was perceived as an extension of his rivalry with A.C. Milan, Silvio Berlusconi, from football to the political sphere. In April 2020 he was ranked by Forbes at number 1513 in the world's billionaires list with a net worth of $1.4 billion. Chairman of Inter Moratti took over as chairman of Inter from Ernesto Pellegrini in 1995, during a period where many considered Inter to be underachievers. During the 18 years of his leadership, Inter has clinched five Scudetti/Serie A in a row from 2006 to 2010 (equalling the all- time record), four Coppa Italia titles (2005, 2006, 2010, 2011), four Supercoppa Italiana titles (2005, 2006, 2008, 2010), one UEFA Champions League (2010), one FIFA Club World Cup (2010) and one UEFA Cup (1998). Inter won the Scudetto, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League in the 2009-2010 season, becoming the first Italian team that managed to achieve the Treble. Moratti is said to have spent around ‚Ç¨1.5 billion of his personal fortune in the transfer market in his time as chairman. His most famous signing was that of Ronaldo from FC Barcelona in the summer of 1997, at a time when he was widely considered the best player in the world. Later, in July 1999, Moratti sanctioned a then world-record ‚Ç¨48 million purchase of striker Christian Vieri, and has purchased numerous others, including Roberto Carlos, Hern√°n Crespo, Adriano, Iv√°n Zamorano, Maicon, Roberto Baggio, Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, Lu√≠s Figo, Patrick Vieira, Samuel Eto'o, Alvaro Recoba and Wesley Sneijder. However, criticism also been levelled against Moratti, as he fired coaches frequently. Except keeping Giuseppe Baresi and Daniele Bernazzani as backroom staff in the first team or in the youth system, as well as Marco Branca as one of the directors, the team had changed from Rafael Ben√≠tez, Leonardo, Gasperini and most recently Ranieri in just 2 seasons. Roberto Mancini and Jos√© Mourinho were the only two trophy winning and longest serving coach in recent years. Before Mancini, Massimo employed more than 10 short-lived coaches, including Roy Hodgson, Marcello Lippi, Marco Tardelli, H√©ctor C√∫per and Alberto Zaccheroni. The day after Ranieri was dismissed, chief scout of the first team Giovanni Battista Lanfranchi was fired and replaced by the former technical commission of Udinese, Valentino Angeloni. Lanfranchi had served for Inter for 13 years in different positions. In November 2013, International Sports Capital took control of 70% of the club. Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir, a part-owner of that company, was elected chairman of Inter, but Moratti remained with the club as the honorary chairman. In June 2016, Moratti's Internazionale Holding S.r.l. sold all its stake in Inter Milan to Erick Thohir's Nusantara Sports Ventures HK Limited for ‚Ç¨60 million (and re-sold to Zhang Jindong's Suning Holdings Group). As of 2018, Moratti's wife, Milly Moratti, remained in the advisory board of Inter. However, Moratti himself, was no longer the honorary chairman of the club. Other members of the Moratti family, Angelomario Moratti, Carlotta Moratti, Giovanni Moratti, remained as members of the board of a subsidiary of the club, Inter Futura.

The breed originated in the Southern United States and is highlighted by their deep red coat. Described by the American Kennel Club as having \\"an overall impression that a master sculptor carved them from blocks of the finest mahogany,\\" the Redbone blends an unrelenting hunter with a loving family dog. This breed has been registered with the United Kennel Club since 1902 and the American Kennel Club since 2009. History In the early 19th century, Scottish immigrants brought red-colored foxhounds to Georgia, which would later become the foundation stock of today's modern-day Redbone. Around 1840, Irish-bred Foxhound and Bloodhound lines were added. The Redbone name comes from an early breeder, Peter Redbone of Tennessee, though the United Kennel Club credits Redbone's contemporary, George F.L. Birdsong of Georgia, and Dr. Thomas Henry in the 19th century. Over time, breeders followed a selective program that led to a coonhound that was adept at treeing wild-game up trees, was courageous against larger animals such as bear and mountain lions, agile enough to track in the mountains or in the marsh, and could swim if necessary (one of the few hounds with webbed feet). They are ideal for pack hunting of both small and larger prey. Originally, the Redbone had a black saddleback, but by the beginning of the 20th century, it was replaced by an uninterrupted red tone. Like many American hunting dogs, especially those from the South, they were widely known by hunters and farmers, but not well-known in the show ring (the Redbone has since found recognition by the two major American kennel clubs). Because of its main use as a hunting dog rather than a show dog, Redbones are extremely rare dogs outside of the United States. There are very few breeders outside of North America and it is virtually unknown outside of the U.S.. The Redbone Coonhound was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1902, becoming the second coonhound breed to gain recognition and was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2010. It was shown at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show for the first time in 2011.  Description  A female Redbone in the field. =Appearance= A four-month-old female Redbone Coonhound The Redbone Coonhound has a lean, muscular, well proportioned build. The body type is typical to the coonhounds subgroup, with long straight legs, a deep chest, and a head and tail that are held high and proud when hunting or showing. The Redbone Coonhound has brown eyes and a face that is often described as having a pleading expression. The dog's eyes may be dark brown to hazel, but a darker color is preferred. The coat is short and smooth against the body, but coarse enough to provide protection to the skin while hunting through dense underbrush. Some Redbones may exhibit a ridge of fur behind the ears and down to the shoulders when alerted, but dissimilar to the ridge found on the Rhodesian Ridgeback. Their large paws have especially thick pads, with webbed toes, and dewclaws are common. The nose is often black and prominent, with black on the muzzle and around the eyes, called \\"masking\\", not uncommon. The ears are floppy and will most likely extend to nearly the end of the nose if stretched out. The coat color is always a rich red, though a small amount of white on the chest, between the legs, or on the feet is sometimes seen. The white chest and feet markings that occasionally appear on Redbone Coonhound puppies today is most likely a throwback to the mixing of Bloodhound and Foxhound bloodlines. Males tend to be 22-27 inches (56-68.5 cm) at the shoulder, with females slightly shorter at 21-26 inches (53‚Äì66 cm). Weight should be proportional to the size and bone structure of the individual dogs, with a preference towards leaner working dogs rather than heavier dogs. Generally, weights will range from 45 to 70 lb. (20.5 to 31.75 kg). =Temperament= The Redbone Coonhound is a very amiable dog overall. The breed is affectionate, gentle, and has a strong desire to please its owner. Socially active and agreeable with other dogs, aggression towards people or other canines is rare. With proper exercise, the Redbone can be happy as a non-hunter and makes a great family pet. In the U.S., particularly in the south, they are kept as both the family dog and a hunting dog. As with other hounds and sporting breeds, puppies and adolescents are more energetic than adults and require frequent activity. Failure to mentally or physically exercise this breed will typically result in a dog that is destructive in the house. When going through obedience training, it is imperative to know that harsher training methods are not effective with this type of breed. Coonhounds are typically stubborn but also overly sensitive; loud and strict correcting can frighten this breed. The Redbone is also very vocal: they naturally have a loud booming bawl, also called a bay, and will be vocal in welcoming their owner coming home, if they sense danger, or that something has gone wrong. Hunting dogs require a good deal of exercise to stay happy and healthy. The breed is best suited to the countryside or suburbs. Urban environments are less than ideal but workable so long as they get sufficient exercise. Redbones are known to have an independent intelligence especially well-suited for problem solving. The majority of Redbones require leashes to avoid wandering. It is not uncommon for this breed to wander from its owner. = Hunting = A Redbone tracking The Redbone is an extremely vocal dog. The breed is known for its distinctive \\"drawling\\" bark, also known as a bay. Hunters who use the breed follow the sound of the voice as the dogs track quarry. A Redbone Coonhound will have a \\"specific\\" bay when it has an animal either treed or cornered. This bay is very much distinguishable from their normal day to day baying. Bred to work on all kinds of punishing terrain, Redbones are fast and surefooted and move with a proud, \\"swinging\\" gait. A Redbone Coonhound's training is a key component to creating a capable hunting dog, so proper training should begin as soon as possible. The Redbone has a stubborn mindset that can work to the owner's advantage, but the Redbone can also absorb a significant amount of information that can help with creating a reliable hunting dog. If properly trained, a Redbone Coonhound should never kill an animal it's tracking. To discourage this behavior, training a puppy with a weighted duck or waterfowl dummy can be used to discourage the dog from shaking the prey with its head. Young Redbone Coonhound in the snow Coonhounds are in the same group as well known breeds such as the Beagle, Basset Hound, and Bloodhound: they are bred primarily to track game using sight and scent over long distances. They are one of the few \\"cold-nose scent hounds,\\" or hounds that can accurately track and follow old scents. They also instinctively mark their position for following hunters by vocalizing as they catch up with their quarry. Therefore, this breed will have the desire to chase small animals such as rabbits, squirrels, badgers, or even cats. They are also adept in the water and can be compared to other water-loving breeds like the Labrador Retriever in swimming ability. In a hunt setting they will often make quarter mile loops away from the pack searching for scent of their prey before returning or using their bay to raise the alarm, thus bringing the pack to their aid. When breeding the Redbone Coonhound, traits such as determination and endurance created a dog that isn't afraid to hunt until its exercise is accomplished. Because of their instinctive desire to follow scents, they are eager to follow their noses and may ignore their owners' commands while in the field. Famous Redbone Coonhounds *Where the Red Fern Grows is a story about two Redbone Coonhounds (\\"Old Dan\\" and \\"Little Ann\\") and their owner Billy Colman.

It grows in damp to wet soils and also is cultivated as a garden plant for its flowers, which attract butterflies and other pollinators with nectar. Like most other milkweeds, it has latex containing toxic chemicals, a characteristic that repels insects and other herbivorous animals. Description Swamp milkweed is an upright, tall plant, growing from thick, fleshy, white roots. Typically, its stems are branched and the clump forming plants emerge in late spring after most other plants have begun growth for the year. The oppositely arranged leaves are long and wide and are narrow and lance-shaped, with the ends tapering to a sharp point. The plants bloom in early to mid-summer, producing small, fragrant, pink to mauve (sometimes white) colored flowers in rounded umbels. The flower color may vary from darker shades of purple to soft, pinkish purple and a white flowering form exists as well. The flowers have five reflexed petals and an elevated central crown. After blooming, green seed pods, approximately long, are produced that when ripe, split open. They then release light to dark brown, flat seeds that are attached to silver-white silky-hairs ideal for catching the wind. This natural mechanism for seed dispersal is similar to that used by other milkweed plants. Habitat Swamp milkweed prefers moisture retentive to damp soils in full sun to partial shade and is typically found growing wild near the edges of ponds, lakes, streams, and low areas--or along ditches. It is one of the best attractors of the monarch butterfly, which feeds on the flowers and lays her eggs on the plants. The emerging caterpillars feed on the leaves. The plants have specialized roots for living in heavy wet soils. The scented, thick, white roots are adapted to live in environments low in oxygen. Blooming occurs in mid to late summer and after blooming long, relatively thin, rounded, pods are produced that grow uprightly. The pods split open in late summer to late fall, releasing seeds that are attached to silky hairs, which act as parachutes that carry the seeds on the currents of the wind. Cultivation This species is cultivated frequently and a number of cultivars are available. They are used especially in gardens designed to attract butterflies. The nectar of the plant attracts many other species of butterflies and insects as well. The plants are also sold as freshly cut flowers, mostly for their long-lasting flower display, but sometimes, for the distinctive seed pods.

In 1967, she was transferred Republic of China Navy where she served as ROCS An Yang (DD-18/DDG-918) until 1999. The destroyer was finally sunk as a target in 2003. United States Navy (1943-1967) Kimberly was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named after Rear Admiral Lewis A. Kimberly (1838-1902). She was launched 4 February 1943, by Bethlehem Steel Co., Staten Island, N.Y., sponsored by Miss Elsie S. Kimberly, daughter of Admiral Kimberly; and commissioned 22 May 1943, Commander Harry W. Smith in command. =World War II= After shakedown Kimberly cleared Norfolk 10 September 1943, and steamed toward the action in the Pacific. Following additional training at Pearl Harbor, the destroyer arrived off Makin 20 November to begin the Navy's relentless conquest of Micronesia. Throughout the Gilbert Islands campaign, the destroyer served in ASW screen for the battleships and cruisers supporting Marines fighting ashore with deadly accurate and devastating naval gunfire. Kimberly departed Tarawa 6 December for the West Coast. After repairs at San Francisco, she sailed 22 January 1944, for the Aleutian Islands. Operating with Rear Admiral Wilder D. Baker's Task Force 94 (TF 94), the destroyer departed Attu 1 February to silence enemy antiaircraft batteries on Suribachi Wan and Kurabi Saki. Kimberly remained in the Aleutians for 7 months on ASW patrols, offensive sweeps, bombardment of the Kuriles, and training exercises before steaming toward San Francisco 18 September. As the tempo of the Pacific war quickened, Kimberly arrived at Manus, Admiralty Islands, to prepare for her roles in the reconquest of the Philippines. On 10 November she departed escorting a supply convoy to Leyte Gulf, carrying material to replenish U.S. forces there. On the evening of 21 December, while Kimberly escorted another convoy to Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, Japanese suicide planes attacked the American ships. During the 2-hour battle, Kimberly's guns shot down one plane and assisted in the downing of two others. After repulsing the attack, the convoy proceeded to Mangarin Bay bringing men and material for the construction of an airstrip and a PT- boat base needed to support the invasion of Luzon, Kimberly's next mission. The destroyer departed Leyte 2 January 1945, screening a preinvasion battleship group. En route, during one of many kamikaze attacks, the destroyer scored another kill. Arriving off Lingayen Gulf 6 January, the bombardment group was immediately placed on alert to ward off the enemy suicide pilots. That day Kimberly shot down two more planes. For the remainder of the month, she bombarded enemy railroad and supply centers. During February the destroyer prepared for the Okinawa campaign which would advance American forces next door to the Japanese homeland. Departing San Pedro Bay 21 March for radar picket duty, the destroyer, off the Ry≈´ky≈´s, was attacked 26 March by two Aichi D3A \\"Vals.\\" Despite accurate antiaircraft fire and numerous hits, one enemy plane, trailing fire and smoke, crashed into the aft gun mounts killing 4 men and wounding 57. Kimberly cleared the area 1 April for repairs at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, arriving 25 April. Returning to the fight, she cleared Pearl Harbor 10 August but Japan capitulated as the veteran destroyer steamed to join the 3rd Fleet in the Far East. She entered Tokyo Bay 4 September and 2 days later sailed, escorting . In company with the famed battleship, she arrived Philadelphia 18 October. After Navy Day ceremonies, Kimberly departed Philadelphia 2 November and arrived Charleston, South Carolina, the next day. She remained there until 5 February 1947 when she was placed in reserve. =Korean War= After the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, Kimberly was recommissioned on 8 February 1951, Comdr. O. B. Parker in command. After shakedown out of Guantanamo Bay and exercises along the coast, she cleared Norfolk 15 May 1951, and steamed to the Pacific as reinforcement. She arrived Tokosuka 18 June and 5 days later sailed for fire support operations off the western coast of Korea. The destroyer also acted as ASW screen and plane guard for the aircraft carriers during the raids on enemy positions ashore. In mid- September she arrived off Formosa for patrol operations before sailing 6 October via the Philippines, the Suez Canal, and the Mediterranean, for the United States. Arriving Norfolk 12 December, Kimberly operated along the Atlantic coast and Caribbean on training exercises until she arrived Charleston, South Carolina, 20 June 1953. She remained there and decommissioned 15 January 1954. Kimberly received five battle stars for World War II and one star for Korean War service.  Republic of China Navy (1967-2003)  After 12 years in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Charleston, South Carolina, Kimberly proceeded to Boston Naval Shipyard in July 1966 for overhaul prior to being loaned to the government of the Republic of China. The ship was loaned to Taiwan 1 June 1967, where she served in the Republic of China Navy as ROCS DD-18 An Yang. After modernization with Wu-Jin Project, she became An Yang (DDG-918) in the mid-1980s. She was decommissioned on 16 September 1999 and was sunk as a target on 14 October 2003.

It is famous for the Tatra T3, a tramcar that sold 13,991 units worldwide. History ƒåKD was formed in 1927 from the merger of two smaller companies, ƒåeskomoravsk√°-Kolben (founded 1896, produced machinery for hydro dams) and Breitfeld-Danƒõk (founded 1854, produced machinery for mines and food industry). From 1927 until 1929 ƒåKD's products included a motorcycle designed by Jaroslav Franti≈°ek Koch. It was an advanced four-stroke single-cylinder unit construction double overhead camshaft design of 500cc. It was sold under the marque BD, thus perpetuating the Breitfeld-Danƒõk identity. In 1929 ƒåKD sold its motorcycle business to Praga Hostiva≈ô, which re-branded the motorcycles under the Praga marque. It was one of the main suppliers to the Czechoslovak state of military vehicles during the 1930s. During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II, the company was renamed BMM (B√∂hmisch-M√§hrische Maschinenfabrik AG) and manufactured arms for the Wehrmacht. The company's most notable products in this era were a light tank of the company's own design - the Panzer 38(t) - and the Jagdpanzer 38(t) tank destroyer, which was built on the Panzer 38(t)'s chassis. After the war, ƒåKD was nationalized and became one of the world's leading producers of trams. These were produced by its subsidiary company, ƒåKD TatraPattison, Tony (ed.) (1999).

He exposes his opponents‚Äô errors of fact or logic with ruthless precision.‚Äù Oliver Burkeman, writing in The Guardian, praised Hart's book The Experience of God as \\"the one theology book all atheists really should read\\".

It is a popular holiday resort for people from Greater Asunci√≥n. History The town was founded in 1881 by German and Swiss immigrants, among them Santiago Schaerer, founder and first colony manager, and was renamed after Saint Bernard to honor Bernardino Caballero, president of Paraguay between 1880 and 1886. In the last decades of the nineteenth century was built the Hotel del Lago, where the National Socialist German Dr. Bernhard F√∂rster spent the last six weeks of his life, before committing suicide on June 3, 1889 by taking an overdose of strychnine. Inspired by a letter from Richard Wagner and his own anti-Semitism, he traveled to Paraguay to create a model German settlement with his wife Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche (sister of the philosopher) and several German families. Their efforts, at the site was called Nueva Germania, were not successful, leading him to go to San Bernardino. Tourism San Bernardino is the summer home site of traditional families from Greater Asunci√≥n. The peak tourist season in San Bernardino is from December to mid February, which is the summer season in the country. During this time young people from Asunci√≥n and neighbouring cities and towns meet around the main meeting points, which are clubs and pubs at night and public spaces in the morning. The town contains a museum. Demography According to the Statistics, Surveys and Censuses Bureau of Paraguay, In 2012 San Bernardino has a total of 20,491 inhabitants.

Early life William Cumming was born in Augusta to Thomas and Ann (Clay) Cumming. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) and studied law in Litchfield, Connecticut. When he returned to Augusta, he bought land and became a planter. Military service Cumming joined the militia, becoming captain of an independent company called the Augusta Blues. When the unit was mustered into the regular army for service in the War of 1812 he was commissioned as a major in the 8th Infantry. In February 1814 he was promoted to colonel and named as adjutant general for the Northern Army. Colonel Cumming fought on the St. Lawrence frontier and in the Niagara campaign. He was cited for gallantry and leadership. He was lightly wounded in November 1813 at the Battle of Crysler's Farm. He was seriously wounded at the Battle of Lundy's Lane in July 1814. An extended period of hospitalization ended his participation in the war, and he resigned his commission in March 1815. Planter and politician When he returned home he resumed his career as a planter. While active and outspoken in political arguments Cumming declined several offices, including an election by the state legislature to the United States Senate. In 1822 his strong support of state nullification, and his habit of strong criticism, led to an ongoing dispute with South Carolina Congressman George McDuffie, who favored deference to the federal government. He met McDuffie in a duel and wounded him. The bullet lodged in McDuffie's back and was never removed; the wound caused him to limp for the rest of his life. Later life In 1847, President Polk offered Cumming the rank of Major General to participate in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, but his age and declining health caused him to turn down the offer. Cumming died in Augusta in 1863. The town of Cumming, Georgia is named in his honor.

It sought to achieve this by requiring that farmers leave a proportion of their land out of intensive production. Such land is said to be 'set-aside'. History Set-aside became compulsory in 1992 for large arable farmers as part of the MacSharry reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. It was originally set at 15% and reduced to 10% in 1996. Following the introduction of decoupled payments in 2005, farmers who had historically claimed set-aside were awarded a number of set-aside 'entitlements' equivalent to the area they had previously set-aside. In order to receive payment on these set-aside entitlements, an equivalent number of hectares had to be removed from agricultural production. Set-aside land was shown to be an effective way to improve soil chemistry and increase biodiversity on arable farmland, especially on 5-year non-rotational set-aside. On 16 July 2007, the European Commission (EC) announced its intention to publish a proposal to reduce the set-aside requirement to 0% in 2008, and the proposal was adopted on 26 September 2007. This was to help mitigate current shortages in the EU cereals market, increase cereals supply to the market and therefore reduce prices following two consecutive lower EU harvests. The EC agreed in November 2008 to abolish set-aside completely through the CAP Health Check.

Oil on wood. 375 √ó 196 cm. Pinacoteca Comunale di Volterra, Italy. The Descent from the Cross (, Apokathelosis), or Deposition of Christ, is the scene, as depicted in art, from the Gospels' accounts of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus taking Christ down from the cross after his crucifixion (). In Byzantine art the topic became popular in the 9th century, and in the West from the 10th century. The Descent from the Cross is the 13th Station of the Cross. Other figures not mentioned in the Gospels who are often included in depictions of this subject include John the Evangelist, who is sometimes depicted supporting a fainting Mary (as in the work below by Rogier van der Weyden), and Mary Magdalene. The Gospels mention an undefined number of women as watching the crucifixion, including The Three Marys, (Mary Salome being mentioned in ), and also that the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene saw the burial (). These and further women and unnamed male helpers are often shown.G. Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p.164, Development of the image Pontormo. The Descent from the Cross. 1525‚Äì1528. Peter Paul Rubens. The Descent from the Cross. 1612‚Äì1614. Even in early depictions the details and posing of the composition, and especially the position of Christ's body, are varied. The scene was usually included in medieval cycles of the Life or the Passion of Christ, between the Crucifixion and the Entombment of Christ. The Lamentation of Christ, or Piet√†, showing the body of Christ held by Mary, may intervene between these two, and is common as an individual image, especially in sculpture. The Bearing of the body, showing Christ's body being carried to his tomb, and the Anointing of Christ's body, showing the body laid flat on the top of the tomb or a similarly-shaped \\"anointing-stone\\" are other scenes that may be shown. This last is especially important in Orthodox art, where it is shown on the Epitaphios. With the Renaissance the subject became popular for altarpieces, partly because of the challenges of the composition, and the suitability of its vertical shape. The Mannerist version of Rosso Fiorentino is usually regarded as his most important work, and Pontormo's altarpiece is perhaps his most ambitious work. The subject was painted several times by both Rubens and Rembrandt, who repeated one of his paintings (now in Munich) in a large print, his only one to be mainly engraved, as well as making two other etchings of the subject.

Route The col du Mont-Cenis at the center left of the picture gives access to a large lake, and further away to the Italian peninsula 10 kilometres beyond the pass. The term \\"Mont Cenis\\" could derive from mont des cendres (\\"mountain of ashes\\"). According to tradition, following a forest fire, a great quantity of ashes accumulated on the ground, thus the name. The path of ashes was found during the building work of the route.Gianni Bisio, article from the newspaper la Stampa, 18 April 2001, p.51, Turin Chronicle. The pass connects Val-Cenis in France in the northwest with Susa in Italy in the southeast. Thence the valley of the Dora Riparia is followed to Turin (103.8 km / 64.5 mi from Modane). The carriage road mounts the Arc valley for 25.7 km / 16 mi from Modane to Lanslebourg, whence it is 12.9 km / 8 mi to the hospice, a little way beyond the summit of the pass. The descent lies through the Cenis valley to Susa (49.9 km / 37 mi from Modane) where the road joins the railway. To the southwest of the Mont Cenis is the Little Mont Cenis (2184.2 m / 7166 ft) which leads from the summit plateau (in Italy) of the main pass to the Etache valley on the French slope and so to Bramans in the Arc valley. The pass runs parallel to the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel. This (highest point 1295 m / 4249 ft) is really 27.4 km 17 miles southwest of the pass, below the Col du Fr√©jus. From Chamb√©ry the line runs up the Is√®re valley, but soon bears through that of the Arc or the Maurienne past Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne to Modane (98.2 km / 61 mi from Chamb√©ry). The tunnel is 13 km in length, and leads to Bardonecchia, some way below which, at Oulx the line joins the road from the Col de Montgen√®vre. History In the Middle Ages, pilgrims passing through Moncenisio and Susa Valley came to Turin along a road called the Via Francigena, with a final destination of Rome. In 1414, Niccol√≤ III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara travelled on this route returning from Paris having met Charles VI, and described the Col du Mont Cenis as having \\"a good ascent and bad descent\\". This pass was crossed in 1689 by the Vaudois, and is believed by some authors to have been the pass used by Hannibal to cross the Alps. As an Alpine pass, Mont Cenis featured in several historical incidents. One example is the descent of Constantine I to Italy, to fight against Maxentius. It was the site of a military victory by the French Army of the Alps, led by General-in-Chief Alex Dumas over Piedmontese forces in April 1794, a victory that enabled the French Army of Italy to invade and conquer the Italian peninsula.Tom Reiss, The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012), chapter 12, \\"The Battle for the Top of the World,\\" pp. 160-174. It was the principal route for crossing the Alps between France and Italy until the 19th century. It was also used as the main passage by which Charlemagne crossed with his army to invade Lombardy in 773, and later by Napoleon I. Mont Cenis was one of the most used Alpine passes from the Middle Ages to the nineteenth century. The pass was part of the border between the two countries from the annexation of Savoy to the Second French Empire in 1861 until the 1947 Treaty of Paris, but is now located completely in France. The treaty allowed Savoy to retrieve its historical and political boundaries.Collection de cartes anciennes des Pays de Savoie, 1562-1789, Archives d√©partementales de la Savoie It has historically been part of Route nationale 6. A road over the pass was built between in 1806 by Napoleon to improve military connections. By 1810, it was the most travelled road between France and Italy, as Strasbourg was closed to silk trade traffic from Vienna, leading to Lyon becoming a major trade centre instead. The Mont Cenis Pass Railway was opened alongside the road in 1868, but was dismantled in 1871, on the opening of the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel. It was the first ever railway based on the Fell mountain railway system and was worked by English engine-drivers. The Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel acquired the alternative, and geographically incorrect, name of Mont Cenis Tunnel because the traffic which formerly used the Mont Cenis Pass was transferred to it. Remains of Forte Varisello. When the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont ceded Savoy to France, in 1860, the Mont Cenis became a frontier pass, and consequently a part of Savoy was left on the Italian side. It was therefore highly fortified as a protection against an invasion of the Val di Susa route towards Turin. In 1874-1880 the Italian Regio Esercito built three stone forts: Fort Cassa, Fort Varisello and Fort Roncia, supported by several batteries and fortifications, such as those at top of Mont Malamot. Two further armored batteries, La Court and Paradiso, were added in the early 20th century, while the Fascist government built here part of its underground Alpine Wall. All these fortifications are now in French territory after the boundaries revision in 1947 allowing Savoy to get its historical territory back. The Lac Du Mont Cenis is an artificial dam that was constructed in 1921 on top of the original road and border crossing. It feeds two hydroelectric power plants. The lake is occasionally drained for maintenance. Cycling The pass of Mont Cenis has been featured 5 times in the Tour de France.

Basilica della Collegiata in Catania, designed by Stefano Ittar, Sicilian Baroque is the distinctive form of Baroque architecture which evolved on the island of Sicily, off the southern coast of Italy, in the , when it was part of the Spanish Empire. The style is recognisable not only by its typical Baroque curves and flourishes, but also by its grinning masks and putti and a particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity. The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style had been used on the island in a na√Øve and parochial manner, having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects ‚Äì and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered ‚Äì inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism. The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, and perfectly reflected the social order of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, it was in fact governed by a wealthy and often extravagant aristocracy into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century. Characteristics Illustration 2: University of Catania, designed by Vaccarini and completed by 1752, exemplifies typical Sicilian Baroque, with putti supporting the balcony, wrought iron balustrades, decorated rustication and two-tone lava masonry ‚Äì a reversal of the more conventional rusticated walls and smooth pilasters belfry crowns Rosario Gagliardi's Church of San Giuseppe in Ragusa Ibla mouldings, scrolls and masks was widely copied all over Catania immediately following the quake. Baroque architecture is a European phenomenon originating in 17th-century Italy; it is flamboyant and theatrical, and richly ornamented by architectural sculpture and an effect known as chiaroscuro, the strategic use of light and shade on a building created by mass and shadow. The Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church, and palazzi, the private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy. The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, Florence, and Naples. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By the middle of the 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland, it typically included at least two or three of the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterise in words: # Grotesque masks and putti, often supporting balconies or decorating various bands of the entablature of a building; these grinning or glaring faces are a relic of Sicilian architecture from before the mid-17th century (Illustrations 2 and 9). # Balconies, often complemented by intricate wrought iron balustrades after 1633 (Illustrations 2 and 9), and by plainer balustrades before that date (Illustration 6). # External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were designed for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street fa√ßade, leading to a courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards as many as four times. Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome. # Canted, concave, or convex fa√ßades (Illustrations 1 and 6). Occasionally in a villa or palazzo, an external staircase would be fitted into the recess created by the curve. # The Sicilian belfry. Belfries were not placed beside the church in a campanile tower as is common in Italy, but on the fa√ßade itself, often surmounting the central pediment, with one or more bells clearly displayed beneath its own arch, such as at Catania's Collegiata (Illustration 1). In a large church with many bells this usually resulted in an intricately sculpted and decorated arcade at the highest point of the principal fa√ßade (Illustration 3). These belfries are among the most enduring and characteristic features of Sicilian Baroque architecture. # Inlaid coloured marble set into both floor and walls, especially in church interiors. This particular form of intarsia developed in Sicily from the 17th century (see the floor of illustration 14). # Columns that are often deployed singularly, supporting plain arches and thus displaying the influence of the earlier and much plainer Norman period (Illustration 3). Columns are rarely encountered, as elsewhere in Europe, in clustered groups acting as piers, especially in examples of early Sicilian Baroque. # Decorated rustication. Sebastiano Serlio had decorated the blocks of ashlar in his rustication; by the end of the 16th century, Sicilian architects were ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves, fish-scales, and even sweets and shells; shells were later to become among the most prevalent ornamental symbols of Baroque design. Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls, a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke.(illustration 2) # The local volcanic lava stone that was used in the construction of many Sicilian Baroque buildings, because this was the most readily available. Many sculptors and stone-cutters of the period lived at the foot of Mount Etna, making a diversity of objects, including balustrades, pillars, fountains and seats for buildings. Shades of black or grey were used to create contrasting decorative effects, accentuating the Baroque love of light and shade (chiaroscuro) as demonstrated in (illustration 2). # The Spanish influence. The architectural influence of the ruling Spanish (Illustration 13), although this was a milder influence than that of the Normans. The Spanish style, a more restrained version of French Renaissance architecture, is particularly evident in eastern Sicily, where, owing to minor insurrections, the Spanish maintained a stronger military presence. Messina's 16th-century Porta Grazia (Illustrations 4), built as the entrance to a Spanish Real Cittadella, would not be out of place in any of the towns and citadels built by the Spanish in their colonies elsewhere. The style of this arched city gate, with its ornate mouldings, scrolls and masks was widely copied all over Catania immediately following the earthquake, with many of its features becoming motifs of the Sicilian Baroque. While these characteristics never occur all together in the same building, and none are unique to Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air. Other Baroque characteristics, such as broken pediments over windows, the extravagant use of statuary, curved topped windows and doors and flights of external stairs are all emblematic of Baroque architecture, and can all be found on Baroque buildings all over Europe.  Early Sicilian Baroque  Sicily, a volcanic island in the central Mediterranean, off the Italian peninsula, was colonised by the Greeks, and then ruled by the Romans, the Byzantines, the Ostrogoths, the Muslims, the Normans, the Hohenstaufen, the Angevins, and the Aragonese. It then became a province of the Spanish Empire and later was part of the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, before finally being absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. Thus, Sicilians have been exposed to a rich sequence of disparate cultures, which is reflected in the extraordinary diversity of architecture on the island. Illustration 5: Piazza Pretoria, Palermo. The Fontana Pretoria (circa 1554) by Francesco Camilliani is a rare example of high Renaissance architecture in the capital city. Behind the fountain is the Church of Santa Caterina (circa 1556), with its spectacular Baroque dome (which was added later). A form of decorated classical architecture peculiar to Sicily had begun to evolve from the 1530s. Inspired by the ruined Greek architecture and by the Norman cathedrals on the island, this often incorporated Greek architectural motifs such as the Greek key pattern into late Norman architecture with Gothic features such as pointed arches and window apertures. The Sicilian Norman architecture incorporated some Byzantine elements seldom found in Norman architecture elsewhere, and like other Romanesque architecture it went on to incorporate Gothic features. This early ornate architecture differs from that of mainland Europe in not having evolved from Renaissance architecture; instead, it was developed from Norman styles. Renaissance architecture hardly touched Sicily; in the capital city of Palermo, the only remnant of the High Renaissance is the Fontana Pretoria, a water fountain originally made for Don Pietro di Toleda by Florentine artists Franscesco Cammilliani and Michelangelo Naccerino and brought to Sicily when it was already 20 years old (Illustration 5). Whatever the reason that Renaissance style never became popular in Sicily, it was certainly not ignorance. Antonello Gagini was midway through constructing the in 1536 in the Renaissance style when he died; he was superseded by the architect Antonio Scaglione, who completed the building in a Norman style. This style seems to have influenced Sicilian architecture almost up to the time of the 1693 earthquake. Even Mannerism passed the island by. Only in the architecture of Messina could a Renaissance influence be discerned, partly for geographical reasons: within sight of mainland Italy and the most important port in Sicily, Messina was always more amenable to the prevailing tides of fashion outside the island. The town's aristocratic patrons would often call on Florence or Rome to provide them with an architect; one example was the Florentine Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, who established the Tuscan styles of architecture and sculpture there in the mid-16th century. However, these influences remained largely confined to Messina and the surrounding district. The patronage of the Roman Catholic Church, removed from the influences of Roman fashion, remained conservative in architectural taste and far-reaching in its power. This is not to say that Sicily was completely isolated from trends elsewhere in Europe. Architecture in the island's major cities was strongly influenced by the family of the sculptor Domenico Gagini, who arrived from Florence in 1463. This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with ornate decorative and figurative sculpture. Less than a century after his family had begun to cautiously decorate the island's churches (1531‚Äì1537), Antonello Gagini completed the proscenium-like arch of the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani. This pedimented arch to the sanctuary has pilasters ‚Äì not fluted, but decorated heavily with relief busts of the saints; and, most importantly in terms of architecture, the pediment is adorned by reclining saints supporting swags linked to the central shield that crowns the pediment. This ornate pediment, although still unbroken, was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative architecture. Similar in style is the Chiesa del Ges√π (Illustration 14), constructed between 1564 and 1633, which also shows early signs of the Sicilian Baroque. Illustration 6: Early Sicilian Baroque: Quattro Canti, Palermo, (circa 1610) Thus, a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of those buildings that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during World War II. The earliest example of Baroque on the island is Giulio Lasso's Quattro Canti, an octagonal piazza, or circus, constructed around 1610 at the intersection of the city's two principal streets. Around this intersection are four open sides, being the streets, and four matching buildings with identical canted corners. The sides of the four buildings are curved, further heightening the Baroque design of the buildings lining the circus. These four great buildings dominating the circus are each enhanced by a fountain, reminiscent of those of Pope Sixtus V's Quattro Fontane in Rome. However, in Palermo the Baroque theme continues up three storeys of the buildings, which are adorned with statues in recessed niches depicting the four seasons, the four Spanish kings of Sicily, and the four patronesses of Palermo: Saints Cristina, Ninfa, Olivia, and Agata. While each fa√ßade of Quattro Canti is pleasing to the eye, as a scheme it is both out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, it is evident that during the 17th century the Baroque style in the hands of the local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.  Sicilian Baroque from 1693  = Earthquake and patrons = Illustration 7: Catania and the Palazzo Biscari, begun in 1702. Catania replaced Messina as Sicily's second city after the revolt of 1686. The great Sicilian earthquake of 1693 destroyed at least 45 towns and cities, affecting an area of and causing the deaths of about 60,000 people. The epicentre of the disaster was offshore, although the exact position remains unknown. Towns which suffered severely were Ragusa, Modica, Scicli, and Ispica. Rebuilding began almost immediately. The lavishness of the architecture that was to arise from this disaster is connected with the politics of Sicily at the time: Sicily was still officially under Spanish rule, but rule was effectively delegated to the native aristocracy. This was led by the Duke of Camastra, whom the Spanish had appointed viceroy to appease the aristocracy, who were numerous. The aristocracy was relatively concentrated compared to most of Europe, and a gentry class was missing. In the 18th century, one estimate held that there were 228;noble families, who provided Sicily with a ruling class consisting of 58 princes, 27 dukes, 37 marquesses, 26 counts, one viscount and 79 barons; the Golden Book of the Sicilian nobility (last published in 1926) lists even more. In addition to these were the younger scions of the families, with their courtesy titles of nobile or baron. Architecture was not the only legacy of the Normans. Rule over the peasants (there was no established middle class) was also enforced by a feudal system, unchanged since its introduction following the Norman conquest of 1071. Thus, the Sicilian aristocracy had at their command not only wealth but vast manpower, something that had by this time declined in many other parts of Europe. As in Southern Spain, the huge rural estates remained almost as concentrated as when they had been Roman latifundi. The Sicilian economy, though very largely agriculturally based, was very strong, and became more so during the 18th century as shipping became more efficient and the threat of Muslim piracy died away. The export markets for lemons (for the great 18th century fashion for lemonade) and wines increased greatly, and Sicilian wheat remained, as it had been since Roman times, the backbone of the economy. The disaster that was to give Sicily its modern reputation of poverty, namely the opening-up of the American Midwest to wheat-farming, was a century away. When it came, this permanently cut the price of wheat to less than half, and destroyed the old economy forever. Basilica abbaziale di San Martino delle Scale The aristocracy shared their power only with the Roman Catholic Church. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops were members of the aristocracy. The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from division; however, this was seldom a cheap option as expenses and an ongoing \\"onerous maintenance\\" had to be paid to the Church. Thus, the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This is one of the reasons that so many of the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale. Once rebuilding began, the poor rebuilt their basic housing in the same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one thing, the Spanish viceroy spent six months of the year in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new fa√ßades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus, the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century. = New cities = Syracuse. Andrea Palma's Cathedral of Syracuse (see illustration 11 below) is flanked by Baroque palazzi. Following the earthquake, a program of rebuilding was rapidly put into action, but before it began in earnest some important decisions were made that would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in town planning, decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer piazze and wider main streets, often on a rational grid plan. The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning. The city of Grammichele is an example of these new cities rebuilt to a hexagonal plan. This concept was still very new in the 1690s, and few new cities had had reason to be built in Europe ‚Äì Christopher Wren's city plan after the Great Fire of London in 1666 having been turned down because of the complexities of land ownership there. There were some other examples such as Richelieu, and later Saint Petersburg. The prototype may well have been the new city of Terra del Sole, constructed in 1564. Another of the first towns to be planned using symmetry and order rather than an evolution of small alleys and streets was Alessandria in southern Piedmont. A little later, from 1711, this Baroque form of planning was favoured in the Hispanic colonies of South America, especially by the Portuguese in Brazil. In other parts of Europe, lack of finance, complex land ownership and divided public opinion made radical replanning after disaster too difficult: after 1666, London was rebuilt on its ancient plan, though new extensions to the west were partially on a grid system. In Sicily, public opinion (that of anyone outside the ruling class) counted for nothing, and hence these seemingly revolutionary new concepts of town planning could be freely executed. In Sicily, the decision was taken not just for fashion and appearance but also because it would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace-fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli. One of the finest examples of this new urban planning can be seen at Noto (Illustration 9), the town rebuilt approximately from its original site on Mount Alveria. The old ruined town now known as \\"Noto Antica\\" can still be viewed in its ruinous state. The new site chosen was flatter than the old to better facilitate a linear grid-like plan. The principal streets run east to west so they would benefit from a better light and a sunnier disposition. This example of town planning is directly attributable to a learned local aristocrat, Giovanni Battista Landolina; helped by three local architects, he is credited with planning the new city himself. Illustration 9: Via Nicolasi, Noto In these new towns, the aristocracy was allocated the higher areas, where the air was cooler and fresher and the views finest. The church was placed in the town centre (Illustration 8), both for convenience to all and to reflect the church's global and central position; round the pairing of cathedral and episcopal palazzo vescovile were built the convents. The merchants and storekeepers chose their lots on the planned wider streets leading from the main piazza. Finally, the poor were allowed to erect their simple brick huts and houses in the areas nobody else wanted. Lawyers, doctors, and members of the few professions including the more skilled artisans ‚Äì those who fell between the strictly defined upper and lower class ‚Äì and were able to afford building plots, often lived on the periphery of the commercial and upper class residential sectors, but equally often these people just lived in a larger or grander house than their neighbours in the poorer areas. However, many of the skilled artists working on the rebuilding lived as part of the extended households of their patrons. In this way Baroque town planning came to symbolise and reflect political authority, and later its style and philosophy spread as far as Annapolis and Savannah in English America, and most notably Haussmann's 19th century re-designing of Paris. The stage was now set for the explosion of Baroque architecture, which was to predominate in Sicily until the early 19th century. Later, many other Sicilian towns and cities which had been either little damaged or completely untouched by the earthquake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital were as opulent as that in the second city. In Palermo the , began in 1566, was one of many in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the Baroque style, with coloured marbles. =New churches and palazzi= Cathedral of San Giorgio, Modica Of Sicily's own form of Baroque, post-1693, it has been said, \\"The buildings conceived in the wake of this disaster expressed a light-hearted freedom of decoration whose incongruous gaiety was intended, perhaps, to assuage the horror\\".Mary Miers, \\"Power and Glory: Paintings of the Sicilian Baroque\\" Country Life (1 Nov 2004); reproduced on the website of John Martin Gallery, London. While this is an accurate description of a style which is almost a celebration of joie de vivre in stone, it is unlikely to be the reason for the choice. As with all architectural styles, the selection of style would have directly linked to current fashion. Versailles had been completed in 1688 in a far sterner Baroque style; Louis XIV's new palace was immediately emulated across Europe by any aristocrat or sovereign in Europe aspiring to wealth, taste, or power. Thus, it was the obvious choice for the \\"homeless rich\\" of Sicily, of whom there were hundreds. The excesses of the Baroque-style palazzi and country villas to be constructed in Sicily, however, were soon to make Versailles seem a model of restraint.Architecture of the Baroque Period (French Architecture in the Baroque Period: Versailles) Retrieved 26 February2020 As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were employed to create the new palazzi and churches. These architects, often local, were able to design in a more sophisticated style than those of the late 17th century: many had been trained in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding of the Baroque idiom. Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by the books of engravings by Domenico de' Rossi, who for the first time wrote down text with his engravings, giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque fa√ßades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy. At this stage of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian architect during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, which would have been unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than those which were to come. Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania and Vaccarini's Cattedrale di Sant'Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to be disciplined and almost reined in. The style of Vaccarini, appointed City Architect in 1736, was to dominate Catania for the next decades. A second hindrance to Sicilian architects' fully achieving their potential earlier was that frequently they were only rebuilding a damaged structure, and as a consequence having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in an earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect; Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the fa√ßade's completion in 1760, There were also other influences at work at this time. Between 1718 and 1734 Sicily was ruled personally by Charles VI from Vienna, and as a result close ties with Austrian architecture can be perceived. Several buildings on the island are shameless imitations of the works of Fischer von Erlach, who had begun to rebuild Sch√∂nbrunn Palace in 1686 in a simple form of Baroque; this form was later to be reproduced in Sicily in the final years of its Baroque era. The palace also had an external staircase (removed in 1746) similar to those that later evolved in Sicily. One Sicilian architect, Tommaso Napoli, a monk, visited Vienna twice early in the century, returning with a store of engraving and drawings. He was later the architect of two country villas of the early Sicilian Baroque period, remarkable for their concave and convex walls and the complex design of their external staircases. One villa, his Villa Palagonia in Bagheria, begun in 1705, is the most complex and ingenious of any constructed in Sicily's Baroque era: its double staircase of straight flights, frequently changing direction, was to be the prototype of a distinguishing feature of Sicilian Baroque. Later, a new wave of architects who would master the Baroque sentiments, aware of Rococo interior styles beginning elsewhere to gain an ascendancy over Baroque, would go on to develop the flamboyance and \\"elastic conceptions of space\\" that today are synonymous with the term Sicilian Baroque. High Sicilian Baroque Illustration 11: Cathedral of Syracuse, Andrea Palma's cathedral fa√ßade (begun in 1728). Based on the formula of a Roman triumphal arch, the broken masses within a columned fa√ßade create a theatrical effect. Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding and construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving ever more frequently from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: hilltop churches would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome. Fa√ßades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as \\"either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island\\". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque: it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque style more evident than in Ragusa and Catania. =Ragusa= Ragusa was very badly damaged in 1693. The town is in two halves, divided by a deep ravine known as the \\"Valle dei Ponti\\": the older town of Ragusa Ibla, and the higher Ragusa Superiore. Illustration 12: Rosario Gagliardi's Duomo of San Giorgio in Ragusa Ragusa Ibla, the lower city, boasts an impressive array of Baroque architecture, which includes the Duomo of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church, Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the fa√ßade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820. In an alley connecting Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore is the church of Santa Maria delle Scale. This church is interesting, though badly damaged in the earthquake. Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style, while the surviving half was kept in the original Norman (with Gothic features), thus demonstrating the evolution of Sicilian Baroque. A balcony of the Palazzo Zacco The Palazzo Zacco is one of the more notable Baroque buildings of the city, its Corinthian columns supporting balconies of amazing wrought iron work, while supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building has two street fa√ßades, each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, a frame of acanthus leaves from which a putto leans. The balconies, a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing corbels which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques. The focal points of the principal fa√ßade are the three central balconies, divided by columns with Corinthian capitals. Here the balconies are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces. The Ragusa Cathedral in Ragusa Superiore was built between 1718 and 1778. Its principal fa√ßade is pure Baroque, containing fine carvings and sculptures. The cathedral has a high Sicilian belfry in the same style. The ornate Baroque interior is separated into three colonnaded aisles. Ragusa Superiore was replanned following 1693 around the cathedral and displays an unusual phenomenon of Sicilian Baroque: the palazzi here are peculiar to this town, of only two storeys and long, with the central bay only emphasised by a balcony and an arch to the inner garden. This very Portuguese style, probably designed to minimise damage in future earthquakes, is very different from the palazzi in Ragusa Ibla, which are in true Sicilian style. Unusually, Baroque lingered on here until the early 19th century. The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque form but with columns of Roman Doric and neoclassical balconies. = Catania = Illustration 13: Catania Cathedral. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini's principal fa√ßade of 1736 shows Spanish architectural influences. Sicily's second city, Catania, was the most damaged of all the larger cities in 1693, with only the medieval Castello Ursino and three tribunes of the cathedral remaining; thus it was replanned and rebuilt. The new design separated the city into quarters, divided by two roads meeting at an intersection known as the Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). Rebuilding was supervised by the Bishop of Catania, and the city's only surviving architect, . Di Benedetto headed a team of junior architects called in from Messina, which quickly began to rebuild, concentrating first on the Piazza del Duomo. Three palazzi are situated here, the Bishop's Palace, the Seminario and one other. The architects worked in complete harmony and it is impossible to distinguish di Benedetto's work from that of his junior colleagues. The work is competent but not remarkable, with decorated rustication in the 17th- century Sicilian style, but often the decoration on the upper floors is superficial. This is typical of the Baroque of this period immediately after the earthquake. In 1730, Vaccarini arrived in Catania as the appointed city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style. The pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type cornices and entablatures, or curved pediments, and free-standing columns support balconies. Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature rather than a general building material, using it intermittently with other materials, and spectacularly for an obelisk supported on the back of the Catanian heraldic elephant, for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal fa√ßade to Catania's cathedral, dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences even at this late stage of Sicilian Baroque. Also in the city is Stefano Ittar's Basilica della Collegiata, built around 1768, and an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most stylistically simple.  Church interiors  Illustration 14: Chiesa del Ges√π, Palermo (1564‚Äì1633), with abundant use of polychrome marble on the floor and walls Illustration 15: The nun's choir in the Church of San Benedetto, Catania Sicilian church exteriors had been decorated in elaborate styles from the first quarter of the 17th century, with ample use of sculpture, stucco, frescoes, and marble (Illustration 14). As the post-earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this external decoration, becoming lighter and less intense (compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15), with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars, cornices, and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and fauna. Inlaid coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style. These patterns with their roundels of porphyry are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The high altar is usually the pi√®ce de resistance: in many instances a single block of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and festoons, and frequently inset with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate. Steps leading to the altar dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles. An example of this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo. The building of Sicily's churches would typically be funded not just by individual religious orders but also by an aristocratic family. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of Sicily's nobility did not choose to have their mortal remains displayed for eternity in the Catacombe dei Cappuccini, but were buried quite conventionally in vaults beneath their family churches. It has been said, though, that \\"the funeral of a Sicilian aristocrat was one of the great moments of his life, and the luxury he had enjoyed in this life was to lead him into the next\\". Funerals became tremendous shows of wealth; a result of this ostentation was that the stone memorial slabs covering the burial vaults today provide an accurate barometer of the development of Baroque and marble inlay techniques at any specific time. For instance, those from the first half of the 17th century are of simple white marble decorated with an incised armorial bearing, name, date, etc. From , small quantities of coloured marble inlay appear, forming patterns, and this can be seen developing until, by the end of the century, the coats of arms and calligraphy are entirely of inset coloured marble, with decorative patterned borders. Long after Baroque began to fall from fashion in the 1780s, Baroque decor was still deemed more suitable for Catholic ritual than the new, pagan-based neoclassicism. The Church of San Benedetto in Catania (Illustration 15) is a fine example of a Sicilian Baroque interior, decorated between 1726 and 1762, the period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and individuality. The ceilings were frescoed by the artist Giovanni Tuccari. The most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nuns' choir (Illustration 15), created , which was designed in such a way that the nuns' voices could be heard during services, but the nuns themselves were still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside. Palazzi interiors Palazzo Gangi, Palermo Frequently the interiors of the palazzi are less elaborate than those of Sicily's Baroque churches. Many were finished with little ornate interior decoration because they took so long to build: by the time they were completed, Baroque had passed from fashion; in these cases, the principal rooms were frequently decorated in a neoclassical style influenced by the late 18th century Sicilian Anglomania and particularly an admiration of Robert Adam and Wedgewood pottery. However, in true Sicilian style, even this more chaste style would often be embellished with Baroque trompe-l'≈ìil figures and colourful Sicilian tiled floors, such as can be found at the Villa Spedalotto at Bagheria. Often a fusion of the two styles is found, as in the ballroom wing of the Palazzo Ajutamicristo in Palermo, built by Andrea Giganti in 1763, where the ballroom ceiling was frescoed by Giuseppe Crestadoro with allegorical scenes framed by Baroque gilded motifs in plaster. This ceiling was already old-fashioned when it was finished, and the rest of the room was decorated in a far simpler mode. When Baroque interior decoration did occur, as elsewhere in Italy, the finest and most decorated rooms were those on the piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Occasionally, however, the late date of completion means that the decoration can be described as Rococo ‚Äì the flamboyant swan song of the Baroque era. A further reason for the absence of Baroque decoration, and the most common, is that most rooms were never intended for public view and, therefore, expensive decoration. Many of the palazzi were vast; the Palazzo Biscari has 700 rooms.Palazzo Biscari Retrieved 25 February 2020 This was necessary because the household of a Sicilian aristocrat, beginning with himself, his wife and many children, would typically also contain a collection of poorer relatives and other extended family members, all of whom had minor apartments in the house. Moreover, there were paid employees, often including a private chaplain or confessor, a majordomo, governesses, secretary, archivist, accountant, librarian, and innumerable lower servants, such as a porter to ring a bell a prescribed number of times according to the rank of an approaching guest. Often the servants' extended families, especially if elderly, also lived in the palazzo. Thus, many rooms were needed to house the household. These everyday living quarters, even the bedrooms of \\"Maestro and Maestra di Casa\\", were often simply decorated and furnished. G√©rard Gefen states in his book Sicily, Land of the Leopard Princes that bedrooms were kept austere as they were rooms for fighting off temptation and sin as much as for sleeping. Further rooms were required by the Sicilian tradition that it was a sign of poor breeding to permit even mere acquaintances to stay in local inns. Any visiting foreigner, especially from a distant European metropolis, was regarded as a special trophy and added social prestige. Hence the Sicilian aristocrat's home was seldom empty or quiet. Illustration 17: The flamboyant staircase at the Palazzo Biscari The rooms of the piano nobile were entered formally from an external Baroque double staircase: they consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, but by the end of the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 16), a building described as \\"Sicily's most famous palazzo\\". This room with its frescoed ceiling by is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style. Baroque interior decoration eventually reached such an exuberance that it became known as Rococo: this is exemplified by the internal staircase (Illustration 17) at the Palazzo Biscari, completed in 1763.Lauren Beeching, \\"Striking stairwells that make climbing to the second floor enjoyable\\", Designcurial, 7 July 2016. Furniture during the Baroque era was in keeping with the style: ornate, gilded and frequently with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for a certain room, for example to match a silk wall panel within a gilt frame. For the greater part of the 18th century furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was always left empty: an arrangement which displayed the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned floor tiles. Common to both church and palazzi interior design was the stucco work. Stucco is an important component of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'≈ìil ceilings and walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, in a private house it might represent musical instruments or the owner's favourite foods. Changing use over the past 250 years has simplified palazzo decor further, as the ground floors are now usually shops, banks, or restaurants, and the upper floors divided into apartments, their interiors lost or decayed.  Late Sicilian Baroque  Illustration 18: Palazzo Beneventano del Bosco (1779), Syracuse, designed by Luciano Al√¨ in restrained late Sicilian Baroque. The wrought iron balconies and sweeping curves, however, keep the approaching neoclassicism at bay. Baroque eventually went out of fashion. In some parts of Europe, it metamorphosed into the Rococo, but not in Sicily where the Rococo is only found internally. No longer ruled by Austria, Sicily, from 1735 officially the Kingdom of Sicily, was ruled by the King of Naples, Ferdinand IV. Hence Palermo was in constant association with the principal capital Naples, where there was architecturally a growing reversion to the more classical styles of architecture. Coupled with this, many of the more cultured Sicilian nobility developed a fashionable obsession with all things French, from philosophy to arts, fashion, and architecture. Many of them visited Paris in pursuit of these interests and returned with the latest architectural engravings and theoretical treatises. The \\"Entrance Temple\\" to the Orto botanico di Palermo The French architect was in Sicily between 1787 and 1794 to study and analyse the ancient Greek temples on the island. Thus Sicilians rediscovered their ancient past, which with its classical idioms was now the height of fashion. The change in tastes did not come about overnight. Baroque remained popular on the island, but now Sicilian balconies, extravagant as ever, would be placed next to severe classical columns. Dufourny began designing in Palermo, and his \\"Entrance Temple\\" (1789) to the Palermo Botanical Garden was the first building in Sicily in a style based on the Greek Doric order. It is pure neoclassical architecture, as established in England since 1760, and it was a sign of things to come. Illustration 21: Palazzo Belmonte Riso (1784), restrained late Sicilian Baroque with more dominant neoclassical features. The upper windows have neoclassical pediments, while the piano nobile has Baroque pediments and a balcony with decorated corbels. The pilasters have decorated Baroque capitals, but are otherwise simple and unadorned. It was Dufourny's great friend and fellow architect Giuseppe Marvuglia who was to preside over the gradual decline of Sicilian Baroque. In 1784 he designed the Palazzo Belmonte Riso (Illustration 21), a good example of the period of architectural transition, combining both Baroque and neoclassical motifs, built around an arcaded courtyard providing Baroque masses of light and shade, or chiaroscuro. The main fa√ßade, punctuated by giant pilasters, also had Baroque features, but the skyline was unbroken. The pilasters were undecorated, simple, and Ionic, and supported an undecorated entablature. Above the windows were classical unbroken pediments. Sicilian Baroque was waning. By the closing years of the 18th century, impoverished Sicily was ruled from Naples by the weak Ferdinand IV and his dominant wife. In 1798 and again in 1806, the King was forced by the invading French to flee Naples to Sicily. The French were only kept at bay from Sicily by an expeditionary force of 17,000 British troops, and Sicily was now ruled by Britain in effect if not in name. King Ferdinand then in 1811 imposed Sicily's first tax, at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy. However, the British influence in Sicily was to provide Sicilian Baroque with one last flourish. Marvuglia, recognising the new fashion for all things British, developed the style he had first cautiously used at Palazzo Belmonte Riso in 1784, combining some of the plainer, more solid elements of Baroque with Palladian motifs rather than Palladian designs. The late Sicilian Baroque was similar in style to the Baroque popular in England at the beginning of the 18th century, popularised by Sir John Vanbrugh with such edifices as Blenheim Palace. An example is Marvuglia's Church of San Francesco di Sales, which is almost English in its interpretation of Baroque. However, this was only a temporary success and the neoclassical style was soon dominant. Few aristocrats could now afford to build, and the new style was mainly used in public and civil buildings such as those at the Palermo Botanical Garden. Sicilian architects ‚Äì even Andrea Giganti, once a competent architect in Baroque ‚Äì now began to design in the neoclassical style, but in the version of the neoclassical adopted by fashionable France. An example is his Villa Galletti at Bagheria, inspired by the work of Ange-Jacques Gabriel. A contemporary traveller, the Comte de Borch, noted the French influence, describing the villa as \\"d√©cor√©e √† la fran√ßaise, avec trumeaux, boiseries l√©g√®res, etc.\\" Decline The decline of Sicilian Baroque was inevitable. Not only were tastes changing generally, but the aristocratic money was running out. During the 17th century, the aristocracy had lived principally on their landed estates, tending and improving them, and as a result their income also increased. During the 18th century, the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities, in particular Palermo, to enjoy the social delights of the Viceroy's court and Catania. Their town palazzi grew in size and splendour, to the detriment of the abandoned estates, which were still expected to provide the revenue. The land agents left to run the estates over time became less efficient, or corrupt, often both. Consequently, aristocratic incomes fell. The aristocracy borrowed money using the estates as surety, until the value of the neglected estates fell below the money borrowed against them. Moreover, Sicily was by now as unstable politically as its nobility were financially. Ferdinand's unpopular tax of 1811 was rescinded by the British in 1812, who then imposed a British style constitution on the island. One legal innovation of this time of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a loan or mortgage, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821 and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism was in the air. These factors, coupled with the social and political upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century, meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class, having to live off their capital. Immediately following the Risorgimento, Sicily's annexation to the new Italian state was economically disastrous for the island, in no small part due to the relaxation of foreign exchange, which was advantageous only to the more industrial north of the new kingdom, but forced the more agricultural south to compete in the North American commodity markets. Furthermore, because of their neglect and dereliction of noblesse oblige, an essential element of the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The dominance of the Sicilian upper class was over. Illustration 19: Palazzo Ducezio at Noto As with the early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first buildings of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play of light and shadow is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.  Legacy  Sicilian Baroque is today recognised as an architectural style, largely due to the work of Sacheverall Sitwell, whose Southern Baroque Art of 1924 was the first book to appreciate the style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt in 1968. Most of the Baroque palazzi continued in private ownership throughout the 19th century, as the old aristocracy either married middle-class money or fell further into debt. There were a few exceptions and some of these still retain their ancestral palazzi today. Thanks to the continuing religious devotion of the Sicilian people, many of the Sicilian Baroque churches are today still in the use for which they were designed. Large parts of Messina, rebuilt after the 1693 earthquake, were destroyed by another in 1908. Illustration 20: Palazzo Lampedusa in Palermo However, much of the blame for the decay and ruinous state of preservation of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but on the political agendas of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair, and also some of those that didn‚Äôt, including Palazzo Lampedusa, the Palermo home of the Princes of Lampedusa, are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold. The remaining members of the Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism a major source of income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The princes, marquesses, and counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today that both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage. As Sicily now becomes a more politically stable, secure and less corrupt environment, the Baroque palazzi are slowly beginning to open their doors to an eager paying public, American and Northern European as much as Italian. In 1963, when the movie The Leopard was released, the Gangi Palace ballroom was almost unique in having been a film set, but today long unused salons and ballrooms are hosting corporate and public events. Some palazzi are offering a bed and breakfast service to paying guests, once again providing impressive hospitality to visitors to Sicily, the purpose for which they were originally intended. In 2002, UNESCO selectively included Baroque monuments of Val di Noto into its World Heritage List as \\"providing outstanding testimony to the exuberant genius of late Baroque art and architecture\\" and \\"representing the culmination and final flowering of Baroque art in Europe.\\"Noto (Italy)\\".

At the low end of the spectrum is a simple binding of a single word or phrase and its definition. At the high end is a full ontology that specifies relationships between data elements using precise URIs for relationships and properties. With increased specificity comes increased precision and the ability to use tools to automatically integrate systems but also increased cost to build and maintain a metadata registry. Some steps in the semantic spectrum include the following: # glossary: A simple list of terms and their definitions. A glossary focuses on creating a complete list of the terminology of domain- specific terms and acronyms. It is useful for creating clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and because it can be created with simple word processing tools, few technical tools are necessary. # controlled vocabulary: A simple list of terms, definitions and naming conventions. A controlled vocabulary frequently has some type of oversight process associated with adding or removing data element definitions to ensure consistency. Terms are often defined in relationship to each other. # data dictionary: Terms, definitions, naming conventions and one or more representations of the data elements in a computer system. Data dictionaries often define data types, validation checks such as enumerated values and the formal definitions of each of the enumerated values. # data model: Terms, definitions, naming conventions, representations and one or more representations of the data elements as well as the beginning of specification of the relationships between data elements including abstractions and containers. # taxonomy: A complete data model in an inheritance hierarchy where all data elements inherit their behaviors from a single \\"super data element\\". The difference between a data model and a formal taxonomy is the arrangement of data elements into a formal tree structure where each element in the tree is a formally defined concept with associated properties. # ontology: A complete, machine- readable specification of a conceptualization using URIs (and then IRIs) for all data elements, properties and relationship types. The W3C standard language for representing ontologies is the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Ontologies frequently contain formal business rules formed in discrete logic statements that relate data elements to each another. Typical questions for determining semantic precision The following is a list of questions that may arise in determining semantic precision. ;correctness: How can correct syntax and semantics be enforced? Are tools (such as XML Schema) readily available to validate syntax of data exchanges? ;adequacy/expressivity/scope: Does the system represent everything that is of practical use for the purpose? Is an emphasis being placed on data that is externalized (exposed or transferred between systems)? ;efficiency: How efficiently can the representation be searched / queried, and - possibly - reasoned on? ;complexity: How steep is the learning curve for defining new concepts, querying for them or constraining them? are there appropriate tools for simplifying typical workflows? (See also: ontology editor) ;translatability: Can the representation easily be transformed (e.g. by Vocabulary-based transformation) into an equivalent representation so that semantic equivalence is ensured? =Determining location on the semantic spectrum= Many organizations today are building a metadata registry to store their data definitions and to perform metadata publishing. The question of where they are on the semantic spectrum frequently arises. To determine where your systems are, some of the following questions are frequently useful. # Is there a centralized glossary of terms for the subject matter? # Does the glossary of terms include precise definitions for each terms? # Is there a central repository to store data elements that includes data types information? # Is there an approval process associated with the creation and changes to data elements? # Are coded data elements fully enumerated? Does each enumeration have a full definition? # Is there a process in place to remove duplicate or redundant data elements from the metadata registry? # Is there one or more classification schemes used to classify data elements? # Are document exchanges and web services created using the data elements? # Can the central metadata registry be used as part of a Model-driven architecture? # Are there staff members trained to extract data elements that can be reused in metadata structures? Strategic nature of semantics Today, much of the World Wide Web is stored as Hypertext Markup Language. Search engines are severely hampered by their inability to understand the meaning of published web pages. These limitations have led to the advent of the Semantic web movement. In the past, many organizations that created custom database application used isolated teams of developers that did not formally publish their data definitions. These teams frequently used internal data definitions that were incompatible with other computer systems. This made Enterprise Application Integration and Data warehousing extremely difficult and costly. Many organizations today require that teams consult a centralized data registry before new applications are created. The job title of an individual that is responsible for coordinating an organization's data is a Data architect.  History  The first reference to this term was at the 1999 AAAI Ontologies Panel. The panel was organized by Chris Welty, who at the prodding of Fritz Lehmann and in collaboration with the panelists (Fritz, Mike Uschold, Mike Gruninger, and Deborah McGuinness) came up with a \\"spectrum\\" of kinds of information systems that were, at the time, referred to as ontologies. The \\"ontology spectrum\\" picture appeared in print in the introduction to Formal Ontology and Information Systems: Proceedings of the 2001 Conference. The ontology spectrum was also featured in a talk at the Semantics for the Web meeting in 2000 at Dagstuhl by Deborah McGuinness. McGuinness produced a paper describing the points on that spectrum that appeared in the book that emerged (much later) from that workshop called \\"Spinning the Semantic Web.\\" Later, Leo Obrst extended the spectrum into two dimensions (which technically is not really a spectrum anymore) and added a lot more detail, which was included in his book, The Semantic Web: A Guide to the Future of XML, Web Services, and Knowledge Management. The concept of the Semantic precision in business systems was popularized by Dave McComb in his book Semantics in Business Systems: The Savvy Managers Guide published in 2003 where he frequently uses the term Semantic Precision. This discussion centered around a 10 level partition that included the following levels (listed in the order of increasing semantic precision): # Simple Catalog of Data Elements # Glossary of Terms and Definitions # Thesauri, Narrow Terms, Relationships # Informal \\"Is-a\\" relationships # Formal \\"Is-a\\" relationships # Formal instances # Frames (properties) # Value Restrictions # Disjointness, Inverse, Part-of # General Logical Constraints Note that there was a special emphasis on the adding of formal is-a relationships to the spectrum which seems to have been dropped. The company Cerebra has also popularized this concept by describing the data formats that exist within an enterprise in their ability to store semantically precise metadata. Their list includes: # HTML # PDF # Word Processing documents # Microsoft Excel # Relational databases # XML # XML Schema # Taxonomies # Ontologies What the concepts share in common is the ability to store information with increasing precision to facilitate intelligent agents.

Nevertheless, an army of around 8000‚Äîmostly cavalry‚Äîwas raised and assembled at the battle ground of Miani. Disastrously for the Talpur Amirs another 8000 troops under Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur (later known as Sher-e-Sindh or \\"Lion of Sindh\\") failed to reach the battle ground in time. Napier had already successfully isolated the Amir of Khairpur (thereafter known as the great traitor by the Sindhi) by bribery and title. Thus the Baluchi army assembled at Miani represented approximately a third of the potential military strength in Sindh. Although the East India Company later gave its troops numbered in the battle as around 2800, contemporary Talpur records indicated the armies were approximately equal in numbers (around 8‚Äì10 thousand each) with the British having around 2500 European officers and soldiers and the balance being Indian sepoys. The difference in military technology and tactics was enormous. The East India Company's army was led by professionally trained British officers and troops and the Indian Sepoys were also well trained and disciplined. They were armed with smoothbore percussion or flintlock Brown Bess muskets, which were accurate to 50‚Äì100 yards, and supported by modern artillery. In contrast, the Baluchi army consisted mostly of cavalry armed with muskets, spears and swords and some old artillery pieces acquired from Persia. The tactic was the favoured cavalry charge. Contemporary records indicate that the Baluchi army's morale was very high with the battle slogan being \\"we will die but not give up Sindh\\". Indeed, the Baluchis died in thousands, in four-to-five hours of carnage, the Baluchi horsemen charged in wave after wave and was mostly cut down long before they could reach British lines by rifle and artillery fire. When they did eventually reach British lines and, according to Napier himself in his book on the battle (Conquest of Sindh), he had to ride amongst his officers and troops to stop them from falling back in disarray in the face of the ferocity of the Baluch who had reached the British lines. Of the Baluch army of 8000 at Miani, around six thousand Baluch were killed. Reliable sources put the British casualties as 256The History of British India: A Chronology by John F. Riddick as kept by the East India company's paymasters while according to the Baluch, the Company's army suffered 3000 dead (although Napier gives a much lower casualty figure as he does for his total force). In famous book on history of Sindh 'Jannat ul Sindh' Molai Shedai writes that. \\"At the time of start of war at early morning at first one band of English army moved a head into the battle feild so that the hidden part of Talpur army might come out of the bushes\\". \\"At beginning Mir Jan Muhammad fought with stretegy and Charles Napier was sure of defeat. English cavalry bands attacked from right and left sides and Mir Jan Muhammad was martyred and Mir Ghulam Shah took over the command. John Jackab leading 1000 cavalry attacked through the bed of Phuleli canal and at once moved back with deception and Talpur army thought it retreat and their lines stood broken and they followed the cavalry and reached across the banks of Phuleli where English artillery was staged at hidden place and English army opened the artillery upon them continuously for three hours .One cannonball hit against the ammunition of Talpur army which was completely destroyed. After noon time one band of Ligharis was retreated then Thorha then Bahawal Khan ran from battlefield who was followed by Nawab Ahmed Lighari who also snatched the flag from Soomar before leaving the battlefield. Mir Naseer and Shahdad wanted to fight till last breath but their army was fleeing from battlefield .About 4000 were among them who left away without any order. One cannonball fall nearby and Suleman, personal servant of the Meer was martyred. It appeared that army of Meers was under siege. Chang, Gopang, Mari and Nizamani were still fighting in battlefield. English army took control of the artillery of Meers due to support of one of in charge of the artillery who was Mr Hawel. At one moment Charles Napier came under attack but was saved by Lieut. Marston. At last moments Mir Hussain Ali Khan also ran away from battlefield. Looking to the situation Mir Naseer Khan also left the battlefield along with 1200 cavalry and came at the Fort of Hyderabad. During a three-hour face to face battle only 27 soldiers of English Army died and became injured. From officers Major Tezdil, Major Jackson, Capt. Maddy, Capt. Tieve, Capt. Cookson, Lieut. Wood died and Lieut. Penny Father, Major Welly, Capt. Tucker, Cap. Convey, Lieut. Harding and Feri became injured. About 20 British officers died and four officers from infantry were amongst them. About 5000 from Talpurs'army died. Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, Talha khan Nizamani, Ghulam Hussain khan Nizamani, Abdullah Khan, Ali Bungash, Gohar Khan Hajizai, Naseer Khan Chang, Mir Ghulam Shah, Mir Mubarak Khan Bihrani and others were among them. During 3 hours battle only one Irish soldier could stab bayonet at the chest of one Balouch soldier who was also killed by the other with sword as dead bodies of the both were found together. Capt. Postins in his book 'Personal observation of Sindh' while mentioning about battle of Miani wrote that' People of Sindh fought against the English army like persons who may fight for something which is more dearer to them than their lives'.Rahimdad Khan Molai Shedai; Janat ul Sindh,3rd edition 1993, pp. 339‚Äì342; Sindhi Adbi Board Jamshoro Later, on March 24, 1843, Mir Sher Muhammad Khan Talpur, reached Hyderabad with his private army of around 8000 and tried to liberate Sindh from the occupation of the British East India Company forces. He sent Napier a message giving the General 48 hours to vacate the Hyderabad Fort. Napier who was firmly entrenched in Hyderabad Fort and had recently been reinforced from Bombay replied by firing his artillery from the Fort walls. Mir Sher Muhammad Khan Talpur was subsequently defeated in the Battle of Dubba and thereafter he went to Punjab to seek help from Maharaja Ranjeet Singh, the Sikh ruler of the Punjab. The Maharaja extended hospitality but declined to become involved. Sher Muhammad Khan then went to the Khan of Kalat to seek assistance, but the Khanate of Kalat had already suffered a defeat by the British in 1838 and was in no position to help. Eventually after 10 years, Mir Sher Muhammad returned to Sindh and surrendered to the British and the East India Company gave him amnesty. The amirs of Hyderabad suffered great loss, their fort was plundered, and amirs themselves were exiled to Andaman Islands ‚Äì never to see Sindh again. Napier's post-conquest occupation of Sindh was absolute. Fifteen years later when the Indian Mutiny or 'War of Independence' in 1857 broke out, no shots were fired in Sindh. His manipulations of the history of his interactions with the Talpur dynasty and the history of the battle were likewise absolute and designed to glorify his position. However, debates that took place in the British Parliament for the post-conquest show the degree of concern that existed in UK on the action he had taken in Sindh. The battle honours of \\"Meeanee\\" and \\"Hyderabad\\" are shared by the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment and a number of Indian regiments, whereas that of \\"Scinde\\" is borne by the Cheshire Regiment alone. Casualties Five thousand Sindhis were killed or wounded while fighting the British.MiƒÅni - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 17, p. 315. The fallen Amirs of Sindh consisted of Mir Nasir Khan Talpur, his nephews Mir Shadad Khan Talpur, Mir Hussein Ali Khan Talpur, Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur, the Subedar of Hyderabad, Mir Rustam Khan Talpur, Nasir Talpur, Wali Mohammad Khan Talpur of Khairpur. Others such as Mir Ali Murad Khan Talpur was taken aboard the sloop and exiled to Burma.Personal observations on Sindh: the manners and customs of its inhabitants; and its productive capabilities A British journal said of the captive Sindhi Amirs: \\"The Amirs as being the prisoners of the state are maintained in strict seclusion; they are described as Broken-Hearted and Miserable men, maintaining much of the dignity of fallen greatness, and without any querulous or angry complainings at this unallevable source of sorrow, refusing to be comforted\\".

This underdeveloped area was hit hard by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and is undergoing a number of major development projects including the construction of a new sea port and international airport finished in 2013. These projects and others such as Hambantota Cricket Stadium are said to form part of the government's plan to transform Hambantota into the second major urban hub of Sri Lanka, away from Colombo. History When the Kingdom of Ruhuna was established it received many travellers and traders from Siam, China and Indonesia who sought anchorage in the natural harbor at Godawaya, Ambalantota. The ships or large boats these traders travelled in were called \\"Sampans\\" and thota means port or anchorage so the port where sampans anchor came to be known as Sampantota (which is now known as Godawaya). After some time the area came to be called Hambantota. =Ancient Hambantota= Hambantota District is part of the traditional south known as Ruhuna. In ancient times this region, especially Hambantota and the neighboring areas was the centre of a flourishing civilization. Historical evidence reveals that the region in that era was blessed with fertile fields and a stupendous irrigation network. Hambantota was known by many names Mahagama, Ruhuna and Dolos dahas rata. About 200 BC, the first Kingdom of Sri Lanka was flourishing in the north central region of Anuradhapura. After a personal dispute with his brother, King Devanampiyatissa of Anuradhapura, King Mahanaga established the Kingdom of Ruhuna in the south of the island. This region played a vital role in building the nation as well as nurturing the Sri Lankan Buddhist culture. Close to Hambantota, the large temple of Tissamaharama was built to house a sacred tooth relic. =Modern history= Around the years of 1801 and 1803, the British built a Martello tower on the tip of the rocky headland alongside the lighthouse overlooking the sea at Hambantota. The builder was a Captain Goper, who built the tower on the site of an earlier Dutch earthen fort. The tower was restored in 1999, and in the past, formed part of an office of the Hambantota Kachcheri where the Land Registry branch was housed. Today it houses a fisheries museum. From 2 August to 9 September 1803, an Ensign J. Prendergast of the regiment of Ceylon native infantry was in command of the British colony at Hambantota during a Kandian attack that he was able to repel with the assistance of the snow ship Minerva.The Asiatic annual register, or, A View of the history of ..., Volume 8, Issue 1, p.74. Earlier, had touched there and left off eight men from the Royal Artillery to reinforce him. This detachment participated in Prendergast's successful defense of the colony. If the tower at Hambantota was at all involved in repelling any attack this would be one of the only cases in which a British Martello tower had been involved in combat. Leonard Woolf, future husband of Virginia Woolf, was the British colonial administrator at Hambantota between 1908 and 1911. =2004 Indian Ocean earthquake= The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami devastated Hambantota, and reportedly killed more than 4500 people. Climate Hambantota features a tropical wet and dry climate (Aw) under the K√∂ppen climate classification. There is no true dry season, but there is significantly less rain from January‚ÄìMarch and again from June‚ÄìAugust. The heaviest rain falls in October and November. The city sees on average roughly of precipitation annually. Average temperatures in Hambantota change little throughout the year, ranging from in January to in April and May.  Demographics  Hambantota Town is Buddhist majority. Islam is the second largest religion in the town. There are also small numbers of Christians and Hindus. Source:statistics.gov.lk Economy and infrastructure A cement grinding and bagging factory is being set up, as well as fertiliser bagging plants. Large salt plains are a prominent feature of Hambantota. The town is a major producer of salt. A Special Economic Zone of has been proposed by Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, out of which approximately will be situated in Hambantota to build factories, LNG plants and refineries while the rest will be in Monaragala, Embilipitiya and Matara. A Vocational training Center was opened in 2017 by Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with China to train the workforce needed for the SEZs. Wickramasinghe also came in to an agreement with state-owned China Merchants Port Holdings to lease 70 per cent stake of the strategically-located Hambantota port at $1.12 billion, opening Hambantota to the Belt and Road Initiative. = Transportation =  Air  Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) is located in the town of Mattala, north of Hambantota. Opened in March 2013, it is the second international airport in Sri Lanka after Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo, but is not being used. The Weerawila Airport is also located nearby.  Road  A2 highway connects Colombo with Hambantota town through Galle and Matara. The Southern Expressway from Kottawa to Matara will be connected to Hambantota via Beliatta  Rail  Construction work started in 2006 on the Matara-Kataragama Railway Line project, a broad gauge railway being implemented at an estimated cost of $91 million.Massive Development in Hambantota District , Media Centre for National Development in Sri Lanka, retrieved 2010-01-19 =Energy= NEG Micon M1500-600 wind turbines in Hambanthota Wind Farm The Hambantota Wind Farm is the first wind farm in Sri Lanka (there are two more commercial wind farms). It's a pilot project to test wind power generation in the island nation. Wind energy development faces immense obstacles such as poor roads and an unstable power grid. =Port= Hambantota Port Hambantota is the selected site for a new international port, the Port of Hambantota. It was scheduled to be built in three phases, with the first phase due to be completed by the end of 2010 at a cost of $360 million. As part of the port, a $550 million tax-free port zone is being started, with companies in India, China, Russia and Dubai expressing interest in setting up shipbuilding, ship-repair and warehousing facilities in the zone. The port officially opened on November 18, 2010, at the end of the first phase of construction. When all phases are fully complete, it will be able to berth 33 vessels, which would make it the biggest port in South Asia. Bunkering facility: 14 tanks (8 for oil, 3 for aviation fuel and 3 for LP gas) with a total capacity of .http://www.colombopage.com/archive_14B/Jul08_1404836212CH.php But in the whole of 2012 only 34 ships berthed at Hambantota, compared with 3,667 ships at the port of Colombo. Sri Lanka was still heavily in debt to China for the cost of the port and with so little traffic, was unable to service the debt. In 2017 China was given a 99-year lease for the port in exchange for $1.1 billion. The involvement of Chinese companies in the development of Hambantota port have provoked claims by some analysts that it is part of China's String of Pearls strategy. Other analysts have argued that it would not be in Sri Lanka's interests to allow the Chinese navy access to the port and in any event the exposed nature of the port would make it of dubious value to China in time of conflict. In November 2019, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa indicated that the Sri Lankan government would try to undo the 99-year lease of the port and return to the original loan repayment schedule. As of August, 2020 the 99-year lease was still in place. Culture Hambantota contains the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium for sports activities. It has a capacity of 35,000 seats and was built for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. The cost of this project is an estimated Rs. 900 million (US$7.86m). Sri Lanka Cricket is seeking relief from its debts incurred in building infrastructure for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Magam Ruhunupura International Conference Hall (MRICH) was built for local and international events. The MRICH, situated in a 28-acre plot of land in Siribopura, is Sri Lanka's second international conference hall. The main hall has 1,500 seats and there are three additional halls with a seating capacity of 250 each. The conference hall is fully equipped with modern technical facilities and a vehicle park for 400 vehicles and a helipad for helicopter landing.http://www.ft.lk/2013/11/08/president-opens- international-convention-center-in-hambantota-ahead-of-chogm/#comment-877716 On 31 March 2010, a surprise bid was made for the 2018 Commonwealth Games by Hambantota. Hambantota is undergoing a major face lift since the tsunami. On 10 November 2011, the Hambantota bidders claimed they had already secured enough votes to win the hosting rights. However, on 11 November it was officially announced that Gold Coast City had won the rights to host the games. Twin cities Hambantota is twinned with Guangzhou, China, since 2007.

He worked for the U.S. Patent Office, and became a principal examiner in 1851. In 1869 he joined the Office of Weights and Measures, a part of the Department of the Treasury that later became the National Bureau of Standards. Lane was particularly interested in astronomy, and was the first to perform a mathematical analysis of the Sun as a gaseous body. His investigations demonstrated the thermodynamic relations between pressure, temperature, and density of the gas within the Sun, and formed the foundation of what would in the future become the theory of stellar evolution (see Lane-Emden equation). Simon Newcomb, in his memoirs, describes Lane as \\"an odd-looking and odd- mannered little man, rather intellectual in appearance, who listened attentively to what others said, but who, so far as I noticed, never said a word himself.\\" Newcomb recounts his own role in bringing Lane's work, in 1876, to the attention of William Thomson who further popularized the work.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal from 1918 to 1920, and again from 1922 to 1927. Jacob was briefly a cabinet minister in the government of Tobias Norris. Jacob was born at Baltonsborough in Somerset, England. He came to Canada as a farm worker in 1893, and was educated at public schools in Gladstone, Manitoba. He later attended law school in Winnipeg, and opened a private practice in the city after graduating in 1906. He was a member of the Winnipeg School Board, and served as chair of the Mothers' Allowance Commission for a time. He was awarded life membership of the Manitoba Curling Association. Jacob was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election, held on January 15, 1918 in the Winnipeg North \\"B\\" constituency following the resignation of Social Democrat Richard Rigg. Jacob ran as a \\"Union\\" Liberal supporting federal Prime Minister Robert Borden's wartime coalition government, and received support from Winnipeg's Conservative organization. He defeated independent candidate E.R. Levinson by about 700 votes. After serving as a government backbencher for two years, Jacob sought re-election as a Liberal in the 1920 provincial election. Prior to this campaign, the various single-member constituencies in Winnipeg had been amalgamated into a ten-member seat, with candidates elected by a single transferable ballot. Jacob finished fourteenth on the first count, and was eliminated after the thirty-first count. At the provincial level, Norris's Liberals were reduced to an unstable minority government. They governed the province with difficulty for two years, and were defeated in the legislature in 1922. Jacob was chosen to lead the Liberal campaign in Winnipeg for the 1922 provincial election, and as such was named to cabinet as Attorney General on June 6, 1922. He was easily returned to the legislature, placing second in the city and winning election on the first count. The Liberal Party was defeated provincially, however, as the United Farmers of Manitoba won most seats in rural areas. The Norris administration, including Jacob, resigned from office on August 8. He served as an opposition member for the next five years, and did not seek re-election in the 1927 campaign.

A neighbourhood police centre (NPC) is a mid-sized police station in Singapore, introduced in 1997 to replace the Singapore Police Force's Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) system.https://www.police.gov.sg/Media-Room/Features/Community-Policing- Through-the-Years Based similarly on the concepts of community policing and modelled after the k≈çban system in Japan,https://www.sg.emb- japan.go.jp/bi_KOBNSpeech_09.htmhttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/community- police-system-fully-rolled-out it allows for police officers on the ground to perform more duties, particularly investigative work, which was previously in the hands of division-based officers. Unlike the NPP, the NPC operates on a 24 hours basis.https://www.police.gov.sg/Contact-Us History A feasibility study was established in October 1981 when some officers of the Singapore Police Force and then-Minister for Home Affairs Chua Sian Chin were sent to Japan to study the koban and train with officers on how the system worked.https://www.mha.gov.sg/hometeamnews/our- community/ViewArticle/strengthening-the- communityhttps://www.jica.go.jp/publication/pamph/region/ku57pq00002izp9j-att/history_of_friendship_and_cooperation_en.pdf The NPP was then piloted in 1983 when Khe Bong NPP post was created with assistance from Japanese police officers visiting Singapore. The neighbourhood police centre (NPC) is a result of a review of the Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) system initiated in 1996.https://www.unafei.or.jp/publications/pdf/RS_No56/No56_14VE_Singh1.pdf While the NPP has helped to reduce crime rates since its introduction in 1983, and perceived positively by the general public, it was limited in its ability to offer greater convenience to the community due to their limited size and scope of duties in individual posts. The high number of NPPs entailed extensive resources spread over many installations, putting pressure on limited resources available to the police, particularly in terms of manpower. The limited scope of the NPP system was also seen as being less optimal in maximising the operational capabilities of individual police officers, and affecting its abilities to retain talent. Pooling the NPPs into larger entities known as NPCs was thus proposed as a solution, although it was not meant to completely replace NPPs. About two thirds of NPPs were planned to be retained so as to maintain convenience to the general public, although many will no longer operate round the clock. An intercom system was introduced to overcome this should public assistance be needed when the NPP is closed. With a larger pool of officers and resources, each NPC was able to provide more services in one location with the aim of reducing the time needed to close each case. Each NPC Officer was also expected to handle not only front-line duties, but also basic investigation work and administrative duties. NPCs would directly liaise with the community for joint programmes and operations within their jurisdiction. This was also helped by having some NPCs sharing the same building with other community agencies, such as Community Centres. In 1997, plans were drawn up the roll out the NPC system across the country over four phases. The Pilot Phase was introduced in Clementi Police Division in October 1997, with the building of three NPCs. The first NPC, Queenstown Neighbourhood Police Centre, was opened at a temporary site opposite Queenstown MRT station on 1 October 1997, and officially opened by Mr Wong Kan Seng, Minister for Home Affairs, on 20 December 1997.https://www.roots.sg/Content/Places/landmarks/my-queenstown-heritage- trail/alexandra-fire-station-queenstown-neighbourhood-police-centre Later assessment of the NPCs under Clementi were deemed to be a success.https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/1999082703.htm The first phase was planned to be implemented in February 1999 to cover the West Region with six NPCs, the second phase by October 1999 covering the East and North-East Regions with 12 NPCs, and the third phase in the Central Region with 11 NPCs by July 2000. There would thus be 32 NPCs, and the number of NPPs would be reduced from 91 in 1997 to 66 by 2000. During the implementation of the plan, several refinements were made, including an abandonment of the planned replacement of the Land Divisions with Regional Commands, and a review of the organisational setup within the NPCs. The roll-out faced a discernible level of public discontent, many of whom were still unaware of the NPC system despite extensive publicity efforts by the police. The primary concern was over the closure of NPPs within their neighbourhoods, and the reduced operation hours of retained NPPs. Nonetheless, all 35 NPCs were successfully opened, although some were delayed due to slower urban development in some areas than expected. The 33rd NPC, Marina Bay Neighbourhood Police Centre had been opened on 6 February 2010.https://www.mha.gov.sg/docs/default- source/publications/home-team-journal-issue-4.pdf Two more Neighbourhood Police Centres had also been opened in Punggol and Woodlands West on 30 December 2012.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/two-new-neighbourhood- police-centres-in-operation-in-punggol-woodlands Organisation Initial roll-out plans for the NPCs entailed the creation of six Regional Commands, which are to replace the existing seven Land Divisions. The Regional Commands of East, North, North East, and West, were aligned to the URA's planning regions, with the exception of the Central Region which will be served by two Commands, namely Central East and Central West. This plan was, however, abolished, and the Land Division system retained, although one of them, Geylang Police Division, was closed and absorbed into Ang Mo Kio and Bedok divisions in December 2000. New NPCs were thus organised within the existing Land Divisional structure, with only minor adjustments to division borders. As a result, some Divisions are much larger than others in terms of number of NPCs under their command, with Ang Mo Kio Police Division having nine NPCs while Central Police Division has three. NPCs differ from NPPs, in that the former have boundaries broadly aligned with that of their respective Development Guide Plans (or planning areas) drawn up by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, as opposed to the later which was based on electoral divisions. NPC boundaries are permanent, while NPP boundaries may change each election should there be a review of electoral boundaries. Planning areas with higher demographies may have two NPCs, namely in Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bukit Merah, Jurong West and Yishun, while smaller planning areas may be combined and served by a single NPC, such as in the Central Area. Each NPC is headed by a Commanding Officer (CO), with the assistance of an Operations Officer (OO). The pool of officers in the NPC, known as neighbourhood police centre officers (NPCOs) are grouped into four Teams, each headed by a Team Leader (TL) and assisted by a Deputy Team Leader (DTL). The CO and OO are Senior police officer positions, while the TLs may be either Senior Officers or Police Officers typically of the rank of Station Inspector and above. The DTL may be any officer of the rank of Staff Sergeant and above. In 2014, it was reported that 21 NPCs have begun to use social media to get public assistance in solving crimes in their local areas.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-like-facebook-for-making- villains-give-up Reception The SPF heavily promotes the NPC system alongside the koban for countries that are trying to adopt a system to fit in their police system.

Established in 1960, The NTS receives its principal funding from grants awarded by the Government of Canada and from cultural ministries in each of the provinces, with added financial support from private and corporate donors. The NTS offers intensive, highly specialized theatre arts training in both English and French languages in a setting that unites all the related disciplines: acting, playwriting, directing, set and costume design, and production. Buildings and features The Monument-National in 2008 The National Theatre School occupies a historic landmark in Montreal, the Monument-National on Saint Lawrence Boulevard, as well as a building in The Plateau district, at the corner of Saint Denis Street and Laurier Street. =Monument-National= The campus of the National Theatre School stretches all the way to the Monument-National in the core of downtown Montreal. This hundred-year-old theatre, owned and operated by the NTS, has been classified as a heritage building. Situated in the heart of the Quartier des spectacles (Performing Arts District), on the famous ‚ÄúMain‚Äù of Boulevard St-Laurent and close to the St-Laurent metro station, is one of the first multi-functional buildings constructed in Canada. Recently restored and renovated, the Monument-National is composed of three performance halls, including a number of spaces offering unlimited conversion and transformation possibilities. The Monument-National‚Äôs two stages can accommodate every kind of production, from small concerts to large-scale shows. The Ludger-Duvernay Theatre ingeniously integrates the latest technology into a 19th-century architectural gem, while the Studio Hydro-Qu√©bec, with its clean lines and Meccano-like permutations, offers exciting flexibility. On the third floor is La Balustrade, a 55-seat cabaret style theatre. =Michel and Suria Saint- Denis Pavilion= Once a juvenile courthouse, the school‚Äôs main home, the Michel and Suria Saint-Denis Pavilion, sits on the border between the Plateau Mont-Royal and Mile End neighbourhoods. The Pavilion houses rehearsal halls, classrooms (including specially converted spaces for voice, dance, movement, set and costume design and writing), the Andr√©-Pag√© Studio (a flexible studio space with a 150-seat capacity), the Pauline McGibbon Studio (80-seat capacity), a small costume shop, a sound studio, a lighting laboratory, a projection room, a computer room, a school supplies store, a cafeteria, and a common space equipped with refrigerators and microwaves for the students. The Bleviss Family Library The Pavilion also houses Canada's largest collection of theatre related books and manuscripts, both published and unpublished, and audio visual materials available in both official languages. This outstanding collection was founded by Alan Bleviss, a graduate of NTS. History The notion of a national theatre school first received focused attention as an indirect result of the \\"Massey Report\\" (the report of the Massey-Levesque Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences of 1951). Robertson Davies, writing the section of the report devoted to theatre, complained that \\"facilities for advanced training in the arts of the theatre are non-existent in Canada,\\" and that, consequently, \\"young actors, producers and technicians [...] must leave the country for advanced training, and only rarely return.\\" Notwithstanding widespread acknowledgement of the validity of Davies' complaint, not until 1958-59 was a committee of 16 of the leading members of the Canadian theatrical community formed through the Canadian Theatre Centre / Centre du th√©√¢tre Canadien (CTC). Actor and CBC television producer, David Gardner chaired the committee that included Colonel Yves Bourassa, Donald Davis, Jean Gascon, Gratien G√©linas, Michael Langham, Pauline McGibbon, Mavor Moore, David Onley, Tom Patterson, Jean Pelletier, Jean-Louis Roux, Roy Stewart, Powys Thomas, Vincent Tovell and Herbert Whittaker. Internationally renowned director-teacher Michel Saint- Denis was brought in from Britain to act as senior advisor. He was a leading authority on theatre training who had created the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and later co-founded the Juilliard School Drama Division in New York City. In fact, French-born Saint-Denis had what many regarded as an ideal background to offer guidance to Canada's national co-lingual theatre school project (he gives details of his employment as a consultant for this project, and the involvement of his wife Suria, in their co-authored book \\"Training for the Theatre: Premises and Promises\\"). In the 1920s, he worked closely with his uncle, the remarkable French theatre director Jacques Copeau, to revolutionize theatrical practice and training in France through the Vieux-Colombier troupe. In the 1930s, Saint-Denis moved to London, England, where he became one of the most highly regarded stage directors of the decade, being responsible for a series of landmark productions featuring such stars of the British stage as John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier and Alec Guinness. The engagement of Saint- Denis also symbolically expressed a central hope for the new Canadian school: that it would embrace that fusion of the best of French and English theatrical training that seemed embodied by Saint-Denis himself. The CTC committee had been formed with a mandate to create a \\"truly bilingual school, located in Toronto.\\" The committee decided that Montr√©al, as a more \\"truly bilingual\\" city, was a better location and the National Theatre School of Canada / √âcole nationale de th√©√¢tre du Canada officially opened on 2 Nov 1960 in premises owned by the Canadian Legion at 1191 Mountain Street in Montr√©al. The school changed locations several times over the next decade until in 1970 it settled at 5030 rue Saint-Denis. Beginning in 1965, it also rented performing space in the Monument-National, which it purchased outright in 1978. This historic theatre (built 1891-94) was then in a dilapidated state; a major renovation in the early 1990s restored the beauty of the old Monument-National and introduced many modernizations, resulting in 2 theatres- the 804-seat Ludger- Duvernay theatre and a smaller flexible Studio theatre, which seats as many as 180 spectators. Founding principals, Jean Gascon was the first Director- General (Principal) at the NTS and head of the school's Francophone programs while Powys Thomas headed up the English programming section. James de Beaujeu Domville took over the role of Director-General from 1964 until 1968. In 1960, the first year of its operation, the National Theatre School only offered classes in acting for its Francophone and English students. They had been selected from hundreds of auditions conducted in every province and territory across the country to participate in thirty months of rigorous training conducted over three years, with eight months annually spent in Montreal and the two summer months in Stratford, Ontario, where students were afforded unparalleled access to the facilities and professional influences of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. In 1961, a bilingual production program was inaugurated. In 1978, a French program in playwriting was added to the French acting section of the school and in 1980, an equivalent English playwriting program was added to its English acting section. Directing has been the most changeable program at the school. Beginning in the early 1980s, various attempts were made to create programs in English and French for the instruction of directing; but for both financial and pedagogical reasons, these programs have not always succeeded, and the English and French sections of the school have apparently abandoned the pursuit of synchronized objectives in this area. Indeed, while the integration of anglophone and francophone students has been fairly thorough in the production program, in other programs it has been more usual to see the English and French sections of the school operating autonomously. While the history of the National Theatre School has generally been prestigious, the institution has not been without controversy. For example, in 1968, which was dubbed \\"the year of the barricades\\" because of the many student protests that swept across Europe and North America, the National Theatre School experienced its own uprising. The 8 graduating acting students in the French section resigned en masse in protest against the school's disregard of Qu√©b√©cois playwrights, particularly as exemplified in statements made by the director of the French acting section, Andr√© Muller. As a result of the protest, the school pointedly reversed its neglect of Qu√©b√©cois plays. In 1971, Muller's successor, Andr√© Pag√©, had the students perform a selection of work from various Qu√©b√©cois writers and began a program of commissioning work for the school from prominent Qu√©b√©cois playwrights. In 1998, the 8 students who had resigned were sent a letter from the school declaring that they had been reinstated as alumni and recognizing that their protest had resulted in progressive change in school policy. Programs It offers professional training in all the major theatre arts in both English and French, making it one of the only co-lingual theatre schools in the world. The programs include Acting, Directing, Production, Playwrighting and Scenography. Intake Students are auditioned and or interviewed from all across the country, and NTS accepts international students as well. Placements at the school are highly competitive; for example, the Acting program auditions around six hundred students annually but only twelve are accepted. Notable alumni The National Theatre School typically graduates approx. 60 students a year from its combined programs and English and French sections, and its alumni include Canada's prominent theatre artists with an influence that extends deep into the US and European worlds of theatre, television and film. The following is a list of notable students and the year they graduated. References Saint-Denis, Michel (1982) Training for the Theatre: Premises & Promises. (Suria Saint-Denis, ed.)

It is currently used mostly for football matches and it also has athletics facilities. Overview King Fahd Stadium in 2014 The stadium was built in 1987 with capacity over 67,000 seats. It measures 116 yards by 74 yards. It also has one of the largest stadium roofs in the world. It was a venue for matches of the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1989, including the final match. As part of Saudi Vision 2030, there was a celebration of the 87th anniversary of the Saudi founding with concerts and performances, with women for the first time being allowed into the stadium. The stadium has been included in the FIFA video games since FIFA 13, when the Saudi Professional League began being featured in the game. The cost of construction was about 1.912 billion Saudi riyals or $510 million. The stadium's roof shades over 67,000 seats and covers an area of 47,000 square feet. The 24 columns are arranged in a circle with a 247-metre diameter. The huge umbrella keeps the sun off the seats and concourse slabs, providing shade and comfort in the hot desert climate. The first goal in an official game was scored by Majed Abdullah. As a personal touch to the stadium, a royal balcony was constructed. The architect was Michael KC Cheah.  Events  The stadium's first major musical event was holding a concert by BTS, which was their first concert in the Middle East, as part of their Love Yourself: Speak Yourself World Tour on 11 October 2019. This made the band the first international act to perform in the stadium. They played to an audience of 31,899 people. The stadium also hosted WWE's event Crown Jewel on 31 October 2019.

That first studio album, Black and White (originally titled Talking to God on the Great White Telephone) was released by Epic Records in January 1986 and was critically well received.

It originates in the Rimo Glacier in a part of the Karakoram range and disputed between India, China and Pakistan, and flows into the Tarim River or Neinejoung River, with which it is sometimes identified. However, in modern times, the Yarkand river drains into the Shangyou Reservoir and exhausts its supply without reaching the Tarim river. The Yarkand River is approximately in length, with an average discharge of . A part of the river valley is known to the Kyrgyz people as Raskam, and the upper course of the river itself is called the Raskam River.S.R. Bakshi, Kashmir through Ages vol 1 p.22, in Google Books Another name of the river is Zarafshan.NGIA GeoNames search The area was once claimed by the ruler of Hunza.  Course  The river originates from the Rimo Glacier in the Karakoram range in India on Sinkiang border region, south of the Kashgar Prefecture. It flows roughly due north until reaching the foot of the Kunlun Mountains. Then it flows northwest where it receives waters from the Shaksgam River, which also originates from the Rimo Glacier. The Shaksgam is also known in its lower course (before falling into the Yarkand) as the Keleqing River (). Then Yarkand River flows north, through the Bolor-Tagh mountains parallel to the Tashkurgan valley, eventually receiving the waters of the Tashkurgan River from the west. After this, the river turns northeast and enters the Tarim Basin, forming a rich oasis that waters the Yarkant county. Continuing northeast, it receives the Kashgar River from the west, eventually draining into the Shangyou Reservoir. Even though the river originally drained into the Tarim River, development along its course in recent decades has depleted its flow. During the period 1986 to 2000, it flowed into the Tarim River only once. The drainage area of Yarkand is 108,000 sq. km. It irrigates areas in Taxkorgan, Yecheng, Poskam, Yarkand, Makit and Bachu counties. It also irrigates ten mission fields in the Agricultural Division.  History  The ancient Silk Route into South Asia followed the Yarkand River valley. From Aksu, it went via Maral Bashi (Bachu) on the bank of the Yarkand River, to the city of Yarkand (Shache). From Yarkand, the route crossed the Bolor-Tagh mountains through the river valleys of Yarkand and Tashkurgan to reach the town of Tashkurgan. From there, it crossed the Karakoram mountains through one of the western passes (Kilik, Mintaka or Khunjerab) to reach Gilgit in northern Kashmir. Then it went on to Gandhara (the vicinity of present day Peshawar). The Indian merchants from Gandhara introduced the Kharosthi script into the Tarim Basin, and the Buddhist monks followed in their wake, spreading Buddhism. The Chinese Buddhist traveller Fa Xian is believed to have followed this route. With the Arab conquest of Khurasan in 651 AD, the main Silk route to western Asia was interrupted, and the importance of the South Asian route increased. Gilgit as well as Baltistan find increased mention in the Chinese chronicles (under the names Great Po-lu and Little Po-lu, from the old name Bolor). China invaded Gilgit in 747 AD to secure its routes to Gandhara and prevent Tibetan influence. But the effects of the invasion appear to have been short-lived, as Turkic rule took hold in Gilgit. It is possible that alternative trade routes developed after this time between Yarkand and Ladakh via the Karakash Valley. The region of Hunza adjoining Xinjiang, which contained the passes through the Karakoram range, began to split off from Gilgit as an independent state around 997, and internecine wars with Gilgit as well as neighbouring Nagar became frequent. The rising importance of the Ladakh route is illustrated by the raids into Ladakh conducted by Mirza Abu Bakr Dughlat who took control of Kashgaria in 1465. His successor, Sultan Said Khan launched a proper invasion of Ladakh and Kashmir in 1532, led by his general Mirza Haidar Dughlat. Gallery File:STANFORD(1917) p61 PLATE19.

History Provand's Lordship was built as part of St Nicholas's Hospital by Andrew Muirhead, Bishop of Glasgow in 1471. A western extension, designed by William Bryson, was completed in 1670. In the early 19th century the house was occupied by a canon supported by income from the Lord of the Prebend (or \\"Provand\\") of Barlanark. Later that century it was acquired by the Morton Family who used it as a sweet shop. Following a generous donation Sir William Burrell, in the form of cash as well a collection of seventeenth-century Scottish furniture in the late 1920s, the house was bought by the specially-formed Provand's Lordship Society, whose aim was to protect it. In 1978, the building was acquired by the City of Glasgow who restored it. It was reopened to the public in 1983, and, following further restoration work which lasted two years, re-opened again in 2000.

(1967-09-20) The Workers' Stadium (), often called Gongti or Gong Ti, was a multi-purpose stadium in the Chaoyang District of north-eastern Beijing, China. It was mostly used for football (soccer) matches. The stadium was built in 1959 and was last renovated in 2004 (the concrete structure was strengthened, a new rotating display screen and energy-saving devices were installed). It had a capacity of 65,094 and covers a land area of 350,000 square meters. It was one of the Ten Great Buildings constructed in 1959 for the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. A new stadium is currently being constructed on the site of the previous Workers' Stadium. History The stadium was the main venue for the 1990 Asian Games, where the opening and closing ceremonies were held. Some high attendance matches of the Beijing Guo'an football club are held at the stadium. In 1993 the stadium was host to a slew of World Records set by the world-leading group of Chinese distance runners at the 7th Edition of the Chinese National Games, the most famous being international stars and world champions Wang Junxia and Qu Yunxia, who had dominated the 1993 World Championships a month before. The stadium holds claim to the fastest women's 1500 m time ever recorded of 3:50.46, the fastest women's 3000 m of 8:06.11 and the fastest women's 10,000 m of 29:31.78. These world records still stand today and are arguably the stadium's biggest claim to fame. The next year, the stadium was partially demolished and renovated as part of China's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games, which ultimately failed. The stadium continued to be a mainstay of Beijing sports into the 21st century, being the 2001 Summer Universiade and the Grand Final venue of 2004 AFC Asian Cup. After Beijing became the host of the 2008 Summer Olympics in July 2001 which the stadium was originally intended as the main venue, it hosted the football quarter-finals and semi-finals, and the women's gold medal final. The stadium was scheduled to host the first ever NFL game played in China, a preseason game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on August 8, 2007. However, the China Bowl was canceled in April 2007. The reasons given were that the NFL wanted to devote all its resources to the scheduled regular season game between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Giants, to be played in London on October 28, 2007. The stadium was the host for the 2009 Barclays Asia Trophy on 29 July and 31 July 2009, featuring Beijing Guoan, and Premier League clubs Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Hull City. It also hosted FC Bayern Munich's pre-season China Tour of 2012, during which the Bundesliga club had a friendly match with Beijing Guoan. The areas north (Sanlitun), east, and west of the stadium are popular nightlife destinations. The xi men (West Gate) offers a strip of nightclubs. The Workers Indoor Arena is located to the west of the stadium. The stadium has been used for concerts as well. Global superstar Mariah Carey began her sold-out five-show tour at the Workers Stadium, and Linkin Park played The Hunting Party Tour at July 26, 2015 in front of an audience of 60,000.

His \\"Infidel home missionary tour\\" was an incident in Charles Darwin's education, leaving Darwin with a memory of \\"the Devil's Chaplain\\" as a warning of the dangers of dissent from Church of England doctrine. Early life He was the sixth son of John and Elizabeth Taylor, born at Walnut Tree House, Edmonton, London, on 18 August 1784. His father, an ironmonger in Fenchurch Street, London, died when he was young, leaving him under the guardianship of his uncle, Edward Farmer Taylor of Chicken Hall, Bridgnorth, Shropshire. Having been at school under John Adams at Edmonton, he was articled as house pupil to Samuel Partridge, then house surgeon at the Birmingham General Hospital. In Birmingham Taylor underwent a religious conversion, after hearing Edward Burn preach. In 1805 Taylor continued as a medical student, walking Guy's and St. Thomas's hospitals in London under Sir Astley Paston Cooper and Henry Cline, and was admitted a member of the College of Surgeons in 1807. Under the influence of Thomas Cotterill, perpetual curate of Lane End, Staffordshire, he decided to study for the church. Qualification and turn to anti-clericalism Taylor studied at St John's College, Cambridge for three years to qualify as a clergyman. At that time the University of Cambridge was dominated by the established Church of England and most students were preparing for positions in the Anglican church. The Revd. Charles Simeon got Taylor his first curacy, but five years after ordination Taylor abandoned orthodox Christianity for evangelism and then eccentric anti-clericalism. Taylor set up a Christian Evidence Society and lectured in London pubs dressed in elaborate vestments, attacking the Anglican liturgy and the barbarities of the Establishment for what he called its \\"Pagan creed\\". At this time blasphemy was a criminal offence against the faith \\"by law established\\", and he was sentenced to a year in gaol. In his cell he wrote The Diegesis, attacking Christianity on the basis of comparative mythology and attempting to expound it as a scheme of solar myths. He was an advocate of the Christ myth theory and has been described as a \\"staunch defender of the mythicist thesis\\".Jongeneel, Jan A. B. (2009). Jesus Christ in World History: His Presence and Representation in Cyclical and Linear Settings. Peter Lang. p. 210. Smith, George H. (1991). Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies. Prometheus Books. p. 177. Infidel home missionary tour Upon his release, with his book newly published, he joined forces with the Radical Richard Carlile for an \\"infidel home missionary tour\\". On Thursday 21 May 1829, they arrived in Cambridge, strolled round the colleges, and in the evening attended Holy Trinity Church for a hell-fire sermon by the Revd. Simeon, which they sneered at as \\"one of the worst imaginable for the morals of mankind\\". Next day they rented lodgings for a fortnight above a print shop in Rose Crescent from the unsuspecting landlord William Smith, as their \\"Infidel Head-Quarters\\". By noon they had sent a printed challenge to the Vice-Chancellor, the leading Doctors of Divinity, the heads of all the colleges and the Revd. Simeon: They then went around the University precincts, with Taylor immaculately dressed in university cap and gown greeting old friends, giving out circulars and seeking out freethinkers. On the Saturday morning an anticipated article about their mission failed to appear in the morning paper. The university Proctors who were in charge of discipline interrogated the landlord, then demanded his lodging-house licence. Smith refused to hand it over, and appealed to the Vice-Chancellor, \\"most deferentially\\" asking the reason as he had not violated any regulations, and the licence had been granted its annual renewal the day before, but received no reply. The Vice-Chancellor and Proctors revoked the licence and made the lodgings out of bounds, posting a notice in the butteries of all the colleges to warn the students, among them Charles Darwin, then in his second year. The Radical pair responded to this \\"paltry spite\\" the next day by putting a public notice on the door of the University Library, challenging a university that \\"punishes the innocent... crushes the weak... oppresses [and] persecutes\\", taking away half the livelihood of Smith, with his wife and six children. On Monday all the students were talking about this iniquitous situation, and a group of \\"young men\\" prepared vigilante action against the Radicals to avenge the landlord. Carlile and Taylor heard of this, and on Tuesday apologised to the landlord, prodded the authorities to restore his licence, and slipped out of town. They were satisfied that they had uncovered \\"about fifty... young collegians, who were somewhat bold in vowing Infidelity among each other\\", though few would \\"break... the shackles\\" of their education and they would have \\"a most painful conflict to endure.\\" Their tour included Lancashire, and at a meeting in Bolton they met Eliza Sharples, who was to continue propagating their message in performances at the Rotunda while they were imprisoned. The Devil's Chaplain Amidst public unrest in July 1830 when Charles X of France was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the Tory government of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, Carlile gave Taylor a platform in the Blackfriars Rotunda, a ramshackle building on the south bank of the River Thames where republican atheists gathered. Several times a week Taylor dressed in \\"canonicals\\", staged infidel melodramas, preaching bombastic sermons to artisans. Two Sunday sermons on \\"The Devil\\" caused particular outrage when he pronounced \\"God and the Devil... to be but one and the self-same being... Hell and Hell-fire... are, in the original, nothing more than names and titles of the Supreme God.\\" He was then dubbed \\"The Devil's Chaplain\\", and thousands of copies of his ceremonies were circulated in a seditious publication, The Devil's Pulpit. As the Tory government collapsed in November, Taylor preached against the establishment while a revolutionary tricolour flew from the roof of The Rotunda. At the start of April 1831 Taylor was again indicted for blasphemy over two Easter sermons in the last days of The Rotunda. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Horsemonger Lane Gaol whence he sent protesting letters to The Times, but his pleas were snubbed by the Home Secretary William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne. In a letter to W.Watts, Taylor described his physical decline and fear that \\"the Christians have determined to kill me... I never expect to leave this Bastile but Heels foremost. Your greatly obliged Murdered Friend, Robert Taylor.\\" (Despite his fears, he lived until 1844. The letter is now in the possession of Larry M. Wright, author of 'Christianity Astrology and Myth'.) By January 1832 a \\"new occupation of the building\\" was promoted around London. From prison Taylor wrote that \\"the spirit of the Rotunda lives\\", and \\"it opens with new spirit, with new attraction, with all that is lovely and virtuous in woman to grace it.\\" From 9 February Eliza Sharples appeared as \\"Isis\\", the \\"Lady of the Rotunda\\", giving theatrically presented lectures which energetically decried Christianity, the priesthood, and the political establishment. In the first lecture she said she was \\"neither of Taylor nor Carlisle; neither of Owen nor St Simon\\", but would \\"be the little busy bee extracting honey from all their doctrines\\". There were soon claims that her lectures were, at least in part, written by Taylor and Carlisle. Her fiery presentations initially attracted attention, but interest fell away and her lectures finished at the end of April. Darwin recalls Taylor  Taylor would be remembered by Charles Darwin as a warning example of a social pariah. In 1857 as he worked towards the publication of his theory he wrote \\"What a book a Devil's Chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low & horridly cruel works of Nature!\\" in what Desmond and Moore argue is a reference to Taylor's nickname. However the term \\"the Devil's Chaplain\\" goes back to Chaucer who has his Parson say \\"Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns, that syngen evere placebo.\\" As the reaction to Darwin's theory developed in March 1860 he described his close ally Thomas Huxley as his \\"good and kind agent for the propagation of the Gospel - i.e. the devil's gospel.\\" Publications *Syntagma of the Evidence of the Christian Religion (1828) *The Diegesis: Being a Discovery of the Origin, Evidences, and Early History of Christianity, Never Yet Before or Elsewhere So Fully and Faithfully Set Forth (1829, 1860) *Thirteen Astro-Theological Sermons (1848) *Devil's Pulpit: Or Astro-Theological Sermons (1857) References Sources * *Adrian Desmond and James Moore, Darwin (London: Michael Joseph, the Penguin Group, 1991). *Julian Browning Autographs Religion & Philosophy, note on Autograph Letter, Signed, to W.Watts, 4 November 1831. *Larry M.

On June 26, 1978, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 operating the flight crashed on takeoff in Toronto, killing two passengers. Crash During takeoff, at 8:15 a.m., one of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32's tires burst and partially disintegrated, firing chunks of rubber into the landing gear mechanism. This set off an \\"unsafe gear\\" warning, prompting the pilot to abort the takeoff. The aircraft, however, was already two-thirds along the length of runway 23L and travelling at . It could not stop before the end of the runway, and plunged off the edge of an embankment while still travelling at , coming to a rest in the Etobicoke Creek ravine. The plane broke into three pieces, but despite its full load of fuel did not catch fire. The accident was visible from Highway 401, which runs alongside the south side of the airport. The plane was destroyed. Two passengers were killed. Both were seated at the site of the forward split in the fuselage. All of the other 105 passengers and crew aboard were injured. Investigation The subsequent investigation found multiple causes of the accident. It recommended greater scrutiny be given to the tires. The pilot, Reginald W. Stewart, delayed four seconds after the warning light came on before he chose to abort the takeoff; a more immediate decision would have prevented the accident. The investigators also criticized the level of training in emergency braking. The presence of the ravine at the end of the runway was also questioned, but nothing was done about it. This failure to expand the airport's overshoot zone was raised when Air France Flight 358 plunged into the same ravine 27 years later. Aftermath Although it is customary for some airlines to retire a flight number after a major incident, Air Canada continued to use Flight 189 for its Ottawa-Vancouver route for several years. As of 2018, the flight number is no longer active on Air Canada's timetable.

Lyon was born in Inverurie, Scotland in 1812 and came to Canada along with his family in 1829. Initiated by the 20-year-old Lyon at the urging of his eventual \\"second\\" Henri Lelievre, the duel was held over the love of local schoolteacher Elizabeth Hughes, and occurred above the Tay Canal outside Perth, Ontario. After Lyon's death, Wilson and his second Samuel Robertson were both charged with murder in Brockville, Ontario, though acquitted. Two years later he married Elizabeth Hughes and they had three children together; he went on to become a judge and Member of Parliament before dying in 1869. The lawyer Wilson had studied under, James Boulton, left Perth after locals began claiming that he had goaded his understudy to push Lyon into the duel, since he was the understudy of Boulton's rival Thomas Radenhurst. Lyon's second, Henri Lelievre, fled the country fearing that some also considered him responsible for the duel, since he had encouraged a second round after both had missed their first shot. He is believed to have died in Australia. In 1996, Susan Code wrote A Matter of Honour , and a year later two students of Sheridan College oversaw the production of an independent film by the same name, telling the story of the duel. On his 1973 album Stompin' Tom and the Hockey Song, Stompin' Tom Connors released the song \\"The Last Fatal Duel,\\" written by Freddy Dixon, detailing the battle (though accidentally referring to Lyon as William, not Robert). Lyon's tombstone in the Anglican cemetery in Perth reads ::Friendship Offering, ::Dedicated ::To the Memory of ::ROBERT LYON, ::(Student-at-law) ::He fell ::in mortal combat ::13 June 1833 ::in the 20th year ::of his Age ::Requieseat in Pace. Other sources, however, agree that it was the last duel in Ontario which was then known as Upper Canada, but not the last fatal duel in what is now the country of Canada. For example, Radio Canada International and the Montreal Gazette refer to documents that state that the last fatal duel occurred on 22 May 1838, in Quebec, then known as Lower Canada, between British officer Major Henry Warde and lawyer Robert Sweeney; Warde was wounded and subsequently died.

Gabriel earned a place among the top five ranked competitors (who are themselves not ranked against each other) in the William Lowell Putnam Competition all four years that he was eligible (2000‚Äì2003), a feat matched by only seven others (Don Coppersmith (1968‚Äì1971), Arthur Rubin (1970‚Äì1973), Bjorn Poonen (1985‚Äì1988), Ravi Vakil (1988‚Äì1991), Reid W. Barton (2001‚Äì2004), Daniel Kane (2003‚Äì2006), and Brian R. Lawrence (2007‚Äì08, 2010‚Äì11). His top-5 performance in 2000 was particularly notable, as he was officially taking the exam in spite of only being a high school senior, thus forfeiting one of his years of eligibility in college. He was on the first place Putnam team twice (2001‚Äì02) and the second place team once (2003). He has earned awards in science and math, including the Intel Science Talent Search, has taught mathematics classes and tutorials, and plays the piano. He was a Research Science Institute scholar in 2000. Carroll proposed Problem 3 of IMO 2009 and Problem 3 of IMO 2010. He also proposes problems to the USAMO such as problem 3 in 2007, 2008, 2010 and problem 6 in 2009. During the 2005‚Äì06 academic year, he taught English in Chaling, Hunan, China. He worked at the National Bureau of Economic Research from 2006 to 2007.  Education  Gabriel Carroll is an alumnus of Oakland Technical High School and graduated from Harvard University in 2005 with degrees in Mathematics and Linguistics. He graduated from the Economics Department at MIT in 2012, and spent one year at Microsoft Research as a postdoctoral researcher during 2012‚Äì2013.  Personal life  Carroll married Canadian economist Eva Vivalt in August 2019.

It is served by the G train at all times.  History  This station opened on July 1, 1937, when the entire Crosstown Line was completed between Nassau Avenue and its connection to the IND Culver Line. On this date, the GG was extended in both directions to Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets and Forest Hills‚Äì71st Avenue. Station layout This underground station has two tracks and two side platforms. Both platforms have a lime green trim line on a darker green border and name tablets reading \\"FULTON ST\\" in white sans serif font on a dark green background and lime green border. Small black \\"FULTON\\" signs in white lettering run along the trim line at regular intervals and directional signs in the same style are below the name tablets. Blue i-beam columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. The station is very close to the Crosstown Line's junction with the IND Fulton Street Line just west of Lafayette Avenue, although the two stations do not have an in- system transfer. Riders on Manhattan-bound A and C trains can catch a glimpse of this station's platforms through the right-side windows a few seconds after leaving Lafayette Avenue. There is an employee-only connection between the two stations via the tunnels. A proposed transfer to the busy Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center complex was rejected by the MTA due to the long walking distance between the two stations. =Exits= The station's full-time fare control area is at the extreme south (geographical west) end of the Church Avenue-bound platform. A bank of turnstiles at platform level leads to a token booth and one staircase going up to the northeast corner of Lafayette Avenue and Fulton Street. A crossunder here connects to the Queens-bound platform. This station has a mezzanine above the platforms and tracks near the north end. However, most of it has been converted to employee-use only and the staircases leading up to it from the platforms are gated shut or sealed off. At the extreme north (geographical east) end of the station, a single open staircase from each platform goes up to a single full height turnstile before a staircase goes up to either western corner of South Portland and Lafayette Avenues, the northwestern one for the Queens-bound platform and the southwestern one for the Church Avenue-bound platform. These exits were closed in the mid-1980s due to concerns over maintenance expense and potential crime, but the southwestern corner entrance (for northbound trains) was reopened in July 2005 following community pressure, while the northwestern corner entrance (for southbound trains) was reopened some time between January and June 2009.https://forgotten-ny.com/2009/02/they-went-brodaway-and-other-subway- sign-errors/  Nearby points of interest  * Barclays Center * Brooklyn Academy of Music * Brooklyn Technical High School * Fort Greene Park * Irondale Center * Mark Morris Dance Center * MoCADA  References   External links  * * Station Reporter ‚Äî G Train * The Subway Nut ‚Äî Fulton Street Pictures * Fulton Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * South Portland Avenue entrance from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View Category:IND Crosstown Line stations Category:New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn Category:New York City Subway stations located underground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1937 Category:1937 establishments in New York (state) Category:Fort Greene, Brooklyn ","title":"Fulton Street station (IND Crosstown Line)"},{"id":"2372915","text":"Stadio San Paolo is a stadium in the western Fuorigrotta suburb of Naples, Italy, and is the third largest football stadium in Italy -- after Milan's San Siro and Rome's Stadio Olimpico. For the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, the stadium hosted the football preliminaries. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of S.S.C. Napoli. Constructed in 1959, the stadium was extensively renovated in 1989 for the 1990 World Cup and again in 2018. The stadium currently accommodates 55,000 spectators. The stadium is widely known for hosting the 1990 World Cup semi-final between Italy and Argentina. Argentina's superstar Diego Maradona, who played for Naples's Italian 1st division team and was a hero to their supporters, asked Napoli fans to cheer for Argentina. The Napoli tifosi responded by hanging a giant flag in their \\"curva\\" of the stadium saying \\"Maradona, Naples loves you, but Italy is our homeland\\". Maradona later said he was touched that Napoli was the only stadium during that World Cup where the Argentinian national anthem was not jeered. The match finished 1‚Äì1 after extra time. A penalty shootout ensued, with Maradona fittingly scoring the winning penalty for Argentina. Recent times Even with Napoli in Serie C1 during the 2005‚Äì06 season, Napoli achieved the feat of having the 3rd highest average home attendance in Italy for the season, with only two Serie A clubs, Milan and Internazionale having higher attendances. Napoli's final game of the season drew a crowd of 51,000 which now stands as a Serie C all-time record. The San Paolo Stadium also hosted Italy's Euro 2008 Qualifier vs Lithuania on 2 September 2006, with the possibility of other qualifiers to be played there in the future. Renaming The Naples city council requested the Italian government's permission to rename the stadium after Diego Maradona, who helped Napoli win Serie A titles in 1987 and 1990 and remains a popular figure in Naples -- despite the Italian law prohibiting the naming of a public building after someone dead less than ten years. 1990 FIFA World Cup An external view with the covering installed for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The stadium was one of the venues of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, and held five matches. The first two were Argentina‚Äôs Group B matches: the first was against Soviet Union on June 13 winning 2-0, and the second was against Romania on June 18 ending in a 1-1 draw. The next two were Cameroon matches: the first was a Round of 16 match against Colombia on June 23 winning 2-1 after extra time, and the second was a Quarter-finals match against England on July 1 losing 3-2 after extra time. The fifth and last was the Semi-final between Argentina and hosts Italy on July 3, with Argentina winning 4-3 on penalties after drawing 1-1 in the extra time. 2018‚Äì2019 renovation The opening ceremony of the 2019 Summer Universiade. The stadium was renovated in preparation for the 2019 Summer Universiade, this included replacing metal fencing with glass barriers and replacing seats. This means the stadium's capacity was reduced from 60,240 to 54,726. The stadium hosted the opening ceremony and athletics event.

The gang were notorious \\"butcher cart thieves\\" during the 1850s and their hijacking methods would later be used by criminals of the early twentieth century. History One of the earliest hijackers in New York's history, the Boodle Gang began raiding food provision wagons which passed through their territory of New York's Lower West Side during the 1850s. After the wagons began traveling around the West Side, the gang began moving into Centre Market soon dominating the area as the leading butcher cart mob. The gang's particular method, similar to other butcher mobs of the period, after approaching the store with a wagon about a dozen gang members would charge into a butcher shop stealing a whole carcass and fleeing in the wagon. The gang's theft usually met with indifference as rival competitors such as the Potashes were quick to take advantage by offering meat at discount prices. By the 1860s, the Boodlers had perfected their techniques and had begun robbing messengers and couriers in the financial district. The gang's activities became very lucrative, particularly in January 1866 when two members robbed a courier carrying $14,000 and escaping by jumping onto a wagon losing their pursuers by clogging traffic in Beekman Street with three other carts. While the police were never able to halt their activities, the gang fared poorly during various gang wars during the 1890s, especially against the Hudson Dusters who would come to dominate the area by the end of the decade. The Boodle moniker failed to instill fear among rival gangs. By the turn of the century the Boodlers were defunct. References *Sifakis, Carl.

The movie's narrative spans the years 1961 to 1986. It stars Drew Barrymore, Steve Zahn, Brittany Murphy, and James Woods. It was the last film directed by Penny Marshall. Although the film is co-produced by Beverly Donofrio, many of its details differ from the book. Plot In 1961, eleven- year-old Beverly \\"Bev\\" Donofrio rides with her father, Connecticut police officer Leonard, to the Christmas tree lot. When she reveals that she wants a bra for Christmas in order to get the attention of a boy she likes, Leonard tells her she is too young to be thinking about boys, and to focus on books. In 1965, Bev is now an intelligent, but na√Øve fifteen-year-old. Her dream is to go to college in New York City and become a writer. She joins her friends, Fay and Tina, at a party. Fay finds her older boyfriend Bobby, who is about to be deployed to Vietnam, while Bev gives a love letter to a popular boy named Sky. When Sky reads the letter aloud, Bev flees to the bathroom. She is consoled by Ray, a stranger, who then defends Bev's honor and fights with Sky. Bev and Ray, with Fay and Bobby, flee the party. The four go to a lookout, where Bobby and Fay have sex. Bev is overcome by Ray's kindness, and they too have sex. Leonard, who is on duty, drives up and brings them to the police station, where Bev claims that they only kissed. Bev discovers that she is pregnant. She tells Ray, initially turns down his offer to get married, then placates her shocked parents by agreeing to a hasty wedding. At the reception, everyone is avoiding Bev, so Fay publicly announces that she is also pregnant. Fay confides to Bev that her father wanted her to put the baby up for adoption, but she and Bobby will be getting married instead. The two girls eventually celebrate the fact they will be mothers together. Over the next few months, the girls bemoan missing out on three things: their childhood, their high school prom, and an education. Bev gives birth to son Jason (which upsets her because she wanted a girl), while Fay has daughter Amelia. Bev continues to pursue her education. When Jason is three, she wins the chance for a college scholarship. Unfortunately, Bev's interview goes badly when she is forced to take Jason along. Although the interviewer praises Bev's writings, he states that she has too many distractions. Later, Fay reveals that she and Bobby are getting divorced, because he met someone while stationed in Hawaii. Bev tells Fay that she's not sure if she loves Jason, because his birth has cost her so much. When Jason almost drowns in Fay's pool, Bev vows to be more attentive. On Jason's seventh birthday, several people from Bev's high school show up to his party: old friend Tina is now engaged and going to NYU; and Tommy, who had a crush on Bev, just graduated from Berkeley. He suggests that Bev move her family to California and pursue her education there, since the state offers financial aid. Ray agrees to the plan, but on the day they are supposed to leave, he confesses that he is a heroin addict and spent their savings on drugs. Bev helps him detox, but Ray sneaks out to get more drugs. When he tells Bev that it's impossible for him to quit, she tells him he should leave instead. Ray agrees, but young Jason chases after him in tears, then tells Bev that he hates her for making Ray leave. Two years later, Bev still yearns for California. She and Fay help Lizard (one of Ray's old friends) dry weed in Bev's oven. Jason, still bitter, tells Grandpa Leonard, who arrests the mothers (Lizard had left). Fay's brother bails them out, using up their savings, on the condition that Fay and Amelia move away with him and cut off contact with Bev. Bev harshly tells the smug Jason that he ruined their lives. She claims that it's his fault Amelia moved away. In 1985, Bev and Jason are driving to see Ray. She managed to get her college degree and has written her memoir, but needs Ray to sign a waiver or else her book will not be published. While driving, Jason tells Bev that he wants to transfer from NYU to Indiana University, but Bev refuses, saying that he is getting the education that she never could. Jason calls his now-girlfriend Amelia with the bad news. Amelia is dejected but assures him that she is not angry. Arriving at Ray's trailer, Bev explains why they are there. When Ray's wife, Shirley, demands $100,000, Bev screams at Ray and storms out. Jason follows her and calls her selfish for only caring about her book when he finally got to see his father again. He accuses her of being a bad mother and she storms off. Ray comes outside and talks with Jason, stating that leaving was the best thing he could have done for Jason and he believes it's the only reason Jason turned out so well. He sneaks the signed papers to Jason. Jason finds Bev, who insists that she was a great mother who sacrificed everything for him. Jason reveals that he will transfer in order to be with Amelia and apologizes to Bev for ruining her life. Bev softens and tells Jason that she is proud of him and thinks of him as the best thing in her life. She also tells him that she holds herself responsible for her various mistakes and poor choices, and that she never meant to blame him for them. She gives him her car to drive to Indiana. Beverly is forced to call Leonard for a ride. She complains to him how Jason blames her for everything wrong in his life. She then realizes that she herself has done the same to her father. Together, they sing a song from her childhood as they drive away.

It holds a 49% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 109 reviews with an average rating of 5.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Riding in Car with Boys suffers from mixing grit and pathos with cuteness and comedy. Ironically, many critics found Zahn's character more compelling and three-dimensional than Barrymore's\\". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \\"A film like this is refreshing and startling in the way it cuts loose from formula and shows us confused lives we recognize ... This movie is closer to the truth: A lot depends on what happens to you, and then a lot depends on how you let it affect you\\". In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised Steve Zahn's performance: \\"It is hard to imagine what Riding in Cars With Boys would have been without Mr. Zahn's brilliantly nuanced and sympathetic portrayal of Ray, who goes through more changes than Beverly\\". USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and found that the \\"strength of the movie lies in these performances and in the situational humor, though ultimately the ending is disappointing, attempting to wrap up loose ends far too neatly\\". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"C+\\" rating, and wrote, \\"... every scene is bumpered with actorly business and production detail that says more about nostalgia for the pop culture of earlier American decades than about the hard socioeconomic truths of being a poor, young, undereducated parent\\". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley criticized Barrymore's performance: \\"Barrymore, a delightful comic actress, has the spunk for the role, but can't do justice to the complexities of Beverly's conflicted personality. So she comes off as abrasive and neglectful as opposed to headstrong and ambitious, winning no empathy for this sour single mom\\". Edward Guthmann also had problems with Barrymore's performance in his review for the San Francisco Chronicle: \\"She never relaxes, never surrenders to the character, but instead tries to justify her and to make us like her despite her selfishness and poor mothering. American actors as a rule are terrified of playing unsympathetic characters, particularly when they've gained the celebrity and box-office appeal that Barrymore has\\". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan criticized the film's direction: \\"At home with the comedy, even if it is too broad, the director brings next to nothing to the serious scenes; they simply sit there on the screen, empty and forlorn\\". Box office Riding in Cars with Boys grossed $30,165,536 in the United States, and $5,577,772 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $35,743,308.

Together with the memorandum of association, they are the constitution of a company. The equivalent term for LLC is Articles of Organization. Roughly equivalent terms operate in other countries, such as Gesellschaftsvertrag in Germany, statuts in France, statut in Poland,Articles of Agreement Law & Legal Definition ' (Latin: ) in Ukraine, Jeong-gwan in South Korea. In South Africa, from the new Companies Act 2008 which commenced in 2011, articles and memoranda of association have been replaced by a \\"memorandum of incorporation\\" or \\"MOI\\". The MOI gives considerably more scope to vary how to the company is governed than the previous arrangement.Delport, Piet \\"The New Companies Act Manual\\" (Lexis Nexis) Contents The following is largely based on British Company Law (referenced at the end of this Article). The Articles can cover a medley of topics, not all of which is required in a country's law. Although all terms are not discussed, they may cover: *The issuing of shares (also called stock), different voting rights attached to different classes of shares *Valuation of intellectual rights, say, the valuations of the IPR of one partner and, in a similar way as how we value real estate of another partner *The appointments of directors - which shows whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality with all of the contributors *Directors meetings - the quorum and percentage of vote *Management decisions - whether the board manages or a founder *Transferability of shares - assignment rights of the founders or other members of the company do *Special voting rights of a Chairman, and his/her mode of election *The dividend policy - a percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit or otherwise *Winding up - the conditions, notice to members *Confidentiality of know-how and the founders' agreement and penalties for disclosure *First right of refusal - purchase rights and counter-bid by a founder. *Drag along provisions ‚Äì majority shareholders force a sale on the other shareholders. *Good and bad leaver provisions ‚Äì determine the price paid for shares transferred following cessation of directorship or employment. Directors A Company is essentially run by the shareholders, but for convenience, and day-to-day working, by the elected Directors. Usually, the shareholders elect a Board of Directors (BOD) at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), which may be statutory (e.g. India and the UK). The number of Directors depends on the size of the Company and statutory requirements. The Chairperson is generally a well-known outsider but he /she may be a working Executive of the company, typically of an American Company. The Directors may, or may not, be employees of the Company. Shareholders In the emerging countries there are usually some major shareholders who come together to form the company. Each usually has the right to nominate, without objection of the other, a certain number of Directors who become nominees for the election by the shareholder body at the AGM. The Treasurer and Chairperson is usually the privilege of one of the JV partners (which nomination can be shared). Shareholders may also elect Independent Directors (from the public). The Chair would be a person not associated with the promoters of the company, a person is generally a well-known outsider. Once elected, the BOD manages the Company. The shareholders play no part till the next AGM/EGM. Memorandum of association The Objectives and the purpose of the Company are determined in advance by the shareholders and the Memorandum of Association (MOA), if separate, which denotes the name of the Company, its Head- Office, street address, and (founding) Directors and the main purposes of the Company for public access. It cannot be changed except at an AGM or Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) and statutory allowance. The MOA is generally filed with a Registrar of Companies who is an appointee of the Government of the country. For their assurance, the shareholders are permit of the Memorandum of Association. Any matter in the Articles of Association not within the scope of the Memorandum of Association of the company is void. Board meetings The Board meets several times each year. At each meeting there is an 'agenda' before it. A minimum number of Directors (a quorum) is required to meet. This is either determined by the 'by-laws' or is a statutory requirement. It is presided over by the Chairperson, or in her/his absence, by the Vice-Chair. The Directors survey their area of responsibility. They may determine to make a 'Resolution' at the next AGM or if it is an urgent matter, at an EGM. The Directors who are the electives of one major shareholder, may present his/her view but this is not necessarily so - they may have to view the Objectives of the Company and competitive position. The Chair may have to break the vote if there is a tie. At the AGM, the various Resolutions are put to vote. Annual general meeting The AGM is called with a notice sent to all shareholders with a clear interval. A certain quorum of shareholders is required to meet. If the quorum requirement is not met, it is canceled and another Meeting called. If it at that too a quorum is not met, a Third Meeting may be called and the members present, unlimited by the quorum, take all decisions. There are variations to this among companies and countries. Decisions are taken by a show of hands; the Chair is always present. Where decisions are made by a show of hands is challenged, it is met by a count of votes. Voting can be taken in person or by marking the paper sent by the Company. A person who is not a shareholder of the Company can vote if he/she has the 'proxy', an authorization from the shareholder. Each share carries the number of votes attached to it. Some votes maybe for the decision, others not. Resolutions There are two types of resolutions, known as an Ordinary Resolution and a Special Resolution. A Special Resolution can be tabled at a Director's Meeting. The Ordinary Resolution requires the endorsement by a majority vote, sometimes easily met by partners' vote. The Special Resolution requires a 60,70 or 80% of the vote as stipulated by the constitution of the Company. Shareholders other than partners may vote. The matters which require the Ordinary and Special Resolution to be passed are enumerated in Company or Corporate Law. Special Resolutions covering some topics may be a statutory requirement. Model articles of associations (A.O.A.) In the United Kingdom, model articles of association, known as Table A have been published since 1865.Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 - Table B The articles of association of most companies incorporated prior to 1 October 2009 ‚Äì particularly small companies ‚Äì are Table A, or closely derived from it. However, a company is free to incorporate under different articles of association, or to amend its articles of association at any time by a special resolution of its shareholders, provided that they meet the requirements and restrictions of the Companies Acts. Such requirements tend to be more onerous for public companies than for private ones. In Hong Kong, the Companies Registry provides four samples of model Articles of Association,http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/faq/faq01.htm#06 and they are known as Sample A, B, C, and D respectively.http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/companies_ordinance/docs/AA_Sample_A.pdfhttp://www.cr.gov.hk/en/companies_ordinance/docs/AA_Sample_B.pdfhttp://www.cr.gov.hk/en/companies_ordinance/docs/AA_Sample_C.pdfhttp://www.cr.gov.hk/en/companies_ordinance/docs/AA_Sample_D.pdf Sample A and B are both designed for a private company (the most common company type). Sample C for a public company. Sample D for a company limited by guarantee. Apparently, the Hong Kong Companies Registry decided to give more than one sample of model Articles of Association rather than one size fits all. Companies Act 2006 The Companies Act 2006 received Royal Assent on 8 November 2006 and was fully implemented on 1 October 2009. It provides a new form of Model Articles for companies incorporated in the United Kingdom. Under the new legislation, the articles of association will become the single constitutional document for a UK company, and will subsume the majority of the role previously filled by the separate memorandum of association.Under the law prior to the 2006 Act, in the event of any inconsistency between the memorandum and the articles, the memorandum usually prevailed: see Ashbury v Watson (1885) 30 Ch D 376.

Citizen Cohn also stars Joe Don Baker (as McCarthy), Ed Flanders (as Cohn's courtroom nemesis Joseph Welch), Frederic Forrest (as writer Dashiell Hammett), and Pat Hingle (as Cohn's onetime mentor J. Edgar Hoover). It was directed by Frank Pierson. The movie was filmed on location in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Synopsis The film spans Cohn's life from childhood through his initial rise to power as McCarthy's right-hand man in the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearings and his eventual public discrediting a month before his death in 1986 from AIDS. It is told mostly in flashback as Cohn lies dying at a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, hallucinating that his many enemies (from Robert F. Kennedy to Ethel Rosenberg, a convicted Communist spy he sent to the electric chair) are haunting him. It concerns aspects of Cohn's life such as his closeted homosexuality and the measure of his culpability in the \\"Red Scare\\" of the 1950s. While the movie portrays Cohn in a decidedly unsympathetic light, it also depicts episodes in his life, such as the death of his beloved mother, in which he showed a more tender, compassionate side.

The source of the Yarkon (\\"Greenish\\" in Hebrew) is at Tel Afek (Antipatris), north of Petah Tikva. It flows west through Gush Dan and Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park into the Mediterranean Sea. Its Arabic name, al-Auja, means \\"the meandering\\". The Yarkon is the largest coastal river in Israel, at 27.5 km in length. History =Iron Age= The Yarkon was the northern boundary of the territory of the Philistines. During the time of the Assyrian rule over the country, a fortress was built in a site known today as Tell Qudadi, on the northern bank of the river, next to its estuary. =Ottoman Period= The Yarkon formed the southern border of the vilayet of Beirut during the late Ottoman period.Weldon C. Matthews (2006) Confronting an Empire, Constructing a Nation: Arab Nationalists and Popular Politics in Mandate Palestine I.B.Tauris, p 26 =World War I= The Arabic name of the river, al-Auja (\\"the meandering one\\"), is shared with Wadi Auja, another small stream that flows into the Jordan Valley north of Jericho. During World War I this coincidence led to the term of \\"the line of the two Aujas\\" referring to a strategic line connecting the two river valleys and taken by the expeditionary forces of General Allenby during his early 1918 advance against the Ottoman army. The mouth of the river was conquered already during the late-1917 Battle of Jaffa. =Mandate period= In the Mandatory period, the British government granted a number of concessions, including to Pinhas Rutenberg's Jaffa Electric Company exclusive rights to generate, distribute, and sell electricity in the District of Jaffa. These rights were delivered through the ‚ÄúAuja Concession‚Äù, which was formally signed on September 12, 1921. The Concession had authorized the company to generate electricity by means of hydroelectric turbines that would exploit the water power of the Yarkon River to supply electricity to the administrative District of Jaffa. The district comprised Jaffa, the oldest and at the time still most important town in the area, the fast growing town of Tel Aviv north of it, and other smaller locations. Yet the plan to generate electricity by hydroelectric means never materialized, and instead the company designed and built a powerhouse that produced electricity by means of diesel-fueled engines.Shamir, Ronen (2013). Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine. Stanford: Stanford University Press. Yarkon River Mouth =State of Israel= The river became increasingly polluted after the 1950s, many blaming this on the construction of the Reading Power Station which is situated near its mouth. When the river's headwaters were diverted to the Negev via the National Water Carrier for irrigation purposes, the state of the Yarkon declined. As sewage replaced the flow of fresh water, habitats were destroyed and flora and fauna disappeared. This was exacerbated by continuous discharges of industrial effluents and municipal sewage into the rivers, which allowed algae to multiply.A rural walk through the big cities, Jerusalem Post On July 14, 1997, the infamous Maccabiah bridge collapse led to the death of four athletes, three of which died due to infections caused by exposure to the polluted river water. Subsequent and ongoing cleanup projects, some government-run, some benefitting from financial aid from Jewish donors from Australia, and some with regional character supported by the NGO FoEME, helped improve the quality of the water.Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael‚ÄìJewish National Fund, The Wetland Project Revives Yarkon River, January 07, 2009 EcoPeace Middle East (formerly Friends of the Earth Middle East), Good Water Neighbors - Cross Border Meetings throughout the Region, September 2015 KKL-JNF staff,Cornerstone Laid for Bird- Watching Center in Yarkon Park, 26 December 2013 WATEC Israel 2015 Conference, Yarkon River Rehabilitation Project Average Monthly Discharge of Yarkon River (1969-1975).jpgAverage Monthly Discharge (1969‚Äì1975) Average Annual Discharge of Yarkon River (1969-1975).jpgAverage Annual Discharge (1969‚Äì1975) Nuphar lutea carpet in the upper Yarkon river. Yarkon River Authority In 1988, the Yarkon River Authority was established to revitalize the river and make sections of it suitable for sailing, fishing, swimming and other recreation. Water quality improved after the construction of modern sewage treatment plants in Hod Hasharon and Ramat Hasharon. The river was dredged to restore its original depth and natural flow. River banks were raised and reinforced, hiking and bicycling paths were built, and picnic and fishing areas were developed with the help of contributions from the Australian Jewish community via the Jewish National Fund. Maccabiah disaster On July 14, 1997, four members of the Australian delegation to the Maccabiah Games were killed and 60 injured as a result of the collapse of a temporary pedestrian bridge over the Yarkon.

The film stars Madeleine Stowe as a young author of children's books and Alan Rickman as a sadistic secret policeman who is interrogating her. The film was released to mostly mixed reviews. Plot Set in an unspecified country, a woman is taken from her home in the middle of the night, accused of embedding dissident messages into her book Closet Land. The book is a story about a child who, as a result of bad behavior, has been locked in a closet as punishment. While in there, the child is greeted by a group of childhood ally archetypes who innocently attempt to comfort the scared little girl. The seemingly simple content is questioned by the government, which accuses the author of encouraging and introducing disloyalty among its audience of na√Øve children. The interrogator is obstinate in his belief that the author is guilty of hidden propaganda. It is revealed that the novel was actually created as a form of escapism, providing a coping mechanism for the author, who endured sexual abuse as a child. Near the end of the film, the interrogator claims that he was the man who had sexually abused the author in her childhood. But one cannot be entirely sure he is telling the truth, as the film suggests he was just using the abuse against her as a way of breaking her down. After subjecting her to lengthy physical and mental torture, and pretending to be several other people (another prisoner, a more brutal interrogator) while the victim is blindfolded, the interrogator tries to get her to sign a confession‚Äîto save her life. While he knows now that she is innocent, he implores her to confess to avoid execution. She refuses, and goes to her death. Cast *Madeleine Stowe as Victim, a young author of children's books and also interrogated by a sadistic secret policeman. *Alan Rickman as Interrogator, a ruthless interrogator. Production The script was Radha Bharadwaj's winning submission to The Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting program in 1989. The Nicholl Fellowships are run by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Bharadwaj later stated: Bharadwaj said that this film was an outgrowth of her graduate studies at Temple University (PA), that she charmed her Hollywood producers into giving her money to do the film ... and that they dropped it upon release. Stowe and Rickman are the only cast of the film and they are both credited. Bharadwaj later revealed in a September 2005 production note that Rickman was not her original choice for the Interrogator. \\"If I were to pick my top choices for role of the interrogator in Closet Land,\\" she wrote, > I would still unhesitatingly go with my first choices then: Sir Anthony > Hopkins, Sir Ian Holm and Peter O'Toole.

Consequently, why should anyone subject himself or herself to this pretentious and contrived two-person drama, which punishes the audience rather than enlightens it?\\" He criticised the lack of a proper setting for the film, an unnamed police state, saying: \\"Right off, the filmmaker lets us off the hook, making it easy to reject the incessant cruelty we witness as artificial.\\" Confused about the film's lack of focus on a single theme, he added: \\"In any event, this bit of Freudianism put in the service of protesting child abuse overloads and sidetracks the film from its main purpose of protesting all human rights violations.\\" He finally concluded by praising Madeleine Stowe's performance, noting that she \\"is actually quite moving in her unshakable dignity.\\" On the other hand, he was more critical of Alan Rickman's delivery, noting that \\"Rickman, whose diction often seems muddled, is needlessly, hissably arch.\\"Thomas, Kevin. \\"MOVIE REVIEWS: A Clumsy Defense of Human Rights.\\" Los Angeles Times. 6 March 1991.

Radha Bharadwaj responded to some of the criticism in her own review, particularly to Kevin Thomas, titled \\"The Real Message of 'Closet Land,'\\" explaining that it \\"doesn't attempt to literally depict the physical reality of political interrogation. I'm more intrigued by the psychological experience: the disorientation, the absurdity, the terror. That's why Closet Land unfolds in a Kafka-esque environment grounded more in nightmare logic than gritty reality. A number of torture victims have told me that Closet Land truly captures the psychological reality of their experience. Amnesty International has strongly supported the film. If Closet Land had been 'pretentious,' the former victims who so strongly identify with the film would have been able to smell it a mile away. And they would certainly never have responded to a movie that degraded their harrowing life experience to the level of 'porno chic.'\\" She added: > I am not, as [Thomas'] simplistic analysis would have it, trying to mix a > 'protest' of child abuse with a 'protest' of political abuse ... all forms > of aggression are organically linked.

That's our loss.\\" Her opinion of the film was overall overwhelmingly positive, dubbing it a \\"complex metaphor to political specificity,\\" an \\"Alice in Closetland\\" that \\"had to be pulled out of its author's head into the Real World for validation.\\" Analysing the film's themes, she said that \\"the film works most potently as a woman's redemptive fantasy, a harrowing Alice in Wonderland descent into the darkness behind the brain to discover 'the soul's true face.'\\" Critiquing the political and sexually abusive overtones, she noted that Stowe's character is \\"denuded of even a name, depersonalized into a number. Such erasure - of self and sexuality - is the legacy of child molestation; but it also suggests the powerfully seductive buildups and letdowns that dominate contemporary media images of women.\\" Praising the characterisations and performances, she likened Stowe's character to Kafka's Josef K. and said of Rickman's character, drawing comparisons to Big Brother: \\"Out of her imagination's rich store, Stowe has created a man of many parts, an actor who will play both satan and saviour to her sinner. Rickman receives her as the 'officer-in-charge', but he wears many masks - Grand Inquisitor, fellow victim, father, lover, therapist, the rapist - before he baptizes Stowe into authentic selfhood.\\" She further praised the production design by Ishioka and elaborated on the final scene, saying: \\"After Stowe's last blindfold is removed, she incandesces in her own enlightenment.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1927, as an independent member. Born in Platt Bridge, Lancashire, England, he was educated at St. Mark‚Äôs College in London. Downes taught English and history at Diocesan College in Pretoria, South Africa, later returning to England and teaching in Suffolk and Somersetshire. In 1912, he moved to Winnipeg. Downes served with the 184th Battalion and later as an officer with the 11th Canadian Railway Corps during World War I. After the war, he worked for the Soldiers Settlement Board. Downes's election to the Manitoba legislature occurred during a period of provincial controversy over the prohibition of alcohol. Although Downes was listed on the ballot as an independent candidate, he campaigned as a representative of the province's \\"Moderation League\\", supporting restrictions on the sale of alcoholic beverages. He called for beer to be sold only \\"by the glass\\" in licensed establishments for on-premises consumption, and opposed efforts to permit sales \\"by the bottle\\" for home consumption. It is not clear what views Downes held on other political issues. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1922 provincial election for the constituency of Winnipeg, which elected ten members by a single transferable ballot. Downes finished third on the first ballot, and was declared elected on the eleventh count. After serving as an opposition member for the next five years, Downes again ran as a \\"Moderation League\\" candidate in the 1927 provincial election. He narrowly missed re-election, finishing in eleventh place on the final count. After leaving politics, he worked for the Provincial Liquor Control Commission until his retirement in 1939. Downes sought a return to the legislature in the 1941 provincial election, running as an independent opposing the province's coalition government. He was a marginal political force by this time, and finished next-to-last in a field of twenty- seven candidates. He died at Deer Lodge hospital in Winnipeg after a short illness.

Plot The movie opens in 1972 as a group of gunmen wearing Richard Nixon Halloween masks steal evidence from a police evidence storage unit, killing several officers in the process. Officer Dennis Meechum (Brian Dennehy) is seriously wounded after stabbing one of the robbers. He survives and publishes a book titled Inside Job based on his experience. Years later, Meechum, who by now has become an acclaimed author and a much decorated detective, is working on his next novel. He now suffers from writer's block, and is a widowed father raising his daughter, Holly (Allison Balson). On a case at the docks, a suspect runs as Meechum gives chase. A man named Cleve (James Woods) joins the chase. The suspect hides in an overhead crane and attempts to shoot Meechum, but Cleve kills the man, then mysteriously disappears. Cleve arranges a meeting with Meechum, and tries to convince him to write a book about his history as a paid assassin for a corporate empire, Kappa International. Cleve intimidates Kappa's founder, David Madlock (Paul Shenar) about Meechum's next book, and promises Meechum to show evidence to back up his claims. They proceed to take trips to New York and Texas where Cleve tries to convince Meechum of his history of hits. While they are in Texas, it is revealed that Cleve was the injured masked gunman that Meechum had stabbed years earlier. Madlock, through his legal representatives, tries to bribe Meechum but fails. When an enforcer tries to steal a manuscript of Meechum's novel and attempts to kill Holly, Cleve intervenes by killing him. Cleve attempts to keep Holly safe by sending her to Meechum's agent, Roberta Gillian (Victoria Tennant). Madlock, however, manages to kidnap Holly. Meechum decides to have a meeting with Madlock at the latter's oceanfront estate. Cleve storms into the house, and guns down all of Madlock's bodyguards. Cleve then sacrifices his own life to save Holly from Madlock. Meechum arrests Madlock, before comforting a dying Cleve. Cleve reminds Meechum about the book and says \\"Remember I'm the hero\\".

He is the guitarist, singer, and a founding member of the band, Cynic. He has remained a continual member for nearly three decades and has developed numerous other projects including √Üon Spoke, Onward with Love, and recently his solo work. Masvidal was ranked in Loudwire's 66 Best Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists Of All Time and 50 Best Metal Songwriters of All Time. Early life Paul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban- American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal.  Education  Masvidal's early years were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar with Carlos Molina, and in college, with jazz musician, Dave Weissbrot who inspired his love of jazz, Steinberger guitars, and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. Masvidal developed an interest in mysticism and esoteric topics from a young age, becoming an initiate to Kriya Yoga in his late teens and eventually a practitioner of Buddhist meditation by his late 20s. Masvidal met drummer Sean Reinert in 1984 at Gulliver Academy In Miami, where the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed.  Career  = Pre-Cynic, Crypha and Seaweed (1984‚Äì1986) = While still at school, Masvidal had formed Crypha along with Sein Reinert. The duo later teamed up with their classmates Reid Hansen and Rod Segal to form Seaweed.

In an interview with Hungarian heavy metal magazine Rattle Inc., Segal mentioned: > \\"The band was never meant to be a long term thing. It was four friends > messing around... Sean and Paul had bigger ideas by then and went off to > music school.\\" Masvidal and Reinert eventually disbanded Seaweed and went on to form Cynic. = Cynic (1988 ‚Äì 1995, first hiatus) = Masvidal, the early years Masvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer Sean Reinert in the late 80s, having released four demos from 1988 to 1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band Death, but declined an invitation to permanently join the band to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist James Murphy for tour dates on the international Spiritual Healing tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \\"groundbreaking\\" Human. In 2017, Rolling Stone magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal albums of all time. Human was Death's best-selling album, and was ranked number 82 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. Death ranked number 1 in thetoptens.com's most influential death metal bands. Masvidal toured extensively for Human, in addition to appearing in the music video for \\"Lack of Comprehension\\", which debuted on MTV's Headbangers Ball. After fulfilling their obligations with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992. In 2013, Masvidal joined forces with other original members of the Death Human line up and toured worldwide in honor of Chuck Schuldiner's legacy with the group DTA (Death to All).alt=1993 saw the release of the \\"progressive landmark\\" album, Focus on Roadrunner Records. Focus was listed in Rock Hard magazine's book as one of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. Loudwire writer Graham Hartmann named Focus the ninth best debut metal album of all time. Roadrunner released a reissue of Focus in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. Cynic took a 12-year hiatus in 1995 after recording \\"The Portal Tapes\\" demos. Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at Musicians Institute, where he also began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. = √Üon Spoke (1999‚Äìpresent) = Paul Masvidal with √Üon Spoke During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded √Üon Spoke, whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \\"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio.

The screenplay by Frank Pierson and Cynthia Cidre was based on the novel by Bobbie Ann Mason. The original music score was composed by James Horner. Willis earned a best supporting actor Golden Globe nomination for his role. Plot Recent high school graduate Samantha Hughes, 17, lives in fictional Hopewell, Kentucky. Her uncle Emmett Smith, a laid-back Vietnam veteran, suffers from post- traumatic stress disorder. Samantha's father, Dwayne, was killed in Vietnam at 21 after marrying and impregnating Samantha's mother, Irene. Samantha finds some old photographs, medals, and letters of her father, and becomes obsessed with finding out more about him. Irene, who has moved to Lexington, Kentucky with her second husband, wants Samantha to move in with them and go to college. But Samantha would rather stay with Emmett and try to find out more about her father. Her mother is no help, as she tells Samantha, \\"Honey, I married him a month before he left for the war. He was 19. I hardly even remember him.\\" Finally, Samantha, Emmett and her grandmother visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Finding her father's name in the memorial releases cathartic emotions in Samantha and her family. Cast * Bruce Willis as Emmett Smith * Emily Lloyd as Samantha Hughes * Joan Allen as Irene * Kevin Anderson as Lonnie * John Terry as Tom * Peggy Rea as Mamaw * Judith Ivey as Anita * Daniel Jenkins as Dwayne * Stephen Tobolowsky as Pete * Jim Beaver as Earl Smith * Richard Hamilton as Grandpaw * Heidi Swedberg as Dawn * Ken Jenkins as Jim Holly * Jonathan Hogan as Larry * Patricia Richardson as Cindy Production =Casting= To prepare for her role, Emily Lloyd stayed with a lawyer and his family in Paducah, Kentucky. In order to get into the mindset of a girl whose father has died, the young actress thought of the death of her paternal grandfather, Charles Lloyd Pack, a British actor to whom she was very close. Lloyd underwent training to speak with a Kentucky accent in the film. The veterans in the dance sequence are all actual Vietnam vets as well and their real family members accompany them. Of the five major characters who are Vietnam veterans, only one, Earl, is played by an actual Vietnam veteran, Jim Beaver. Ken Jenkins, who plays Jim Holly (the organizer of the veteran's dance), is the father of Daniel Jenkins, who plays Samantha's father Dwayne in the Vietnam flashbacks. Their casting in the film was purely coincidental. The commencement speaker was played by Don Young, the minister of a large Baptist church in Paducah, Kentucky. In an interview with The Paducah Sun, he said the speech had been written for him but joked that it was so good, he might \\"borrow\\" parts of it in future sermons. =Filming= Much of the film was shot in Kentucky's far-western Jackson Purchase, where the original author, Bobbie Ann Mason, grew up. Her home of Graves County, specifically its county seat of Mayfield, was the location for many scenes. The walk-in doctor's office seen in the film is actually a dry cleaners which was renamed \\"Clothes Doctor\\" following its appearance in the film. Several other scenes were shot in the Purchase's largest city of Paducah, particularly the scenes inside Emmett's home. Release In Country had its world premiere on September 7, 1989 at the Toronto International Film Festival, which Bruce Willis attended and dedicated to Canadian war veterans who fought in Vietnam. =Box office performance= The film was given a limited release on September 15, 1989 in four theaters grossing $36,505 on its opening weekend. It was given a wide release on September 29, 1989 in 606 theaters grossing $1.3 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $3.5 million in North America. =Critical reception= In Country was generally well received by critics. It has a 68% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \\"The movie is like a time bomb. You sit there, interested, absorbed, sometimes amused, sometimes moved, but wondering in the back of your mind what all of this is going to add up to. Then you find out\\". In his review for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen praised Emily Lloyd's performance: \\"Emily Lloyd, the callow Brit who burned up the screen in Wish You Were Here, is letter perfect - her accent impeccable and her energy immense\\". USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and praised Bruce Willis' \\"subsidiary performance as Lloyd's reclusive guardian- uncle is admirably short on showboating\\". In his review for The Guardian, Derek Malcolm praised Lloyd for her \\"portrait is of a lively waif who does not intend to be easily defeated by the comedy of life without adding a few jokes of her own, and it is the most complete thing she has so far done on the screen, good as she was in Wish You Were Here\\". Time magazine felt that the script \\"perhaps pursues too many banal and inconsequential matters as it portrays teen life in a small town\\", but that \\"the film starts to gather force and direction when a dance, organized to honor the local Viet vets, works out awkwardly\\". Furthermore, its critic felt that the film was \\"a lovely, necessary little stitch in our torn time\\". In her review for The New York Times, Caryn James criticized the \\"cheap and easy touches ... that reduce it to the shallowness of a television movie\\", and found James Horner's score, \\"offensive and distracting\\". Newsweek magazine's David Ansen wrote, \\"While one can respect its lofty intentions, the movie doesn't seem to have any better sense than its high-school heroine of just what it's looking for. At once underdramatized and faintly stagy, it keeps promising revelations that never quite materialize\\". In her review for the Washington Post, Rita Kempley wrote, \\"What's meant to be a cohesive family portrait, a suffering American microcosm, is a shambles of threads dangling and characters adrift. Jewison leaves it to stymied viewers to figure out the gist of it\\".

The plot concerns the mysterious death of the daughter of a prominent Army general. The film is based on the 1992 novel by the same name by Nelson DeMille. Plot Vietnam War veteran Paul Brenner is in Georgia, masquerading as First Sergeant Frank White, to broker an illegal arms trade with a self-proclaimed freedom fighter. Brenner is actually a Chief Warrant Officer serving as an undercover agent of the United States Army Criminal Investigation Division Command. While on a local army base, Brenner's car gets a flat tire and a young officer helps him change it. The officer is Elisabeth Campbell, the commanding general's daughter and a captain in psychological operations. The next evening, she is found murdered. The base provost marshal, Colonel Kent, secures the crime scene. Brenner and Sara Sunhill, a rape specialist, are brought in to investigate. It starts out awkwardly between Brenner and Sunhill....they'd been involved in the past. Sunhill was engaged to a major while dating Brenner on the side and appears to enjoy toying with Brenner. Brenner and Sunhill search Elisabeth's home and find a room containing video and BDSM equipment. Brenner is attacked by an intruder who removes the video tapes. Brenner questions Elisabeth's superior officer, Colonel Moore. Moore is evasive and gives a false alibi, which leads Brenner to arrest him on charges of conduct unbecoming an officer. Sunhill is knocked to the ground by four men who try to intimidate her and Brenner. Sunhill notices that the main assailant is wearing a silver claddagh ring. It turns out to be a Captain Elby. At gunpoint, he confesses that Elisabeth was sexually promiscuous with the men on the base as part of an extensive \\"psychological warfare\\" campaign against her father. Back at the jail, Colonel Kent releases Moore, confining him to quarters at his home on-base. When Brenner, Sunhill, and Kent return to Moore's home, they find him dead with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. But Brenner is not convinced that Moore's death was suicide. General Campbell's adjutant, Colonel Fowler, attempts to close the investigation, stating that Moore killed himself out of guilt, but Brenner refuses to accept this. Brenner and Sunhill visit Colonel Slesinger, the Academy's psychiatrist, who explains that Elisabeth had been brutally gang raped by fellow cadets at West Point, and left to die in an isolated area‚Äîstaked down in exactly the same manner in which she was found murdered. While not directly cooperative Slesinger hints at where a key to the file cabinet is kept. He also hints at where a special notation was attached to her file...revealing the name of someone who came forward regarding Elisabeth to Slesinger privately. Elisabeth never knew the names of her assailants, but Sunhill tracks down the cadet who was in the report attached to Elisabeths file in Slesinger's cabinet at West Point. She tricks him into admitting his presence during Elisabeth's by showing him a pair of underwear that she'd purchased only an hour before...but makes the former cadet think they were Elisabeth's. She told him that the attackers DNA was on it. Feeling trapped but also guilt-ridden....because while he wasn't one of the attackers Elisabeth was his friend and he didn't help her....he admits witnessing the rape and the hatred the men had towards a woman who surpassed them as a cadet. They then arrest the other assailants, all of whom face 20 years imprisonment for their crime. The agents pay a visit to the general, who corroborates the story. Fearing that the assailants would never be caught, Campbell had acted upon the advice of another general and decided to cover up the incident since such a scandal could have destroyed the United States Military Academy. He also visited Elisabeth in the hospital and convinced her to do the same. This denial of justice severely traumatized Elisabeth, causing her to partake in various violent sexual activities and wage a war of psychological revenge against her father. Campbell also reveals that he encountered his daughter the night of her murder and that, with the aid of Moore, she staged the reenactment of her West Point rape in an attempt to force him to face what he did. But Campbell was unmoved, and left her tied to the stakes. Realizing that Kent is the only suspect left, Brenner decides to question him. He calls Sunhill but learns that she was returning to the murder scene with Kent, who also wants to see Brenner. Brenner arrives and confronts Kent, who admits that he killed Elisabeth. He had been madly, obsessively in love with her and was even ready to leave his wife and children to be with her forever. He snapped when she spat in his face and then strangled her to death. He also admits he murdered Moore and made it appear as suicide in an attempt to get away with it. Kent then commits suicide by deliberately stepping on an anti-personnel mine. As General Campbell prepares to get on the plane to accompany Elisabeth's body to the funeral, he is confronted by Brenner, who lays the burden of his daughter's death on the general. Brenner tells Campbell that his betrayal of Elisabeth was what had killed her and that Kent had just put her out of her misery. Though General Campbell threatens Brenner to keep silent or else be run out of the Army, Brenner has him court-martialed for conspiracy to conceal a crime, thus ruining the general's public and military careers.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 23, 1999. In the episode Stan, Kyle and Cartman pit Tweek and Craig against each other. Meanwhile, the boys' wood shop teacher, Mr. Adler, struggles to cope with the loss of his wife, who died in a plane crash. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA in the United States. It was the last South Park episode to air before the film, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, was released one week later on June 30. Plot The episode begins with the boys on their first day of wood shop. Mr. Adler, their teacher, tells the students not to \\"screw around\\". They are also asked who the biggest troublemaker in their class is. Stan and Kyle claim that Tweek is, while Cartman argues that it is Craig. To settle the dispute Stan, Kyle and Cartman make a bet over who would win a fight between Tweek and Craig. The boys set off tension between Tweek and Craig, and they agree to fight after school. Meanwhile, we see Mr. Adler dealing with troubling memories of a deceased lover every time he looks at a photo of her. To deal with the memories, he consumes great amounts of nicotine gum. Later, it is revealed that she was a pilot whose plane exploded in mid-air and crashed into the ocean, where she drowned. The flashbacks are depicted in live action by South Park assistant writer Pam Brady. When a crowd forms to see the fight, Clyde announces that both Tweek and Craig went home. Stan and Kyle go to Tweek's house, and Tweek explains that he had no reason to fight Craig. Eager to settle the bet, Stan and Kyle tell Tweek that Craig did show up to fight but degraded him instead. Meanwhile, Cartman and Kenny convince Craig to reschedule the fight as well. The next day, when the fight between Craig and Tweek is about to take place, it is revealed that neither know how to fight, and the battle is postponed again until they learn how to fight. Craig gets to learn martial arts with the aid of Cartman who considers sumo as a future career. Tweek is taught to box by Stan's uncle Jimbo and his friend Ned. Throughout the episode, Kenny has not been attending shop class, but home economics. Kenny is told to transfer to shop class by the teacher with the claim that home ec is not \\"right for him\\" and he will most likely not find a husband. Although terrified at the thought of being around all the tools (which is the reason why he didn't take shop class), Kenny has no choice and transfers. The school day ends and Tweek and Craig finally start the long- awaited fight. Meanwhile, in his shop class, Mr. Adler writes a suicide note explaining he cannot cope with his fianc√©e's death and that he has run out of nicotine gum. He climbs onto the slowly moving table saw feet first and awaits his death. He then gets up and shouts \\"Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?!\\", then repositions himself to go head first, saying \\"That would have hurt like hell!\\" Kenny comes in to the shop classroom, and Mr. Adler puts him to work on the jigsaw. Tweek and Craig fly through the shop classroom window, still fighting. Mr. Adler climbs down from the table saw and demands to know what is going on. Tweek and Craig knock the stool out from underneath Kenny, and Kenny hangs on the saw machine. Tweek slams Craig into a second saw which knocks over the one Kenny is on. Kenny's jacket is caught by the blade, and he is spun around and then flies into a box of old, rusty, sharp nails. When Mr. Adler picks up Kenny's body, his fianc√©e (along with his grandmother and uncle) talks to him through Kenny, telling him to move on. Mr. Adler says he can and hugs Kenny. Stan, unaware of the situation, delivers the familiar phrase to Kyle, \\"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.\\" The kids go to the hospital to visit Tweek and Craig to tell them about the bet. They tell Tweek and Craig that each boy's family called the other's wusses on the news, which revitalizes the fight. Production Mr. Adler is based on a teacher Matt Stone had in elementary school, whose name was bleeped multiple times on DVD commentary. The situation where the Pam Brady character yells, \\"It's all for you!\\" to Mr. Adler is an allusion to the film The Omen; at Damien's birthday party, these are the same last words the nanny cries right before she jumps off the roof to hang herself. This episode includes common musical pieces. The music used during the sumo training scenes was, at the time, the theme music used on CNBC's program Street Signs. Terrance, Mephesto's son, returns for this episode. When Kenny has a vision of all the sharp tools that would be around him if he transferred to Shop Class, the music that plays is an excerpt from Baba Yaga, the ninth movement of Modest Mussorgsky's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" suite, which has also been used in several other episodes.

Col. Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah ( Mu·∏•ammad Khouna Wald Haidallah) (born 1940) was the head of state of Mauritania (Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation, CMSN) from 4 January 1980 to 12 December 1984. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2003 presidential election and the 2007 presidential election.  Family background and early career  Born in 1940 in the Nouadhibou region (either in then-Spanish Sahara\\"Mauritania: Consolidation of Power\\", Library of Congress Country Studies or colonial Mauritania), into a family of the Sahrawi Laaroussien tribe, he passed to secondary education in Rosso near the border to French-administered Senegal. He earned a baccalaureat in science in Dakar, Senegal, in 1961. After joining the Mauritanian army in 1962,Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah, Rulers.org he studied in French military colleges, notably Saint-Cyr. After 1975, he commanded forces in the north of Mauritania and Tiris al-Gharbiya (Western Sahara), in the war against Polisario Front guerrillas, notably in the Zouerate region and Bir Moghrein. In 1978, with the country in severe disorder, he participated in a coup d'√©tat that overthrew Mauritanian President Mokhtar Ould Daddah. As a member of the CRMN military junta, he was promoted to the post of Chief of the General Staff.  As head of CMSN  Haidallah became prime minister on 31 May 1979, a few days after the death in an airplane crash of the previous prime minister, Col. Ahmed Ould Bouceif, with whom he had seized power for the CMSN just a month earlier, from Col. Mustafa Ould Salek and the CRMN. In January 1980 he seized power from Ould Salek's successor as head of state, Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Louly. He continued to also hold the position of Prime Minister until December of that year, when a civilian, Sid Ahmed Ould Bneijara, was appointed to the post. His reign was marked by severe political turbulence, as Mauritania extracted itself from the war with the Polisario Front ‚Äî started by Ould Daddah in 1975 ‚Äî and his regime faced a number of coup attempts and military intrigues.\\"Mauritania: The Haidalla Regime\\", Library of Congress Country Studies\\"Mauritanian Group Says It Killed Libyan in Rome\\", New York Times, September 23, 1984. On March 16, 1981 a coup attempt against Haidalla failed,.\\"Mauritanian Coup Attempt Fails After Bloody Clashes\\", Washington Post, March 17, 1981. Haidalla accused Morocco of being behind the coup, which Morocco denied, and in the next month Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya was appointed Prime Minister.\\"Career Soldier Takes Over As Premier of Mauritania\\", New York Times, April 27, 1981. Another attempted coup was allegedly sponsored by Libya. In March 1984, Haidallah took the office of Prime Minister again, replacing Taya, in a move to strengthen his personal power.\\"Mauritania: Political Disintegration\\", Library of Congress Country Studies On December 12, however, Taya ousted Haidallah in a coup while the latter was out of the country. Haidalla had been at a Franco-African Summit in Burundi\\"Mauritania's President Arrested by Coup Leader\\", UPI, New York Times, December 14, 1984.\\"Former Mauritanian President Ould Haidalla seeks new term in office\\", African Press Agency, March 7, 2007. and learned of the coup in Brazzaville, during his return to Mauritania, from Denis Sassou Nguesso, the president of the Republic of the Congo. Haidallah returned to Mauritania anyway and was arrested at the airport in Nouakchott; he was eventually released in December 1988. Taya promised to install democracy, but his rule was considered dictatorial by many; he was deposed by a military coup in 2005. = Foreign policy = Haidallah's main achievement was to make peace with the Western Sahara-based Polisario Front, which had been fighting Mauritania since it annexed part of the former Spanish colony in 1975. The CMSN opted for complete withdrawal from the conflict, evacuating southern Rio de Oro (which had been annexed as Tiris El Gharbiya) and recognizing the POLISARIO as the representative of the Sahrawi people. This led to a crisis in relations with the country's until-then ally Morocco, which had similarly annexed the remainder of Western Sahara, with Haidallah's government facing an attempted coup, troop clashes and military tension.\\"Mauritania: The Polisario Problem\\", Arab.net. Relations were completely severed between 1981 and 1985, when they were restored by Haidalla's successor.\\"Mauritania: Regional Security Concerns\\", Library of Congress Country Studies.\\"Mauritania: Morocco\\", Library of Congress Country Studies. However, relations improved with POLISARIO's main regional backer, Algeria, with the Algerian government sending arms and supplies to bolster his regime.Mauritania: Relations with Other States of the Maghrib, Library of Congress Country Studies Haidalla's 1984 recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR, the POLISARIO's government-in- exile) as a sovereign nation appears to have been one of the triggering causes for Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's coup in 1984. =Domestic policy= On the domestic front, his most notable policies were the institution of Islamic sharia law in 1980-83,\\"Mauritania: History\\", Encyclop√¶dia of the Orient as well as several failed attempts to rebuild the political system shattered by the 1978 coup ‚Äî first as a multiparty system, and then, after the first coup attempt against him, as a one-party state. It was also during Haidallah's rule that slavery was formally abolished in Mauritania, although the practice continues at a diminished level still today. He made a statement announcing the abolition of slavery in July 1980, and this was followed by a legal decree in November 1981.\\"Mauritania: A future free from slavery?\\" , Amnesty International, November 7, 2002. Political opponents were treated harshly, with imprisonments\\"Mauritanian ruler from the 1980s enters post-coup presidential race\\", International Herald Tribune, December 28, 2006. and those responsible for one of the failed coups against his government were executed.  Activities after losing power  After returning to Mauritania in 1984, Haidallah was held in administrative detention for several years by Ould Taya, during which time he fell sick. After his release, he stayed outside politics until 2003, when he returned to head the opposition. He then unsuccessfully ran for president against Taya in November, campaigning on a moderately Islamist platform, whereas Taya, who had established full diplomatic ties with Israel, was considered pro-Western. Haidallah officially came in second with about 19% of the vote, although he alleged fraud; he was arrested immediately after the election, accused of plotting a coup.\\"MAURITANIA: Ould Haidallah trial to begin on Monday\\", IRIN, 27 November 2003.

After the 2005 coup  Following a military coup against Taya in August 2005, an amnesty in early September freed Haidallah from his sentence, along with more than a hundred others sentenced for political offenses. On December 27, 2006, Haidalla announced that he would be a candidate in the presidential election scheduled for March 11, 2007. He campaigned on a nationalist-Islamist platform, citing the struggle against poverty and slavery as priorities. On February 3, he gained the support of another registered presidential candidate, former opposition politician and prisoner under Ould Taya, Chbih Ould Cheikh Melainine, who dropped out of the race. However, no longer having the political base that came with being the main candidate of the opposition under Ould Taya, Haidallah was even less successful in the 2007 election, coming in tenth place and receiving 1.73% of the vote. After the election, which was won by Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, Haidalla announced his support for Abdallahi in October 2007.\\"Former Mauritanian leader pledges support for current president\\", African Press Agency, October 25, 2007. However, following the coup that ousted Abdallahi in August 2008, Haidalla expressed his support for the coup in a statement on August 29, 2008, saying that it was necessary under the circumstances and urging all Mauritanians to support it. He also criticized the negative reactions of Western governments to the coup, alleging that they were interfering in Mauritanian affairs. In July 2007, Sidi Mohamed Uld Haidalla (Mohamed Khouna's son) was detained in Morocco for drug trafficking charges. In 2008 he was judged and condemned to 7 years in prison. On June 18, 2010, Haidallah wrote an open letter to the heads of state who have good relations with the king of Morocco, requesting for help to bring his son back to Mauritania or to liberate him. He denounces the conditions of imprisonment of his son, who is handicapped. On June 24, 2010, El Ghassem Uld Bellali, a Mauritanian deputy, declared that the imprisonment of Sidi Mohamed Uld Haidalla is a Moroccan \\"political vengeance\\" against Haidalla's father, for the recognition he gave to the SADR and to the right of self-determination of the Sahrawi people, when he was president of Mauritania.

Biography From 1872 to 1886, he was appointed professor at Faculty of Sciences of Lille, lecturing differential and integral calculus at Institut industriel du Nord (√âcole centrale de Lille). From 1896 to his retirement in 1918, he was professor of mechanics at Faculty of Sciences of Paris. John Scott Russell experimentally observed solitary waves in 1834A New Kind of Science and reported it during the 1844 Meeting of the British Association for the advancement of science. Subsequently, this was developed into the modern physics of solitons. In 1871, Boussinesq published the first mathematical theory to support Russell's experimental observation, and in 1877 introduced the KdV equation. In 1876, Lord Rayleigh published his mathematical theory to support Russell's experimental observation. At the end of his paper,Lord Rayleigh (1876). On waves. Philosophical Magazine, ser. 5, vol. 1, no. 4: 257-279. Lord Rayleigh admitted that Boussinesq's theory came before his. In 1897, he published Th√©orie de l'√©coulement tourbillonnant et tumultueux des liquides (\\"Theory of the swirling and agitated flow of liquids\\"), a work that greatly contributed to the study of turbulence and hydrodynamics. The word \\"turbulence\\" was never used by Boussinesq. He used sentences such as \\"√©coulement tourbillonnant et tumultueux\\". The first mention of the word \\"turbulence\\" in French or English scientific fluid mechanics literature (the word \\"turbulence\\" existed in other context) can be found in a paper by Lord Kelvin in 1887.

Tomie was Ito's first published work he originally submitted to Monthly Halloween, a sh≈çjo magazine in 1987, which led to him winning the Kazuo Umezu award. The manga has been adapted into a live-action film series with eight installments to date, and an anthology television series released in 1999, and a web television series in development for Quibi. Plot The manga centers on the titular character: a mysterious, beautiful woman named Tomie Kawakami, identified by her sleek black hair and a beauty mark below her left eye. Tomie acts like a succubus, possessing an undisclosed power to make anyone fall in love with her. Through her mere presence, or through psychological and emotional manipulation, she drives these people into jealous rages that often lead to brutal acts of violence. Men kill each other over her, and women are driven to insanity as well ‚Äî though there are some who are strong enough to resist her. Tomie is inevitably then killed time and time again, only to regenerate and spread her curse to other victims, making her effectively immortal. Her origins are never explained, though it is suggested by some older men in the series that she has existed long before the events of the manga; in Boy, she is revealed to have known her future teacher Satoru Takagi since he was a child. Each story showcases various characters that encounter Tomie in her many (often hideous) forms, with some having their own arcs or returning in later chapters. Tomie's regenerative abilities (partly fuelled by cannibalism) are also showcased: aside from recovering quickly from gruesome and seemingly mortal wounds, she can also replicate herself by sprouting unnaturally from any part of her body, whether it be from severed limbs, organs, or even her spilled blood. Radiation accelerates her healing/regeneration process. Her cells are also capable of transforming a victim into a Tomie via an organ transplant. Multiple characters are even driven to dismember her corpse, unwittingly allowing more Tomie copies to grow and spread throughout the world. Even locks of her hair are dangerous; burrowing into its victim's brain to possess them, and eventually kill them when it grows wildly within the body. It is also shown that even if Tomie's body is not injured, her body will attempt to sprout another Tomie through tumorous growths, usually when she is emotionally stressed. Some Tomie copies, however, cannot stand one another; one is seen killing one personally, while others order it done through the boys they seduce/enslave. Fire is the only known method to destroy a Tomie for good, though only if the flesh is completely carbonized. The next story arc, beginning as a prequel, reveals that a baby girl can grow naturally into a Tomie via a blood injection and that she can age if she has not yet copied herself. The man responsible for these injections is a horribly burnt stranger ‚Äî once a supermodel disgraced by a Tomie in his past ‚Äî who seeks revenge by making one of these \\"natural\\" Tomies old and ugly. He manages to encase a Tomie named \\"Ayaka\\" in a block of cement with the help of Ayaka's older sister. The two then wait for many years ‚Äî endlessly hearing her tormented cries ‚Äî before finally breaking the block, revealing that Tomie had somehow escaped through a tiny crack, her apparent wailing being nothing more than wind blowing through the hollow block. An arc released exclusively with the DVD release of the Junji Ito Collection, titled Tomie: Takeover, features Tomie encountering a man so narcissistic that she is unable to take control over him, resulting in Tomie doubting her own attraction. A four-page crossover arc with Souichi Tsujii, titled Souichi Possessed, was released in 2018. In the story, the titular's Souichi's older brother Koichi tells a younger Tomie of his attempted mischief of a brother's encounter with a different elderly Tomie, the arc serving as the prologue to a larger confrontation between the pair, as the younger Tomie requests an introduction. Publication Tomie is published by Asahi Sonorama and appeared as a serial in the manga magazine Monthly Halloween from 1987 to 2000. Tomie received one bound volume on February 1996, titled .

There are to date nine films in the series. The films manage to recreate the atmosphere of the manga. Most of the manga stories occur during the dark of night for its sense of eeriness, and the films generally follow suit. Two episodes were adapted for the Junji Ito Collection. Tomie's sexuality in films is more ambiguous. In the manga, Tomie's attitude towards other people seems to range between thinly- veiled hostility and outright murderous rage (unless she stands to profit from them), while the film incarnation is known to seduce women as well as men. In July 2019, Alexandre Aja was announced to be developing a web television series adaptation of Tomie for Quibi, in conjunction with Sony Pictures Television and Universal Content Productions, with David Leslie Johnson- McGoldrick serving as writer and executive producer and Hiroki Shirota onboard as co-producer.

He is best known for his organ at Exeter Cathedral in Devon, which he completed in 1665. John Loosemore was born in Barnstaple where he was baptized on 25 August 1616. His father was also a builder and repairer of organs, and passed on the trade to his son John, who moved to Exeter sometime before 1645. The other two sons of the family, Henry and George, also had a connection with organ music as they were eventually appointed organists at King's College, Cambridge and Trinity College, Cambridge, respectively, probably under the patronage of Dudley North, 4th Baron North. During the rule of the Puritans in Exeter from 1646-1660, church music was frowned upon. Many church organs, including the previous instrument in Exeter Cathedral, were vandalized or destroyed during the English Civil War. During this period, Loosemore was employed primarily in repairing organs and building other keyboard instruments for private ownership. One of his virginals dated 1655 has been preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum. With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, Loosemore was commissioned first to repair the old organ in Exeter Cathedral, and then, in 1662-1663, to build a new one. This was completed on 27 May 1665. Loosemore reported the cost of the new organ as ¬£847.7s.10d. Loosemore constructed at least two other organs during his lifetime, another in Exeter Cathedral for the choir school and one at Nettlecombe Court for Sir George Trevelyan. After the marriage of his eldest daughter Joan to his assistant John Shearme in 1674 or 1675, Loosemore turned over much of his business to him and lived in semi- retirement. After a period of increasing infirmity, he died on 18 April 1681, and was buried in Exeter Cathedral. His gravestone was originally placed in the floor at the east end of the nave near the entrance to the south aisle of the choir, close to his organ, but has since been moved to the north choir aisle near the north wall. He is the namesake of the John Loosemore Centre for Organ and Early Music in Buckfastleigh, Devon, founded in 1974 by John Wellingham, William Drake and Allan Thomas as a teaching establishment offering tuition in both organ playing and history, and construction of organs in an adjoining workshop. The teaching program has since been discontinued, but the organ-building workshop remains under the direction of William Drake.

Starting off as a small largely rural community, Oakbank is now a dormitory town or bedroom community for Winnipeg, as a majority of the residents work in that city. Its rapid population growth is representative of small towns in the Winnipeg Capital Region, with two new housing developments being expanded in the town.  History  In 1899, a post office was established in the present location of Oakbank and the village grew around it. In 1901, a Presbyterian church was moved to the community and a Baptist church built in 1908. In 1906, the Canadian Pacific Railway built a track that passed through the village; by 1927 the line was double-tracked. A train station existed until 1968. Electricity was supplied by the Winnipeg Electric Company starting in 1930. Rural electrification did not reach the surrounding area until 1949. In 1887, a telephone was installed in the home of the municipal secretary treasurer. Various private telephone companies, often with only a dozen subscribers, operated until they were all absorbed by Manitoba Telephone System in 1950. In 1964, local school divisions were consolidated and Oakbank became the local center for elementary, junior high and high school students, against many people's wishes. A local manual telephone exchange was in operation until 1966 when an automatic exchange was installed. A credit union was founded in the village in 1945.

He served as a U.S. Representative from 1971 to 1973 and as the 27th Governor of North Dakota from 1973 to 1981. Life and career Link was born in Alexander, North Dakota. He attended the McKenzie County schools, and North Dakota Agricultural College. Link began a career as a farmer soon after his 1939 marriage, and became active in politics as a member of the local chapters of the National Farmers' Union and Nonpartisan League. He was elected to the North Dakota House of Representatives in 1946 as a Democrat. Link served for 14 years as the house's minority leader, and was speaker of the house from 1965 to 1967. He was also a member of the Randolph Township Board, 1942‚Äì1972; McKenzie County Welfare Board, 1948‚Äì1969; Randolph School Board, 1945‚Äì1963; county and State Farm Security Administration committee, 1941‚Äì1946; and delegate, North Dakota State conventions, 1964-1968. In 1970, Link was persuaded to run for U.S. Congress from the western district of North Dakota to succeed Republican incumbent Thomas S. Kleppe, who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. It was a job with little security as it appeared certain the state would be consolidated into a single congressional district after the census. He was narrowly elected as a Dem-NPLer to the Ninety-second Congress (January 3, 1971 ‚Äì January 2, 1973) in a mild surprise; was not a candidate for reelection in 1972 but was a successful candidate for Governor of North Dakota; reelected in 1976 and served from January 2, 1973, until January 6, 1981. Link was well liked and well respected as a governor. Those of all political persuasions found common ground with him. Some considered him a social conservative who was staunchly anti-abortion, deeply religious and willing to stand for principle even when political wisdom dictated otherwise, vetoing a bill to lower the state minimum drinking age to 19 years and providing leadership against legalizing gambling in the state. Others viewed him as a moderate as he was also astute fiscally, managing to avoid raising taxes of one of the poorer states in the nation. Still others saw him as a progressive, since he was still able to maintain and grow an excellent education system with affordable universities and students who consistently achieve some of the top test scores in the United States. Even his political opponents could find little to criticize about his governing style. Some in his own party considered him too religious, too ethical, too colorless and too unwilling to compromise for the sake of political expediency. Nevertheless, he was nominated to run for a third term. He narrowly lost re-election in 1980 only due to a perfect storm of circumstances working against him, namely (1) a tradition of turnover in the governor's office (only Link's immediate predecessor in the office had served more than six years), (2) continuous occupation of the governor's mansion since 1961 by Dem-NPLers in a solidly Republican state, (3) a highly unpopular President Jimmy Carter running for re-election at the top of the ticket, (4) a highly popular opponent Ronald Reagan running on the Republican side, (5) a national feeling of pessimism brought about by the Iran hostage crisis and an unprecedented combination of double-digit unemployment, inflation and gas lines, even though North Dakota fared far better than most other places in the United States. Later life After his defeat for re-election, Link remained active in public life, leading a successful fight against a state lottery in 1984. He also remained a strong force for historical preservation and writing of local histories. He and his wife Grace lived in Bismarck, North Dakota. He is fondly remembered by North Dakotans and former North Dakotans, Dem-NPLers and Republicans alike as one of the best governors the state ever enjoyed. Though the Democratic-NPL has been able to elect only one governor since Link vacated the office in 1981, they managed to occupy all the seats in the state's federal congressional delegation from 1987 until January 2011, with every member therein having served during the Link Administration. A movie was made of the Links' lives in 2008, entitled: \\"When the Landscape is Quiet Again\\". Link died at St. Alexius Hospital on June 1, 2010, in Bismarck, just eight days after his 96th birthday. He was survived by his wife of 71 years, former First Lady of North Dakota Grace Link, with whom he had six children.

He was also the younger brother of Rudolf Dassler, founder of Puma. Dassler was an innovator in athletic shoe design and one of the early promoters who obtained endorsements from athletes to drive sale of his products. As a result of his concepts, Adi Dassler built the largest manufacturer of sportswear and equipment. At the time of his death Adidas had 17 factories and annual sales of one billion marks. Life =Early life and education, 1900-1918= Adolf ‚ÄúAdi‚Äù Dassler was born in the Franconian town of Herzogenaurach, a small town about 20 km outside Nuremberg, on 3 November 1900, the third son and youngest of four children of Christoph and Pauline Dassler. His siblings were Fritz, born 1892, Marie, born 1894 and Rudolf born 1898. Christoph had been the last in a line of Dassler weavers and dyers. With the collapse of the local textile industry owing to competition from industrial producers Christoph left his ancestors' trade, began learning the intricate stitching skills needed to become a cobbler and obtained employment at a local factory, eventually specializing in making felt slippers. Many others in Herzogenaurach had turned to shoemaking at the same time; by 1922, the town boasted 112 shoemakers out of a population of 3,500. His mother set up a laundry in the back of the house where his sister Marie also worked, and the three boys were used to deliver clean wash throughout the town, becoming known as the \\"laundry boys.\\" Dassler as a running athlete in 1915 In 1913 Adi completed his formal education and was apprenticed to a baker. Entirely uninterested in becoming a baker, Adi spent much of his free time in athletic endeavors. Along with his childhood friend, Fritz Zehlein, son of a local blacksmith, he engaged in a variety of sporting events in track and field as well as football, boxing, ice hockey, skiing and ski jumping. Adi frequently fashioned his own equipment such as javelins from sticks and discus from stones. Soon after August 1914, Adi's brothers were conscripted by the German Army. Adi completed his apprenticeship but decided against becoming a baker. Instead he began to learn stitching from his father. He also began thinking about how changes in shoe design could improve athletic performance. He was beginning to conclude that specialized shoes for each sport might produce significant results. It was an idea that would guide his later career and profoundly affect sport and the business surrounding it. Before his 18th birthday Adi was conscripted in June 1918 in the last days of the war. He remained in the army for over a year until October 1919. When Adi returned, he found that the economic devastation of the war caused their mother to give up the laundry business. Adi decided to pursue his concepts of innovative athletic footwear design and use the laundry shed to begin a small shoe production business. =The Brothers Dassler Shoe Factory, 1918-1945= Adi supported himself while attempting to start up his business by repairing shoes in town. Facing the realities of post-war Germany where there was no reliable supply for material for production or credit to obtain factory equipment or supplies, he began by scavenging army debris in the war-torn countryside: Army helmets and bread pouches supplied leather for soles; parachutes could supply silk for slippers. Dassler became quite adept at jury-rigging available devices to help mechanize production in the absence of electricity. Using belts, for example, he rigged a leather milling machine to a mounted, stationary bicycle powered by the firm's first employee. The business would be driven by Adi's vision of specialized sport designs. He produced one of the earliest spiked shoes, with spikes forged by the smithy of the family of his friend Fritz Zehlein. He constantly experimented with various materials (such as shark skin and kangaroo leather) to create strong but lightweight shoes. Years later his widow, K√§the Dassler, said: \\"Developing shoes was his hobby, not his job. He did it very scientifically.\\" The \\"Dassler Brothers Sports Shoe Factory\\", near Herzogenaurach train station in 1928 After the war Rudolf had determined on becoming a policeman. But after he completed his training, he joined Adi's firm on 1 July 1923. With the support of the Zehlein smithy producing spikes, Adi was able to register Gebr√ºder Dassler, Sportschuhfabrik, Herzogenaurach (\\"Dassler Brothers Sports Shoe Factory\\", Herzogenaurach) on 1 July 1924. By 1925 the Dasslers were making leather Fu√üballschuhe (football boots) with nailed studs and track shoes with hand- forged spikes. Two factors paved the way for the transformation of the business from a small regional factory to the international shoe distributor it would become. First was the interest showed by former Olympian and then coach of the German Olympic track-and-field team, Josef Waitzer. On learning of the plant and Adi's experiments, Waitzer travelled from Munich to Herzogenaurach to see for himself. A long friendship developed between the two, based on interest in improving athletic performance with improved footwear, and Waitzer became something of a consultant to the company. The relationship would prove extremely valuable in giving Adi access to the athletes (German and foreign) at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. As early as the 1928 Amsterdam games, however, the Dasslers' footwear was being used in international competitions. Lina Radke, for example, the German middle distance runner who won gold in 1928, wore Dassler track shoes. Likewise, a German gold medal runner wore Dassler shoes at the 1932 Los Angeles games. The second key factor for the shoe firm in the early 1930s was the role sport played in the racial-nationalist philosophy of Hitler. With the rise of the Nazi Party, athletic teamwork was prioritized. The Dassler brothers did not fail to see how their economic interest would benefit from politics; all three Dassler brothers joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933‚Äîthree months after Hitler was appointed Chancellor. Rudolf was said to be most ardent believer of the three. But it was Adi who decided that becoming a coach of and supplier to clubs in the Hitler Youth movement was essential to expanded production, and he joined in 1935. (In his denazification proceedings after the war, Adi pointed out that he confined himself to coaching and avoided political rallies. He also testified that he was involved in clubs of other political affiliations, such as a liberal gymnastic club, Herzogenaurach's conservative KHC soccer club and a workers' sports club named \\"Union.\\") Both Adi and Rudolf were members of the National Socialist Motor Corps, and in their correspondence both used the complimentary closing, \\"Heil Hitler.\\" In the early 1930s Adi Dassler enrolled in theSchuhfachschule (the Footwear Technical College) in Pirmasens. One of the instructors was Franz Martz, a master producer of lasts. Dassler became a frequent house guest of Martz, who permitted Dassler's attentions to his fifteen-year-old daughter, K√§the Martz. On 17 March 1934, the two wed. Unlike Rudolf's wife Friedl (n√©e Strasser), K√§the was somewhat self-assertive and suspicious of brusque ways of Franconians. She would have frequent run-ins with Adi's parents and Rudolf and his wife, all of whom lived in the same house. Years later, in a letter to Puma's American distributor, Rudolf explained the rift with his brother as solely to be blamed on K√§the, who he claimed \\"tried to interfere in business matters ‚Ä¶\\"; he claimed that the brothers' relations were \\"ideal\\" until 1933. K√§the would give birth to their son Horst in March 1936, their first daughter Inge in June 1938 and their second daughter Karin in 1941. After the war, Brigit was born in May 1946 and Sigrid in 1953. Jesse Owens with his record- setting long jump, wearing Dasslers' shoes at the 1936 Berlin Olympics Dassler saw the 1936 Berlin Olympics as the key springboard for international exposure. Although his relation with Waitzer ensured that most German athletes would wear Dassler footwear, Dassler had another athlete principally in mind‚ÄîJesse Owens, the American track-and-field star. Dassler found his way to meeting Owens and wordlessly offered his shoes to the American star. Owens accepted the gesture and wore the distinctive shoes (with two leather strips on the sides and dark spikes) when he defeated Lutz Long in the long jump (shattering his own record in the process), in his two individual gold-winning performances in track and as a member of America's Gold medal upset of the German relay team. Dasslers' association with Owens proved crucial to the success of the firm. Not only did it immediately catapult the company into an international player in the sportswear field spiking sales overall, but it quite literally later saved the firm. When American troops discovered that the Dassler factory was where the shoes for Owens' Olympic victories were made, they decided to let the works remain standing, and, indeed, many of the troops became good customers. Large orders for basketball, baseball and hockey footwear gave the Dasslers \\"the first boost on the road to becoming a worldwide success story.\\" Once war began the Dasslers' ability to profit from Nazi enthusiasm for sport ended as the Reich became a total war machine. The Dassler firm was permitted to operate, but its production was severely curtailed. Then on 7 August 1940 Adi received notice of his conscription into the Wehrmacht. Although he reported in December to begin training as a radio technician, he was relieved of duty on 28 February 1941 on the ground that his services were essential in Gebr√ºder Dassler. Rudolf, who had already served four years during the Great War, was drafted in January 1943. In the early years of the war, the firm was partially converted to a factory for the production of military material. Nevertheless, staff was reduced and supply was hard to come by. But it still continued to produce Waitzer shoes, although some of its football line became known as \\"Kampf\\" and \\"Blitz.\\" By October 1942 worker shortage became so severe that Adi Dassler himself formally requested the use of five Soviet prisoners of war to man his production line. Wartime conditions exacerbated the simmering dispute between Rudolf and Adi's families. The house that Christoph, Pauline, sons Rudolf and Adi and their wives, and five grandchildren all lived in together seemed stifling, and forced family association at work was further complicated by sister Marie's employment there. Rudolf, angry that his younger brother was determined to be the leader of the Dassler firm (and therefore released from the Wehrmacht), began to assert himself among family members. He used this assumed authority to deny employment to two of Marie's sons, asserting that \\"there were enough family problems at the company.\\" The decision devastated his sister, since those not employed in permitted industries were nearly guaranteed to be drafted as the army's manpower needs became a gaping maw. Indeed, Marie's sons were eventually conscripted, and they never returned from the war. Fritz Dassler, who was not on speaking terms with Adi, made a similar decision laying off a teenaged seamstress who worked for his lederhosen-turned-army- pouch manufacturer, but had worked previously for four years for Adi. Adi managed to make room at the shoe factory to protect her for the rest of the war. Rudolf's rage boiled over when he was called up again in January 1943 as part of a total mobilization program. He later expressed (to the Puma American distributors) the belief that he was unfairly repaid for getting his brother \\"released for the factory\\" in 1942 and claimed that for his own immediate conscription he \\"had to thank my brother and his [Nazi] party friends ‚Ä¶\\" Stationed in Tuschin in April 1943, Rudolf wrote to his brother: \\"I will not hesitate to seek the closure of the factory so that you be forced to take up an occupation that will allow you to play the leader and, as a first-class sportsman, to carry a gun.\\" Six months later the factory was indeed shut down, but as part of the Reich's Totaler Krieg‚ÄîK√ºrzester Krieg (Total War‚ÄîShortest War) campaign, part of which involved converting all industry to military production. On leave at the time of the shut down, Rudolf intended to take some of the leather inventory for his own later use. Stunned to find that Adi had already done so, he denounced his brother to the Kreisleitung (the county level Party leaders), according to K√§the, who treated her husband \\"in the most demeaning manner.\\" In December 1943 the shoe-making machinery of the Dassler firm were replaced by spot-welding machines. The Army determined that the Dassler plant would thereafter make Panzerschreck, a shoulder-fired tube copied after captured American bazookas. Like the American proto-type, the weapon was designed to be relatively light weight and able to penetrate tank armor. Stationary testing suggested it could penetrate 230 mm, 15‚Äì75 mm deeper than the American bazooka. The Army's contractor was Schriker & Co., located in nearby Vach, which shifted assembly to Herzogenaurach to avoid Allied air raids. Parts were transported by rail to the Dassler plant where they were welded. The simple design of the weapon allowed the contractor to quickly train former seamstresses to spot weld sights and blast shields onto the pipes provided. the more complicated production of rockets continued in Vach. The weapons were to be distributed to tank-destroying detachments, and by March 1945 92,000 Panzerschrecks were in active use at the fronts of the rapidly constricting periphery of German territory. Although the weapon was remarkably effective and easily produced, its availability came too late in the war to save the Reich. Back in Tuschin, Rudolf continued to make good on his resolve to wrest the plant from his brother. Using contacts at the Luftwaffe he attempted to have the production of Panzerschrecks replaced by government- ordered production of army boots under a patent he personally held. The patent proved defective, and his plan came to nothing. Unable to obtain permission to leave the Polish outpost, Rudolf turned to his own devising. Several weeks before January 19, 1945, when the Soviets overran Tuschin (which then reverted to its original name, Tuszyn) and decimated his unit, Rudolf had fled to Herzogenaurach (where a doctor provided him a certificate of military incapacity owing to a frozen foot). The now-defunct unit had been folded into the Schutzstaffel (SS). The sources for what Rudolf did between his desertion from Tuschin and the funeral of Rudolf's and Adi's father on 4 April 1945 is among the disputed records in the American denazification panels. On the day after the funeral he was arrested and taken to the B√§renschanze prison run by the Gestapo in N√ºrnberg. He remained there until the Allied liberation in early May. When American troops reached Herzogenaurach, tanks paused before the Dassler factory pondering whether to blow it up. K√§the immediately approached the troops and argued that the plant was simply a sports shoes producer. The troops spared the plant, taking over the family house in the process. Two weeks after the liberation of Herzogenaurach, Rudolf returned. As the American denazification process proceeded, the threat of liability from their Nazi past drove an irreconcilable rift between brothers Rudolf and Adi, each seeking to save himself. =The denazification proceedings and the family rupture, 1946= Sculpture of Dassler in the Adi Dassler Stadium On 25 July 1945, about two months after the arrival of U.S. troops, Rudolf was arrested by the American occupation authorities, on suspicion that he worked for the Sicherheitsdienst (the secret service of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS commonly known as the SD) engaged in counterespionage and censorship, and was sent to an internment camp in Hammelburg. Rudolf began to prepare a defense that he did not voluntarily help the Reich and did not in any event engage in SS or SD activities. The American investigators soon discovered his early Nazi party membership and proof that he volunteered for the Wehrmacht in 1941. They even knew that in Tuschin his job was to keep track of \\"personal and smuggling cases.\\" His key problem, however, was in explaining his activities after he had been summoned to Nuremberg in March by the Gestapo. Rudolf maintained that he had been summoned on March 13 for an investigation of his earlier unauthorized departure from Tuschin and did nothing but report daily to the Gestapo while they investigated him for over two weeks. He claimed that he escaped on March 20. Rudolf used written statements of his former superior in Tuschin (who was in the same camp and alleged to be the intelligence chief of the region) and a driver he encountered after he was arrested by the Gestapo in April (who was also incarcerated with Rudolf). Rudolf made much use of the latter's testimony and averred that he had been sentenced by the Gestapo to the Dachau concentration camp. Rudolf claimed that en route the driver was ordered to shoot all the prisoners, disregarded the order, continued toward Dachau but was stopped by advancing Allied troops to whom he released the prisoners, including Rudolf. The American investigator in charge of the case did not credit any of this testimony, which he regarded as mere cover for the unlawful activity of all three. He noted that both Rudolf's wife and his brother Adi testified that Rudolf worked for the Gestapo. The investigation ground on for nearly a year. During the time it became apparent that it was not possible to hold all the prisoners for a detailed examination of the case, and the authorities decided to release all persons not deemed to be a security threat. Accordingly, Rudolf was released on 31 July 1946. Before Rudolf was released, Adi himself had to appear before the denazification panel. The result was announced on 13 July 1946: Adi was declared a Belasteter, the second most serious category of Nazi offenders, which included profiteers, and subjected the convict up to 10 years in prison, but the immediate threat was that he would be removed from management of the firm. His early membership in the Nazi Party and the Hitler Youth were not contestable. But on appeal he amassed a portfolio of testimony attesting to his good conduct during the war. Adi's staunchest supporter was Herzogenaurach's mayor, who the Allied forces trusted. A nearby mayor, who was half-Jewish, testified that Adi warned him of a potential Gestapo arrest and hid him on his own property. A longtime Communist party member testified that Adi was never involved in political activities. And Adi showed that far from profiting from the forced weapons production, the firm lost 100,000 marks. Despite Adi's evidence, the committee did not acquit him. Instead, they reclassified him as Minderbelasteter (Lesser Offender), This source contains a copy of the verdict. a category of lesser culpability resulting in probation of two to three years with various conditions but still requiring that Adi not operate Dassler Shoes. Adi hired counsel to appeal the decision; Rudolf, who had just been released, saw this as his opportunity to wrest control of the business from Adi. In the course of the appeal proceedings Rudolf Dassler inserted statements that claimed that Adi Dassler had organized the production of weapons himself and for his own profit and that Rudolf would have resisted the change in production if he were present. He also claimed that his brother had falsely denounced him and that Adi had made political speeches to employees at the plant. Among other proofs submitted by Adi's counsel was a strong denial of all Rudolf's claims by K√§the. On 11 November 1946 the Spruchkammer H√∂chstadt sitting in Herzogenaurach changed Adi's status to Mitl√§ufer (follower), relieving him of most of his civil disabilities, but still required some supervision. On 3 February 1947, ownership was returned and he was formally granted permission to resume management of the firm. Rudolf's belief that Adi had denounced him and his conduct during his brother's appeal made further relations between them impossible. In fact, it irreparably divided the family. Mother Paulina sided with Rudolf and Friedl, who cared for her the rest of her life. Their sister Marie, who never forgave Rudolf for the death of her sons, sided with Adi and K√§the. Rudolf, his wife and two children left the family home and moved across the river, where he would take over the second factory of the Dassler firm. In their separation Adi retained the first factory and the family villa. As for the rest of the firm's assets, the two divided them one- by-one. Once the brothers divided their businesses they never spoke again. =Founding Adidas, 1946‚Äì1947= After the war, the Dassler firm found itself with some of the same problems that it faced at the beginning. A world war had decimated the German economy and supplies for the shoe factory were hard to come by. In addition, the firm had to convert back from weapons to shoe production. This time, however, the American occupying authorities were interested in reviving economic activity, so they gave the firm active encouragement. American officers had commandeered the Dassler house for their residence on 16 April 1945, and thus Adi had close contact with officials who gave him access to unneeded war material for production. Until a source of leather became available Adi made use of the rubber from fuel tanks and rafts and canvas from tents to make shoes. Adi was thus able to produce shoes, and save for the months in 1946 while under the classification of Belasteter he was able to manage the business (from July 1946 to February 1947 under the supervision of a trustee) until the separation from his brother in 1948. The Adidas registered logo with the three stripes During the negotiations to separate the firm, Rudolf and Adi allowed the employees to determine which resulting firm they would work for. Because Rudolf had mainly concerned himself with sales and administration, most of the sales staff opted to join Rudolf at the W√ºrtzburger Strasse factory. The rest, including almost all the technicians and those involved in product development and production, remained with Adi. Adi thus ended up with nearly two-thirds of the employees. To partially fill the void left by the departure of the administrative personnel K√§the and her sister Marianne Martz joined the firm and acted in a variety of capacities. Meanwhile, Adi was concerned in designing a distinctive look for his shoes, at least partially so that it would be possible to show which athletes used his footwear. He fell upon the idea of coloring the straps used for reinforcement on the sides of the shoes a different color than the shoes themselves. He experimented with different numbers of straps and ultimately decided on three. The \\"three stripes\\" became a distinctive mark of Adidas shoes. In March 1949 Dassler registered the three stripe logo as the company's trademark. As for the company's name, the plan was to use a contraction of Adi's nickname and last name (much as Rudolf originally contemplated by naming his firm \\"Ruda\\" before deciding on \\"Puma\\"), but \\"Addas\\" was rejected on the ground that it was used by a children's shoe manufacturer. Accordingly, in his August 18, 1949 company registration, Adi added a handwritten \\"i\\" between Ad- and -das to maintain the contraction (Adi Dassler). As a result, the company became known as Adolf Dassler adidas Schuhfabrik. =Adidas' breakthrough, 1948-1978= Like the Dasslers, Sepp Herberger joined the Nazi Party in 1933. In 1936 after Germany's humiliating quarter final defeat by Norway at the Berlin Games, the Nazi sports authorities appointed him to coach the national football team. Herberger began an association with the Dassler firm having been cultivated by Rudolf Dassler. After the breakup Herberger sided with the Puma firm, until Rudolf once again felt his authority challenged and insulted him. Herberger switched his allegiance to Adidas. The nature of the dispute is unknown; some thought it involved the payments owed if the German team wore Puma shoes. In many respects the fit was better with Adi, who was quiet, willing to learn the needs of football players and more innovative than his brother. Herberger's drive to make Germany a dominant force in international football predated the war. He learned of 18 year old Fritz Walter in 1938 and began grooming him for the team. When war came Herberger was able to keep Walter out of the army. After the war, Herberger was deemed a Mitlaufer and the post-war German authorities continued him as the coach of the national team. Adi soon became a regular part of the entourage of the national team, who sat beside Herberger and adjusted players' shoes mid-game. One of the six sculptures in the Walk of Ideas Berlin to celebrate the 2006 FIFA World Cup. This one celebrates \\"The Modern Football Boot\\" invented by Adolf Dassler. West Germany (established in May 1949) was not eligible for the 1950 World Cup (the first after the war), and so all preparations were made with a view toward the 1954 matches in Bern, Switzerland. By that time Adidas's football boots were considerably lighter than the ones made before the war, based on English designs. At the World Cup Adi had a secret weapon, which he revealed when West Germany made the finals against the overwhelmingly favored Hungarian team, which was undefeated since May 1950 and had defeated West Germany 8‚Äì3 in group play. Despite this defeat, West Germany made the knock-out rounds by twice defeating Turkey handily. The team defeated Yugoslavia and Austria to reach the final (a remarkable achievement), where the hope of many German fans was simply that the team \\"avoid another humiliating defeat\\" at the hands of the Hungarians. The day of the final began with light rain, which brightened the prospects of the West German team who called it \\"Fritz Walter-Wetter\\" because the team's best player excelled in muddy conditions. Dassler informed Herberger before the match of his latest innovation‚Äî\\"screw in studs.\\" Unlike the traditional boot which had fixed leather spike studs, Dassler's shoe allowed spikes of various lengths to be affixed depending on the state of the pitch. As the playing field at Wankdorf Stadium drastically deteriorated, Herberger famously announced, \\"Adi, screw them on.\\" The longer spikes improved the footing of West German players compared to the Hungarians whose mud-caked boots where also much heavier. The West Germans staged a come from behind upset, winning 3-2, in what became known as the \\"Miracle in Bern.\\" Herberger publicly praised Dassler as a key contributor to the win, and Adidas's fame rose both in West Germany, where the win was considered a key post-war event in restoring German self-esteem and abroad, where in the first televised World Cup final viewers were introduced to \\"the ultimate breakthrough.\\" =Personal life= Dassler was married to K√§the until his death from heart failure in 1978. They had 4 children. In 1973, their son Horst Dassler founded Arena, a producer of swimming equipment. K√§the Dassler died on December 31, 1984. Posthumous After Adolf Dassler's death his son Horst and his wife K√§the took over the management. Horst died on April 11, 1987. Adidas was transformed into a private limited company in 1989, but remained family property until its IPO in 1995. The last of the family members who worked for Adidas was Frank Dassler (the grandson of Rudolf), head of the legal department since 2004, who resigned in January 2018. In 2006, a sculpture of Dassler was unveiled in the Adi Dassler Stadium in Herzogenaurach. It was created by the artist Josef Tabachnyk.

Life Adamson was born at Perth where his father, Patrick Adamson, a burgess became Dean of Merchant Guildry.www.alternative- perth.co.uk Adamson read philosophy at the University of St Andrews where he graduated as MA, later receiving a doctorate. Residence in France After serving as Minister of Ceres, Fife for three years, in 1565, Adamson travelled to Paris as tutor to the eldest son of Sir James MacGill, the Lord Clerk Register (or Clericus Rotulorum of Scotland), serving there initially as a Knights Hospitaller chaplain.www.british-history.ac.uk In June 1566 Adamson wrote a Latin poem on the birth of Prince James for Mary, Queen of Scots and her King consort, Lord Darnley; by describing the young James as serenissimus princeps \\"of France and England\\" which, leaked by a rival to Charles IX of France's courtiers, caused offence resulting in six months' detention in France. He was released only through the intercession of Queen Mary and other senior Scots nobility, thereafter relocating with his pupil to read Law at the University of Bourges. At the time of the 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in Paris, Adamson had been living under cover at a tavern in Bourges for seven months, whose aged landlord was later reportedly thrown from the roof for offering charity to such a \\"heretic\\".

As Moderator in the following year, he together with his successor, David Lyndsay, presented the Church Assembly proceedings to Lord Morton, Regent of Scotland. In 1576, Adamson's consecration as Archbishop of St Andrews gave rise to a protracted conflict among the Presbyterian faction in the Assembly. Adamson had already published a catechism of Latin verse dedicated to James VI, which work was highly acclaimed even by his opponents, as well as a Latin translation of the Scots Confession of Faith. In 1578 Adamson submitted himself before the General Assembly, procuring a brief respite but the following year fresh accusations were brought against him. During these turbulent political times, he took refuge in St Andrews Castle, where a so-called \\"wise woman\\", Alison Pearson,http://iainthepict.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/alison-pearson-witch.html who was later burned for witchcraft, cured his apparent \\"serious illness\\". Excommunication In 1583 Adamson returned to public service by being posted as Scottish ambassador to the Court of St James's of Elizabeth I of England; whilst in London rumours were spread about his bad behaviour. On his return he implemented strong measures in parliament against Presbyterians, and consequently accusations of heresy followed with excommunication at a provincial synod held at St Andrews in April 1586; however at the next General Assembly this verdict was rescinded as being ultra vires. In 1587 and 1588, however, fresh accusations were brought against Adamson, and again he was excommunicated, though afterwards on the inducement of a former adversary, Sir Andrew Melville, his sentence was remitted. Meanwhile, Adamson had produced the Book of Lamentations, and the Book of Revelation in Latin verse which he dedicated to the king, but complained of his harsh treatment. King James was unmoved by Adamson's representations and transferred the episcopal revenues to his new favourite, Ludovic, 2nd Duke of Lennox. After falling from grace, Adamson spent the remaining three years of his life supported by charity. Legacy Cathedral of St Andrews, Fife Adamson possessed many gifts, being learned and eloquent, but also had grave defects of character; however the \\"Recantation of Episcopacy (1590)\\" attributed to him is probably spurious. His collected works, prefaced by a favourable panegyric, in the course of which it is said that \\"he was a miracle of nature, and rather seemed to be the immediate production of God Almighty than born of a woman\\", were published by his son-in-law, Thomas Wilson, in 1619. An heraldic memorial to Adamson survives at the ancient cathedral of St Andrews.www.historic-scotland.gov.uk By his wife Elizabeth n√©e Arthur, Adamson had two sons, James and Patrick, and a daughter, Mariota, who married Sir Michael Balfour.Orkney Balfours Home Page His elder brothers, James and Henry, both served as Provost of Perth, and they were fathers of Henry and John Adamson respectively.

Craig (August 26, 1877 ‚Äì July 16, 1966) was Canadian lawyer and politician who served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1927. He later served as a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken.  Early life and education  Craig was born in Underwood, Ontario, and was educated in Port Elgin and Winnipeg. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1897 and an LL.B. degree in 1904, both from the University of Manitoba. Craig was called to the Manitoba bar the following year.  Career  He worked as a barrister-at-law, and was appointed to the bench of the Law Society of Manitoba in 1916. From 1912 to 1916, he was Crown Prosecutor for the city of Winnipeg. In 1916, he was named King's Counsel. Craig also served as chair of the Winnipeg School Board, the Social Service Council of Canada, and the Winnipeg Canadian Club. Craig was initially Conservative, and endorsed the Manitoba Conservative Party in the 1915 election on the grounds that it was more supportive of higher education than was the Manitoba Liberal Party. He later left the Conservatives, and was elected to Manitoba's legislature in the 1922 provincial election as a candidate of the newly formed Progressive Association in Winnipeg. During this period, Winnipeg was a single constituency which elected ten members via a single transferable ballot. Despite finishing twelfth in the count of first preferences and being in the middle of the pack for much of the counting process, his voting totals stayed solid till the end when he was declared elected. Eight Progressive candidates ran in Winnipeg, but Craig was the only one elected. Winnipeg's Progressive MLA aligned with the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM), which swept the rural constituencies to emerge as the largest party in the legislature. The Progressive party was a force in federal politics at this time and the UFM took the name the Progressive, when it formed government.Morton, The Progressive Party in Canada, p.229 As the government's only Winnipeg representative, Craig was assured of a cabinet position. He was appointed as the province's Attorney General on August 8, 1922. Craig emerged as Premier John Bracken's most trusted confidante during the parliament that followed, and became known as the government's strongest voice in the legislature. Like the premier, Craig believed that Manitoba should be governed in a non- partisan, efficient and business-like manner. On January 12, 1925, he was given a secondary portfolio of Minister of Telephones and Telegraphs. Although a successful minister and a young man, Craig chose to retire from the legislature after only a single term. He resumed his practice as a lawyer, and provided legal services for Bracken's ministry in 1929.  Personal life  Craig was married to Marguerite Maud Hogg. He died in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of 88 in 1966.

Lying triceps extensions are one of the most stimulating exercises to the entire triceps muscle group in the upper arm. It works the triceps from the elbow all the way to the latissimus dorsi. Due to its full use of the Triceps muscle group, the lying triceps extensions are used by many as part of their training regimen. Triceps extensions are isolation exercises, meaning they use just one joint. While compound exercises are recommended for developing all the muscle groups involved in the functional movement, triceps extensions can be beneficial for fixing imbalances in the triceps or rehabilitating from injury. In bodybuilding, this exercise is used to target the triceps for growth. A study sponsored and done by the American Council on Exercise revealed that the extensions are around 70-90 percent effective compared to the triangle push up for the triceps. However, extensions put no pressure on the wrists so they are an alternative for people with wrist strain or injury. Execution Lying triceps extension with an EZ curl bar Instructions: #Lie on a flat bench with feet on the ground and head hanging just off the top of the bench, so that the edge of the bench rests in the pit between neck and head. #Take the barbell with an overhand grip (palms away from body) and hold it out above the head so that the arms are supporting the weight. Do not hold the arms straight over the face at 12 o'clock, but rather at an angle more like 10 o'clock, with feet at 3 o'clock. All of the weight should be on the triceps. #Now bend the arms at the elbow, bringing the bar down close to the top of the forehead. #Keep the elbows in the same position, do not let them sway outward. #Press back up to starting 10 o‚Äôclock position. Try to avoid moving your elbows too much; try to keep them the same width apart during the whole movement. Variations =Vertical French extension= In this variation, the exercise is performed while standing (or sitting on a device with a low backing‚Äîthat allows the shoulders full range of movement). With respect to gravity, the weight is still lifted in the same manner. With respect to the body, . As with all weight training movements, it is important to keep the weight under smooth control on both the way down and the way up. This exercise can be performed standing, sitting or lying on one's back. As with most weight training exercises, it is recommended to start off with a lighter weight and then to gradually increase the weight as the muscles get stronger. =Incline EZ-bar Lying Tricep Extensions= In this variation, the exercise is done lying on an incline bench with an EZ-bar which is said to hit the muscle group at a different angle stressing in a new way. Simply thinking about the position of the torso relative to the elevated arms will explain this. Being on a flat bench and raising the arms straight up as in the top of a bench press is a reference point. When inclining the torso from this position, the arms will make an obtuse angle with the lower body. This stretch is what hits the long head of the triceps hard, as the arm should be pointed as far toward your back as comfortably possible to receive the best stretch of the long head. = Triceps Extension Push-ups = A Triceps extension push-up can be performed as a bodyweight exercise only and is thus an ideal substitution when weight lifting equipment is not available. To perform a triceps extension push-up, a person begins on the ground in a plank position with their body supported by their feet and forearms. While maintaining strict form, the triceps are extended until the person is in the standard push-up position. The triceps are then relaxed returning the body to the plank position so another repetition can be performed.http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight- exercises/ =Other= Another variation is done with dumbbells, lying on the ground, touching the dumbbell to the forehead and then fully extending the arm.

The Dreaming first appeared in the Sandman vol. 2 #1 (January 1989), and was created by Neil Gaiman and Sam Kieth. The Dreaming is the domain of Dream of the Endless. Publication history The Dreaming was a monthly comic series that ran for 60 issues (June 1996 to May 2001) and has since been completely rebooted in 2018. Article in Entertainment Weekly. It is set in the same dimension of the DC universe as The Sandman and the stories occurred primarily within Dream's realm, The Dreaming, concentrating on characters who had played minor roles in The Sandman, including The Corinthian, Matthew the raven, Cain and Abel, Lucien the dream librarian, the faerie Nuala, Eve, and Mervyn Pumpkinhead (janitor of The Dreaming). It also introduced a number of new characters, most notably Echo and a new (white) dream raven, Tethys. There were brief (but often important) appearances by The Endless during the series, including cameos by Dream (both Morpheus and Daniel), Death, Destiny, and Desire. The series was initially conceived as an anthology series edited by Vertigo editor Alisa Kwitney, and as such it was written, drawn and inked by a variety of artists. The covers were all painted by former Sandman cover-artist Dave McKean, and Sandmans writer Neil Gaiman acted as creative consultant on the series - having a notional right of refusal on scripts and plotlines (which he never exercised) and suggesting developments or characters for exploration. However Gaiman was quick to undo events of The Dreaming comics with the publication of Endless Nights, just one year after The Dreaming ended. Endless Nights ultimately ignored events from The Dreaming, such as the death of Matthew the raven, and later the new Sandman Universe version of The Dreaming (2018) would quietly ignore all the events and new characters from the first iteration of The Dreaming. Vertigo Comics. article in Polygon. Kwitney contacted several writers inviting them to submit stories for the new anthology, amongst them Peter Hogan on the basis of his work for British comic 2000 AD. He suggested the story that eventually became \\"The Lost Boy\\" (Issues #4-#7). Following the completion of Al Davison's \\"The Dark Rose\\" story (issues #20 - #21), The Dreaming underwent a change of direction: it changed from an anthology series to an ongoing series concentrating on a small group of core characters. Kwitney decided that the series needed to develop its own internal continuity, with irregular The Sandman Presents mini-series being introduced to present stories told outside of that continuity. Gaiman explained the need for the change by saying: Initially, the writing duties on the revamped series were to be shared between Caitl√≠n R. Kiernan and Peter Hogan, who had recently impressed with their stories \\"Souvenirs\\" (Issues #17 - #19) and \\"Ice\\" (Issue #16) respectively. However, Hogan's increasing commitments with other work and the perceived pre-existing fanbase that Kiernan had brought with her to the title meant that she was offered the position as sole writer from the \\"Many Mansions\\" story (issues #27-#34), despite Kiernan herself admitting that there did not seem to be much crossover between the two readerships. Peter Hogan would be made a semi-regular writer for the series The Sandman Presents by way of compensation. The series suffered from its ties to the original Sandman series throughout its run, with Kiernan saying \\"from the start, The Dreaming has been saddled with living up to what Neil Gaiman did with The Sandman. It doesn't take long to get puking sick of hearing 'It's just not the same,' or 'It's not as good as The Sandman,' or 'Why is it so much darker than The Sandman,' or even 'It's almost as good as The Sandman.' I know the comparisons are inevitable, and even logical, but it's been an uphill battle trying to get readers to look at The Dreaming as a series separate from The Sandman, with its own tone and atmosphere and concerns.\\" Kiernan received strong criticism for the direction she took the series in, with commentators placing the blame solely on her. However, Kiernan found the experience genuinely satisfying - despite the stress and comics not being her first love - and the series continued for 60 issues before being cancelled to focus on the more successful The Sandman Presents and Lucifer series. Kiernan contributed a story to this new post-Dreaming era, the three issue The Sandman Presents: Bast featuring the cat goddess introduced in the Season of Mists storyline. The Dreaming comics have since undergone a complete reboot, written by Si Spurrier, starting in 2018 as part of the Sandman Universe reboot, celebrating the 30th anniversary of The Sandman. Article in Entertainment Weekly. Many of the events in Kiernan's The Dreaming run seem to have been either undone or retconned. The Domain The Dreaming is the world where people go to dream, and is a vague, shifting realm of symbol, belief, and imagination. It is named after another name for the Dreamtime, a central concept in Australian Aboriginal mythology. Inhabitants =Merv Pumpkinhead= Mervyn \\"Merv\\" Pumpkinhead is Dream's jaded, street-wise, cigarette-smoking janitor who first appeared in The Sandman #5 in May 1998. While his appearance can vary based on who is viewing him (for example, William Shakespeare saw a turnip-headed version of Merv in Sandman #75 (March 1996)), Merv is generally portrayed as having a pumpkin for a head. His appearance is based on Jack Pumpkinhead, a character in L. Frank Baum's Oz books. Mervyn's first appearance in The Sandman #5 (May 1989) had him driving a bus, helping to transport Morpheus on his quest. Pumpkinhead later claims this was his job during Morpheus' absence. Merv seems to be in charge of the construction and demolition of the Dreaming, though he often complains that his job is superfluous since Dream can change any of it at will. He takes up arms to fight the Furies in The Kindly Ones and is killed, but he was returned to life by the new Dream in The Wake. Mervyn also appeared in his own spin-off to The Sandman series called Merv Pumpkinhead: Agent of DREAM, published in 2000. In this publication, Merv goes on a James Bond-esque adventure in which he attempts to foil the schemes of a would-be world conqueror, and along the way meets beautiful women and evil villains. Locations The Dreaming is vast, and its landscape varies greatly from place to place. Some of the important locations of The Dreaming include: *The House of Mystery and the House of Secrets, Cain and Abel's homes. *The Gates of Horn and Ivory, two gates carved by Dream; \\"the dreams that pass through the gates of ivory are lies, figments and deceptions. The other admits the truth...\\" (Gaiman). This is a direct reference to Virgil's Aeneid, in which Aeneas passes through the \\"realm of sleep\\" and encounters two similar doors with similar functions. *The Castle, Dream's abode at the center of the Dreaming. The front gate is guarded by three mythical beasts, a gryphon, a wyvern, and a hippogriff (often mistakenly drawn as a winged horse). It includes Lucien's library, which contains every book that anyone ever dreamt of writing. The library allows its users to read any of its books whether or not the reader speaks the language it was written in or indeed can even read. When one of the dreamed of books is actually written in the real world, the copy in Lucien's library bursts into flames and is destroyed.

The Magdalena has been featured in The Darkness, Witchblade, Tomb Raider, and Vampirella, and in its own series of twelve issues from April 2010 to April 2011. Fictional character biography The Magdalena #1 The Magdalena is the title of a series of women descended from Jesus Christ via his marriage to Mary Magdalene. The Magdalena inherits great powers from the royal bloodline and acts as a warrior in the defence of the Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church has been the Magdalena's employer since the Middle Ages, raising her from childhood and training her until she is ready to carry out her role. The Inquisition, a secretive and powerful council of cardinals, oversees the Magdalena's activities and decides her missions. =Sister Rosalia= Sister Rosalia was a former Magdalena who died when she was 33 years old. She was raped as a teenager by a masked assailant. She became pregnant as a result of the assault and gave birth to a girl. The child was stolen from her and raised in an unidentified convent. In her last mission, she was sent to investigate vampirism in France. She was informed that vampirism is a retrovirus that forces vampires to consume blood to restore their hemoglobin. She decided that they were not evil and aided their escape. She was killed by the soldiers of the Inquisition, the Garduna, for trying to prevent them from slaughtering the vampires. It was hinted that Rosalia might have been infected with the virus and would rise three days after her death, mirroring the Resurrection of Jesus. =Sister Mariella= Mariella, the adult daughter of Rosalia, was sent to kill Jackie Estacado with the Spear of Destiny, but unbeknownst to her she still wasn't fully trained and wasn't able to differentiate between right and wrong. After the Sisters of the Order of Magdalene performed the ritual which gave Mariella the ability to divine a person's sins, she and her Sisters were overpowered and defeated by Jackie, who made an example of them by crucifying them in the church. After recovering from her crucifixion and the fight with Jackie, Mariella learned where the Spear of Destiny was and prepared to retrieve it. While doing so, she encountered the Angelus and Appolonia Francetti in the Amazon rainforest and was again left to die after Appolonia used a portion of the Darkness' power to subdue her. =Patience= The third and current Magdalena is known as Patience, created by writer Brian Holguin. Patience was in her novitiate but she left her convent suddenly, forcing the Inquisition to send an agent, Kristof, to track her down when her time came to assume the role of the Magdalena. Kristof found Patience living on the streets with a homeless girl named Rowan Barry. Kristof became Patience's mentor and gave her basic training. Patience was initially hesitant but later accepted her destiny when Rowan was abducted by agents of an evil force. The events lead to a disagreement with Kristof and the Inquisition, prompting her to declare herself independent of their control. She remains allied with them only when their goals do not conflict with her ethics. Patience appeared again when Sara Pezzini, an officer of the New York City Police Department and wielder of the Witchblade, was attacked by a bloodthirsty demon posing as a young woman. Patience helped her to drive away the demon. =Benedetta Maria Ferro= Benedetta was a Magdalena of Spanish descent who tried to stop Jackie Estacado's ancestor, Miguel Estacado, from obtaining a treasure meant for the Pope. During her battle with Estacado, she was fatally wounded before plunging the Spear of Destiny into the hull of Estacado's ship. Before her death, Miguel took the spear, intending to return it to the Holy See, and left her to die, a decision he later regretted. Powers and abilities Each Magdalena has the innate ability to see into the human heart and show people the error of their ways in order to give them the chance to redeem their sins. Additionally, each Magdalena wields the Spear of Destiny, the spear that pierced the side of Christ, as a weapon against demons and evil magic. Planned movie A movie was planned by Top Cow in 2008. In July 2009, it was announced that Ry√ªhei Kitamura would direct with Holly Brix writing. Jenna Dewan and Luke Goss were set to star. The project never came to fruition.

Service career He did his flight training in Canada at No.2 Initial Training School (ITS) in early 1941, and No.8 Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS) and No.10 Service Flying Training School (SFTS) to July 1941. As a Sergeant Pilot he was posted overseas to the UK in August 1941, flying Hawker Hurricane fighters at No.55 Operational Training Unit (OTU). In September 1941 he was posted to No. 263 Squadron RAF, flying the Westland Whirlwind, based in the West Country and flying convoy protection and ground attack sorties into France. He was promoted to Flight Sergeant in January 1942 and commissioned as a Flight Lieutenant in March 1942. In June 1942 he was posted to the newly formed No. 421 Squadron RCAF flying the Spitfire Mk.V. He then shipped out to Malta to join No. 249 Squadron RAF in October 1942, where he became an ace with seven confirmed victories. His first aerial victory came in February 1943 when he and another pilot downed a Junkers Ju 52 transport near Licata. He was awarded a quarter victory in shooting down a Junkers Ju 88 of KG 54 on 3 March 1943, a half victory on 22 March 1943 and a third on 16 April. In April he and American ace Squadron Leader J.J.

On June 22 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Although tour-expired in July 1943, Kennedy stayed on operations, this time with No. 111 Squadron RAF until September 1943. A spell with No. 93 Squadron RAF followed until December 1943. He then returned to the UK and began another tour on 15 June 1944 as Commanding Officer with No. 401 Squadron RAF. Kennedy downed two more German fighters for a total of 14 enemy aircraft destroyed, before he was shot down by flak on 26 July 1944. After parachuting into a field in occupied France, he initially hid in a hayloft and was cared for by a French family. With the aid of the French Maquis, Kennedy walked to Allied lines. He returned to Canada in September 1944, and was released from the RCAF on 13 February 1945. He became a doctor and studied medicine at the University of Toronto, graduating in 1950. He was based in Cumberland, Ontario. Kennedy died on 6 January 2011. Kennedy's brothers, Robert and Carleton, also served. Carleton died when his Halifax Mk III bomber crashed.

He represented Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district from April 22, 1947 to January 3, 1957, and Wisconsin's 9th congressional district from January 3, 1965 to December 31, 1974.Glenn Robert Davis, Wisconsin Historical Society Early life and education Davis was born on a small farm to a poor family in Vernon, Wisconsin. He excelled academically despite pressure from his father to forsake school for farming. He skipped several grades and was a teacher of the younger children in his one-room school house before he graduated three years early from Mukwonago High School in 1930 at 15. Davis attended the Platteville State Teachers College (now the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìPlatteville) with a donation from his mother (who had been hiding the money from her husband for just such an occasion). He majored in education and went on to teach high school at Cottage Grove and Waupun for five years. Davis then went back to school, earning a law degree from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1940. After passing the bar, Davis opened a law firm in Waukesha, Wisconsin. From this perch, he launched his first campaign for public office, with a successful bid for the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1940. He later lived in New Berlin, Wisconsin, and Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Military service After a year in the legislature, Davis resigned his seat to join the U.S. Navy, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Lieutenant Davis served as the Communications officer aboard the USS Sangamon (CVE-26), an escort carrier. The ship sustained a Kamikaze attack the latter days of the war off of Okinawa. Although a third of the crew were casualties, Davis was uninjured. Political career Davis resumed the practice of law after being honorably discharged from the Navy, on December 12, 1945. He also stepped up his involvement in politics, serving briefly as a local court commissioner and attending Republican Party functions. Davis was elected as a delegate to every Republican National Convention from 1952 to 1972. In 1947, Davis ran in the special election to succeed Robert Kirkland Henry, a Republican congressman who died just weeks after being elected to a second term. Davis served five terms in the House of Representatives representing Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district, before deciding to seek higher office in 1956. Instead of running for reelection, he launched an unsuccessful primary challenge to incumbent Sen. Alexander Wiley, R-Wisconsin. In 1957, Davis lobbied unsuccessfully to become the GOP candidate in the special election to replace the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wisconsin. The Republican nod instead went to former Gov. Walter J. Kohler, Jr., who went on to lose the seat to Democrat William Proxmire. Davis subsequently returned to his law practice. Eight years later, in 1964, Davis made a successful comeback bid by winning the open Ninth Congressional District created by reapportionment. He served another four terms before losing in the 1974 primary to a conservative up-and-comer, future U.S. Sen. Bob Kasten. Davis felt he was hurt by the then-unpopular pardon of Richard Nixon by then President Gerald Ford on the Sunday before the primary election. Davis had been closely associated with Ford. Davis's congressional service was marked by a generally conservative record that grew more moderate in the early 1970s. He achieved perhaps his greatest mark as a close friend and golf partner of then-House Minority Leader Gerald Ford. Davis was also the star shortstop for the \\"Washington Senators,\\" a recreational baseball team made up solely of congressmen. To this day, Davis remains the sole native of Waukesha County to have held Congressional office. Later years After his loss in the primary, Davis resigned on December 31, 1974‚Äîjust days before his term would have otherwise ended. He moved permanently to Arlington, Virginia. Davis worked as a consultant for Potter International, Inc. from 1975 to 1983. He died in Arlington on September 21, 1988. Part of Davis's legacy is the Glenn R. Davis Charitable Foundation, a scholarship organization funded and administered by his family. The Glenn Davis Charitable Foundation gives a monetary award to one graduating student in each Waukesha County high school every year. The award is granted to a student who has done something to overcome substantial obstacles, reflecting Davis's own rise from a family of pickle farmers to U.S. congressman. Family Glenn Davis' son J.

Often described as socially responsible investing (SRI), this practice is more accurately in the case of Ave Maria Mutual Funds called morally responsible investing (MRI) or faith-based investing. History The first of its funds was established in 2001. As of June 30, 2020, the Ave Maria Mutual Funds had over $2.3 billion in assets under management. Most of that money is invested in the Ave Maria Rising Dividend Fund (Ticker: AVEDX), the firm's flagship fund, Ave Maria Growth Fund (AVEGX) and Ave Maria Value Fund (AVEMX). Other funds include Ave Maria Bond Fund (AVEFX), Ave Maria World Equity Fund (AVEWX) and Ave Maria Focused Fund (AVEAX). The six Ave Maria Mutual Funds are managed by Plymouth, Michigan based Schwartz Investment Counsel, Inc. The firm was established in 1980 by George P. Schwartz, CFA. There is also an Ave Maria Money Market Account, which is really a money market fund managed by Pittsburgh, PA based Federated Investors. The Catholic Equity Fund merged into Ave Maria Rising Dividend Fund on March 30, 2007. Schwartz also began offering an Ave Maria Separately Managed Account (Ave Maria SMA) product in late 2009. Investments According to the fund family prospectus and website, the company screens its investments first on financial criteria, then eliminates companies involved in the practice of abortion or whose policies are morally (though not necessarily ethically) anti-family. What constitutes anti-family practices is based on moral judgments made by the company's Catholic Advisory Board and the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Examples cited by the fund family include companies distributing pornography, and companies with policies that they view undermine the sacrament of marriage. Involvement with contraception and infanticide (aka abortion) also disqualify a company from the fund, as does embryonic stem cell research. Unlike other ethical funds, however, it does not reject defense companies, alcohol, or tobacco (other common SRI-screened areas).\\"A Catholic View of Investing\\", New York Times, December 18, 2008 Catholic Advisory Board In defining its process for screening investments based on religious principles, the board members are \\"guided by the magisterium of the Catholic Church and actively seek the advice and counsel of Catholic clergy\\".

Life and career Colonne was born in Bordeaux, the son and grandson of musicians of Italian-Jewish descent. From the age of eight, he played flageolet and accordion, and then began violin studies with Baudoin.Cinquante Ans de Musique Fran√ßaise de 1874 √† 1925. Les √âditions Musicales de la Librairie de France, Paris, 1925. Starting in 1855, Colonne studied at the Conservatoire in Paris, where he won first prizes in both harmony and violin. For almost a decade (1858‚Äì67) he was first violinist at the Op√©ra in Paris, as well as playing second violin in the Lamoureux Quartet. In 1871 he directed concerts at the Grand-H√¥tel and Massenet's music for the staging of Les √ârinnyes in 1873. Also in 1873, Colonne, along with the music publisher Georges Hartmann, founded the \\"Concert National\\" at the Od√©on Th√©atre. Two years later, the venue moved to the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet and the name of the enterprise was changed to 'L'Association Artistique du Ch√¢telet'. The Association's performances eventually became known as the Concerts Colonne; and this name continued to be used until the 1960s.Except for the years of Paris's German occupation in World War II, when (because of Colonne's Jewish ancestry) the events were referred to as 'Piern√© Concerts' instead. In 1878 Colonne had met Tchaikovsky during the Russian composer's visit to Paris, and, as well as giving the local premiere of his 4th Symphony, remained in contact,Brown D. Tchaikovsky, Vols III & IV. Gollancz, London, 1992, passim.Letters from the composer to Colonne survive: http://en.tchaikovsky- research.net/pages/%C3%89douard_Colonne which led to 'exchange' concert trips for Colonne in Russia. Colonne was noted for his interest in Berlioz (then, on the whole, more highly regarded in the English- and German-speaking countries than in France). David Cairns noted in relation to the performance tradition following the death of Berlioz that the \\"advent of Edouard Colonne was therefore crucial... Berlioz was accepted ‚Äì as the composer of a single work, at most of two: Faust and the Fantastic Symphony. But the oeuvre was now in good hands\\". He comments that when the 15-year-old Pierre Monteux joined Colonne's orchestra in 1890 and \\"learned the music from the inside\\" this tradition continued.Cairns, David. Berlioz ‚Äì Volume 2: Servitude and Greatness, 1832‚Äì1869. London, Allen Lane, 1999, p777-778. Monteux (first violist and then assistant conductor of the Colonne orchestra) used Colonne's annotated score for his 1931 recording of Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique. In addition, Colonne stood out for his support of the music of Wagner, Mahler and Saint-Sa√´ns. He introduced the descriptive note into programme booklets. Another of his significant contributions was in the technological sphere: he was the first conductor of note to make commercial phonograph records, all for the French Path√© company. His earliest recordings were issued on wax phonograph cylinders,Path√© catalogue, October 1901, p. 32: \\"Orchestre Symphonique. ‚Äî Cylindres enregistr√©s par l'Orchestre Colonne, sous la direction m√™me de Ed. COLONNE.\\" none of which is known to survive, but a later group of recordings, made circa 1906 and issued on Path√© discs, has been remastered and reissued on CD. The works range from Beethoven to Widor, and announcements by Colonne are included.Foreman L. √âdouard Colonne - review of Tahra and Symposium CDs. Classic Record Collector, Autumn 2006, p80-81.

Originally a five- issue mini-series, the character went on to star in numerous crossover titles with the likes of the Punisher, Vampirella, and Hellboy. After Event comics, the character was exclusively written by Jimmy Palmiotti and drawn by various artists as it jumped from publisher to publisher. The series relaunched at Dynamite Entertainment with the first mini-series selling out. After that Icon- an independent label for creator owned work at Marvel comics, published two mini-series. The character then came back to PaperFilms, a company owned by Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner where it is currently published. Painkiller Jane has been published all over the world in at least 8 languages to date. The comics have been the basis for a film and television series and is currently in development with Jessica Chastain. Fictional character history Jane Vasko begins as an undercover police officer attempting to infiltrate the Fonti Mob. After gaining the trust of mob boss Joey Fonti, she is given the assignment of passing a message on to rival gang member Adam, not realizing that an explosive device has been planted on her. As she meets her target, the explosion causes significant injuries, but Adam is uninjured. Through mysterious means, he manages to revive Jane, giving her superhuman regenerative powers in the process. Leaving her life as a police officer behind, she becomes the vigilante Painkiller Jane. The validity of this origin is unclear, as a completely different origin has been presented in the first Painkiller Jane miniseries, and the Dynamite Comics' miniseries contain references to both versions of the characters' origin. Powers and abilities Jane Vasko is virtually indestructible. With Jane's exceptional regenerative abilities, minor injuries heal in seconds, and do not even slow her down; more major ones tend to take a few minutes. She has recovered from multiple gunshot wounds, explosions, chemical weapons assault, axes buried in her spine, even a shotgun blast to the face (which simply knocked her off her feet for a bit). However, the healing power does not stop the injuries from hurting, which is where her new name came from. On the offensive side, she has no real powers except for being a tough woman to kill. Other than that, she is a skilled fighter and master of undefined martial arts, as well as a master marksman with her weapons of choice, a pair of handguns.

Running roughly north-west to south-east, it is the valley of the Arkle Beck, and is the northernmost of the Yorkshire Dales. It is a subsidiary dale to Swaledale, which it joins at Reeth. On its way up the dale from Reeth the unclassified road crosses many other small streams and their catchments, such as Great Punchard Gill, Roe Beck, Annaside Beck, and William Gill. It passes through several small settlements: Raw, Arkle Town, Langthwaite (where a narrow back road leads to Booze), Eskeleth and Whaw. At Eskeleth Bridge another unclassified road forks north-east (towards Barnard Castle); this also joins a minor road running along the northern side of the dale to Whaw. Beyond Whaw is the most sparsely populated upper part of Arkengarthdale, which here runs roughly west‚Äìeast. This area is one of the most northerly parts of the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Eventually the dale ends and the road reaches the Tan Hill Inn, the highest in England, just outside the Park, near the Pennine watershed. Beyond Tan Hill, the road divides again, heading westward to Brough, south to Keld and south-west to Kirkby Stephen. The moors on both sides of Arkengarthdale are used for the annual Scott Trial, a cross-country motorcycle endurance event. The Dale cuts through the eastern half of a major lead mining field and lead was extracted from the area for over a thousand years.Raistrick, Arthur (1955) Mines and Miners of Swaledale. Atkinson & Pollitt, Kendal. Pages 15-18. Most of the mining structures have now disappeared leaving only the spoil heaps and the line of an long chimney from the site of the smelting mill. The current economy of the Dale depends on hill farming, grouse shooting and tourism. Population and land ownership In the 19th century a lead ingot with the name Hadrian stamped on it was found, at Hurst, east of the dale. This find, which has been lost at the British Museum, as well as records of the Romans at Richmond using Brigantian slaves digging for lead, has led to the assumption that the Romans were mining lead in Arkengarthdale in the 2nd century.Batty, Margaret (1982) A View of Arkengarthdale.: no evidence. The large proportion of Viking names, Fagger Gill, Kitley Hill, Langthwaite and Whaw, indicates Viking settlement during the 10th century, probably arriving from the west. Arkil is a Viking name which leads to speculation that he was a local leader.Batty. p.4. Following the Norman conquest in the 11th century a large part of North Yorkshire was given to Count Alan, a member of William's family. He kept Arkengarthdale and neighbouring New Forest as a hunting \\"forest\\" which was policed by forest rangers. In the 14th century there were eight gamekeepers employed preventing game being hunted in the dale.Batty. p.4. Towards the end of the 13th century there were 30 cottages in the Parish, but there followed a period lasting over a century of depression and de-population, with plague and war with France.Batty. p.5. By the end of the 16th century the Earls of Richmond had died out and Arkengarthdale and New Forest reverted to the Crown. Attempts by Crown agents to change the leases of the 55 tenants of small-holdings in the area led to protracted disputes. In 1628 the Crown, in an attempt to clear its debts, sold Arkengarthdale as well as other estates to the City of London. In 1656 the valley was bought by Charles Bathurst, who was Oliver Cromwell's doctor.Batty. p.8. The estate remained in the Bathurst family for four generations, John, Theodore & Charles, until in 1740 it was inherited by Charles' three great-granddaughters. At that time married women were not allowed to own property so the estate belonged to their husbands.Batty. p.7. In 1770 the turnpike road from Reeth to Brough via Tan Hill was opened.Batty. p.8. This greatly reduced the cost of transporting lead and coal from the mines since carts could be used instead of pack-horse trains.Northern Mine Research Society Memoirs 2011 Editor Richard Smith ISSN 0308-2199 p.21 Ian M. Spensley Mines, Quarries, Building and Fuel in Wensleydale and Swaledale Between 1808 and 1811 a London banker, George Brown of Stockton, bought all three parts of the estate. Before his death in 1814 Brown had rebuilt the school and laid plans for a new church. The estate was inherited by his sister and his second sister's husband Rev John Gilpin, vicar of Stockton.Batty. p.9. The early 19th century was a time of growth in the dale. In 1801 there was a population of 1186. In 1811 it had risen to 1529. In 1798 there were 34 miners and 1 farmer; in 1820 there were 9 farmers, 5 innkeepers, 4 mining agents, 2 flour dealers, a curate, a schoolmaster, a clogger, a shoemaker and a shopkeeper. In 1831 there were 285 males over 25 years old working as miners.Batty. p.4,9,10. But with the decline of the price of lead from ¬£33 a ton in 1801 to ¬£13 10s in 1831 a depression followed during which people left the dale in search of work; some to the factories in Derbyshire and Lancashire, others to the mines in County Durham, a significant number also emigrated to America.Raistrick. p. 26.Batty. p.9. The average age of death of miners between 1835 and 1841 was 54 years 5 months. Typhus was common in the dale.Batty. p.12. =1851 census= > The 1851 census records 1283 people in the dale; for 1073 of them it was > their place of birth. There was a male population of 659; 254 of whom were > lead miners and a further 42 were involved in smelting, construction and > transport. 18 women and children washed the ore.

Following the 1883 closure of CB Mining the most of the miners moved on in search of work. By 1891 the population of the dale was 761. 37 men from Arkengarthdale served in the First World War, three of whom were killed. 1921 was the first year in which anyone in the dale owned a car, it was a Ford.Batty. p.20. Owner: Laurie Peacock. The estate remained in the Brown- Gilpin family until being sold to Tommy Sopwith after the First World War. The shooting estate is currently shared between the Duke of Norfolk and a Dutch shooting syndicate. Lead mining Lead is found in veins running through the extensive limestone and chert beds which extend from Swaledale. One of the earliest techniques for extracting the ore is called \\"hushing\\". It involved the controlled release of dammed water along the line of a lead bearing vein to wash away the top soil allowing the vein to be worked. The Roman historian Pliny records this method being used in Britain to extract lead. Some fine examples of hushes can be found in Arkengarthdale as well as traces of dams and other water works. The other early method used was the digging of bell pits with lateral tunnels, called drifts, following the vein. The drifts would be extended until they became unsafe and another pit would be dug further along. Lines of these pits can still be seen across the moors.Hardy, John (No date, post 1982) The Hidden Side of Swaledale. The Life and Death of a Yorkshire Lead Mining Community. Frank Peters, Kendal. . Page 15. Apart from a locally found Roman lead \\"pig\\" stamped with the name Hadrian the earliest record of lead being taken from the dale dates from 1285. It states that the Lord's mine made a profit of ¬£4, possibly referring to Faggergill.Batty. pp 7Raistrick. p. 21. By 1521 there was extensive mining in Arkengarthdale, at Moulds, Punchard Gill and Faggergill. Bell pits were common in the 17th and 18th century. The lead was sold to lead merchants based in York. Gunpowder was introduced about 1700, and had become common by 1750. This led to the digging of deep-level tunnels into the hillsides. By the end of the 19th century it was possible to enter the Moulds Level in Arkengarthdale and travel six miles underground to the Sir Frances Mine in Gunnerside Gill, Swaledale.Hardy. Page 17. The hexagonal powderhouse was built in 1725. In 1750 the Moulds Level, north-west of Langthwaite, was worked out. It was later used as a route for transporting ore from the Old Gang Levels in the next valley to the west. It had its own smelting mill but this was knocked down after the building of the Octagonal Mill. The lead-mining in Arkengarthdale was dominated by the CB (Charles Bathhurst) Company which was founded in 1656 when a Dr. Bathhurst purchased from the Crown the right to mine in the area. His Company continued until 1911 when the lead-mining industry in Yorkshire collapsed due to the slump in the price of lead.Raistrick, Arthur (1972) Leadmining in the Yorkshire Dales, Dalesman Publishing. Page 16. Water was always a problem in the mines. During the eighteenth century a group of miners working underground near Boldershaw blasted into an underground lake. Twenty-four miners and two pit ponies were drowned in the flood that followed.Hardy p. 42 In 1820 miners in Little Punchard Gill created a canal level along which ore and spoil could be floated to the surface.Raistrick. Page 23. The existence of this water level is disputed by modern researchers.Bob Carlyle, public meeting, Reeth Archeological Society, 17 October 2012. =The Octagonal and the New Mills= Site of Octagonal Mill with the Hungry Hushes in the background. In 1800 the mines of Arkengarthdale were let for 21 years to a Newcastle company for a fixed rent rather than a percentage of the lead mined. The company, under its manager Frederick Hall, invested heavily in new technology.Batty. pp. 8,9 In 1804 they built a new smelting mill, 2 miles north of Langthwaite. It was octagonal in design, 170 ft by 70 ft, with a 36 ft diameter water wheel to drive the bellows. It had four flues and a timber roof.Batty. p. 8 ??? or 1700 ??? In 1824 the octagonal mill was replaced by the New Mill a few hundred yards away on the other side of the Tan Hill road. The New Mill was built by Easterby Hall & Co. for Ark & Darwent Mining Company. It had improved fire chamber design and a 33 ft water wheel, but used the existing chimney which ran half a mile up to the top of the moor. This kind of flue was large enough to allow men to climb up the inside and scrape off the condensed lead. It also vented the toxic residues away from livestock and vegetation. The Octagonal Mill continued life as a saw mill until in 1941 one of the roof timbers gave way and the roof was taken down. Today only the clearing on which it stood can be made out. Some parts of walls from the New Mill can be seen from the Tan Hill road. It closed in 1883, the last lease-holder being Whitewell & Company. The route of the collapsed double flue up the moor is easy to follow. The powder house is still standing. For a time it was used for candle making. The octagon was believed to have special properties for containing explosions. In 1870 there was a strike at the Faggergill Mine over the new management's insistence that the morning shift should start at a fixed time. After an eight-week stoppage the miners were forced to accept the changes.Batty. p.16 The last lead-mining enterprise in the Dale was Stang and Cleasby Mines, formed in 1908. They dug the Nuthole Mine, connecting to the Faggergill Levels and managed to remain profitable until 1914.Hardy. Page 75. Raistrick. Page 27. They created a mile-long horse level cutting through the multiple existing levels. The total length of the Faggergill levels is calculated to be around fifteen miles. The mine was sold on in 1912 and continued to make a small profit until the First World War. Other minerals were extracted from the Dale but on a smaller scale. Coal was mined in Punchard Gill until the 1940s. Chert was taken from the Hungry Hushes and along Fremington Edge, also ceasing after 1940. Notable people Anthony Peacock was executed in Richmond for his part in the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536.Batty, Margaret (1982) A View of Akengarthdale. Teesdale Mercury Press. p. 5. In 1736 Christopher Hind was transported to the \\"King's plantations for seven years\\" possibly for poaching.Batty. p. 7.

It was sculpted around 1490, when Michelangelo was about fifteen. This and the Battle of the Centaurs were Michelangelo's first two sculptures. The first reference to the Madonna of the Stairs as a work by Michelangelo was in the 1568 edition of Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.Madonna of the stairs in Casa Buonarroti The sculpture is exhibited at the Casa Buonarroti in Florence, Italy. Description The work is an obvious homage to stiacciato of Donatello, as Vasari also noted, both in technique and sizes plans with millimeter thickness variations, both in iconography, starting from the scale pattern with pronounced steps and handrails foreshortened, visible for example in the Feast of Herod in Lille, smashing spatially opening a path of dramatic vanishing. The figure of the Madonna, sitting on a square stone, and in profile while looking away, occupies the entire height of the relief, from edge to edge, with a severity and monumentality reminiscent of the classic rods. Very original is the composition of the sacred group, at the same time blocked and dynamic, with the Virgin and upright and keep him away gaze, in a prophetic attitude, as she lifts her dress to feed or protect the child asleep, and generates a movement spiral thanks to the arrangement in opposite limb: Jesus has indeed let go of his arm behind his back and Maria comes to weave his feet, showing the right plant and breaking the stillness of the smooth surface of the bas-relief. The right hand of the Child turned out was later used more than once by the artist to symbolize the abandonment of the body in sleep or in death, as in the portrait of Lorenzo de 'Medici, Duke of Urbino or the Bandini Piet√† and refers to ' Farnese Hercules (since by Michelangelo man is seen as Hercules). Pronounced is the muscle of the Child and the taking of Mary, especially with large hands, thanks to the different treatment of the surfaces, make it appear vigorous simple, everyday gesture. Virtuoso is finally the fall of the drapery, especially on Cubic's seat, which follows form with great realism. On the left, on the steps that give the name to the work, there are two putti just blanks in attitude dance or fight and another who, leaning on the handrail, tents, along with a fourth figure placed behind the Virgin, a drape. It is difficult to determine the significance of this background scene, perhaps a simple exercise in style or a tribute to dancing putti Donatello.

Founded in 1982, Native Earth is Canada's oldest professional Indigenous theatre company. Native Earth is dedicated to developing, producing and presenting professional artistic expressions of the Indigenous experience in Canada. Through stage productions (theatre, dance and multi-disciplinary art), new script development, apprenticeships and internships, Native Earth seeks to fulfill a community of artistic visions. It is a vision that is inclusive and reflective of the artistic directions of members of the Indigenous community who actively participate in the arts. Native Earth Performing Arts helms Aki Studio, a 120-seat black box creation/rehearsal/performance space in Regent Park's Daniels Spectrum. Background Founded in 1982, it is the oldest professional Indigenous performing arts company in Canada. They have been central in the development of a community of Indigenous artists, and have contributed to the creation of several plays which have become canonical in Canadian drama, such as Tomson Highway's award-winning The Rez Sisters and Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing, Daniel David Moses's Almighty Voice and His Wife, Drew Hayden Taylor's Someday, and Cliff Cardinal's Huff. Native Earth hosts the annual Weesageechak Begins to Dance festival which is a showcase for emerging Indigenous theatre, dance, and multi-discipline artists. In 1986 Native Earth was able to secure government funding, which brought stability to the organization. This funding allowed Native Earth the possibility to program a season and open its own office with full-time staff. In the same year Native Earth presented its first scripted work, Tomson Highway's The Rez Sisters which became a hit and attracted large audiences across Canada. The Play was so successful that it was also invited to the Edinburgh Festival and received the Dora Mavor Moore Award and the Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award. In 1989 Native Earth created Weesageechak Begins to Dance an annual play festival which developed plays that often turned into full production the following year. One of the plays which was developed through this process was John McLeod's Diary of a Crazy Boy. In 2012, the organization was described as \\"a formidable artistic hub for all things related to contemporary Indigenous performing arts.\\" In 2012, Native Earth moved their administrative headquarters to the Daniels Spectrum, an arts and cultural centre located in Toronto's revitalized Regent Park (part of the Regent Park Revitalization Plan). They also launched Aki Studio ‚Äì a 120-seat creation and performance black box space located on the main floor of the Daniels Spectrum. The inaugural play staged in the new space was Dominion, a five-person play written by Canadian author Andr√©a Ledding. Aki Studio has hosted a variety of theater companies, primarily independent, Indigenous, or multicultural theatre companies; these include fu-Gen, Cahoots, Obsidian, Acting Up Stage (now The Musical Stage), Paper Canoe, and the Agokwe Collective.

Early life Townshend was the son of John Villiers Stuart Townshend, 5th Marquess Townshend, and Lady Anne Elizabeth Clementina Duff. His paternal grandfather was John Townshend, 4th Marquess Townshend and his maternal grandfather was James Duff, 5th Earl Fife. His father was a Member of Parliament for Tamworth before his elevation to the House of Lords in 1863. Career and peerage Upon the death of his father in 1899, he succeeded as the 11th Baronet Townshend of Rainham, the 9th Baron Townshend of Lynn Regis, the 6th Marquess Townshend of Raynham, and the 9th Viscount Townshend of Raynham. Lord Townshend served as the Deputy Lieutenant of Norfolk. Personal life Gwladys, Marchioness of Townshend, from a 1908 publication. Heavily in debt, Townshend was forced to sell many of the family's valuables, including nearly 200 masterpieces, including works by Thomas Gainsborough, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony van Dyck. He leased the family estate Raynham Hall, before traveling to America to find a rich wife. Lord Townshend became engaged to a Mrs. Evelyn Sheffield of Jacksonville, Florida, but broke off the engagement \\"when he discovered she was not as rich as she had implied.\\" After he returned to England, he was introduced to Thomas Sutherst, a barrister who agreed to pay off his debts if he married his daughter. Lord Townshend isagreed and on 9 August 1905, he married Gwladys Ethel Gwendolen Eugenie Sutherst. Shortly after the wedding, his new father-in-law attempted to have Lord Townshend declared insane, however, \\"a court found him incapable of managing his own financial affairs, but sane enough to remain at liberty, under the care of his wife.\\" Despite her father's manipulations, reportedly the Marchioness was genuinely devoted to Townshend and worked diligently to restore the family fortunes so her children could be raised at Raynham Hall, although some of the family's land holdings elsewhere were sold. Before his death in 1921, they were the parents of: * George John Patrick Dominic Townshend, 7th Marquess Townshend (1916-2010), who married three times and served as chairman of Anglia Television from 1958 to 1986. * Lady Elizabeth Mary Gladys Townshend (1917-1950), who married Sir Eric White, 2nd Baronet.

It consists of two parts: the first is about the last months in the life of John Keats and his encounters with the Roman (dialectal) poet Giuseppe Gioacchino Belli. The second presents English translation of a sequence of blasphemous sonnets by Belli. The title refers to the enclosed rhyme scheme, commonly used by both Keats and Belli; it can also refer to Christ's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, prior to his agony (\\"Abba\\" means \\"father\\"). It is the epitaph on Burgess's marble memorial stone, behind which the vessel with his remains is kept, in Monte Carlo. 'AB' are also Anthony Burgess' initials. Synopsis In Part One, Keats has various adventures, meeting Belli in the Sistine Chapel and Pauline Bonaparte, sister of Napoleon, in the Pincio, and a Roman man of letters named Giovanni Gulielmi. Part Two consists of about seventy (from a total of 2,279) amusingly blasphemous sonnets by Belli, purportedly translated by one Joseph Joachim Wilson, a descendant of Gulielmi. An elaborate passage describes how the Italian Gulielmis were transformed into English Wilsons \\"during a wave of anti-Italian feeling occasioned by alleged ice-cream poisoning in the 1890s in the Lancashire coastal resorts of Blackpool, Cleveleys, Bispham and Fleetwood\\". Authorship Belli was a real person but Giovanni Gulielmi and his descendant Joseph Joachim Wilson are fictional. Wilson's name is a thinly veiled allusion to Burgess's real name, John Anthony Burgess Wilson, but the Belli translations are in fact by Burgess's Italian wife, Liana Burgess.

It was formed in 1968 and is a part of Niger State and Kebbi State. Kainji Lake National Park (KNLP), situated around the lake, is Nigeria's oldest National Park, established in 1976. Kanji Dam The Kainji Dam is situated in Northern Niger State and generates power for most towns in Nigeria. It was built from 1964 to 1968 and cost about 209 million dollars, a quarter of which was used to relocate the original population. Together with a smaller dam for a minor stream, it is long and high in the middle. It has a capacity of 12 turbines producing a total of 960 MW, but only 8 were installed, producing 760 MW. Part of the production is sold to the neighbouring country of Niger. National Park Kob antelope in the National Park Kainji Lake National Park (KNLP) (headquarters Wawa) is situated north of Lagos, close to the border with the Republic of Benin. It comprises two sectors, Borgu Game Reserve and Zugurma Game Reserve, which are separated by Kainji Lake. The abundant wildlife in the game preserves include baboons, duikers, hippopotami, hyenas, kobs, roan antelopes, and warthogs. Only the Borgu (western) sector is currently used for tourism; the Zugurma (eastern) sector lacks infrastructure, including access roads. The topography of the park is gently undulating with a general decrease in elevation from west to east. The Borgu sector is drained mainly by the Oli, Timo and Doro rivers and their tributaries, while the Zugurma sector is drained by the Maingyara and Nuwa Tizururu rivers. The vegetation of the park is typical of the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, although in some areas it appears more Sahelian. Riparian forests occur on the banks of the larger watercourses. Conservation issues Although the area around the park has a relatively low population density, numerous human activities adversely affect the park. These include deforestation, uncontrolled burning and illegal grazing and are particularly prevalent in the Zugurma sector. Wild mammals occur at relatively low densities due to illegal hunting. Lake Kainji has suffered a dramatic decline as a fishery due to the high numbers of artisanal and subsistence fisherfolk using the lake. It has been suggested that a period of closure, together with controlled fishing rights may help improve fish stocks.

It was listed as entry number 34 in A Catalogue of Circumpolar Stars, published posthumously in 1838 by British astronomer Stephen Groombridge. Based upon parallax measurements taken by the Gaia spacecraft, the system is located about 11.6 light-years from the Sun. This positions the pair among the nearest stars to the Solar System. Both components are small, dim red dwarf stars that are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. They orbit around their common barycenter in a nearly circular orbit with a separation of about 147 AU and a period of around 2,600 years. Both stars exhibit random variation in luminosity due to flares and they have been given variable star designations: the brighter member Groombridge 34 A is designated GX And, while the smaller component is designated GQ And. The star system has a relatively high proper motion of 2.9 arc seconds per year, and is moving away from the Solar System at a velocity of 11.6 km/s. It achieved perihelion some 15,000 years ago when it came within of the Sun. GX Andromedae The most massive and luminous component of the pair has the variable star designation GX Andromedae. It is a main sequence red dwarf star of spectral type M1.4 that varies his brightness due to stellar flares. Gaia observations suggest a rotation period of 44 days and a magnetic activity cycle of roughly 9 years. GQ Andromedae The smaller companion bears the variable star name GQ Andromedae. It's a red dwarf main sequence star that undergoes flare events like the primary; it has a spectral type M4.1, so it has also a lower effective temperature. Planetary system In August 2014, a planet orbiting around Groombridge 34 A was reported. The planet's existence was deduced from analysis of the radial velocities of the parent Star by the Eta-Earth Survey using HIRES at Keck Observatory. At the time of its discovery, it was the sixth-nearest known exoplanet. Using the CARMENES spectrograph combined with the measurements of the HARPS and HIRES spectrographs, researchers failed to detect the purported Groombridge 34 Ab. However, they did propose another that another planet (Groombridge 34 Ac, GJ 15 Ac) could be orbiting the parent star. This discrepancy was later reconciled with new HIRES observations, covering a longer span of time, where both planets were recovered, constraining their minimum mass to 3.03 for Groombridge 34 Ab and 36 for Groombridge Ac. Their orbital periods are 11.4 and approximately 7,600 days, respectively. To date, this is the fifth-closest multi-planet system to our Sun, hosting the longest period Neptune-mass exoplanet discovered so far.

Established in 1978, it covers an area of about . The park includes three distinct sectors: a part of the Kainji Lake in which fishing is restricted, the Borgu Game Reserve to the west of the lake, and the Zugurma Game Reserve to the southeast. History Kainji National Park was established in 1978 and is divided into three distinct sectors, the Zugurma Game Reserve, the Borgu Game Reserve and Kainji Lake. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with Yankari National Park. The park is owned by the state and managed by the Federal National Park Service (FNPS), receiving direct government funding. This means that enforcement actions against poachers can be pursued under national park law and not in the local courts. Geography The Borgu Game Reserve is mostly made up of savanna forest and has an area of , while the Zugurma Game Reserve is smaller, at . The two main parts of the park are separated by the Kainji Lake, a long reservoir. The Zugurma sector has no access roads and only the Borgu sector is used for tourism. The southern and western parts of the Borgu Game Reserve drain into the Oli River, a tributary of the Niger River, while the other parts drain directly into the lake via four small rivers. The Zugurma Game Reserve has little drainage; the smaller watercourses dry up during the dry season, but there are a number of permanent waterholes along the Oli River and elsewhere in the park. The Borgu sector consists of undulating hills with some quartzite ridges and ironstone pans, while the Zugurma sector consists of a low plateau, with soils derived from sandstone, much eroded in places. The mean annual rainfall is about , with the wet season lasting from May to November and the dry season from December to April. Flora The savanna woodland of the Borgu sector is dominated by Burkea africana, Terminalia avicennioides and Detarium microcarpum. Below the quartzite ridges Isoberlinia tomentosa predominates, and further down the hillsides on the relatively dry lower slopes are stands of Diospyros mespiliformis, with an understory of Polysphaeria orbuscula. Terminalia macroptera occurs on moist savannas and Isoberlinia doka is found on higher ground in ironstone areas. In the Zugurma sector the tree cover is typical of the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic although this area is overgrazed and eroded, and the main woodland is besides the watercourses and waterholes. Common trees here include Afzelia africana, Daniella oliveri, Pterocarpus erinaceus, Terminalia schimperiana, Parkia clappertoniana, Vitellaria paradoxa, Detarium microcarpum, Isoberlinia doka, Uapaca togoensis and Khaya senegalensis. Fauna 65 mammal species, 350 species of birds, and 30 species of reptiles and amphibians have been recorded in the park. These include lion, leopard, caracal, elephant and African manatee, numerous species of antelope, hippopotamus, African wild dog, honey badger, cheetah, Senegal bushbaby, many species of monkey, and African clawless otter. Reptiles include the Nile crocodile, West African slender-snouted crocodile, four turtle species, Nile monitor, savannah monitor, other lizards and snakes, and 12 amphibian species. There are 82 species of fish in Lake Kainji. The fauna of the Zugurma sector is less varied than of the Borgu sector because of poor drainage, overgrazing by cattle, poor quality vegetation and extensive poaching.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1927, and was a cabinet minister in John Bracken's government from 1922 to 1925. Black was born in Kilmarnock, Scotland, the son of Francis M. Black, and was educated at Perth Academy and at King's College London. He joined the British civil service in 1886 and then was hired by the Union Discount Company of London in 1889. In 1892, he moved to British Columbia, where he worked for the Bank of British Columbia. Black operated on his own in Vancouver from 1898 to 1901. In 1895, he married Margaret Elizabeth McIntosh. He later joined the Pat Burns Company, working in Nelson and Calgary. Black served as president of the Calgary Board of Trade in 1916-17 and was a member of the Alberta Public Utilities Commission in 1917. He later moved to Manitoba, and became treasurer of the United Grain Growers association. Black became vice-president of the Winnipeg Street Railway Company in 1924. Black's entry into politics came about in an unusual manner, after the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) emerged as the province's largest political party in the 1922 provincial election. The UFM won 25 seats out of 52, with elections deferred in three other northern seats. They were not an organized political party, however, and did not have a leader until John Bracken was chosen by caucus after the election. The UFM, which governed as the Progressive Party, promoted the philosophy that Manitoba should be governed in an efficient, businesslike and non-partisan manner. Although Black had no political experience, and was not a candidate in the 1922 election, his successful management of the United Grain Growers recommended him to the new administration. He was chosen as Bracken's Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Telephones and Telegrams on August 8, 1922. On September 13, he was declared elected by acclamation for the sprawling northern constituency of Rupertsland, one of the province's deferred seats. The historian John Kendle has described Black as \\"a dry, dour Scotsman renowned for his frugality and efficiency\\". He proved equally cautious and frugal as a finance minister, and played little role in parliamentary debates. Black resigned his ministerial portfolios on January 12, 1925, and served as a government backbencher for the next two years. He did not seek re-election in 1927. In 1927, Black became chair of the British Columbia fruit control board. He died in Vancouver at the age of 70.
