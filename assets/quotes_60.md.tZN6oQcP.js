Owned by Cumulus Media, the station broadcasts a classic-leaning country music format branded as 93.3 Nash Icon. Studios are in Athens, Alabama while its transmitter is in Huntsville. History The station signed on in 1962 as WJIG-FM in Tullahoma, Tennessee (simulcasting WJIG-AM). In 1987 as WKQD-FM, the transmitter was moved to Elora, Tennessee, and the station began serving the Huntsville market. Its legal station ID at that time became \\"WKQD-FM, Tullahoma-Huntsville.\\" The station has sported various formats over the years, including Disco (as \\"Boogie 93\\" WBGY-FM), CHR (as \\"The New Power 93 FM\\" WKQD), rock (as \\"93.3 The Ugly\\" WKQD), country (as \\"93.3 Huntsville's Country\\" WHVK, \\"93.3 The Twister\\" WTZT, \\"93.3 The Possum\\" WPZM, \\"US 93 FM\\" WUSX, and \\"93.3 The Wolf\\" WWFF-FM), and adult contemporary (as \\"Mix 93.3\\" WXMR). After an ownership change in 2003, it switched to a mainstream urban format (again called \\"Power 93.3\\"), originally playing Hip Hop and R&B; music as WHRP to compete with heritage urban WEUP-FM. Over the course of several months in late 2005, the station gradually shifted from Hip Hop and R&B; to Urban Adult Contemporary as \\"93.3 WHRP, The Adult Mix.\\" 93.3 The Wolf logo, 2008-2011 On April 5, 2006, Cumulus acquired 94.1 WXQW, and it immediately began simulcasting WHRP. On December 21, 2007, 94.1 WXQW switched to the WHRP call letters, and 93.3 was assigned WWFF-FM. The new WHRP maintained the Urban AC format, and on January 12, 2008, WWFF-FM switched back to country, again branded as \\"The Wolf\\". In 2008, the station's license was reassigned to New Market, Alabama, and the transmitter was again moved, this time to Drake Mountain in Huntsville. The 1,096 foot tower one mile northwest of Elora that once broadcast on 93.3 still stands today and is still owned by Cumulus Broadcasting LLC of Atlanta, GA who acquired it from the Dunnavant family but today, there are no radio broadcast transmissions from it. Journey 93.3 logo, 2011-2014 Following three-and-a-half years of poor ratings as a country outlet, on August 31, 2011, WWFF began stunting with a \\"wheel of formats\\" that was predominantly classic country, oldies, CHR, smooth jazz, urban oldies, and urban AC, as well as playing news and history bits from Huntsville history. It also included a tribute to Michael Jackson and snippets of Casey Kasem describing the then-new Compact Disc technology from a 1980s American Top 40 show. At exactly 9:33 AM on September 2, the station began airing its new format as \\"Journey 93-3\\", with a three-minute introduction, and a short promo by Randy Jackson, former bass player for the 1980s rock band Journey, followed by their song \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\". 93.3 The Wolf Heading On a New Journey WWFF Becomes Journey 93.3 The format is promoted as a \\"journey\\" through 1980s and 1990s popular music, similar to other Journey-branded stations launched by Cumulus in Atlanta (W250BC) and Cincinnati (WNNF) earlier in the summer of 2011 (both have since changed formats). WWFF-FM began airing all-Christmas music on November 16, 2012, at 5 PM, still using the \\"Journey\\" moniker. It switched back to its 80s/90s Hits format on December 26 at midnight. On November 14, 2014, after stunting briefly with Christmas music, WWFF returned to country music under Cumulus's Nash Icon format, which focuses primarily on popular country music acts from the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. Ownership The station was originally owned by Jerry Newton (the brother of Wayne Newton) and started circa 1973. In 1987, the station became WKQD and moved the transmitter to Elora, Tennessee, which would cover the original city of license (Tullahoma, Tennessee) along with the Huntsville area. The Dunnavant family LMAed the station in 1991 and eventually purchased the station outright. On April 1, 2003, the then-WUSX was sold by Athens Broadcasting Co. (William E. Dunnavant, president) to Cumulus Broadcasting Inc. as part of a four station deal with a total sale price of $22 million in cash and Cumulus common stock. The acquisition of the stations was completed in July 2003.

It is also applied to airport runways and ocean freight terminals. In effect, every highway superintendent does pavement management.Pavement Management - A Manual for Communities, U. S. Department of Transportation, Metropolitan Area Planning Council, Boston MA., 1986 Pavement management incorporates life cycle costs into a more systematic approach to minor and major road maintenance and reconstruction projects.

Shahin, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, 2002 , as the cost of data collection can change significantly . Pavement management encompasses the many aspects and tasks needed to maintain a quality pavement inventory, and ensure that the overall condition of the road network can be sustained at desired levels.Hillsborough County Pavement Management Strategy, Hillsborough County Fl, Ch.1 - Introduction, pg1., R. Cox, P.E. 2006 While pavement management covers the entire lifecycle of pavement from planning to maintenance in any transport infrastructure, road asset management and road maintenance planning target more specifically road infrastructure. The introduction of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board‚Äôs (GASB‚Äôs) Statement 34GASB Welcome Page is having a dramatic impact on the financial reporting requirements of state and local governments. Introduced in June 1999, this provision recommends that governmental agencies report the value of their infrastructure assets in their financial statements. GASB recommends that government agencies use a historical cost approach for capitalizing long- lived capital assets; however, if historical information is not available, guidance is provided for an alternate approach based on the current replacement cost of the assets. A method of representing the costs associated with the use of the assets must also be selected, and two methods are allowed by GASB. One approach is to depreciate the assets over time. The modified approach, on the other hand, provides an agency more flexibility in reporting the value of its assets based upon the use of a systematic, defensible approach that accounts for the preservation of the asset.Proceedings of the 2003 Mid-Continent Transportation Research Symposium, Ames, Iowa, August 2003. ¬© 2003 by Iowa State University. Pavement management and pavement management systems provide agencies with the tools necessary to evaluate their pavement assets and meet the GASB34 requirements under the modified depreciation approach. Pavement management systems A pavement management system (PMS) is a planning tool used to aid pavement management decisions. PMS software programs model future pavement deterioration due to traffic and weather, and recommend maintenance and repairs to the road's pavement based on the type and age of the pavement and various measures of existing pavement quality. Measurements can be made by persons on the ground, visually from a moving vehicle, or using automated sensors mounted to a vehicle. PMS software often helps the user create composite pavement quality rankings based on pavement quality measures on roads or road sections. Recommendations are usually biased towards predictive maintenance, rather than allowing a road to deteriorate until it needs more extensive reconstruction. Typical tasks performed by pavement management systems include: # Inventory pavement conditions, identifying good, fair and poor pavements. # Assign importance ratings for road segments, based on traffic volumes, road functional class, and community demand. # Schedule maintenance of good roads to keep them in good condition.'Saha, P., & Ksaibati, K. (2015). 'A Risk-based Optimization Methodology for Managing County Paved Roads', In Transportation Research Board 94th Annual Meeting (No. 15-1916), http://docs.trb.org/prp/15-1916.pdf # Schedule repairs of poor and fair pavements as remaining available funding allows.Pavement Management System Summer Intern Program, Nuggets and Nibbles Volume XXX Number 3, Cornell Local Roads Program, Summer 2011, page 4, http://www.clrp.cornell.edu/nuggets_and_nibbles/index.htm Research has shown that it is far less expensive to keep a road in good condition than it is to repair it once it has deteriorated. This is why pavement management systems place the priority on preventive maintenance of roads in good condition, rather than reconstructing roads in poor condition. In terms of lifetime cost and long term pavement conditions, this will result in better system performance. Agencies that concentrate on restoring their bad roads often find that by the time they've repaired them all, the roads that were in good condition have deteriorated. The State of California was among the first to adopt a (PMS) in 1979. Like others of its era, the first PMS was based in a mainframe computer and contained provisions for an extensive database.U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, California Division, November 13, 2003) It can be used to determine long-term maintenance funding requirements and to examine the consequences on network condition if insufficient funding is available. Management approach The pavement management process has been incorporated into several pavement management systems including SirWay https://www.sirway.info/assets/pdf/Sirway- RMS.pdflink= . The following management approach evolved over the last 30 years as part of the development of the PAVER management system (U.S. Army COE, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory, Micro PAVER 2004). The approach is a process that consists of the following steps:Pavement Management for Airport, roads, and Parking Lots, 2nd Edition, M.Y. Shahin, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, 2002 # Inventory Definition # Pavement Inspection # Condition Assessment # Condition Prediction # Condition Analysis # Work Planning =Inventory Definition= Typically, pavement management requires road inventory to be created and tied to an Asset Location Referencing System (ALRS). Road inventory includes road location using both coordinate and linear referencing systems, road width, road length and pavement type. =Condition Assessment= Pavement condition can be divided into structural and functional condition with various condition variables. Functional condition can be divided into roughness, texture and skid resistance while structural condition includes mechanical properties and pavement distresses.Bennett, C. R., de Solminihac, H. and Chamorro, A. Data Collection Technologies for Road Management, Transport Note No. 30, Roads and Rural Transport Thematic Group, The World Bank, Washington D.C., 2007. To measure such indices, costly laser- based tools are used extensively while development of cost effective tools such as RGB-D sensors significantly reduces the cost of data collection . =Condition Prediction= Pavement condition prediction is often referred to pavement deterioration modeling, which can be based on mechanical or empirical models. Also, hybrid parameterized models are popular. More recently other methods based on Markov models and machine learning have been proposed that outperform their former counterparts . Pavement deterioration is caused by traffic and weather conditions. Also, material and construction choices affect the deterioration process. It has been shown that empirical models outperform the mechanical and hybrid models in condition prediction.Sirvio, Konsta (2017) Advances in predictive maintenance planning of roads by empirical models. Aalto University publication series DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS, 166/2017. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319998419_Advances_in_predictive_maintenance_planning_of_roads_by_empirical_models) =Work Planning= Work planning is essentially road maintenance planning in which the maintenance works are assigned both spatially and temporally according to the desired criteria such as minimal costs to the society.

History Around the time of the 19th century British emancipation of slaves in British Antigua and Barbuda, a colonial plantation owner had financial troubles and was forced to sell off a part of her property in small lots. The ex-slaves in the neighbourhood bought up all the small freeholds, as they desired to own land in perpetuity. ‚ÄúLiberta‚Äù, meaning liberty and honoring the freed people, became the settlement's name in 1835. By 1842, a painted signboard near its border read: ‚ÄúThe Village of Liberta‚Äù. The new landowners immediately settled on the lots they had purchased, framed their houses, and cultivated their gardens. Besides working on nearby plantations, income was sometimes also earned working as mechanics at Nelson's Dockyard at Falmouth Harbour.

The PTS is given in units related to a program's overall clock reference, either Program Clock Reference (PCR) or System Clock Reference (SCR), which is also transmitted in the transport stream or program stream. Presentation time stamps have a resolution of 90kHz, suitable for the presentation synchronization task. The PCR or SCR has a resolution of 27MHz which is suitable for synchronization of a decoder's overall clock with that of the usual remote encoder, including driving TV signals such as frame and line sync timing, colour sub carrier, etc.A Guide to MPEG Fundamentals and Protocol Analysis, specification notes by Tektronix. Decoding of N elementary streams is synchronized by adjusting the decoding of streams to a common master time base rather than by adjusting the decoding of one stream to match that of another. The master time base may be one of the N decoders' clocks, the data source‚Äôs clock, or it may be some external clock. A transport stream may contain multiple programs and each program may have its own time base. The time bases of different programs within a transport stream may be different. Because PTSs apply to the decoding of individual elementary streams, they reside in the PES packet layer of both the transport streams and program streams. End-to-end synchronization occurs when encoders save time stamps at capture time, when the time stamps propagate with associated coded data to decoders, and when decoders use those time stamps to schedule presentations. Synchronization of a decoding system with a channel is achieved through the use of the SCR in the program stream and by its analog, the PCR, in the transport stream. The SCR and PCR are time stamps encoding the timing of the bit stream itself, and are derived from the same time base used for the audio and video PTS values from the same program. Since each program may have its own time base, there are separate PCR fields for each program in a transport stream containing multiple programs. In some cases it may be possible for programs to share PCR fields.

Opening narration Plot Matt is a young man who is near death and awakens from a coma in a present-day hospital. He frantically asks his girlfriend to save him, and she agrees to take Matt from his hospital room. Shortly after they leave the room, a man dressed all in white appears and is bewildered that he does not find anyone else there. Meanwhile, Matt's girlfriend drives into a dusty old town called Winfield which appears to be a throwback to the Old West. The man in white, Griffin St. George, tracks them to Winfield. The townspeople encounter St. George who states he is in the \\"reclamation\\" business. The townspeople help St. George change the flat tire on his car and offer him a drink while they wait. Meanwhile, Matt tries to explain to his girlfriend that St. George is an \\"agent of death\\" who is after him as he escaped death. Although the townspeople claim not to know Matt, St. George is suspicious and questions the town drunk. The reason why he is after Matt is because his \\"number was up\\". The drunk protests that he is over 150 years old, so surely his number must have been up before Matt's. St. George says for unknown reasons no \\"numbers\\" of any Winfield residents can be found, let alone such a location on the map. The drunk admits that in the 19th century, they were approached by Chin‚ÄîSt. George's predecessor as the angel of death. Chin took a liking to the simple ways of Winfield and the decent people, so he struck a deal to spare them from death. The drunk tries to say that because he is the town drunk, he is of little use to Winfield, so simply take him and forget about Matt, but St. George says the bureaucracy of death does not work that way. St. George takes the drunk back to town in order to collect all the townspeople. Upon arriving back at the town he finds Matt ready to surrender if St. George leaves the townspeople alone, yet the townspeople are also ready to sacrifice themselves in order to save Matt. After consulting with Chin over the phone, St. George decides to leave both Matt and the townspeople alone, but warns that no one lives forever so they all must one day accept his eventual return. St. George's car then starts flying, ascending towards Heaven.

At the time of the murders, Reid lived with roommate Brian Fozzard and had a room at a boarding house, and he was on parole from a 1983 conviction in Texas on charges relating to the aggravated armed robbery of a Houston steakhouse. He had served seven years of a 20-year sentence, and was paroled in 1990. Originally from Richland Hills, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, Reid went to Nashville to pursue a career as a country music singer. Crimes =Captain D's= At Captain D's on Lebanon Road in the Donelson neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee, on the morning of February 16, 1997, Reid entered the store before opening, under the guise of applying for a job. Once inside, he forced employee Sarah Jackson, 16, and the manager, Steve Hampton, 25, into the restaurant's cooler. Reid forced the two to lie face down on the floor and then shot them execution style. Money, including large amounts of change, was found missing from the cash register. Reid used the cash from this robbery as a down payment on a car two days later. =McDonald's= At McDonald's on Lebanon Road in Hermitage, Tennessee [ northeast of Captain D's], on the evening of March 23, 1997, Reid approached four employees as they exited the store after closing. At gunpoint, he forced them back into the restaurant. Reid shot three employees to death execution style in the storeroom: Andrea Brown, 17; Ronald Santiago, 27; and Robert A. Sewell. Reid attempted to shoot Jos√© Antonio Ramirez Gonzalez, but his weapon failed. Reid then stabbed Gonzalez 17 times and left him for dead. Gonzalez avoided further attacks by lying completely still and pretending to be dead. Reid then took US$3000 from the cash registers and fled. When the scene was discovered, Gonzalez was taken to a nearby hospital, treated, and ultimately survived. He eventually testified against Reid. =Baskin-Robbins= At Baskin-Robbins on Wilma Rudolph Boulevard in Clarksville, Tennessee, on the evening of April 23, 1997, Reid went to the door after closing and persuaded the employees to let him inside. Once inside, Reid kidnapped Angela Holmes, 21, and Michelle Mace, 16, and forced the two to Dunbar Cave State Park. Their bodies were discovered the next day at Dunbar Cave Park. Their throats had been slashed. Trials Reid was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder across three trials. Jurors from West and East Tennessee were brought in and sequestered, because a judge determined that the overwhelming media coverage in Nashville would prevent the selection of an unbiased jury from Middle Tennessee. =Captain D's= In the Captain D's murders, Steve Hampton's driver's license and a video rental card were found in the median of Ellington Parkway with Reid's fingerprints on each. Reid was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. =Baskin-Robbins= In the Baskin-Robbins murders, Reid's car was found to contain forensic evidence from the victims, as well as evidence of a credit card gasoline purchase near the location of the bodies on the night of the murders, placing him at the scene around the time of the crime in an area roughly from his home. Witnesses also placed a vehicle similar to Reid's vehicle in the immediate area at the time of the crime. Blood evidence from the victims was found on his shoes. He was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder. The Clarksville trial took place in the time between the two Nashville trials. Sentences Reid received seven death sentences for his convictions, the first two coming on April 20, 1999. Reid's execution was stayed several times in the years following, including an instance in 2003 just hours before the scheduled execution. Reid eventually waived his right to an appeal. Members of his family, along with anti-death penalty activists, claimed he was mentally handicapped and unable to make such a decision, and filed multiple motions (both successful and unsuccessful) to stay his execution. However, the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld all of Reid's sentences. Reid's case has received national attention among anti-death penalty activists. Reid resided at Tennessee's Morgan County Correctional Complex (Inmate #303893). His seven death sentences are the most ever handed down to a single person in the state of Tennessee. His last execution date was scheduled for January 3, 2008, but was stayed on December 26, 2007 by US District Judge Todd J. Campbell, pending investigation into the constitutionality of Tennessee's lethal injection methods. The stay was part of a larger investigation, and not directly related to Reid's case. On April 16, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in a Kentucky case upholding the legality of execution by lethal injection. The state of Tennessee immediately began appealing stays of execution to resume death penalty cases, including Reid's. Mental issues After his arrest, Reid's family (notably his sister, Linda Martiniano) argued that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial. Following his convictions, they argued that he was not able to make sound legal decisions. Reid displayed erratic decision making, choosing to appeal some verdicts and not others, and professing his will to die as sentenced after having fought to avoid such a fate earlier in his defense. At the same time, Reid exhibited public signs of paranoia, calling his defense team \\"actors\\" and claiming he was part of a United States government mind-control project called \\"Scientific Technology\\" that monitored his every move. In cross-examinations, the prosecution attempted to counter this defense by claiming Reid was a crafty con artist using these \\"delusions\\" as a defense mechanism. Other crimes suspected For a time, Reid was considered a prime suspect in the 1993 Brown's Chicken massacre in Palatine, Illinois due to the similar nature of the crime in relation to the two incidents in Nashville. Characteristics included shoeprints found at the scene and descriptions of the killer that matched Reid's profile. His alibi checked out, however, and Reid was later ruled out as a suspect. Juan Luna was convicted on seven counts of murder in 2007. On September 29, 2009, Luna's cohort, James Degorski, was found guilty of all seven counts of murder. On October 20, 2009, Degorski was sentenced to life in prison. All but two of the jurors had voted for the death penalty. Reid was reportedly also considered a suspect in the Houston-area killings of three people in a bowling alley for which Max Soffar has twice been convicted. Death Reid died at Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, on November 1, 2013. The cause of death was from complications due to pneumonia, heart failure, and upper respiratory issues. Reid had been in the hospital for about two weeks.

Development Based on a design by the US Bureau of Aeronautics for a simple single-seat scout seaplane that could be disassembled and assembled quickly. Instead of building the aircraft itself the Bureau of Aeronautics contracted the Cox- Klemin Aircraft Corporation to build six aircraft designated XS-1. The aircraft were powered by a 60 hp Lawrance L-4 radial engine. One aircraft was re-engined in 1923 with a Kinner engine and re-designated XS-2. Operational history As part of a series of studies conducted by the United States Navy after World War I into the possibility of submarine borne observation and scouting aircraft, the submarine S-1 became the experimental platform for this project late in 1923. The XS-1, XS-2 and the Martin MS-1 were used for the trials mounted in a cylindrical pod behind the conning tower. After surfacing the aircraft could be rolled out and assembled, it was then launched ballasting the sub until the deck was awash. The first full cycle of surfacing, assembly, launching, retrieving, disassembly, and submergence took place on 28 July 1926, on the Thames River at New London using the XS-2. After further trials during 1926 all the experimental aircraft were scrapped.

Between 1986 and 1996, she won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, and nine national titles. Upon the conclusion of her successful career, she was awarded the Thomas Keller Medal by the International Rowing Federation (FISA) ‚Äì the highest honour in rowing. Rowing career =Representing East Germany= Sorgers was born in 1967 in Neubrandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, which at the time belonged to East Germany. She went to school in Pragsdorf where she was chosen for the rowing programme. From early on in her rowing career, Sorgers was a sculler. Her first club was Dynamo Neubrandenburg-Mitte and in 1981, she transferred to SC Dynamo Berlin. In 1982, she won the national junior championships in quad scull. Her first notable success came at the 1983 Spartakiad where she won gold in the double scull event partnered with Sybille Schmidt. At the 1984 World Rowing Junior Championships in J√∂nk√∂ping, Sweden, she became junior world champion in the coxed quad scull alongside Judith Zeidler. At the 1985 World Rowing Junior Championships in Brandenburg an der Havel, East Germany, she became junior world champion in the double scull partnered with Claudia Kr√ºger with whom she had rowed since the beginning of the year; they dominated the final from the start and were more than 12 seconds ahead of the silver medallists. Having won her second junior world championship title, Sorgers proclaimed that her biggest wish was to make it into the senior national team. At the beginning of the next season, she was chosen by chief women's coach J√ºrgen Gr√∂bler for the team. Having just turned 19‚Äîthe second-youngest on the East German team with Andreas Hajek a few months younger‚Äîshe won her first senior world championship title at the 1986 World Rowing Championships in Nottingham in the United Kingdom in the quad scull alongside Kerstin Pieloth, Birgit Peter and Kerstin Hinze. In October 1986, she was awarded a Patriotic Order of Merit in gold (first class) for her sporting success. The team repeated this success at the 1987 World Rowing Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark, with Jutta Hampe having replaced Hinze and despite Hampe having caught a crab early in the final. In January 1988, Sorgers was awarded the sports title \\"Honored Master of Sports\\". At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, the women from East Germany dominated the rowing competition by winning five of the six events. Sorgers won gold with the quad scull, alongside Kerstin F√∂rster (n√©e Pieloth), Kristina Mundt and Beate Schramm. Of the team of 23 female rowers, only two rowers did not win a medal ‚Äì the coxless pair came fourth. In November 1988, Sorgers was awarded a Patriotic Order of Merit in gold (first class); this was the second time that she received this award. For the 1989 rowing season, Sorgers teamed up with Schramm in a double scull. Early in the rowing season, they successfully competed against a team made of Jutta Behrendt (n√©e Hampe) and Sybille Schmidt (Sorger's 1983 double scull partner). Sorgers and Schramm won the 1989 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Yugoslavia. For the 1990 rowing season, Sorgers was back in a quad with Schmidt, Kerstin K√∂ppen and Kr√ºger. This crew went to Tasmania in Australia for the 1990 World Rowing Championships where they became world champions. This was the last appearance of the East German national rowing team as the German reunification had happened a month earlier; the two German rowing federations were about to merge, too. =Representing Germany= The 1991 rowing season started with a national regatta for the small boat classes in Wedau where Sorgers competed in single scull and was beaten into second place by Schramm. A month later, an international regatta was held at the same venue where Sorgers teamed up with Sybille Schmidt in the double scull; they won their boat class by a margin of almost 8 seconds. The intention of the rowing officials had always been for Sorgers and Schmidt to be part of a quad scull for 1991 and after further qualification races, the 1990 team was reassembled, with Jana Thieme nearly having replaced Kr√ºger. At the 1991 World Rowing Championships in Vienna, Austria, the quad scullers defended their world championship title. In the 1992 season, Sorgers had a performance low. She did attend a three-week Olympic training camp in Mexico but then did not make the 1992 national team selection. She thus missed out qualification for the 1992 Summer Olympics. In 1993, Sorgers changed club and moved to SG Dynamo Potsdam but did not make it back into the national team. In December 1993, Sorgers was one of forty-five athletes to be awarded the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (\\"Silver Laurel Leaf\\"), the highest sports award in Germany. Sorgers made a comeback in the 1994 season. She made it back into the national team and with the quad scull, she won her sixth world championship title at the 1994 World Rowing Championships in Indianapolis, United States. The other team members that year were Mundt, Katrin Rutschow, and Kerstin K√∂ppen-Kosbab. At the 1995 World Rowing Championships in Tampere, Finland, the quad scull defended its championship title, with Thieme having replaced Mundt. Sorgers retired after winning a final gold medal in quad scull with Rutschow, K√∂ppen, and Kathrin Boron at the 1996 Summer Olympics. After her retirement, she was awarded the Thomas Keller Medal. =National championships= In the GDR, Sorgers won her first national title in 1986 in the quad scull. In 1988, she became national champion in both the double and the quad scull. In 1989, she retained her title in the double scull. In 1990, she won her final East German title with the quad scull. After the reunification, Sorgers won four national titles in quad scull: in 1991, 1994, 1995, and 1996. Life outside rowing Sorgers trained as a medical technical assistant from 1984. In 1991, she trained to become a beautician. She married rower Oliver Rau some time after her retirement from competitive rowing and has since been known as Jana Sorgers-Rau. The couple have twin daughters (born 2000) and for many years, they lived in Bremen. Oliver Rau worked for sports club SV Werder Bremen from 1996 until 2017. He now works for and they live in Frankfurt.

Benazir Bhutto, twice Prime Minister of Pakistan (1988‚Äì1990; 1993‚Äì1996) and then-leader of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party, had been campaigning ahead of elections scheduled for January 2008. Shots were fired at her after a political rally at Liaqat National Bagh, and a suicide bomb was detonated immediately following the shooting. She was declared dead at 18:16 local time (13:16 UTC), at Rawalpindi General Hospital. Twenty-three other people were killed by the bombing. Bhutto had previously survived a similar attempt on her life (the 2007 Karsaz bombing) that killed at least 180 people, after her return from exile two months earlier. Though early reports indicated that she had been hit by shrapnel or the gunshots, the Pakistani Interior Ministry initially stated that Bhutto died of a skull fracture sustained when the force of the explosion caused her head to strike the sunroof of the vehicle. Bhutto's aides rejected this version, and argued instead that she suffered two gunshots before the bomb detonation. The Interior Ministry subsequently backtracked from its previous claim. In May 2007, Bhutto asked for additional protection from foreign contracting agencies Blackwater and the British firm ArmorGroup. The United Nations' investigation of the incident revealed that, \\"Ms. Bhutto's assassination could have been prevented if adequate security measures had been taken.\\"  Background  Benazir Bhutto, September 2004 Bhutto had opted for self-exile while her court cases for corruption remained pending in foreign and Pakistani courts. (archive subscription needed) After eight years in exile in Dubai and London, Bhutto returned to Karachi on 18 October 2007 to prepare for the 2008 national elections, allowed by a possible power-sharing deal with President Pervez Musharraf. Bhutto survived an assassination attempt in Karachi during this homecoming. En route to a rally in Karachi on 18 October 2007, two explosions occurred shortly after she had landed and left Jinnah International Airport returning from her exile. Bhutto was not injured, but the explosions, later found to be a suicide-bomb attack, killed 139 people and injured at least 450. The dead included at least 50 of the security guards from her Pakistan Peoples Party, who had formed a human chain around her truck to keep potential bombers away, as well as six police officers. A number of senior officials were injured. Bhutto was escorted unharmed from the scene. After the bombing Bhutto and her husband asked Musharraf for greater security, including tinted windows, jammers for bombs, private guards, and four police vehicles. These calls were echoed by three U.S. Senators who wrote to Musharraf. Bhutto's supporters and the Pakistani government dispute whether or not she was provided adequate protection. The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported that Bhutto further asked the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Britain's Scotland Yard, and Israel's Mossad several weeks before the assassination to help provide for her protection. Israel had not yet decided whether or not to provide aid because it did not want to upset relations with Pakistan and India. Bhutto also tried to obtain private security personnel, approaching both the U.S.-based Blackwater and UK-based ArmorGroup. However, the Pakistani government refused to give visas to the foreign security contractors. Despite this, American diplomats provided Bhutto with confidential U.S. intelligence on threats against her. After the assassination, President Musharraf denied that Bhutto should have received more security, saying that her death was primarily her own fault because she took \\"unnecessary risks\\" and should have exited the rally more quickly.  Assassination  Benazir Bhutto had just addressed a rally of Pakistan Peoples Party supporters in the city of Rawalpindi when the rally was rocked by an explosion. Initial police reports stated that one or more assassins fired at Bhutto's bulletproof white Toyota Land Cruiser just as she was about to drive off after the rally. A suicide bomber detonating a bomb next to her vehicle followed. According to Getty Images photographer John Moore, Bhutto was standing through her vehicle's sunroof to wave at supporters, and fell back inside after three gunshots. The Times of India aired an amateur clip showing the assassin firing three gun shots at Bhutto before the blast (video no longer available via India Times). Various videos have surfaced on YouTube but sources are difficult to confirm. Following the incident, an unconscious Bhutto was taken to the Rawalpindi General Hospital at 17:35 local time, where doctors led by Rawalpindi Medical College Principal Mohammad Musaddiq Khan tried to resuscitate her, performing a \\"left anterolateral thoracotomy for open cardiac massage\\". Sadiq Khan, Mohammad Khan's father, had tried to save Liaquat Ali Khan when he was assassinated in the same park and rushed to the same hospital in 1951. Although Pakistan Peoples Party spokesman Farhatullah Babar initially said that Bhutto was safe, she was declared dead at 18:16 local time (13:16 UTC). = Cause of death = Memorial at the site of the assassination Plaque marking the spot of the assassination Bhutto's cause of death has been much discussed and debated. Some commentators suggested that this debate was motivated by attempts to define Bhutto's legacy: perhaps Bhutto would be considered a martyr if she died by gunshot, but not if she died by hitting her head following a bomb blast. Others asserted that the arguments against a death by gunshot were intended to blunt criticism that she was not adequately protected. Initial reports based on Pakistani Interior Ministry information reported that Bhutto was killed by a gunshot wound to the neck. Rehman Malik, a security adviser for Pakistan Peoples Party, suggested that the killer opened fire as Bhutto left the rally and that he hit her in the neck and chest before he detonated the explosives he was wearing. Javed Cheema, an interior ministry spokesman, stated that her injuries were caused either by her having been shot or from pellets packed into the detonated bomb that acted as shrapnel. On 28 December, however, the cause of Bhutto's death became less clear. Pakistan's Interior Ministry announced that they now felt Bhutto's death was as a result of a neck fracture sustained when she ducked or fell into her vehicle and hit the sunroof catch immediately after the gunshots but later reported her cause of death as a skull fracture. According to an Associated Press report, the Ministry stated \\"Bhutto was killed when she tried to duck back into the vehicle, and the shock waves from the blast knocked her head into a lever attached to the sunroof, fracturing her skull.\\" The Ministry further added, in contradiction of the official hospital account, that Bhutto suffered no gunshot or shrapnel injuries and that all gunshots missed her. Pakistan Peoples Party spokesman Farhatullah Babar rejected claims that Bhutto's death was caused by an accident. Bhutto's lawyer and a senior official in the Pakistan Peoples Party, Farooq Naik, said that the report was \\"baseless\\" and \\"a pack of lies\\". He went on to support the view that the cause of death was two bullets hitting Bhutto in the abdomen and the head. An anonymous Toyota official also rejected the notion that she could have even hit the lever based on its location in the car (a Toyota Land Cruiser). In statements made to Pakistan's The News, Mohammad Mussadiq Khan, one of the doctors who treated Bhutto at Rawalpindi General Hospital, described severe and depressed skull fractures, oval in overall shape, on the right side of Bhutto's head.Medical report of Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. (27 December 2007). The Washington Post. Retrieved 31 December 2007. He apparently saw no other injuries and downplayed the possibility of bullet wounds, although he had previously spoken of them. One anonymous doctor said that Pakistani authorities took Bhutto's medical records immediately after her death, and that they told doctors to stop talking. On 31 December, Athar Minallah of the Rawalpindi General Hospital released a statement (described as \\"clinical notes\\") signed by seven persons involved in Bhutto's treatment at the hospital. These persons were not pathologists and did not conduct a formal autopsy. The statement first narrates the course of treatment, from Bhutto's arrival at the hospital until she was declared dead. The second part of the statement details the head wound and notes that \\"Detailed external examination of the body did not reveal any other external injury\\". X-rays had been taken of the head wound and were interpreted in the statement. The cause of death was declared to be \\"Open head injury with depressed skull fracture, leading to cardiopulmonary arrest\\". According to The Washington Post, the crime scene was cleared before any forensic examination could be completed and no formal autopsy was performed before burial. Despite the ambiguity surrounding her death, Bhutto's husband Asif Zardari did not allow a formal autopsy to be conducted citing his fears regarding the procedure being carried out in Pakistan. On 1 January 2008, Pakistan's Interior Ministry backtracked on its statement that Benazir Bhutto had died from hitting her head on the sunroof latch. Ministry spokesman, Javed Iqbal Cheema said that the ministry would wait for forensic investigations before making a conclusion on Bhutto's cause of death. On 8 February 2008, investigators from Scotland Yard concluded that Benazir Bhutto died after hitting her head as she was tossed by the force of a suicide blast, not from an assassin's bullet. However, as quoted in an article in The New York Times: \\"It is unclear how the Scotland Yard investigators reached such conclusive findings absent autopsy results or other potentially important evidence that was washed away by cleanup crews in the immediate aftermath of the blast.\\" In the report, UK Home Office pathologist Nathaniel Cary said that while a gunshot wound to her head or trunk could not be entirely excluded as a possibility, \\"the only tenable cause for the rapidly fatal head injury in this case is that it occurred as the result of impact due to the effects of the bomb-blast.\\" The findings were consistent with the Pakistani government's explanation of Bhutto's assassination, an account that had been greeted with disbelief by Bhutto's supporters. = Funeral = Bhutto's funeral occurred on the afternoon of 28 December 2007. Her body was moved from Chaklala Airbase in Rawalpindi to Sukkur Airport on 28 December at 01:20. Both her children and her husband travelled with her body. Earlier they reached Chaklala Air Base by a special flight to get her body. Mourners from all over Pakistan made their way to Larkana to take part in the funeral ceremony for the former Prime Minister. The family delivered the body to its site of burial via helicopter. Bhutto was laid to rest beside her father in the family tomb.  Aftermath  = Riots = thumb After Bhutto's death, supporters wept and broke the hospital's glass doors, threw stones at cars, and reportedly chanted \\"Dog, Musharraf, dog\\" outside the hospital, referring to President Musharraf. Others attacked police and burned election campaign posters and tyres. Some opposition groups said that the assassination could lead to civil war, and other commentators said that the upcoming elections would likely be postponed. Demonstrations were widespread in Pakistan with police using tear gas and batons to break up angry demonstrations in Peshawar. Some protesters torched the billboards of Musharraf, firing in the air and screaming. Protests in Multan also had protesters burning tires and blocking traffic. Similar scenes were witnessed in Karachi, Bhutto's home city. Police in Sindh were put on red alert. Two police officers were shot in Karachi during the riots following the assassination. Musharraf ordered a crackdown on rioters and looters to \\"ensure safety and security.\\"Musharraf cracks down on rioters, BBC News, Last Updated: Saturday, 29 December 2007, 14:57 UTC The Pakistan Rangers announced shoot-on-sight orders against anyone inciting violence or arson, although attempts to avoid direct confrontation were maintained. On 28 December the riots deteriorated, especially in the Sindh Province, the homeground of Bhutto. Foreign outlets, trains, banks and vehicles were destroyed or burned and protesters took over the streets, chanting slogans and setting tires on fire in several cities. At least 47 people died in the riots. Rioters destroyed 176 banks, 34 gasoline stations and hundreds of cars and shops. 28 December was the first day of a general strike called by many groups, ranging from political parties to various professional groups. Then it was the banks mainly in Sind. They were attacked and the buildings were burned in many cities of Sind. Most of the automated teller machines were destroyed. In some places, people were lucky to bring some money home. Hundreds of private buses were burned in all parts of the country. There were also incidents of burning of trains in Sind. According to the Daily Jang: Over 100 people died in the incidents related to mass protest, either by police or in the crossfire of different groups. = Pakistan Peoples Party = Bhutto's son, Bilawal Zardari, read her instructions on the future of the Pakistan Peoples Party on 30 December. In that will, she had designated her husband Asif Ali Zardari as her political successor but Zardari made their then nineteen-year-old son, Bilawal, the Chairman of the PPP as Zardari favoured their son to represent Bhutto's legacy, in part to avoid division within the party due to his own unpopularity and he serve as Co-Chairman of the PPP. = Elections and electoral fraud report = Pakistan's election commission met on 31 December to decide whether or not to delay the January elections; two days before they hinted that they would need to because pre- election preparation had been \\"adversely affected\\". A senior election commission official subsequently announced that the election would be delayed until \\"the later part of February\\". Senator Latif Khosa, one of Bhutto's top aides, reported that she was planning to divulge evidence of fraud in the upcoming election following the event where the assassination took place. The pair co-wrote a 160-page dossier on the subject, with Bhutto outlining tactics she alleged would be put into play, including intimidation, excluding voters and fake ballots being planted in boxes. The report was titled Yet another stain on the face of democracy. In a statement he made on 1 January 2008, Khosa said: Khosa said that they had planned to give the dossier to two American lawmakers on the evening of her assassination and release it publicly soon after that. One of the claims in the dossier was that US financial aid had been secretly misappropriated for electoral fraud and another was that the ISI has a 'mega-computer' which could hack into any other computer and was connected to the Election Commission's system. A spokesman for President Musharraf called the claims \\"ridiculous\\". In the run up to the election, the 'sympathy vote' was considered crucial for the Pakistan Peoples Party, which was expected to win the National Assembly.Birsel, Robert Bhutto sympathy vote seen key to Pakistan election.

Responsibility  Adnkronos claimed that al-Qaeda second-in-command Ayman al- Zawahiri ordered the killing in October 2007. U.S. intelligence officials have said that they cannot confirm this claim of responsibility. Nonetheless, U.S. analysts have said that al-Qaeda was a likely, or even prime suspect. For its part, the Pakistani Interior Ministry (of the previous Musharraf administration) stated that it had proof that al-Qaeda was behind the assassination, stating \\"that the suicide bomber belonged to Lashkar-e- Jhangvi‚Äîan al Qaeda-linked Sunni Muslim militant group that the government has blamed for hundreds of killings\\". The Interior Ministry also claimed to have intercepted a statement by militant leader Baitullah Mehsud, said to be linked to al-Qaeda, in which he congratulated his followers for carrying out the assassination. On 29 December a Mehsud spokesman told the Associated Press that Mehsud was not involved in the assassination: \\"I strongly deny it. Tribal people have their own customs. We don't strike women. It is a conspiracy by government, military and intelligence agencies.\\" The Pakistan Peoples Party also called the government's blame of Mehsud a diversion: \\"The story that al- Qaida or Baitullah Mehsud did it appears to us to be a planted story, an incorrect story, because they want to divert the attention,\\" said Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for Bhutto's party. On 18 January 2008, CIA Director Michael Hayden claimed that Mehsud and his network was responsible. Bhutto, in a letter to Musharraf written on 16 October 2007, named four persons involved in an alleged plot to kill her: current Intelligence Bureau (IB) Chief Ijaz Shah, former chief minister of Punjab Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, former chief minister of Sindh Arbab Ghulam Rahim, and the former ISI chief, Hamid Gul, as those who posed a threat to her life. British newspaper The Times suggested that elements within the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence with close ties to Islamists might have been behind the killing, though it asserts that Musharraf would have been unlikely to have ordered the assassination. October 2007 emails from Bhutto saying she would blame Musharraf for her death if she were killed, because the Musharraf government was not providing adequate security, were also published after Bhutto's death. Soon after the killing, many of Bhutto's supporters believed that the Musharraf government was involved in the assassination.David, Ruth Bhutto Supporters Blame Musharraf. Forbes. Retrieved 1 March 2008 On 30 December Scotland on Sunday quoted MI5 sources saying that factions of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence may be responsible for the assassination. = United Nations inquiry = UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced on 5 February 2009 to send a commission to investigate Benazir Bhutto's assassination on Government of Pakistan's request. Armed with a modest mandate and a limited timeframe, a three-member team arrived at Islamabad on 16 July 2009. The unit, headed by the Chilean diplomat Heraldo Mu√±oz, found themselves plunged into a murky world of conspiracy theories, power politics and conflicting agendas. Mu√±oz was supported by the Indonesian official Marzuki Darusman and Peter Fitzgerald, a retired Irish police officer who headed the initial inquiry into the assassination of Lebanese Premier Rafik Hariri in 2005. The UN was asked to send a team to dispel away a conspiracy theory claiming that Zardari himself orchestrated his wife's death; a notion most analysts dismissed because of absence of any concrete evidence. Basically the UN team's mandate was to \\"establish the facts and circumstances of the assassination\\" and not to undertake a criminal investigation, which remained responsibility of the Pakistani authorities. A formal investigation by the United Nations commenced. The report concluded that the security measures provided to Bhutto by the government were \\"fatally insufficient and ineffective\\".UN report on Bhutto murder finds Pakistani officials 'failed profoundly' UN News Centre. 15 April 2010. Retrieved 12 May 2011. Furthermore, the report states that the treatment of the crime scene after her death \\"goes beyond mere incompetence\\". The report states that \\"police actions and omissions, including the hosing down of the crime scene and failure to collect and preserve evidence, inflicted irreparable damage to the investigation.\\" The UN Commission in its report mentioned that: A range of government officials failed profoundly in their efforts first to protect Ms Bhutto and second to investigate with vigour all those responsible for her murder, not only in the execution of the attack, but also in its conception, planning and financing. Responsibility for Ms Bhutto's security on the day of her assassination rested with the Federal Government, the government of Punjab and the Rawalpindi District Police. None of these entities took necessary measures to respond to the extraordinary and urgent security risks that they knew she faced.'' In short; among other failings: the police co-ordinated poorly with the PPP's own security; police escort units did not protect Ms Bhutto's vehicle as tasked; parked police vehicles blocked the emergency route; and, the police took grossly inadequate steps to clear the crowd so that Ms Bhutto's vehicle would have safe passage on leaving Liaquat Bagh. The performance of individual police officers and police leadership was poor in areas of forward planning, accountability and command and control. The heroism of individual PPP supporters, many of whom sacrificed themselves to protect Ms Bhutto should have been properly canalised by the Chief of PPP's security [Mr Rehman Malik]. More serious, Ms Bhutto was left vulnerable in a severely damaged vehicle by the irresponsible and hasty departure of the bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz which, as the back-up vehicle, was an essential part of her convoy [perhaps purposefully taken away by Rehman Malik, Babar Awan & Farhatullah Babar]. ....The collection of 23 pieces of evidence was manifestly inadequate in a case that should have resulted in thousands.... Hosing down the crime scene so soon after the blast goes beyond mere incompetence and needed fixing criminal responsibility on many. The deliberate prevention by CPO Saud Aziz of a post mortem examination of Ms Bhutto hindered a definitive determination of the cause of her death. It was patently unrealistic for the CPO to expect that Mr Zardari would allow an autopsy on his arrival in Pakistan while in the meantime her remains had been placed in a coffin and brought to the airport. The autopsy should have been carried out at RGH long before Mr Zardari arrived. The Commission was persuaded that the Rawalpindi police chief, CPO Saud Aziz, did not act independently of higher authorities, either in the decision to hose down the crime scene or to impede the post-mortem examination. = Official indictment = On 5 November 2011, a Pakistani court indicted two police officers in connection with Bhutto's 2007 assassination in Rawalpindi, among them the former police chief of the city. The two men were in charge of the former prime minister's security and have been previously arrested charged with \\"conspiracy as well as abetment in the murder\\" and \\"changing the security plan\\". A further 5 men have also been indicted all of whom are believed to have been affiliated with Beitullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban leader blamed by the government for the attack. On 20 August 2013 ex-President Pervez Musharraf, was indicted on three chargers for murder, conspiracy to murder, and facilitation of murder in connection with his alleged failure to provide adequate security for Bhutto‚Äîcharges for which he is reportedly denying responsibility.Pakistan court indicts seven in Bhutto murder case in Reuters on 5 November 2011 On 31 August 2017, a Pakistani anti-terrorism court declared Musharraf as a fugitive in Bhutto's murder and acquitted five suspected Pakistani Taliban of conspiracy to murder due to lack of evidence, and two high-ranking police officers have been sentenced to 17 years in prison, one for mishandling security at the Bhutto rally and the another for mishandling the crime scene.Benazir Bhutto murder: Five cleared of killing ex- Pakistan Prime Minister ‚ÄìThe Daily Telegraph on 31 August 2017Musharraf declared fugitive as Bhutto murder trial ends in Pakistan ‚ÄìThe Guardian on 31 August 2017Pakistani court declares ex-military leader a fugitive in Bhutto murder case ‚ÄìReuters on 31 August 2017 On 16 December 2019, Musharraf, in exile for hospitalization in Dubai, was sentenced to death in Pakistan in absentia for high treason, for suspending the constitution and imposing a state of emergency a decade early, with right of appeal.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistans-former- military-ruler-pervez-musharraf-is-sentenced-to-death-for-treason/2019 The United Arab Emirates has no current extradition with Pakistan, though Sharaf's poor health prevents him from being moved even if there was.  Reactions  = Pakistani government = According to state television, Musharraf held an emergency cabinet meeting after he received word of the blast. He then addressed the nation, saying that \\"We shall not rest till we tackle this problem and eliminate all the terrorists. This is the only way the nation will be able to move forward, otherwise this will be the biggest obstacle to our advancement.\\" In a televised address, President Musharraf publicly condemned the killing of Bhutto, proclaiming a three-day mourning period with all national flags at half-mast. Mahmud Ali Durrani, the Pakistani ambassador to the United States, called Bhutto's death \\"a national tragedy\\" and stated that \\"... we have lost one of our important, very important and, I would stress, liberal leaders.\\"  Opposition  Nawaz Sharif (pictured in 1998) expressed his solidarity with Bhutto's family and political workers. Nawaz Sharif was the first mainstream political leader to reach the hospital and express his solidarity with Bhutto's family and political workers. He vowed to \\"fight your [Bhutto's] war from now on\\" and calling the day of her assassination the \\"darkest, gloomiest day in the history of this country\\". Despite extreme political enmity between the two leaders during the 1990s, both vowed to introduce politics of tolerance before returning from exile and had earlier signed the Charter of Democracy. After signing the charter, they said that they would work for an end to the rule of President Musharraf. Earlier in the day, Nawaz Sharif's political meeting had also been shot at, resulting in the death of four people. Chairman Imran Khan of the Tehreek-e- Insaf party strongly condemned the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. \\"It is a dastardly act designed to destabilise Pakistan with the government responsible for not providing her security though she was demanding it. We must fight this menace of terrorism. It is a black day in the history of Pakistan and an irreparable loss to this country,\\" Khan said. Pakistan Peoples Party Washington, D.C. chapter president Javaid Manzoor said, \\"We [Bhutto's supporters] are shocked. We are stunned. Every single one of us is mourning the loss of our leader,\\" also stating that he believed that the next election, scheduled for 8 January would be cancelled. Pakistan Peoples Party senior vice chairman Ameen Faheem later called for a 40-day period of mourning across Pakistan. Pakistan Peoples Party spokesman Farhatullah Babar said the Pakistan Peoples Party was unhappy with the government's declaration of the death coming as a result of an accident and said that the Pakistan Peoples Party wanted to see a change in the direction of the investigation. He called for an independent inquiry into the assassination by international experts. He also said that \\"had the government accepted our demand of conducting an inquiry into Karachi's 18 October blast by international experts, this incident would not have happened.\\" = International reaction = U.S. President thumb Bhutto's assassination was met with widespread condemnation by members of the international community, including Pakistan's regional neighbours Afghanistan, China, India, Bangladesh and Iran. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh praised Bhutto's efforts for the improvement of Indo-Pakistani relations. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting and unanimously condemned the assassination, a call echoed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon.

(St James's was demolished a few years later; some monuments from St James's are preserved in St Peter's.) The church shows traces of many stages of construction from about 1180 onwards (the original church of around 1100 was destroyed by fire). =List of incumbents= Music St Peter's has a new organ, a choir and a series of Saturday morning concerts. The Organist & Director of Music since 2007 is Peter Siepmann. =Choir= The choral tradition at St Peter's was developed by Vincent Trivett (Organist 1906-1947), Kendrick Partington (Organist 1957-1994) and others. The choir sings in church every Sunday and frequently has concert performances. The choir often sings in other churches and cathedrals across the UK and abroad. This began with a visit to Lichfield Cathedral in 1969. In 2008 the choir sang the services for several days at Westminster Abbey. =Concerts= St Peter's has a regular series of Saturday morning 'coffee break' concerts. These were started in 1988. The church also occasionally hosts more formal evening performances. =Organ= The first organ since the Commonwealth period was installed by Lincoln in 1812. This was enlarged by Lloyd and Dudgeon in 1863Nottinghamshire Guardian - Friday 8 May 1863 and has been adapted and restored several times since by E. Wragg & Son, Henry Willis & Sons and Hill, Norman & Beard. In 1952, much of the organ of St Columba, Mansfield Road was incorporated into the St Peter's instrument. A new organ was installed in 2010, and combines some ranks of new and re-used pipes with digital simulations of most stops. It is situated in the North-East corner of the church, retaining a historic eighteenth century case. The organ has been designed as a recital instrument, and to provide support for congregational singing, as well as accompanying the church's choir. Organists There are notes of payments to organists in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries *1481-1482 And for 5s paid to the organist (lusori ad organa) in the aforesaid Church in this year.Thoroton Society Record Series Volume VII (1939).

Clock In 1552 Edward VI's commissioners delivered to ‚Äòparson‚Äô Nicholas Cooke a clock in the ‚Äòsteeple‚Äô, which had probably been there since the fifteenth century. The earliest reference in the church records ‚Äòchargs pyed owete fforw the church of St Peter‚Äôs in the yre off oure lord god 1577 2 sh. to Toms Lockwood for looking after the clock.‚Äô In 1723-4, the Chamberlains‚Äô Account record a payment of ¬£1 to the Sexton of St Peter's for ringing a 4 o‚Äôclock bell. On Wednesday 29 April 1846, a vestry meeting was called to consider the offer of new church clock. On Thursday 15 October 1846, as Richard Ward, a man employed by Messrs. Taylor and Garrett, was assisting in taking down the old face of St. Peter's church clock, when it gave way. A rope attached to it dragged him with it. The new clock was installed in 1847, manufactured by Reuben Bosworth at a cost of ¬£125 () and was at the time, the largest in Nottingham. It had a pendulum long and a bob weighing . It was an eight-day clock with four dials, each in diameter. The clock was tested for several weeks before the hand on the dials were connected to the mechanism on 7 April 1847. On Christmas Eve 1852 a hurricane broke off one of the minute hands of the clock. New cast iron clock dials, in diameter were presented by Henry Smith to the church in 1872 at a cost of ¬£66 (). A new clock was installed by G. & F. Cope in 1881 which had a Denison Remontoire, compensation pendulum and wire rope lines. The strike was provided by a hammer on the hour bell on E. This was replaced by an electrically driven clock by Smiths of Derby in 1965.

Career At the age of 16, while spending a weekend in New York City with her mother, her singing came to the attention of a retired producer who was guesting at the same establishment. He booked Wynn at a Peekskill vaudeville house, the owner of which engaged her to sing at his two other New York State properties, in Kingston and Newburgh. After working the vaudeville circuit, the late 1930s saw Wynn landing at radio station WNEWLundigan Haunts All Nan's Debuts, The Pittsburgh Press, April 19, 1941, p. 8 in New York for a 13-show-per-week stint and honing her talent under the mentorship of Jimmy Rich, the singing coach to Dinah Shore, Bea Wain, and Barry Wood, among others.The Daily Collegian, Penn State University, April 13, 1941, p. 7 Radio show stints followed with Rudy Vallee's orchestra, and with Hal Kemp's orchestra on his \\"Time to Shine\\" radio show.

He was descended from the noble and ancient family of the Muchars of Bied and Rangfeld, studied at the lyceum in Graz, entered the Benedictine Order, and made his vows on 16 October 1808, at Admont. Ordained a priest shortly afterwards, he devoted himself entirely to the study of Middle Eastern languages, became librarian and keeper of the archives in 1813, and later on professor of Greek and Middle Eastern languages at the theological school of his monastery. From 1823 to 1825 he was supplementary professor of Biblical science, becoming afterwards professor of aesthetics and classical philology at the University of Graz. He found that pure philological studies did not suit his taste, and in this branch we possess from him only an edition of Horace with German translation, which appeared in 1835 at Graz. His researches dealt chiefly with the history of Austria, for which purpose he made extensive visits to the libraries of Austria, Bavaria, and Upper Italy; thus, nearly all his historical works are based upon careful examination of the original sources. In 1829, the Academy of Sciences in Vienna elected him a member in recognition of his important contributions to national history, and he was one of the founders of the Historical Society for Inner Austria.

He was War Chief of the Kata or Arikara band of the Kiowa Indians, and then Principal Chief of the entire Kiowa Tribe, a position he held for an extraordinary 33 years. He is best remembered as the last undisputed Principal Chief of the Kiowa people before the Reservation Era, and the battlefield leader of the Plains Tribes in the largest battle ever fought between the Plains tribes and the United States.Mayhall, Mildred The Kiowas Name Doh√§san's name, which was hereditary, has been variously translated as Little Mountain, Little Bluff, or Top-of-the-Mountain. The name is difficult because /t√≤h…îÃÅÀê/ denotes 'the concavity in a bluff rather than the bluff itself. /s√¢n/ indicates 'small'. He was the son of a chief named Doh√° (Bluff). Because his name, and the Chieftainship of his band, was hereditary, (though not necessarily father to son) ‚Äì Doh√§san himself was succeeded by his nephew, rather than one of his sons, and though his father was a chief, it was his uncle who was the hereditary war chief from whom he got his name. Life before becoming Principal Chief The Arikara band was so named because of their close trading relationship with the Arikaras in the upper Missouri valley during the tribe's early recorded history. Because of their trading relationships with traders from the US, Spain, and the French, the Kiowa, and the Arikara in particular, were well known to European-Americans. Doh√§san was known to traders as early as the late 1820s. He gained a reputation as a fierce, but tricky, warrior and successful war chief. DOHASAN Handbook of Texas Online Doh√§san was a member of the elite warrior society, the Koitsenko.Greene 92 Although his position as Chief of the Arikara band was hereditary, the Principal Chief of the entire Kiowa people was not a hereditary position. The elders of all the bands met together and elected the Principal Chief, and he generally held that position the rest of his life. Doh√§san became principal chief of the Kiowas in the spring of 1833, after the tribe elders and sub-chiefs deposed then-Principal Chief A'date. This followed the massacre of A'date's village by Osages at Cutthroat Gap, near the head of Otter Creek in what became the Indian Territory of the Oklahomas. Doh√§san was the last undisputed Principal Chief of the Kiowa Tribe while they were a free people. After ascension to Principal Chieftainship After A‚Äôdate was deposed, and Doh√§san arose to become principal Chief of the entire Kiowa people, the United States Army became acquainted with Doh√§san. The massacre of an entire village of the Kiowa prompted the dragoon expedition of Colonel Henry Dodge to Western Oklahoma in the summer of 1834. Doh√§san was among those on hand to greet the colonel and his expedition. Artist George Catlin, who accompanied the expedition, sketched and painted Doh√§san 's portrait. The expedition found Doh√§san to be a friendly and calm in person under peaceful conditions. The purpose of the expedition was to end the ferocious fighting between the various Plains Tribes, and in May 1837 Doh√§san was one of the principals who signed the Fort Gibson Treaty, by which the United States government sought to end intertribal warfare in Indian Territory. Treaties did little to end the Kiowas' frequent raids for horses and other plunder, and it is arguable whether they even slowed the fighting between the tribes. Texas was basically wide open to joint Kiowa- Comanche raids, and the annual raids into Mexico became a dreaded part of life in both Mexico proper and its northern states. In his raids, Doh√§san and his tribesmen and allied Comanche came to live in the winter in the Staked Plains, especially along the Canadian River valley and Palo Duro Canyon, which served as a base for both wintering and the annual raids. At Palo Duro Canyon, on September 17, 1845, he was sketched by Lt. James W. Abert in his watercolor portfolio. In the summer of 1851 Doh√§san led a war party of the various Kiowa bands, and allied Comanches against the Pawnees near the head of Medicine Lodge Creek in Kansas, killing most of them. His name again rises in Army records in 1857 when he successfully led his warriors out of an ambush by Mexican soldiers at Hueco Tanks near El Paso Norte in Texas. The Mexicans had pursued the raiders north out of Mexico, and hoped to eliminate them. Instead, most of the Mexican troops were killed or wounded. The American Government was anxious to keep the Kiowa friendly as the Civil War beckoned, and in late 1859, as a goodwill gesture, Major John Sedgwick's troops gave Doh√§san an old army ambulance wagon along with the usual presents. When he was unable to master the art of driving a team, Doh√§san had a couple of Kiowa boys ride the harnessed horses as he sat in the driver's seat. In 1861, when federal authorities threatened to withhold annuity goods and send troops against the Kiowas if they did not cease their raiding, Doh√§san angrily and contemptuously called the \\"white chief\\" a fool with the \\"heart of a woman.\\" =First Battle of Adobe Walls= Other than the extraordinary length of his service as Principal Chief, and being the last Principal Chief of the free Kiowa, Doh√§san will be remembered in military history for commanding the Native American forces at the First Battle of Adobe Walls.Trosser, John (2004). . \\"Adobe Walls Texas\\" September 7, 2007. The first battle of Adobe Walls occurred on November 26, 1864, in the vicinity of Adobe Walls, the ruins of William Bent's abandoned adobe trading post and saloon near the Canadian River in Hutchinson County, Texas. The battle was one of the largest engagements in terms of numbers between European-Americans and Indians on the Great Plains, and the largest engagement ever between the Comanche and Kiowa and their allies, against the non-Natives. It came about because Gen. James H. Carleton, commander of the military district of New Mexico, decided to punish Comanche and Kiowa attacks on Santa Fe wagon trains. The Indians saw the wagon trains as trespassers who killed buffalo and other game the Indians needed to survive. Col. Christopher (Kit) Carson, was given command of the First Cavalry, New Mexico Volunteers, and told to proceed and campaign against the winter campgrounds of the Comanches and Kiowas. This was the second invasion of the heart of the Comancheria, after the Antelope Hills Expedition. The campgrounds in question were reported to be somewhere on the south side of the Canadian River. On November 10, 1864 Carson started from Fort Bascom with 335 cavalry, and 75 Ute and Jicarilla Apache scouts. Those Carson had recruited from Lucien Maxwell's ranch near Cimarron, New Mexico. On November 12, 1864, Carson‚Äôs force, supplied with two mountain howitzers under the command of Lt. George H. Pettis, twenty-seven wagons, an ambulance, and forty-five days' rations, proceeded down the Canadian River into the Texas Panhandle. Carson had decided to march first to Adobe Walls, which he was familiar with from his employment there by Bent over 20 years earlier. Inclement weather, including an early snow storm, caused slow progress, and on November 25, 1864, the First Cavalry reached Mule Springs, in Moore County, approximately west of Adobe Walls. Scouts reported the presence of a large Indian encampment at Adobe Walls, and Carson ordered his cavalry forward, to be followed by the wagons and howitzers. Approximately two hours after daybreak on November 26, 1864, Carson's cavalry attacked a Kiowa village of 150 lodges. The Chief, Doh√§san, and his people fled, passing the alarm to allied Comanche villages nearby. Marching forward to Adobe Walls, Carson dug in there about 10 AM, using one corner of the ruins for a hospital. Carson discovered to his dismay that there were numerous villages in the area, including one very large Comanche village. The total number of Indians opposing Carson are often estimated at 3,000, but it is unlikely that the total manpower of the Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa- Apache amounted to more than one-half that number.Kavanagh, Thomas W. The Comanches Lincoln: U of NE Press, 1999, pp. 472-473. In 1869, five years later, the total population of the three tribes was estimated to be 6,565 of which less than one-fourth would be adult males. Whatever their numbers, Carson saw he was outnumbered by the warriors pouring forward to engage him in battle, a much greater force than he had expected.The Comanches: Lords of the Southern Plains. University of Oklahoma Press. 1952. Doh√§san, assisted by Satank (Sitting Bear), Guipago (Lone Wolf) and Satanta (White Bear), led the Kiowas in the first attack. Fierce fighting developed as the Kiowa, Kiowa Apache, and Comanche warriors repeatedly attacked Carson's position. Reportedly, Satanta replied to Carson's bugler with his own bugle calls. Carson succeeded in repelling the attacks only through his clever use of supporting fire from the twin howitzers. After six to eight hours of fairly continuous fighting, Carson realized he was beginning to run low on shells for the howitzers, and ammunition in general, and ordered his forces to withdraw. The angry Indians tried to block his retreat by setting fire to the grass and brush down near the river. The wily Carson, however, set back-fires and retreated to higher ground, where the twin howitzers continued to hold off the Indians. When twilight came, Carson ordered a group of his scouts to burn the lodges of the first village, which also resulted in the death of the Kiowa- Apache chief, Iron Shirt, when he refused to leave his tepee.. \\"Adobe Walls Texas\\" September 7, 2007. Despite the fact that Carson was forced to retreat in the face of much more opposition than he had expected, the United States Army declared the First Battle of Adobe Walls a victory. Carson was probably outnumbered 10-1, and his clever use of backfires and the howitzers prevented his being overrun. As it was, Carson lost 6 dead, 25 wounded, to approximately 50-60 killed among the Indians. Nothing could obscure the fact however that the Kiowa and their allies had driven the American army from the field. Doh√§san, probably in his 70s, had commanded the largest force of Plains Indians ever massed against the army, and compelled a force armed with howitzers to retreat and yield the day. Little Arkansas Treaty and death In October 1865 Doh√§san signed the Little Arkansas Treaty, but he vigorously protested confinement to a reservation, declaring that the Kiowas owned all the land from the North Platte River to the upper Texas Panhandle and needed room to roam about. Shortly afterward, in early 1866, he died. Beginning of the reservation era As noted earlier, though the chief position in the Kata or Arikara band of the Kiowa Indians was hereditary, it was not necessarily given from father to son, and in this case, it was not. Doh√§san's sister's son, Agiati or \\"Gathering Feathers\\" inherited his name in 1864.Greene, 31 The younger Doh√§san took part in the remaining battles as the Kiowa struggled to remain a free people. But time was running out, and he was part of the delegation to Washington in 1872, which appealed to the government to allow the Kiowa to remain free. Afterward, as the remaining Kiowa went to the reservation, the younger Doh√§san lived with his family in peace on the reservation near Fort Sill until his death. Artist and calendar keeper Doh√§san was the primary calendar keeper among the Kiowa throughout most of the 19th century.Greene, 25 He added many innovations to Kiowa pictorial art. In his winter count, he added an image for each year's summer Sun Dance. To painted tipi designs, Doh√§san introduced images of counting coup. When he died, his nephew Agiati became a calendar keeper, followed in turn by Agiati's son, Silver Horn (1860‚Äì1940), one of the most prolific of all Kiowa artists. Doh√§sen's original calendar is in the collection of the Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley.Greene and Thornton, 300 In 1892 the young Doh√§san gave his annual family calendar history, begun by his uncle, the last great principal chief of the Kiowa, to Capt. Hugh L. Scott, who in turn donated it to the Smithsonian Institution. Dohasan's descendants included his granddaughter, Betty Nixon, who co-founded the Mid-America All-Indian Center in Wichita, Kansas, in 1976.

A total of 33 Turkish construction/contracting companies were listed for the Top 250 International Contractors List prepared by the Engineering News-Record in 2009.http://www.enr.com/toplists/2015_Top_250_International_Contractors1 Turkish contracting in the international market During the periods in which investments slowed down in the public and private sectors, foreign contracting services gained importance. The shrinking of the economy in Turkey and the bottleneck in the construction sector resulting from it, has forced construction companies to concentrate more on business abroad. The opening of the Turkish contractors to foreign markets started at the beginning of the 1970s. The first country to which Turkish contractors exported their services was Libya, where they started their projects by importing the necessary technology from European countries.The Turkish Contractors Association Later on, the growing Turkish contracting services expanded to other foreign markets such as Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and Iran. Particularly during the 1970s, 90% of the expatriate works undertaken were realized in Arab countries. Since the beginning of the 1980s, the Turkish Contractors have oriented themselves more towards the former Soviet Union countries. In the 1990s, due to the economic depression and the political uncertainties in the Middle Eastern and North African countries, the Turkish Contractors have focused predominantly on the Commonwealth of Independent States, Eastern Europe and Asian countries. In this framework, they have undertaken important projects in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, the Caucasus, the Central Asian Republics, Germany, Pakistan and the Far East. The total volume of work undertaken by Turkish Contractors has reached 110 billion US Dollars. The Turkish Contractors Association (TCA) has currently 139 members from Turkeys main contracting companies. 90% of the members of TCA is composed of engineers and architects. These are responsible for the realisation of 70% of domestic construction works and 80% of over 4200 projects undertaken in 69 countries. Timeline The works of Turkish contractors can be evaluated over three decades plus the period between 2000-2005. 1972 - 1979 Most of the works undertaken during this period were in North Africa and especially in Libya (72.54%) and later on, in Saudi Arabia (15.44%), Iraq (7.25%), Kuwait (4.71%), Greece (0.06%) and Iran (0.01%). The most important field of activity in this period was housing (32.14%), followed by harbours (18.11%), road/ bridge/ tunnel works (11.67%) and urban infrastructure projects (8.19%). 1980 - 1989 Most of the works undertaken during the second decade were realized in Libya again, despite a relative decrease in proportion (55.05%). Saudi Arabia (24.38%) and Iraq (11.16%) were ranking respectively second and third thus maintaining the position they had occupied during the first decade. The emergence of the former Soviet Union was a new development that occurred during this period (3.50%). Other countries in which Turkish contractors started working were Jordan, Yemen, Iran, the USA, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. During this period, housing activities (38.90%) and urban infrastructure projects (17.52%) increased and were followed by road/ bridge/ tunnel (6.69%) and agricultural projects (6.33%). 1990-1999 In the third decade, the trend changed completely. While the share of the Russian Federation increased to (36.19%), Libya's share decreased drastically to (11.19%). Libya was followed by Pakistan (6.92%) and Turkmenistan (6.67%). The works undertaken in the former Soviet Union countries, together, amounted to 61%. The differentiation of the countries in which new projects were undertaken was a novel development characteristic of this decade. Pakistan (6.92%), Turkmenistan (6.67%), Kazakhstan (6.55%), Uzbekistan (4.29%), Bulgaria (2.79%), the USA (2.69%), Azerbaijan (2.30%) and Croatia (1.86%) emerged as new markets. Other important developments were the considerable decrease in the proportion of works in Saudi Arabia (3.44%) and disappearance of Iraq from the scene. The ‚Äúother‚Äù category comprised 33 countries with a proportion of 8%. Despite a decrease in the proportion of housing works (23.89%), it remained the first ranking activity. However, this did not mean a decrease in housing works in terms of value. The value of the housing projects undertaken during this period was also high. Housing was followed by road/ bridge/ tunnel works (12.84%), industrial facilities (9.65%) and commercial centers (8.13%). The highest proportion of the projects undertaken during this period was in the Russian Federation and the other former Soviet Union countries. 2000 - 2007 The period after the year 2000 is a period where markets showed even more differentiation and where there was specialization in certain types of projects. The number of countries, in which Turkish contractors worked, increased considerably and that caused the percentage of work in each country to decrease relatively. Nevertheless, the Russian Federation maintained the first rank (14.66%) and was followed by Romania (11.46%) and Kazakhstan (9.55%).The interesting developments in this period are, apart from Romania, the emergence of the United Arab Emirates (7.75%), Afghanistan (5.34%), Ireland (4.66%), Qatar (3.33%), Algeria and Morocco as new markets. After the interventions that took place in Afghanistan and Iraq, the rebuilding activities in these countries were closely followed by TCA member companies, just as it was in the rest of the world. When the types of work undertaken during this period are considered, road/bridge/tunnel works occupy the first rank (24.47%), followed by industrial facilities (14.52%), airports (8.33%), social and cultural facilities (6.54%) and housing (6.08%). The total value of work undertaken amounted to 5.4 billion US Dollars in 2004,9.3 billion US Dollars in 2005, 15,9 billion US Dollars in 2006 and 19,5 billion US Dollars in 2007.

The Laurentian Upland (or Laurentian Highlands) is a physiographic region which, when referred to as the \\"Laurentian Region\\" or the Grenville geological province, is recognized by Natural Resources Canada as one of five provinces of the larger Canadian Shield physiographic division. The United States Geological Survey recognizes the Laurentian Upland as the larger general upland area of the Canadian Shield.Physiographic divisions of the conterminous U. SPhysiographic Regions Geography The Laurentian Region, as recognized by Natural Resources Canada, is part of the plateau and dissected southern rim of the Canadian Shield in the province of Qu√©bec. It is a western extension of the Laurentian Mountains, and continues across the Ottawa Valley into Ontario as the Opeongo Hills. Viewed from the valleys of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers, the south-facing escarpments of the Shield give the appearance of mountains 500‚Äì800 meters high; looking across the plateau, the relief is more moderate and subdued. These scarps mark the dramatic southern edge of this Upland region, of which Mont Raoul Blanchard is the highest peak. Although the other limits are less well defined, this Laurentian Region in Quebec may be considered to extend 100‚Äì200 km northward from the scarps and to stretch from the Gatineau River in the west (mean elevation 400 m) some 550 km to the Saguenay River in the northeast. Here it attains its maximum elevation north of Quebec City in the R√©serve faunique des Laurentides (over 1000 m). Individual summits rise above the plateau surface: Mont Sir Wilfrid (783 m) and Mont Tremblant in the west, Mont Sainte-Anne (815 m) at Quebec, Mont Raoul Blanchard (1166 m), Mont Bleu (1052 m) and Mont des Conscrits (1006 m) in R√©serve faunique des Laurentides. Cap Tourmente (579 m) and Mont des √âboulements (770 m) are dramatic examples of the scarp face as it drops precipitously to the St Lawrence River. The more general Laurentian Upland Province may be considered to extend over a larger area of the Canadian Shield, into Northwestern Ontario and parts of Northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York State, and is recognized by the United States Geological Survey to include the Superior Upland. As a southern extension of the Canadian Shield, the Adirondack Mountains of New York State might also be considered and extension of the Laurentian Upland.Erwin Raisz, Physiographical Map of North America, in Espenshade, Edward B., Jr., and Joel L. Morrison, editors. Goode's World Atlas, 17th ed. Chicago: Rand McNally & Co. 1986. Geology The Laurentian Upland is primarily made up of ancient Precambrian igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock. With the exception of the river valleys and lacustrine basins, it is a rolling to mountainous peneplain that ranges from 800 to 1400 feet above sea level.  Superior Upland  Physiographic area map of the interior United States. The Superior Upland is identified by \\"1\\" on the map. Brockway Mountains of the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan (Precambrian of the Keweenian Series) The Superior Upland is the province of the Laurentian Upland which projects into the United States west and south of Lake Superior. This upland, part of the Canadian Shield along with the Adirondacks, is a greatly deformed structure and is composed primarily of igneous and metamorphic crystalline rocks commonly associated with a rugged landscape. At some prehistoric period, this had a strong relief, but today the upland as a whole is gently rolling with the inter-streams surfaces being plateau-like in their evenness. Here they have elevations of 1,400 to in their higher areas, such as the Misquah Hills and Huron Mountains.U.S. Geological Survey. (various quadrangles) [maps]. 1:50,000. Washington D.C.: USGS, 1971 In this province, we find a part of those ancient mountains regions that were initiated by crustal deformation and then reduced by a long continued erosion to a peneplain of modern relief. A peneplain with the occasional moderately high monadnocks left behind during the peneplanation of the rest of the surface. The erosion of the region must have been far advanced in prehistoric times, even practically completed, because the even peneplain surface is overlapped by fossiliferous marine strata from an early geological date, Cambrian. This shows that the depression of the region beneath an ancient sea took place after a long existence as dry land.Ojakangas, Richard W.; Matsch, Charles L. (1982). Minnesota's Geology. University of Minnesota Press, 15. . The extent of the submergence and the area over which the Palaeozoic strata were deposited are unknown. Because of the renewed elevation without deformation, erosion in later periods has stripped off an undetermined amount of the covering strata. The valleys by which the uplands are here and there trenched to moderate depth appear to be, in part at least, the work of streams that have been superposed upon the peneplain through the now removed cover of stratified rocks. Glaciation has strongly scoured away the deeply weathered soils that presumably existed here in preglacial time. It left behind firm and rugged ledges in the low hills and swells of the ground and spread an irregular drift cover over the lower parts, whereby the drainage is generally disordered being deposited in lakes and swamps and elsewhere rushing down rocky rapids.

Their subsistence is based on horticulture, hunting and various fishing techniques. As of 2010 they numbered about 410 individuals.  History  The Teko constitute one of the six now-living ethnic groups of French Guiana already present before colonization. More nomadic than the other ethnic groups of the area, the Teko resided on different rivers in French Guiana during the colonial period, notably on the Approuague and, more recently, they settled within the surroundings of the Tampok and Maroni River near the border with Suriname, and the Camopi River near the border with Brazil. Their villages, usually located at a distance from the rivers for protection from raids, were moved frequently due to soil exhaustion, warfare, and several customary reasons, like the death of a chief. The Teko' first contact with the Europeans occurred in 1767 when an expedition lead by Patris, came across the tribe. The number of people was estimated at 350 to 400. They were in continuous warfare against the Galibi Amerindians who often raided their territory. By the 19th century internal and intertribal warfare had weakened the Teko to the point of being collective slaves to the Wayampi. The tribal warfare ended after the French government had threatened a military intervention. The fighting, along with the epidemics, greatly reduced their numbers. In 1849, Bagot estimated their numbers around 100 people. By the late 1960s, the Teko were in a poor state of health, however due to general health improvements and various demographic strategies, they have since grown to the number of approximately 400. In the 1960s, the French Government contacted all tribes to ask them whether they wanted French citizenship. The Wayampi, who did accept citizenship in 2000, and the Teko were the only tribes who decided against citizenship. During the same period, the French government tried to the concentrate the population in larger villages with limited success. The government installed male captains, based on the Maroon hierarchy, to head the villages, however being a matrilocality, the position was often inherited by the widow. In 2012, the Teko resisted the creation of the Guiana Amazonian Park as a restriction to their free movement. Lifestyle The Teko practice slash-and-burn agriculture and compliment the food supply with hunting, gathering and fishing. Many of the villagers live in wooden huts with palm leaves, however concrete houses are becoming more common. The tribe is matrilocal, i.e. the husband moves into the wife's village. In the 1960s polygamy was still being practised, but in decline. Marriages with other tribes and ethnic groups was on the rise.  Language  Emerillon is the eponymous term for their language which belongs to the Tup√≠- Guaran√≠ family. An identifying characteristic of the language is nasal harmony. The language is still being passed on to the children as the native language, however French, Portuguese and Wayamp√≠ are becoming secondary languages. The effect is mainly limited to borrowing of the lexicon of the European languages, however the language is considered endangered.

The two try introducing Aorta to other women, but none can match up to Glorice because, as Aorta says, \\"She's got balls\\". The Mafia Don even thanks George with a kiss, and George panics, thinking he's received the ominous \\"Kiss of Death\\". But his fear is unfounded as Aorta promotes George to consigliere and throws him a party with a cake made by Mickey the Baker. As the assistant and new friend to the boss, George is forced to drive the two on a date which ends with Aorta on the receiving end of Glorice's oral talents. Aorta announces his engagement to Glorice with George to be best man, and the beautiful moll reveals to George her plan of blackmail. So George decides to hire hitman Briles, an expert assassin. But he fails when Glorice recognizes the hitman as a long-lost uncle, and the hitman is unwilling to kill a nephew in a dress. George, dejected, walks the streets when he's suddenly tackled by a draft detective. George proves his undraftable 4-F status by showing his flat feet. Discovering Glorice in the draft detective's wanted file, George turns Glorice in to the Navy. When Glorice doesn't turn up at the wedding, Aorta cries on George's shoulder, believing Glorice left him at the altar. George and Dip celebrate. That is, until Glorice returns from the Navy with some sailors who beat George up. Glorice finds Aorta and convinces him to have a quick wedding. A bruised George drives to the church, deciding to take matters into his own hands. He intercepts Glorice in the women's room and shoves the gun into the back of her head. But he doesn't kill her. Instead, the two start kissing, completely in love. Aorta walks in and threatens to kill George for stealing his fianc√©. To save George, Glorice reveals \\"her\\" tool, shocking Aorta, who dies of a heart attack. At Aorta's funeral, it becomes clear that George is now the new Don, Glorice his \\"Mob Queen\\".

His roles included frontline policing, shield unit, advanced police response driving and Criminal Investigation Department for 14 years. For six years he worked on the robbery squad covering North London.  Career  During his career Brennan was assaulted on multiple occasions and decided he did not want any colleague to go through the types of assault and consequences that he had. He therefore launched a campaign group called \\"Protect the Protectors\\", calling for better protection for all frontline police officers. In doing so he held a press conference and was a regular contributor to all sections of the national media on police protection issues. He claims he was also regularly stopped by victims of crime and the public who were impressed with his views on law and order and urged him to speak up for them too . To this end he also set up Victims of Crime Trust registered as a charity in 1994, which gave a voice for victims of crime and specialised in helping families bereaved through murder or manslaughter. The trust failed to submit returns to the Charity Commission from 2005 onwards, and its registration was removed in 2010 on the grounds that it had \\"ceased to exist\\".Charity Commission Register: 1032867 - VICTIMS OF CRIME TRUST Brennan claims that his position allowed him to obtain support from frontline police officers, victims of crime and the public alike .

Reactions to his work  Some members of the Police Federation, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Home Office were critical of Brennan's outspoken positions. One Police Federation member was quoted as saying that Brennan \\"gives outrageous soundbites and simplistic solutions to complex issues. I don't think he represents the views of many officers.\\" Police Review described Brennan as probably being the best known face and voice in British policing and said that \\"Protect the Protectors\\" was the primary reason the government of the day reversed its policy on issuing police officers with a side-handled baton which had been originally refused. The Independent offered critical coverage questioning whether Brennan is a convenient \\"rent-a-mouth\\" for the media pointing out his propensity to comment on a wide array of unrelated policing matters ranging from asylum-seekers to prison gyms. The newspaper also noted that some in the police force viewed Brennan as \\"an unelected, unrepresentative, hardline reactionary.\\" References External links * Jason Bennetto, \\"Police anger over \`irritating' constable loved by the media\\", The Independent (London), 18 October 2003 * \\"The changing face of policing\\", BBC News, 26 April 2005 * Norman Brennan, \\"Crime is the terror we must tackle\\", Sunday Telegraph, 28 November 2004 * \\"Calls for jury law reforms\\", BBC News, 18 September 2002 * \\"Talking to Norman Brennan about his career as a Police Officer.\\", Sky News, 18 August 2019 * \\"‚ÄòInstead of condemning police, start supporting them,‚Äô Met Police Federation chairman tells MPs\\", Ian Collins, Talk radio, 12 August 2020 * \\"BBC 'facts don't care about your feelings' interview\\", BBC News, 30 July 2020 * \\"Dangers of policing the streets\\", BBC News, 11 June 2007 * \\"Protect the Protectors Campaign\\", Police Federation, November 2018 * Category:Metropolitan Police officers Category:Legal procedure Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Norman Brennan"},{"id":"14904854","text":"KNTS (1680 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Spanish language contemporary Christian format.

Directed by Felix E. Feist, the film served as a screen test for, and is the first significant screen appearance of, two adolescent actresses who soon became stars, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. Although only lightly reviewed at the time of its release, the film has garnered a generally positive reputation among Garland biographers.  Plot  Small town friends Edna (Deanna Durbin) and Judy (Judy Garland) are upset. Edna's grandfather and his orchestra, who play free Sunday concerts at a local park, have been fired by the town council because the concerts are poorly attended. The girls hit upon the idea of singing at the concerts and set about promoting the next concert. The following Sunday Edna and Judy join Granddad on the bandstand. Edna's operatic style and Judy's swing bring crowds running from all over the park. The event is a huge success and Granddad's concerts are saved.  Production  Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland were both under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer but the studio had not put them to work in films. With their contracts coming up for renewal, feelings among studio executives were that the studio didn't need two girl singers. Every Sunday would serve as an extended screen test to decide which girl's contract would be renewed. Durbin recorded the aria Il Bacio for the film. Composers Con Conrad and Herb Magidson wrote a specialty number for Garland, \\"The Americana.\\" Following the screening of the short for MGM executives, opinion was divided on whether Garland or Durbin should be retained. Finally, Louis B. Mayer, upon his return from a European trip, decreed that both girls should be kept. However, Durbin's contract option had expired by then. She was signed by Universal Studios, where her first picture, Three Smart Girls (1936), was so successful that it saved Universal from bankruptcy.  Critical reception  As a short film that served as a programmer, Every Sunday received scant critical attention upon its release. Durbin's hometown newspaper, the Winnipeg Free Press, did praise the film, lamenting that it was \\"all too short\\" and citing Garland as a \\"girl singer of distinction.\\" Garland biographers, when discussing the film in any detail, are generally complimentary both to the film and to Garland. \\"Unpretentious and fascinating...Every Sunday gives us a marvelous glimpse of Judy's talent in an unrefined state\\" is a typical comment, with the film \\"reveal[ing] how accomplished a performer Judy Garland already was at fourteen.\\" Durbin does not fare quite as well. Although described by one biographer as appearing \\"relaxed\\" and \\"happy\\" on film others dismiss her \\"diffidence\\" and call her \\"stiff.\\"  Notes   References   * *  External links  * * The Judy Room Every Sunday\\" page Category:1936 musical films Category:1936 films Category:Films directed by Felix E.

Release data The album was released as an LP in 1989 by AIP Records (as #AIP-10047) and as a CD in 1996 (as #AIP-CD-1047). Vinyl-Only tracks and CD bonus tracks The English Freakbeat LPs and CDs have most tracks in common, although not always in the same order, and some of the LP tracks were not included on the CDs. Also, the CD bonus tracks are not always at the end of the album. Thus, for clarity, we have shown tracks for both editions of the album, with vinyl-only tracks and CD bonus tracks indicated. Notes on the tracks The following information is taken mostly from the CD liner notes. Glenn Athens & the Trojans ‚Äì the leader is also known as Glen Athens ‚Äì were from Surrey and won the local Beat Trophy in 1964; they were named by Mirabel Magazine as the top \\"semi-pro\\" band for two straight years. This track is taken from a 1965 EP on Spot Records. The song by The Sessions was written by Miki Dallon (who was featured as a solo artist on English Freakbeat, Volume 1) and was evidently released only in America. The original incarnation of Mickey Finn as Mickey Finn & the Blue Men in 1964-65 (see English Freakbeat, Volume 4) included a young Jimmy Page. Both sides of their final single are included, from late 1967. The Kubas/the Koobas had early connections with the Beatles; they had not only toured with the legendary band but were also managed by Brian Epstein. Also, they made an appearance in the film Ferry Cross the Mersey. These two previously un-reissued tracks are from the flip side of their first single as the Kubas and from a later release as the Koobas. \\"Messin' with the Man\\" by the Beat Merchants is the \\"B\\" side of their first single; the \\"A\\" side is on English Freakbeat, Volume 1. Their second single, \\"So Fine\\" was paired with a song by Freddie and the Dreamers in its American issue. Reportedly, the Wolf Pack is actually the Animals recording under a pseudonym for a soundtrack album called The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood. Released on ABC-Paramount Records, the song may only have been issued in the U.S. Members of The Syndicats include Steve Howe ‚Äì a future member of Tomorrow and then Yes ‚Äì who was the lead guitarist for this track. Their classic \\"Crawdaddy Simone\\" can be found on English Freakbeat, Volume 4. At one time, the Soul Agents reputedly included Rod Stewart and John Anthony, who later managed Genesis and other bands. Also, three members of this band later joined the Loot, who are featured on English Freakbeat, Volume 1. These two tracks are from their rare third single. The history of the Irish band the Wheels ‚Äì rivals of Van Morrison's early band Them ‚Äì is recounted in the original liner notes of the landmark Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968, but only in regard to their connections with the Shadows of Knight, who covered several of their songs. \\"Don't You Know\\" is the \\"B\\" side of their version of Gloria ‚Äì the band claimed that Morrison wrote it for them! ‚Äì while \\"Road Block\\" is from the flip side of the second single. Another song by the Wheels can be found on English Freakbeat, Volume 4. The estimable Joe Meek produced both singles by the Blueberries; \\"Little Baby\\" is their first release. Jimmy Page is rumored to have played on this session, but this is denied by the band; their own guitarist Mike Stubbs later joined the Syndicats. The curious \\"7 Pounds of Potatoes\\" ‚Äì which \\"come between me and my love\\", claim the lyrics ‚Äì is a surprising number from the Dakotas. Although best known for backing Billy J. Kramer (see English Freakbeat, Volume 5) on several more pop-oriented recordings in the British Invasion era, the Dakotas made several hit records in their own right, notably \\"Cruel Sea\\" from 1963, which was renamed \\"Cruel Surf\\" for its U.S. release and was later covered by the Ventures. The Limeys released six typical Mersey-oriented singles over the 1964 to 1966 period; \\"Cara-Lin\\", originally recorded by the Strangeloves is from their final single. The Lancasters is one of several English artists that were \\"discovered\\" by Kim Fowley in the 1963-1965 period. This is yet another track in the English Freakbeat series that was released only in the U.S., in December 1964. Among the bandmembers are Ritchie Blackmore, one of the co- founders of Deep Purple. \\"Satan's Holiday\\" is actually the venerable \\"Hall of the Mountain King\\".

Born in Gresten, he received his classical education in Linz, Upper Austria being his family's home region. In 1862 he became a novice among the Austin Canons in Sankt Florian. After completing his theological studies there, he was ordained priest in 1867. As Alfred Ritter von Arneth relates in his memoirs, historical studies had been successfully cultivated at St. Florian's since Provost Arneth's time, and M√ºhlbacher was soon active in this domain. Among his writings are articles on St. Florian's Gerhoh von Reichersberg, and the literary productions of St. Florian's. In 1872 he was studying history under Julius von Ficker in Innsbruck, where after two years he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. He then hastened to Vienna to finish his historical training under Theodor von Sickel's guidance. When Ficker entrusted the youthful scholar with the revision of the Carolingian period of B√∂hmer's \\"Regesta\\", he was directing him to a domain in which he was to do much work. In 1878 he was formally received as academical lecturer into the philosophical faculty of the University of Innsbruck, and between 1880 and 1889 published his edition of the imperial \\"Regesta\\" of the Carolingian period. As Oswald Redlich says, \\"the technique of compiling regesta received exemplary development at M√ºhlbacher's hands, and his work served as a model for the entire new edition of the imperial Regesta\\". In 1892 M√ºhlbacher was entrusted with the editing of the Carolingian charters for the Monumenta Germani√¶ Historica. At the same time it became necessary to bring out a new edition of his Carolingian \\"Regesta\\". The two works proved of mutual assistance. He was able to see only the first part of each work through the press, but left considerable material for the use of his successors. No other German scholar was so well qualified to write the Deutsche Geschichte unter den Karolingern, which appeared in 1896. After 1879 M√ºhlbacher edited the Mitteilungen des Instituts f√ºr √∂sterreichische Geschichtsforschung (Publications of the Institute for Austrian Historical Research). In 1881 he was appointed extraordinary, and in 1896 ordinary professor at Vienna. In 1895 Ficker turned over to him the management of the Regesta Imperii. He took in hand the arrangement of the Austrian State Archives, and the preparation of the more recent history of Austria. He was chosen an active member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna. When M√ºhlbacher died in Vienna at age 59 of pneumonia, he left the almost completed manuscript of his edition of the charters of Pepin the Short, Carloman I and Charlemagne. This volume was published posthumously in 1906 (Die Urkunden Pippins, Karlmanns und Karls des Gro√üen, MGH Diplomata Karolinorum I, book in digital form) and is the authoritative edition of the charters of these three kings until today.

Life and career Thomas Murray studied organ with Clarence Mader at Occidental College. He studied choral conducting as well, and graduated with his B.A. from that university in 1965. The next year, he won the National Competition of the American Guild of Organists. From 1966-1973, he was organist at Immanuel Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, and from 1975-1980 he was choirmaster and organist of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Boston. In 1981, he joined the music faculty at Yale University, becoming university organist in 1990. He retired from that position at the end of Yale's 2018‚Äì19 academic year.

In the United States, he has appeared as a soloist with the Pittsburgh, Houston, Milwaukee and Portland Symphonies and with the National Chamber Orchestra in Washington, D.C. He has also performed in most European countries, South America, Australia and Japan, and was featured as a soloist with the Moscow Chamber Orchestra at the Lahti Festival in Finland.http://pipeorgancds.com/thomasmurray.html Thomas Murray is best known for his performances of Romantic organ works and transcriptions of works originally written for other instruments. He is especially knowledgeable about the organ music of Elgar, Mendelssohn, Franck, and Saint-Sa√´ns, and his recordings of organ works by Mendelssohn and Elgar are regarded as authoritative. He has also frequently performed works by Johann Sebastian Bach,http://www.rccotoronto.ca/index11TM.html though his interpretation of Classical and Baroque music reflects just as much an idiosyncratic and individual approach as a historically-informed one. As university organist at Yale, he has access to the famed Skinner organ in Woolsey Hall, one of the largest and most important Romantic instruments in the US, and has made numerous recordings on this instrument. Additionally, he has recorded numerous organs by the Hook firm, one of the most prominent organ-building companies in American during the 19th century.

Mixing and matching is the unavoidable process in the making of inner connections and the presentations of interculturalities. The majority of the works in intercultural theatre deal basically with thinking and doing around the themes, stories, pre-performative or performative concepts of Asian classical theatre or traditional performing arts forms and practices, mixing and matching the concepts or the ideas of the foreign.\\"Theatre world performance politics culture\\" After the well-known success of Peter Brook's production of the Mahabharata,\\"Metamorphoses\\" the trend has been evolving tremendously around the globe and many the cultural institutions of many governments have become directly interested in pushing the boundaries of intercultural senses and sensitivities by financially investing on new theatrical productions, university research, conferences and fellowships\\"SUSI Grants\\"  Three major groups  =Imitational theatre= The intended audience is from the same culture, or a foreign audience from a different culture and the theater group, or the actors or performers, come from the same cultural background or from very diverse foreign cultural backgrounds. The production may imitate foreign styles, the production procedures may introduce new techniques, a new style of acting or a new style of presentation for a group of actors from various cultures or the same culture, the production may include foreign languages, costumes, scenic themes and other aspects. There are many examples of intercultural theatre groups, people, and institutions who are experimenting with various levels of mixing and matching of traditional or contemporary aspects of theatre training and presentations in this type of Imitational Theatre. After the global acceptance of renowned theatre director Peter Brook, many theatre directors went after Asian traditional theatre art forms and other Asian representational systems, in order to develop and portray their own theatre presentations using, or somehow capitalizing on the actor training systems and scenic representations belonging to those particular Asian theatres, such as the Noh theatre, Kathakali, Chinese opera etcetera. While Peter Brook was successful in his approach to a universally accepted vision of theatre-making through the Asian theatre systems --beyond the parameters of imitating different theatrical topics-- many other younger institutions or directorial approaches are kept within the parameters of imitations or comparisons, or only exchanges of physical exercises. =Adaptive theatre= There are two types of intercultural theatre within adapted theatre. One can consider \\"the norm\\" to represent what the audience of a certain culture expects/has typically been exposed to: * Adapts to the norm ‚Äì traditional style productions that have been consciously adapted to fit with the cultural expectations of the intended audience of another culture. * Adapts away from the norm ‚Äì the original culture dominates but it borrows foreign elements to enlarge the range of expression (e.g. TheatreWorks (Singapore) and Ong Keng Sen; International Centre for Theatre Research and Peter Brook; and The Bridge ‚Äì Stage of the Arts) =Universal theatre= The aim of universal theatre is to be recognized and accepted by audience members from a wide range of cultural backgrounds (e.g. The Mahabharata, Peter Brook, Hiroshi Koike Bridge Project- The Mahabharata,\\"Performing Arts Institute\\" Bari Hochwald The Global Theatre Project,\\"The Global Theatre Project\\" The World Theatre Project, People's Theatre Project etc.) Sub-divisions Globalization supported in the developments of intercultural theatre in various directions and evolutions of point of views by the theatre practitioners, scholars, funders and producers(British Council, Fulbright, Ford foundation, The Rockefeller foundation) particularly using English language as the main medium of communication for knowing, acknowledging, debating, reasoning, considering, teaching, learning, writing, speaking, adapting, translating or transforming the one culture to the other culture in large contexts and in detailed micro contexts. Primarily the discourses of intercultural theatre practice developed out of the re-source influences of western theatre arts, western theoreticians and western theatre practitioners. (e.g. Eugenio Barba, Jerzy Grotowski, Thomas Richards, Peter Brook, Robert Wilson,Phillip Zarilli) =American intercultural theatre= *For many theatre cultures, American intercultural theatre has given the possibilities of new exchanges, experiments, researches and pioneer introductions of model attempts in theatre making. There are many directors, teachers or theatre artists began working with the sources of American point of views in the intercultural attempts and some of them are Richard Schechner, Phillip Zarilli, Robert Wilson,Christian DuComb Phd, Prof. Esther Kim Lee, Ellen Stewart-La MaMa, Lee Breuer-Mabou Mines, Hugh Gittens, Anne Bogart, Phillip Glass etc. =Australian intercultural theatre= =British intercultural theatre= =Canadian intercultural theatre= Non-Native English language speaking countries intercultural theatre *English is the primary medium of communication in the intercultural theatre scene worldwide and American English or British English used as the mother source language to make all transactions related with theatre training, teaching and performing.

The culture is also part of business in the sense of in- coming and out-going, travelling or transforming stories, experiences, music, histories and philosophies.

The grounds and park are listed, Grade II, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. The site was a house of rest for the monks of St Augustine's Abbey, which became Bristol Cathedral. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was granted to Sir George Norton who built an Elizabethan mansion. One of his descendants gave sanctuary to Charles II during his escape to France in 1651. The original house was demolished and rebuilt in the Regency period by Philip John Miles and became the seat of the Miles baronets. The mansion housed a collection of over a hundred paintings representing many Old Masters. In common with many country houses after the First World War, it entered a period of institutional use in 1919 under Rev Harold Nelson Burden (1859-1930) as a psychiatric hospital but was subsequently restored. The estate now offers office accommodation, conference and meeting rooms, and the house has a licence as a venue for civil wedding services. The Palladian house has a Greek Revival interior which has largely survived the various uses of the building. The grounds were originally landscaped by Humphrey Repton, part of which is now within the Leigh Woods National Nature Reserve. An organic farm has also been established based on the walled garden. History =Original building= The manor of Leigh at the time of the Norman Conquest belonged to the lordship of Bedminster but William the Conqueror awarded it to the Bishop of Coutances. The manor house was given in 1118 by Robert Fitzharding to become a house of rest for the abbot and monks of St Augustine's Abbey, which became Bristol Cathedral. As \\"Abbot's Leigh\\" it was distinguished from other places named \\"Leigh\\". At the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Paul Bush, the Bishop of Bristol, surrendered it by a deed dated 25 May 1549 to Henry VIII; on 23 September the King granted the reversion of the manor, after the death of the bishop (which took place in 1559), to Sir George Norton (d. 1585). The original Leigh Court was an Elizabethan mansion built by Sir George Norton. His great-great-grandson, also George Norton (born 1622), unknowingly hosted Charles II, who arrived at the house the evening of 12 September 1651, during his escape to France following the Battle of Worcester. The Nortons were friends of the Kings's travelling companion, Jane Lane. The Nortons were unaware of the King's identity during his three-day stay. While staying at Leigh Court and after being recognised by the elderly butler, who had served the King when a young Prince at Richmond, Charles deflected suspicion by asking a trooper, who had been in the King's personal guard, to describe the King's appearance and clothing at the Battle of Worcester. The man looked at Charles and said, \\"The King was at least three inches taller than you.\\"Count Grammont.

The Boscobel Tracts: Relating to the Escape of Charles the Second After the Battle of Worcester and his subsequent adventures, William Blackwood and Sons. p.166 Richard Ollard describes the house in The Escape of Charles II, After the Battle of Worcester: > \\"Abbots Leigh was the most magnificent of all the houses in which Charles > was sheltered during his escape. A drawing made in 1788, only twenty years > before it was pulled down, shows a main front of twelve gables, surmounting > three storeys of cowled windows; a comfortable, solid west country > Elizabethan house.\\" After the Restoration, the King made George Norton a Knight; his widow set up an elaborate monument to him in the church at Abbot's Leigh. The manor of Abbot's Leigh eventually passed into the hands of the Trenchard family after Sir George Norton's son, also Sir George (1648‚Äì1715), and his daughter Grace (1676‚Äì1697) both died without issue. William Trenchard of Cutteridge, Wiltshire, had married Ellen Norton, sister and coheir of Sir George. The direct Trenchard line died out on the death of John William Hippisley Trenchard (1740‚Äì1801) and the estate and the old Tudor manor, now in a state of disrepair, was sold in 1811 to Philip John Miles (1773‚Äì1845), the mayor and member of parliament for Bristol. Miles also owned properties and extensive estates elsewhere including Kings Weston House (by Sir John Vanbrugh), The Manor House (Old Rectory) at Walton-in-Gordano, Walton Castle, Cardigan Priory and Underdown by Anthony Keck in Ledbury, Herefordshire. =Rebuilding= The Drawing Room, Leigh Court, Bristol, c.1840. Oil on canvas by Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham Miles demolished the original building around 1812 and in 1814 rebuilt the seat a quarter of a mile further north-east, to designs by Thomas Hopper, that were based on plans which Hopper had previously drawn for Pythouse, Wiltshire. Philip Miles died in 1845, leaving Leigh Court to his eldest son, William Miles, for whom the Miles Baronetcy of Leigh Court, Somerset was created in 1859. In 1884 the second Baronet, Sir Sir Philip Miles, entertained the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII. Miles purchased the art collection of Richard Hart Davis and others. The mansion eventually housed a collection of over a hundred paintings representing many Old Masters ‚Äì Domenichino (including the St John the Evangelist sold in 2009 for ¬£9.2 million), Titian, Poussin, Michelangelo, Raphael, Rubens, Claude Lorrain (including the Altieri Claudes) and Van Dyke, as well as numerous family portraits, however the majority of the more famous paintings were sold between 1884 and 1898. In the middle of the 19th century it was possible to visit the house to view the art collection on Thursday afternoons upon application to the Miles family's business offices at 61 Queen Square, Bristol (formerly the house of Philip John Miles's father, William Miles). =Hospital= The Miles family continued to occupy the house until 1917 when, in common with many such houses, it had become oversized for modern living; with death duties to pay, it was put up for auction, however the house and were withdrawn from the sale. They were then used by Rev Harold Nelson Burden, during a period of institutional use as a hospital. Burden had been the chaplain at Horfield Prison, and with his wife Katharine had founded the National Institutions for Persons Requiring Care and Control to care for mentally disabled children and adults. In 1908 they rented the Stoke Park estate, opening the Stoke Park Colony in April 1909. The colony was the first institution certified as a home for mentally disabled patients under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913, Burden having been a member of the Royal Commission for inquiry into care of the feeble-minded that lead to the Act. The colony was regarded as a leading institution of its type. Leigh Court continued to operate as part of the Stoke Park Hospital group until taken over by the National Health Service in 1948 but was subsequently restored. During the 1980s, Leigh Woods (surrounding the house) were used to film the TV series, Robin of Sherwood starring Michael Praed (later Jason Connery). =Current use= Since 2000 Leigh Court has been restored and many rooms and outbuildings have been converted for use as office accommodation, conference and meeting rooms. It is also approved by North Somerset council as a venue for civil wedding services. Business West (formerly the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative) also have their head offices at the house. Architecture Externally the architectural style of Leigh Court is Palladian. The house, built of Bath stone, has a hipped slate roof with a glazed and coffered area over its Great Hall. The appearance of the south-east and north-west elevations mirror each other. Each has three central bays, These project slightly from the rest of the frontage. The porticoes have of four, unfluted Ionic columns, above which are pediments on the plain entablature. Ionic columns can also be found on the seven bay north- east elevation. There are two-storey service wings attached to the main house. The interior is decorated in Greek Revival. style. Immediately inside the entrance is a hall laid with a stone and marble patterned floor. The ceiling has a saucer dome supported by eight marble Ionic columns in a circle. In addition it contains decorative anthemion friezes and a stone and marble patterned floor. The morning room in the east corner is in a late 19th century Adam/Wyatt style. The mansion is entered from the south-east front through an Entrance Hall measuring about square, around which four pairs of massive marble pillars with Ionic capitals giving the impression of a circular room. This leads to the Great hall by and high extending to the glazed and coffered roof; the Hall is surrounded by galleries on the first floor which are supported by marble pillars with Ionic capitals. This in turn leads on to the Salon which is the same size as the Entrance Hall. To the right of the Great Hall is the Library which is by and was fitted with bookcases on three sides to the full height of the room and has two mauve marble fireplaces and deep coved friezes and cornicing. The ceiling, high, is of a bold, coffered geometrical design. The Library leads, to its right, to the Morning Room, about by and to its left to the Drawing Room of the same size as the Morning Room, decorated with gilt and tapestries and with views extending across the Severn to the Welsh hills. To the left of the Salon is the Dining room, of the same size as the Morning Room. Also to the left of the Great Hall are a Billiard room, Smoking room (now used as a bar when the house hosts receptions), Gun Room and WCs. The Great Hall which has a double staircase still contains an original pipe organ built by Flight and Robson of London. In addition to being played manually, it could originally be set to play the overture and a duet (\\"Ah, Perdona\\") from Mozart's Clemenza di Tito.

Grounds The grounds were originally landscaped by Humphrey Repton. At the turn of the 19th century a walled garden was built to provide food for the estate. Sections of the extensive estate have been sold off since 1952. In 1974 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food bought the woodland associated with the house and this is now Leigh Woods National Nature Reserve and includes the area known as Paradise Bottom. The current estate covers including lawns, woodland, flower gardens and a pond. Some of the trees on the site were lost during the Great Storm of 1987. A not-for- profit organic farm has been established based on the walled garden, and buildings within the old estate are used by a charity providing mental health services and by the Macmillan Lymphedema Service.

The Palikur Nation, or naon√©, is Arawak-speaking and socially organized in clans. As with other Amazonian groups, current population figures for the Palikur are unsure; estimates range from about 1300 people to some 2000 people. Roughly two-thirds of them live in Brazil, and the remainder in French Guiana. Names The Palikur people are also known as the Paricuria, Paricores, Palincur, Parikurene, Parinkur-I√©ne, Pa√Økwen√©, Pa'ikwen√©, Aricours, Aukuyene, Karip√∫na- Palik√∫r, Palicur, Palijur, Palikour, Paricura, Paricuri, or Parucuria people.  History  The location of the Palikur near the mouths of the Amazon made them one of the first Amazonian tribes ever encountered by Europeans. As early as 1507 their name was recorded by the Spanish explorer Vicente Ya√±ez Pinz√≥n. By the middle of the 17th century there was an estimated 1,200 Palikur population, of which were 400 bowmen, about one third of their total population living between the Cassipor√© and Maroni rivers. They were engaged in a century-long war with the Galibi, and resisted missionization. The Palikur were also embroiled in the protracted colonial rivalry between Portugal and France for control of the region, extending south of Ile de Cayenne (French Guiana) into what today constitutes the Brazilian state of Amap√°. A Portuguese expedition of the late 18th century burned all Indian villages in the territory, which was then under French influence, and deported the Palikur, who had become allies with the French, into the interior of Brazil. Consequently, the Palikur remained isolated for much of the next century. After Amap√° was finally conceded to Brazil in 1900, some 200 to 300 Palikur chose to move from Brazil to French Guiana, where they had long enjoyed good relations with the Cr√©ole population. Prejudice against indigenous peoples of Brazil was strong among non-natives. The Palikur had not forgotten their ancestors' enslavement by the Portuguese. In 1942 the Brazilian Indian Protection Service (SPI) installed a Nationalization Service in the area with the purpose of integrating the natives, but with limited success. As an example, the Palikur elders refused schooling to their people because they perceived it as a form of slavery. In the early 1960s, a community schism following a shamanic war caused part of the Brazilian Palikur community to relocate to French Guiana. Successive waves of migrants have continued to replenish the French Guianese Palikur community. Not until the late 1960s, with the creation of FUNAI, and as they began converting to Pentecostalism, did the Palikur became more responsive to the Brazilian government. Between 1977 and 1981 FUNAI demarcated a common area of 4347 km2 for the Palikur, Ua√ß√° Galibi, and Karip√∫na. In 1980 a Pentecostal church was built in the village of Ukumene, gathering a population of 350, nearly two thirds of the then Brazilian Palikuri population, and more than a third of the global Palikuris.  Economy  The Palikur subsist largely on bow and arrow fishing, supplemented by hunting and horticulture. Manioc, roasted, or used for the preparation of flat cakes and beer, is the main cultivated plant. Sweet potatoes, sugarcane, peppers, gourds, cotton, and papayas, which the Palikur have adopted from the Europeans, along with mangoes, coffee, and citrus trees, are also cultivated. Commercial relations between the Palikur and the Europeans began to intensify in the early 18th century; river and forest products were exchanged for tools, harpoons, clothes and glass beads. Until the end of the 19th century the main commercial surplus was roasted manioc flour. In the 1940s and 1950s an intense commerce with alligator skins took place, until the alligator population was depleted. The Palikur manufacture objects of wood, bone, feathers, and cotton seed. They are also regionally famous for their basket-ware. Shotguns for hunting and harpoons and cotton fishing lines are being widely used at the present. In French Guiana particularly, a growing number of Palikur are engaging in the market-economy. Notes  References  * Palikur on Ethnologue.com *Wilbert, Johannes; Levinson, David (1994).

He died at 29, in Chicago while hiding from Minnesota authorities. Early life Killen was born in Haddington, Pennsylvania. He later moved to Minnesota, where he made his home for the majority of his life and career (notwithstanding the final five months of his life). Boxing career Standing 6'1\\" (1.85 m) and weighing around , he was large for a heavyweight of his era. This benefited him tremendously as he was nearly three inches (8 cm) taller than most of his opponents. He was a patient fighter who usually waited for his opponent to make the first move, while setting up his punch. He was known as the best counter-punching heavyweight of his era, but known even more for his devastating one-punch power, winning most often by knockout. Some at the time felt he may have had greater one-punch power than even boxers John L. Sullivan or Peter Maher. However, he was less tough, durable, and was not as aggressive or tenacious as Sullivan, the reigning champion at that time. Killen's first fight was against John Howard, whom he managed to knock out in the second round. Twenty-one more wins followed (all by knockout) before he lost on a foul against Mervine Thompson. Killen had knocked down the highly regarded Thompson four times, but the referee allegedly kept giving Thompson all the time he needed to recover each time, prompting the crowd to grow angry and storm the ring, as well as Killen taking off his gloves in disgust. All of this caused him to lose via disqualification. Death Contrary to historical reports, Killen was not murdered. He died of Erysipelas in Chicago, while on the run from the authorities from his home state of Minnesota, where he had been arrested for assault and battery of two different people, both within two days; both during drunken stupors. He made bail and fled the state to Winnipeg and then later Chicago. He was 29 when he died. Legacy He was rated as the seventh all-time greatest Minnesota heavyweight by boxing historian George Blair. His current (incomplete) record is 55 wins (52 by knockout), two losses, three draws and one no-contest.

She won the medals at the international rowing competitions.RRK 08 Rudern ‚Äì Deutsche Rudererfolge bei Weltmeisterschaften She retired from competitive rowing after the 1980 Summer Olympics and from September 1980, she worked as a rowing coach in Potsdam. She graduated with a diploma in physical education from the Deutsche Hochschule f√ºr K√∂rperkultur (DHfK) in Leipzig in 1981. She later became the sculls trainer for the national women's team. She was thus responsible for preparing the sculls team for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, USA. Classification earlier in the year determined that Kathrin Boron was the strongest sculler, followed by Jana Thieme, Katrin Rutschow, and Kerstin K√∂ppen. Guided by the principle that the strongest sculler should row in the singles, her preference was for Boron, but Boron preferred to row in the double or quad. Lau thus nominated Thieme for the single, Koppen and Boron would make the double, and Koppen, Boron, Rutschow and Jana Sorgers were to make up the quad. Dr Ralf Kollmann, who as sports director was responsible for nominating the teams, rejected these teams and wanted rowers picked so that more clubs were represented. Germany's national rowing organisation (Deutscher Ruderverband) nominated Meike Evers for the single, and Thieme and Manuela Lutze, and for the quad the team recommended by Lau. Evers had come eighth or ninth in Lau's classification, and Lau predicted that Evers would not reach the A-final (she only made the C-final). Lau further predicted that the double would at best come fourth (they came fifth). Her final prediction was that the quad would win gold, which they did. By Lau's best assessment, had her suggested teams been accepted, all three boats would probably have won medals. After the Atlanta Olympics, she accused Kollmann of incompetence.

Gl√∫niairn was a son of Amla√≠b Cuar√°n (d. after 980) who abdicated as king of Dublin following his defeat at the Battle of Tara in 980 and the subsequent capture of Dublin by M√°el Sechnaill mac Domnaill of Clann Cholm√°in, the High King of Ireland. Olaf retired to Iona where he probably became a monk and later died. Gl√∫niairn and M√°el Sechnaill were both sons of D√∫nlaith, sister of the previous High King, Domnall ua N√©ill of Cen√©l nE√≥gain, and M√°el Sechnaill appointed his half-brother to rule in Dublin as his client. M√°el Sechnaill removed many of the hostages and captives that Amla√≠b Cuar√°n had held in Dublin, including Domnall Cl√≥en, King of Leinster.Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 51-52; Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp. 52-54\\\\. For family relationships, see: Downham, Viking Kings, p. 29, fig. 6; Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 49, fig. 2. It is likely that Gl√∫niairn benefited substantially from the support of his half-brother, and this support extended beyond that which placed him in power in Dublin in 980 over the claims of his many half-brothers. Domnall Cl√≥en, together with Gl√∫niairn's distant kinsman Ivar of Waterford, faced M√°el Sechnaill and Gl√∫niairn in battle in 983, and defeated their enemies, Ivar's son Gilla P√°traic being one of the many dead in this rout. M√°el Sechnaill's army ravaged across Leinster while Gl√∫niairn's men attacked the church at Glendalough.Downham, Viking Kings, p. 252; Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp. 81-82. In 989 Gl√∫niairn was \\"killed when drunk by his own slave\\", his killer's name being given as Colban in Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's Chronicon Scotorum.Downham, Viking Kings, p. 252. Benjamin Hudson suggests that the reports of the killing in the Irish annals, and particularly M√°el Sechnaill's rapid riposte, argue that Gl√∫niairn's death was more probably the result of factional infighting in Dublin. The annals record that M√°el Sechnaill attacked Dublin, brushing aside resistance. He demanded, and received, the payment of eraic, a term in early Irish law corresponding approximately with Anglo-Saxon wergild. He retained a third for himself, which is what the law would prescribe for a ruler or nobleman acting to enforce payment. It is unclear if Gl√∫niairn was succeeded by Sigtrygg Silkbeard, his paternal half-brother, or by the rival Ivar of Waterford. Gl√∫niairn had at least one full sibling, a sister named Ragnhild who married a son of Congalach Cnogba.Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 49, fig. 2. Gl√∫niairn's son Gilla Ciar√°in died in 1014 at the battle of Clontarf.Downham, Viking Kings, pp.251-252; Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 83, figure 3. He had a second son, who may have been called Sitriuc, who is recorded as killing Gofraid, son of Sigtrygg Silkbeard, in Wales in 1036. This son was perhaps the father of Gofraid (died circa 1070), a ruler of the Isle of Man who is said to have given refuge to Godred Crovan. This Gofraid had a son named Fingal who also ruled Man and died in 1079. Some interpretations would make Macc Congail, who ruled the kingdom of the Rhinns, Fingal's son.Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp. 170-172.

Ebnat, 24 July 1829; d. Nordhausen, 7 October 1902) was a Church historian. His family were country people of Ebnat (now a part of Aalen) in W√ºrttemberg, and upon the conclusion of his studies in the gymnasium Neher devoted himself to the study of theology in the University of T√ºbingen. After his ordination, he worked as pastor of Dorfmerkingen, then of T√ºbingen, and finally of Nordhausen (in the district of Ellwangen, W√ºrttemberg). In addition, Neher devoted himself throughout his life to intellectual pursuits, principally to canon law and church history, giving his attention, in the latter study, chiefly to the two branch sciences of ecclesiastical geography and ecclesiastical statistics. In his first considerable work, which appeared in 1861, he deals with the topic of the privileged Altar (altare privilegiatum). In 1864 he published the first volume of his carefully planned work, Kirchliche Geographie und Statistik, which comprises three volumes (Ratisbon, 1864‚Äì68). It was, for that day, an important work for historians. Its author was one of the first in modern times to focus on this branch of church history, collecting with care material often very difficult to procure, and arranging it systematically. His book on the celebration of two Masses by a priest on the same day pertains to canon law, and it bears the title: Die Bination nach ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung und nach dem heutigen Recht (Ratisbon, 1874). After 1878 Neher edited the statistical \\"Personalkatalog\\" of his own diocese of Rottenburg am Neckar, and was one of the principal contributors to the second edition of Wetzer und Welte's Kirchenlexicon. For this work he wrote 235 articles, or greater parts of articles. Their content is chiefly matter relating to church history, or to ecclesiastical statistics.

Originally based in Smyrna/Izmir, the club was uprooted in the population exchange between Greece and Turkey following the Asia Minor Catastrophe in 1922. It is now based in the Athenian suburb of Nea Smyrni, (New Smyrna) in Greece, where many of the refugees from Smyrna settled. The Panionios football team has won the Greek Cup twice (1979, 1998) while the Panionios basketball team won the Greek Cup in 1991. Panionios has a long tradition of raising talented athletes in many sports (e.g. Fanis Christodoulou, Thomas Mavros, Nikos Anastopoulos, Dimitris Saravakos, etc.) History =Smyrna era (1890‚Äì1922)= Panionios was founded in 1890 under the name Orpheus, by Greeks of Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire. The name related with the legendary musician of ancient Greece, because the main activity of the club was the music. Three years later, in 1893, members of Orpheus who wished the activities of Orpheus to be focused on sport withdrew from the club and founded a new club. That was named Gymnasium and it was the first exclusively Greek sport club in Smyrna. In 1896, Gymnasium organized the first Panionian Games and in 1897 participated in the foundation of SEGAS along with 25 clubs from Greece and two from Cyprus. In October 1898, Orpheus and Gymnasion merged again to form Panionios GSS. The next years Panionios took part in all Panhellenic Games. It also took over the organisation of Panionian Games. Between 1898 and 1922, the games were held 19 times. These games together Panhellenic Games were the most important Greek athletic events. In 1900, Panionios organised the first poetry competition. The winner was Stelios Sperantzas with the poem anthem of Panionios. The first years, Panionios hadn't got its own gymnasium. The club rented out a court near the wharf, from the French company of Smyrna. In 1910 the French company sold the area and Panionios stayed homeless. Thanks to Chrysostomos of Smyrna, Panionios was allotted a big area for its gymnasium near the Greek cemetery. The inauguration of new stadium was held in 1911 during 14th Panionian Games. =Athens era (1922‚Äì1938)= The presence of Panionios in Smyrna finished with the Asia Minor Catastrophe. After the Asia Minor Catastrophe and the expulsion of Greek of Asia Minor, Panionios threatened to be dissolved. The club rescued thanks to its president, Dimitrios Dallas. He tracked down the survivors athletes of Panionios and regrouped the club. The first years Panionios hadn't got own sport facilities. The offices of the club were temporarily accommodated in a small room in Panathenaic Stadium in Athens. In 1923 Panionios reestablished the Panionian Games in Athens with the participation 10 athletic clubs. Panionian games were repeated in 1925, during 35th anniversary of Panionios. In November 1937, Panionios Board of Directors led by President D. Karabatis and the Municipality of Nea Smyrni agreed to relocate the club in Nea Smyrni, the Athens suburb that was mainly inhabited by Greek Asia Minor refugees coming from Smyrna, the club's historical home. Construction works started in 1938, and were completed one year later, 1939. =New Smyrna (Nea Smyrni) era (1938‚Äìtoday)= Nea Smyrni Stadium Hellinikon Olympic Arena After the construction of stadium, Panionios regrouped the football team. Panionios football team won the championship of EPS Athens in 1951 and it was the runner-up of Panhellenic championship the same year. The next year it was the runner up of the Football Cup where defeated by Olympiacos in the replay game (the first match had finished 2-2). Panionios football team evolved to one of the protagonists of Greek championship with steady presence in first division. It was runner-up of the championship one more time, in 1971 and also it has won two football cups in 1979 and 1998. Furthermore, Panionios has important presence in basketball and the last years in water polo. Panionios Basketball team has won a Greek cup in 1989 and one time was a runner-up of the championship (1987). The team has a steady presence in the first division finishing many times in the top four of the championship. The Panionios basketball women team has won a championship in 2007.

It was designed by landscape architect Jacob Weidenmann (1829‚Äì1893) who also designed Hartford's Bushnell Park. Its first sections were completed in 1866 and the first burial took place on July 17, 1866. Cedar Hill was designed as an American rural cemetery in the tradition of Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The cemetery straddles three towns. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997, in Hartford, Newington, and Wethersfield. It includes the Cedar Hill Cemetery Gateway and Chapel, also known as Northam Memorial Chapel and Gallup Memorial Gateway, which is separately listed on the NRHP. Cedar Hill Cemetery encompasses and includes several historic buildings, including the Northam Memorial Chapel (built 1882), which was designed by Hartford architect George Keller, and the Superintendent's Cottage (built 1875), which continues to be occupied by Cedar Hill's Superintendent to this day. Open from dawn til dusk 365 days a year, Cedar Hill Cemetery welcomes visitors to walk the grounds and partake in the expansive art, history and natural resources this park-like space has to offer. Notable monuments Cynthia Talcott monument Cedar Hill has many unique monuments. One of the most recognizable is the tall pink-granite pyramid, and life-sized angel statue, erected in memory of Mark Howard and his wife, Angelina Lee Howard. Mark Howard was president of the National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford and Connecticut's first internal revenue collector. Another example of an unusual grave is that of Cynthia Talcott, age two, which features her likeness in stone. John Pierpont Morgan's family monument was designed by architect George W. Keller.

Of middle-class origin, Neugart studied in the classical schools of the Benedictine Abbeys of St George and St. Blasien, entered the order at the latter monastery in l759, and was ordained priest 1765; in 1767 he was appointed professor of Biblical languages at the University of Freiburg. In 1770, however, he returned to St. Blasien where he professed theology. While engaged in this work he published a treatise on penance, Doctrina de sacramento poenitentiae recte administrando (St Blasien, 1778). His abbot, Gerbert had planned the publication of a Church history of Germany on a large scale (Germania sacra). In 1780 at his request Neugart began an elaborate research into the history of the Diocese of Constance. On Gerbert's death in 1793, Neugart declined the title of abbot but accepted the provostship of Bad Krozingen, near Freiburg, so as to be able to devote himself entirely to historical studies. He published the original charters and documents for the history of the Diocese of Constance in a separate publication, Codex diplomaticus Alemanniae et Burgundiae transjuranae intra fines dioecesis Constantiensis (I, St. Blasien, 1791; II, St. Blansien, 1795). With this as a basis he wrote in Krozingen the first instalment of his history of the Diocese of Constance Episcopatus Constantiensis Alemannicus sub metropoli Moguntina (part I, vol. I, to the year 1100, St. Blasien 1803). Soon the abbey of St. Blasien was secularized. Notwithstanding Neugart's efforts for its preservation it was assigned to Baden, and absorbed with all its landed possessions. In 1807 Neugart went to Vienna to negotiate for the settlement of the expelled monks in Austria, and succeeded. The abbot and monks of St. Blasien were granted the Abbey of St. Paul, near Klagenfurt in the valley of the Lavant, suppressed by Joseph II. Here Neugart completed the second volume of his diocesan history extending to 1308, but it was not published until 1802. He then turned his attention to the history of Carinthia and of the Abbey of St. Paul, where he and his companions had found refuge. After his death there appeared his Historia monasterii Ord. S. Benedicti ad S. Paulum in valle inferioris Carinthiae Lavantina (Klagenfurt, 1848,1854). Several historical treatises and compilations are still in manuscript. Another work, Libellus majores maternos Rudolphi I regis exhibens, was edited by Weber (Klagenfurt, 1850).

The Marava War of Succession  A war of succession broke out in the Marava kingdom in the year 1720.Subramanian, Pg. 37 Vijaya Raghunatha, the adopted son of Raja Kilavan had died and a war of succession broke out between two other sons of Kilavan namely Bhavani Shankar and Tanda Teva. Serfoji I supported the cause of Bhavani Shankar and placed him on the throne. But Bhavani Shankar did not fulfill his promise to cede all lands north of the Pambar River to Thanjavur. Thanjavur switched sides and began to support another pretender. The Marava army suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Serfoji I. Bhavani Shankar was deposed and the country conquered by Serfoji I. The country was split up into three parts: one part was annexed by Thanjavur while the Zamindaris of Sivaganga and Ramnad were created out of the other two.  Encounter with Abirami Pattar  Ruler Serfoji I, the Maratha Raja of Thanjavur who ruled over the land, visited the Abirami temple to pay homage to Lord Shiva. On noticing the peculiar behavior of Subramaniya Iyer(also known as Abirami Pattar) who was a temple priest, he inquired the other priests about the individual. One of them remarked that he was a madman while another rejected this categorization explaining to the king that Subramaniya Iyer was only an ardent devotee of Goddess Abhirami. Seeking to know the truth himself, Serfoji approached the priest and asked him what day of the month it was i.e. whether it was a full-moon day or a new-moon day. Subramaniya Iyer answered mistakenly that it was a Pournami (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Øå‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ£‡ÆÆ‡Æø, Lit. full-moon day) who could see nothing else but the shining luminant form of the Goddess. While in reality, the night was an Amavasya (Tamil: ‡ÆÖ‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æµ‡Æö‡Øà, Lit. new-moon day). The king rode off informing the former that he would have his head cut off, if the moon did not appear on the sky by six in the night. Immediately realizing his mistake, Subramaniya Iyer supposedly lit a huge fire and erected a platform over it supported by a hundred ropes. He sat upon the platform and prayed to the Goddess Abhirami to save him. He cut off one rope after another in succession on completion of each verse of his prayer. These hymns form the Abhirami Anthadhi. On verge of completing the 79th hymn,the Goddess Abhirami manifested herself before him and threw her thadanga (Tamil: ‡Æ§‡Æü‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Øà, Lit. diamond earring ornament), over the sky such that it shined with bright light upon the horizon. The area around the temple was surrounded by light like noon. Overcome with ecstasy, Subramaniya Iyer composed 22 more verses in praise of the Goddess. The king repented his mistake and immediately cancelled the punishment he had awarded Subramaniya Iyer. He also bestowed upon the latter the title of \\"Abirami Pattar\\" or \\"One who worships Goddess Abhirami or The Priest of Goddess Abhirami\\" and supposedly awarded his successors the privilege of using the title \\"Bharathi\\".  Literature  The reign of Serfoji I was known for literary works of considerable significance. Advaita Kirtana, a Tamil manuscript in the Tanjore library speaks of a breach in the Cauvery dam and refusal of the Madurai Nayak to allow this repair.Subramanian, Pg. 38 Drought and famine followed, and then, the necessary repairs were carried out. There is a Sanskrit manuscript named Sarabhoji Charitra which praises the king for fighting with those who came to cut off the Cauvery dam. The reference here has to be traced to an event in the Marava war of succession. Serfoji I is presented as a pious and charitable monarch. He endowed Brahmanas with agraharams like Mangamatam in Tiruverkadu and Sarabhojirajapuram in Tirukkadaiyur.Subramanian, Pg. 39 Vidyaparinaya written by Vedakavi was enacted in the festival of the Goddess Anandavalli in Thanjavur.Subramanian, Pg. 40 It speaks of the marriage of the individual soul with Vidya. Sarabharaja Vilasa and Ratinamanmatha were written by Jagannatha son of a minister of Ekoji. Sivabharata, a Sanskrit manuscript deals with the ancestry and achievements of Shivaji. It was translated into Tamil as Sivajicharitram.  Succession  Serfoji I did not have a legitimate male offspring of his own. However, after his death, a claimant rose in the person of Katturaja who assumed the name Shahuji II and claimed to be an illegitimate offspring of Serfoji II.  Death  Serfoji I died in 1728. One of his queens performed Sati. He was succeeded by his younger brother Tukkoji.

Different china services have been ordered and used by different presidential administrations. The White House collection of china is housed in the White House China Room. Not every administration created its own service, but portions of all china services created for the White House are now in the China Room collection. Some of the older china services are used for small private dinners in the President's Dining Room on the Second Floor. White House china services =Monroe service= The Monroe china was the first created specifically for an American president. In 1817 in Paris, Dagoty-Honor√© manufactured the china of James Monroe, the first White House china solely for presidential use, and designed specifically for an American president. A dinner service of thirty place-settings and a matching dessert service were purchased for US$1,167.23. A Napoleonic eagle was in the center of the plates, which was popular at the time in both France and America. The eagle carried a red, white, and blue banner reading \\"E Pluribus Unum\\", the national motto. There are five vignettes inside the dark red border, representing agriculture, strength, commerce, science and arts. The china was criticized by the press at the time for being foreign goods. Though Congress soon passed a law mandating all furniture for the White House be made in America, when it came to manufacturing china, it would take the country nearly another one hundred years to compete with the fine works produced in England and France. =Polk service= A piece from the Polk dessert service The White House needed a new china service by the time the Polks took up residence in 1845. The same company which produced the Monroe china service, Dagoty-Honor√© of Paris, made their state dinner service. The dinner and dessert services were ordered in 1846; 400 pieces cost US$979.40. The service included a plain white design and gold trim, which made it a popular service with later administrations. The simplicity of the china made it well suited to mix with other depleted services when the occasion arose. The dessert service, rather than being plain, features a soft green border and polychrome flowers. =Lincoln service= The Lincoln china was used frequently. The Lincoln china is the first service that was chosen entirely by a First Lady. Mary Todd Lincoln felt that it was important to maintain a proper appearance in the White House so that foreigners would perceive America as strong and her husband‚Äôs administration as in control. As a result, the Lincoln administration (1861-1865) was socially active amid the Civil War. Mrs. Lincoln personally selected china with a purple-red border called \\"Solferino\\", later known as the \\"Royal Purple\\" set, in 1861 from E. V. Haughwout and Company in New York City. The service had been produced by Haviland and Company in Limoges, France. The American bald eagle is above a shield with the national motto spread throughout clouds. The Coat of Arms of the United States is centered in the service. =Hayes service= The order of the Hayes china service came about by chance. First Lady Lucy Hayes met with artist Theodore R. Davis. While in the White House conservatory with Mrs. Hayes, Davis suggested that the china include the flora and fauna of North America as decoration. Davis produced 130 designs for Mrs. Hayes, many unique. The order cost $3,120. It was first used during a dinner for incoming President James A. Garfield and his family. The service design was well liked by the public and reproduced, though critics were less than satisfied. =Harrison service= The Harrison china was designed by First Lady Caroline Harrison. First Lady Caroline Harrison wanted new china that would be \\"symbolic and meaningful to Americans.\\" An artist herself, the first lady placed the Coat of Arms of the United States in the center of the plates, and designed a goldenrod and corn motif etched in gold around a wide band of blue. The corn represents Mrs. Harrison's home state of Indiana. 44 stars, one for each state in the Union at the time, made up the inner border. Mrs. Harrison directed a large-scale remodeling effort of the White House, and added a china closet to display all past presidential china services. Caroline Harrison was not able to use the china she had ordered, as she died before it was delivered to the White House. The china arrived in December 1892. =Theodore Roosevelt service= An extensive White House renovation was conducted in the early 1900s, during which the State Dining Room was enlarged to seat over 100 guests. A new set of china was needed due to the expanded size of the room. First Lady Edith Roosevelt ordered 1,320 pieces of Wedgwood china. The china was white and highlighted the Great Seal of the United States. Mrs. Roosevelt expanded upon Mrs. Harrison's efforts to gather china from previous administrations and displayed them in a specially made cabinet on the White House ground floor. =Wilson service= The Wilson service was the first to be manufactured in the United States. The Wilsons entered the White House in 1913, and at the time, the most recently ordered china was from the Theodore Roosevelt presidency, over ten years before. By 1918, new china was needed. First Lady Edith Wilson preferred ordering American-made china, and chose Lenox after viewing a sample in a Washington, D.C., store. The Wilson pattern was designed by Lenox's chief designer, Frank Holmes, who chose a restrained theme. The china featured a deep ivory border surrounding a brighter ivory body and two bands of matte gold encrusted with stars, stripes, and other motifs. The dinner plates have deep blue borders. Each of the 1,700 pieces has the presidential seal in raised gold. It was the first presidential china to feature the arms of the presidential seal rather than the arms of the Great Seal of the United States. The first shipment of the china was delivered to the White House between August and November 1918. A New York newspaper wrote, \\"The proud day has arrived when the White House dining service [was] designed by an American artist, made at an American pottery ... and decorated by American workmen.\\" The china remained in use for the Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover administrations. =Franklin Roosevelt service= The Franklin Roosevelt china By 1933, the Wilson service had become largely depleted. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt promoted new china during difficult economic times to keep American workers employed. The Roosevelts ordered Lenox china through a New York store in October 1934. The pattern included a border of 48 gold stars ‚Äî one for every state ‚Äî and the presidential seal in enamel colors on an ivory body. The stars were set against a band of marine blue, personal to the Roosevelts because of the president's interest in nautical subjects, and complemented by an inner band of golden roses and feathers. This was reminiscent of the Roosevelt family crest. Lenox worked overtime so that the 1,722 pieces of china would be completed in time for an important state dinner in January 1935. For the first time in White House history, every guest dined from a single service. =Truman service= The Truman china As a result of the 1948-1952 White House renovation, the State Dining Room color was changed, and the Trumans wanted a new china service to match the color of the soft celadon green walls. The Trumans ordered 1,572 pieces of Lenox china in 1951. The pattern included a border of celadon green flanked by an etched gold band and a twenty-four karat gold rim on an ivory body. It included a raised gold presidential seal, surrounded by 48 gold stars. Following the end of World War II, Harry Truman had issued an executive order in 1945 to standardize the seal; he had the head of the eagle turned toward the olive branch, representing peace, instead of toward the arrows, representing war. The china adhered to Truman's order. The service was first used on April 3, 1952, at a luncheon for the Dutch royal family. =Eisenhower service= By the Eisenhower years, the Truman china was still in good supply. To complement the Truman service dinner plates, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower ordered 120 service plates. The plates were ordered from Castleton China, Inc. of New Castle, Pennsylvania, at a cost $3,606.40. The plates were white, though the rims were covered with pure gold medallions, which required eight separate firings in the kiln. =Johnson service= The Lyndon Johnson state china service features American wild flowers. By 1966, three years into the Johnson presidency, it was determined that new china was needed to replace older services. On November 8, 1967, the new china order was announced; the service would serve 140 guests at a cost of $80,028.24. The Johnson service was the first that was not purchased with appropriated government funds; an anonymous donor through the White House Historical Association funded the china project. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson worked very closely with the designer, Tiffany and Company of New York City, and the china was manufactured by Castleton China, Inc. Mrs. Johnson integrated her main cause as first lady ‚Äî beautification ‚Äî with the china design. The china pieces feature the eagle first designed for the Monroe china, and the border of the plates were decorated with over forty different wildflowers found throughout the United States portrayed on different plates. The dessert plates were made featuring the state flower of each of the fifty U.S. states. The flowers were hand painted on each plate, delaying the completion of the china until the summer of 1972, four years into the Nixon administration. =Reagan service= The Reagan state china service The Reagan state china service was modeled on Woodrow Wilson's china and features the seal of the president of the United States in burnished gold on an ivory background with a border of scarlet. The china was manufactured in the United States by Lenox, and selected by First Lady Nancy Reagan. State dinners had become so large by the Reagan presidency that none of the china could accommodate the number of guests. First Lady Nancy Reagan ordered 4,370 pieces of Lenox china, enough place settings of 19 pieces for 220 people. This was nearly twice as many placesettings as other recent services. The Reagans wanted a design that would display a strong presence for the subtly colored State Dining Room, now painted white. Nancy Reagan worked closely with Lenox designers to create a pattern with bands in a striking scarlet red, which was her favorite color. The pattern was bordered on each side with etched gold, which created a sparkling contrast with the soft ivory china. The presidential seal was in raised gold in the center, partially overlaying the red border. On pieces such as the service and dessert plates, fine gold crosshatching overlays the red. The Reagans were often criticized for the $209,508 cost. The china was not funded by taxpayers, and was paid for by a J.P. Knapp Foundation donation. =Clinton service= The Clinton china service being used for a state dinner To commemorate the bicentennial of the White House, the Clintons ordered 300 12-piece place settings in 2000. Differing from previous White House china services, the Clinton china included a border of pale, creamy yellow, rather than a brighter primary color, and images of the White House, instead of the customary presidential seal, in the center. Each piece in each place setting included a different pattern showing outstanding architectural elements found in the East Room, State Dining Room, and Diplomatic Reception Room. It was first used at a dinner function attended by Gerald Ford and Mrs. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Mrs. Carter, George H. W. Bush and Mrs. Bush, and Lady Bird Johnson. =Bush service= George W. Bush White House state china The George W. Bush White House state china has a gold rim with a green basket-weave pattern and a historically-inspired gold eagle. It was manufactured by Lenox. The Bush china was introduced on January 7, 2009, two weeks before President George W. Bush left office. Two service sets were introduced. The larger service set was the first full set since that of the Reagan china in 1982. The larger set, made by Lenox, is composed of roughly 4500 pieces to fill 320 place settings. First Lady Laura Bush chose a soft green pattern due to its versatility and ability to coordinate with flowers. The pattern was inspired by a coffee service belonging to President James and Dolley Madison. The smaller White House Magnolia Pattern service set, made by Pickard China in Illinois and designed by Anna Weatherley, is composed of 75 place settings and was purchased for use in the private quarters of the White House. =Obama service= Obama state china service The 3,520-piece Obama state china service was introduced on April 27, 2015, the day before it was to be used for the first time at the April 28 state dinner for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The rim of most pieces is decorated with textured gold. Inside the rim is a band in \\"Kailua Blue\\", a bright blue color inspired by the hue of the sea in President Barack Obama's home state of Hawaii. A delicate inner line of gold completes the decoration. Dinner and serving plates are simpler in design. Each dinner plate has a simple, narrow band of gold on the edge and a broad, undecorated bas- relief pinwheels and fronds on the rim. The bas-relief design was taken from an Empire style china service purchased by then-Secretary of State James Madison in 1806. The bas-relief element, Andrew Pickard Morgan of Pickard China says, is unique to White House china. The service plates feature a broad, textured rim of gold, and the presidential coat of arms in gold in the center. The service contains 320 settings, and each setting has 11 pieces. Each setting also contains (for the first time in the history of White House china services) an individual tureen. The tureen can be used for soups, small entrees, or desserts, and reflects a more modern style of dining. Pickard workers spent more than a year, experimenting with numerous trial pieces, to produce the tureen. In addition to the service plate, the teacup and the dessert plate all feature the Presidential Coat of Arms. First Lady Michelle Obama was assisted in composing the china service pattern by designer Michael S. Smith. Planning began in the fall of 2011, and White House chefs, White House staff, and Pickard China of Illinois were consulted on the design. The set was manufactured by Pickard China at a cost of about $367,258. The White House Historical Association, a private foundation established by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy to purchase furniture and decorative and fine arts for the Executive Residence, provided the funds for the purchase.

History The pub itself dates from at least the 17th century and the present building was constructed in 1846, the pub having been purchased in 1831 by what became Young's Brewery. =1959‚Äì2012= The Bull opened as a jazz venue in 1959 and, under the management of Albert Tolley, became an important venue for major UK and visiting international jazz musicians during the 1960s. In 1982 Dan Fleming took over the premises and the venue continued to flourish with its jazz roster. Fleming added blues and rock acts to its listings, a policy which continues to this day. The venue featured in Martin Scorsese's History of the Blues (2003). The music room was refurbished with sponsorship from Yamaha in 2006 and was renamed \\"The Yamaha Room\\". In 2009 the Bull celebrated fifty years as a venue and a spokesman from Yamaha Music stated: \\"We are delighted to congratulate the Bull's Head on reaching the milestone of its 50th anniversary. We are very proud of the Yamaha Jazz Room and our partnership with this historic venue, the unique place it occupies in international jazz history and its philosophy to present and showcase both established and new talent.\\" =2013 change of ownership= On 1 July 2013 Fleming retired and the Bull's Head lease was sold to Geronimo Inns, a wholly owned subsidiary of Young & Co. Although the new lease agreement was said to protect the continuation of live music, a petition to preserve the music room was launched in June 2013. The refurbished pub and music room, needing acoustic improvement, was opened at the beginning of 2014.

The New Commandment is a term used in Christianity to describe Jesus's commandment to \\"love one another\\" which, according to the Bible, was given as part of the final instructions to his disciples after the Last Supper had ended, \\"And supper being ended, ...\\" and after Judas Iscariot had departed in . This commandment appears thirteen times in twelve verses in the New Testament.   Theologically, this commandment is interpreted as dual to the Love of Christ for his followers. The commandment can also be seen as the last wish in the Farewell Discourse to the disciples.Imitating Jesus by Richard A. Burridge 2007 page 301 Gospel of John The statement of the new commandment by Jesus in John 13:34‚Äì35 was after the Last Supper, and after the departure of Judas.Encountering John: The Gospel in Historical, Literary, and Theological Perspective by Andreas J. Kostenberger 2002 pages 149‚Äì151 The commandment was prefaced in John 13:34 by Jesus telling his remaining disciples, as little children, that he will be with them for only a short time, then will leave them. In the commandment Jesus told the disciples: \\"Love one another; as I have loved you\\".The Gospel of John (1998) by Francis J. Moloney and Daniel J. Harrington. . Page 425.The Gospel of John (1994) by Frederick Bruce. . Page 294. Just after the commandment, and before the Farewell Discourse the first reference to Peter's Denials took place, where Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the cock crow. Two similar statements also appear in chapter 15 of the Gospel of John: * John 15:12: This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you. * John 15:17: These things I command you, that ye may love one another. Other New Testament references =Johannine writings= The Johannine writings include other, similar passages. * 1 John 3:11: For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another * 1 John 3:23: And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment. * 1 John 4:7: let us love one another: for love is of God; * 1 John 4:12: No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us. Similarly, the Second Epistle of John states: * 2 John 5: not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. =Pauline letters= The Pauline Epistles also contain similar references. * Romans 13:8: Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law. * 1 Thessalonians 4:9: ... for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. =1 Peter= The First Epistle of Peter has a similar statement: * 1 Peter 1:22: ...to love brotherly without feigning, love one another with a pure heart fervently. Interpretations The \\"New Commandment\\" concerns the love for neighbor and is similar to the second part of the Great Commandment, which comprises two commands: love for God and love for neighbor. The first part of the Great Commandment alludes to Deuteronomy 6:4-5, a section of the Torah which is recited at the beginning of the Jewish prayer known as The Shema. The second part of the Great Commandment, which is similar to the \\"New Commandment\\", commands love for neighbor and is based on Leviticus 19:18. According to Scott Hahn, while the Torah commanded human love, Jesus commands divine love for one another that is modeled on his own acts of charity.Ignatius Catholic Study Bible New Testament The \\"New Commandment\\", the Wycliffe Bible Commentary states, \\"was new in that the love was to be exercised toward others not because they belonged to the same nation, but because they belonged to Christ ... and the love of Christ which the disciples had seen ... would be a testimony to the world\\". One of the novelties introduced by this commandment ‚Äì perhaps justifying its designation as New ‚Äì is that Jesus \\"introduces himself as a standard for love\\". The usual criterion had been \\"as you love yourself\\". However, the New Commandment goes beyond \\"as you love yourself\\" as found in the ethic of reciprocity and states \\"as I have loved you\\", using the Love of Christ for his disciples as the new model. The First Epistle of John reflects the theme of love being an imitation of Christ, with 1 John 4:19 stating: \\"We love, because he first loved us.\\".The People's New Testament Commentary by M.

Established in 1923 in Kings Norton, Birmingham, the club soon moved its base into the Bromsgrove Urban District Council's area of Worcestershire, when it used a ground initially in Masshouse Lane, and later in Bells Lane on Bournville Village Trust land, where it had two pitches laid out. The team won the inaugural North Midlands RFU Seven-a-Side Tournament in 1930, and a unique double was achieved when its Colts side won a similar inaugural competition at The Reddings in its 1963/4 season. The club has hosted numerous county matches, and its players have appeared in representative sides over the years. Nigel Horton began his career at Kings Norton and went on to represent England. Nick Baxter has represented The Barbarians, England Students, England Sevens, Worcester Warriors, Pertemps Bees, and Stourbridge. County boundary changes and housing development forced the club to move away from Bells Lane in 1973, and members worked hard to raise sufficient funds to purchase 12¬Ω acres of agricultural land. A two- storey clubhouse and three rugby pitches were laid out. Having weathered the initial difficulties, the new 2001/2 committee put together a three-year action plan designed to ensure survival and put the foundations for progress in place. Many of the goals it set for itself were achieved well ahead of schedule, and a revised plan had to be swiftly prepared. A ground-leveling scheme involving landfill was completed in 2003; this will eventually provide an extra small pitch ideal for youth rugby. Kings Norton RFC play an active and important part in the local community, running 3 Senior Men's teams including a Veterans, they also have a thriving junior section which offers rugby for as young as Under-6 through to Under-16's. There is also a growing Girls rugby division within the club. They also have strong links to local schools and colleges, providing sponsorship and coaching to teams from as many as 9 schools, whilst holding annual and monthly tag-tournaments for all ages.

Having completed his Humanistic studies in Enkhuizen, he studied medicine at Utrecht, 1842, received the degree of M.D. in 1848, and began practicing in Westwoud near the city of Hoorn. He devoted some of his spare time to literature and history, and he pub-lished, in 1856, a volume of poems entitled: De laatste Dochter der Hohenstaufen, on subjects chiefly from the Middle Ages. Then came a series of historical works, first among which was Het Katholicismus in betrekking met de beschaving van Europa (Amsterdam, 1856‚Äì1857, in 2 volumes), a history of the influence of Catholicism upon the culture and civilization of European nations. In several pamphlets and in a voluminous work, Geschiedenis der Regering van Pius IX (Amsterdam, 1862‚Äì63), he treated the Roman question of 1859. His chief work, Geschiedenis der nederlandsche Beroerten in de XVI. eeuw (Amsterdam, 1865‚Äì70, in 8 parts), a history of the revolutionary wars of the Netherlands from 1559 to 1598, discloses no new sources, but shows what rights Catholics were entitled to in the State. New editions appeared in 1886 and 1904. Somewhat as a sequel he wrote: Geschiedenis der kerkelijke en politieke geschillen in de republiek der zeven vereenigde provincien (1598‚Äì1625) (Amsterdam, 1886-87 in two parts). Intended for popular reading are: Algemeen Geschiedenis des nederlandschen Volks- van de vroegste tijden tot op onze dagen (Amsterdam, 1871‚Äì82, in 20 parts; new edition, 1896‚Äì98, in 24 parts); Geschiedenis van het nederlandsche Volk van 1815 tot op onze dagen (Amsterdam, 1883‚Äì86, in 4 parts; 2nd edition 1898); and the widely read Vaderlandsche Geschiedenis voor de jeugd (Amsterdam, 1870; 25th edition, 1905, by G. F. I. Douwes). He published a number of pamphlets and articles in periodicals on topics of the times, especially in Onze Wachter, edited by him from 1871 to 1874 in collaboration with Herman Schaepmann. He was an energetic defender of the rights and the privileges of Catholics, and one of the first to champion the freedom of the Catholic Church in the Netherlands. Catholics erected a monument to him in the church at Westwoud and set aside the surplus of the money contributed as a perpetua1 fund, called \\"Nuyensfund\\", to aid the work of Catholic historians of the Netherlands.

Hurtubise claimed that it was \\"the first suit of its kind in the world, it is the first ballistics exoskeleton body suit of armour.\\" Despite his efforts to promote the suit, the inventor experienced personal and financial hardship. Hurtubise's death in a traffic accident in June 2018 was believed to have aborted any future research on the Trojan suit. Development Troy Hurtubise spent two years and $15,000 developing the Trojan suit. When worn, the Trojan provided 97% coverage of the body and a claimed 95% flexibility. The suit also weighed 50 lbs maximum. He claimed that it could be suited to a soldier for CA$2000 if it were mass-produced. It was originally designed to stop Improvised Explosive Devices like the kind used in Iraq. However, he never actually tested the suit against a live IED. The suit used a bullet-resistant foam of Hurtubise's own design to repel bullets and knives. Features The Trojan Ballistics Suit of Armour's main weapons were dual pistols on magnetic holsters. There was a sheath on the wrist that contained a knife for close- quarter combat. The suit also contained a Pepper spray capsule for emergency situations. Hurtubise stated that this could be used to incapacitate 40 insurgents. This was supposedly made possible because his capsule would contain 3% oleoresin capsicum. However, it would be illegal to use in a combat situation, as capsicum is banned for use in war by the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The helmet utilized both an intake fan and an exhaust fan to keep the soldier who wore it from overheating in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan. It also included a perfectly centered laser targeting system to mark a target to be taken out by a sniper or assault vehicle. Hurtubise integrated a voice-activated radio into the helmet for easy communication. Two high-power lights were integrated into the side of the helmet. Hurtubise also included a voice-changing mechanism in the suit's helmet. A compartment on the left arm contained a small vial of salt for the soldier, and the inventor stated that each Trojan suit would contain one dose of morphine. Also, a \\"last-words\\" recorder could be taken off of a soldier and given to the family of the soldier. A transponder chip was included that can be swallowed by a soldier so that he could be extracted. A light transponder on the chest could also be activated to signal a helicopter. On the right leg was a small remote- controlled surveillance robot. The soldier watched the robot on a small fold- out screen on the left leg. A military time world clock was integrated into the groin protector that Hurtubise claimed was \\"where it's got to be.\\" One of the shoes also had a small handheld shovel locked into it. Raffle Hurtubise held a raffle for his Trojan suit to raise funds to continue development. But the winner, Sara Markis, agreed to let Troy keep the suit. Media coverage The Trojan was featured on a Discovery channel special where he explained the features of his suit in detail. Similarities The Trojan suit bore a striking resemblance to the MJOLNIR battle armours from the Halo video game series. Hurtubise confirmed this in an interview, saying, \\"I did look at Star Wars. I looked at Halo, the video game.\\" See also *Body Armor References External links *Engadget article on the Trojan *Mission Trojan (currently down) *Edit International article on the Trojan *Article about Ebay auction Category:Body armor Category:Ballistic vests ","title":"Trojan Ballistics Suit of Armor"},{"id":"14905623","text":"Shahuji I Bhonsle (Marathi: ‡§∂‡§æ‡§π‡•Å‡§ú‡•Ä ‡•ß/‡§∂‡§π‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§§‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡§ö‡•á)(b.1672) also called Shahji of the Bhonsle dynasty was the second Maratha ruler of Thanjavur. He was the eldest son of Ekoji I, who was a half brother of Shivaji, the first Maratha ruler of Thanjavur. He reigned from 1684 to 1712. Accession Shahuji I ascended the throne in 1684 at the age of 12 on the death of his father Venkoji or Ekoji I the first Maratha ruler of Thajnavur. The campaign of Zulfiqar Khan The Mughal Emperor Aurangazeb's Deccan campaign reached its highpoint after the death of Shivaji. The Deccan sultanates were annexed in 1687 and Shivaji's eldest son Shambhaji was captured and slain. However, the annihilation of the Maratha Empire was prevented by the brave resistance offered by Shivaji's second son Rajaram and his wife Tara Bai. As the Maratha territories were overrun by Mughal troops, the focus of resistance shifted to Gingee fort which Rajaram took in 1693 with an army of 20,000 men provided by his cousin, the Raja of Thanjavur. Aurangazeb retaliated by sending his general Zulfiqar Khan who recaptured Gingee and pursued the fleeing Marathas into Thanjavur. From 1691, Thanjavur had been forced to pay a tribute of four lakhs to the Mughals in order to retain their sovereignty. In 1697, Zulfiqar Khan forced Shahuji I to return the lands he had obtained from Mangammal, the Nayaki of Tiruchirapalli. Eventually Shahuji defeated the Mughals and captured lands as far as Varanasi. For this; he was immortalized in many literary works. Wars and Conquests An inscription at Pattukkottai boasts of the conquest of all lands between Pamban and Pudukkottai by Babaji son of Gangadhara, the agent of Shahuji I and the construction of a fort by the same official. Inscriptions also refer to the help offered by Shahji I to the Maravas. In 1700, Babaji invaded Tiruchirapalli in alliance with the Sethupathy of Ramnad. However, Rani Mangammal, the Queen of Tiruchirapalli inflicted a crushing defeat on Ramnad. Soon Shahuji I switched sides on account of the common danger to Thanjavur and Tiruchirapalli from the anicut built by Mysore across the Cauvery. A major war with Mysore was averted. But furious with Shahuji I over his new-found friendship with the Nayaks of Madurai / Tiruchirapalli, Kilavan, the Raja of Ramnad invaded Tiruchirapalli and defeated the forces of the Nayaki. He sent a huge army across the dominions of Shahuji I and took the fort of Aranthangi in 1709. Literature Shahuji I patronized learning and promoted literature. There are some dramas(koothu) in manuscript in the Thanjavur library which belong to this period. A large number of high-quality Sanskrit works were produced during this period. Dharmakuta heaps praises on Shahuji I. Tryambaka Raya Makhi gave a new interpretation to the Ramayana. Venkata Krishna Dikshitar who was a court-poet of Shahuji I composed Natesa Vijayam. Apart from this, Bhaskara Dikshit wrote Ratnatulika while Veda Kavi wrote Vidya Parinayam and Jivananda In 1693, Shahuji I renamed Thiruvisanallur as Shahajirajapuram and made a gift of this village to 46 Pandits of his court. This village soon emerged as the hub of literary, art and architectural activity. Bhulokadevendra Vilasam,Athirupavathi Kalyanam,Sankaranarayana Kalyanam,Chandrikahasa Vilasa Natakam,Koravanji and Vishnu saharasraja vilasam are some works in Tamil drama which belong to this period. However, almost all Tamil works of Shahuji's period indicate a decline in quality. The usual plot is that some princess falls in love with Sahendra or Shahuji and secures him at last. The king is described in them as a linguist and a conqueror. Besides these, there are a few stray pieces praising Ekoji, Shahuji and Serfoji. There are also some Telugu works from this period which are also lower in quality when compared to those of the Nayak period. Sahasraja vilasa nataka narrates how Shahuji I defeated the Muslim sultans and conquered all lands up to Varanasi. Vishnu sahasraja vilasam is a Tamil koothu written in Telugu script. Later life According to the Advaita Kirtana, Shahuji I abdicated the throne in 1712 and became a yogi. He was succeeded by his brother Serfoji I.

History In 1934 a single Arab house stood on the site of what is today Beit Oren. It was purchased with the surrounding lands, settled by a group of 15 Jewish workers, and served as a watch tower and camp. The workers intended to build a city and name it Ya'arot HaCarmel, but a number were killed when the site was attacked during the 1936 Arab Revolt. The kibbutz was founded in 1939 by immigrants from Poland and Russia, part of the Hebrew Socialist Youth movement. Over time these were joined by other groups from Dror and Aliyat HaNoar, as well as by a group from Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael. During the Mandate era the kibbutz served as a Palmach base for underground activities against the British. On 9 October 1945, a Palmach unit set out from Beit Oren to free 208 illegal immigrants detained at the Atlit detainee camp. After overcoming the guards, the freed immigrants were led past Beit Oren to Kibbutz Yagur, where they were hidden from the British.

The airline commenced commercial operations from Tegel Airport at the start of the 1988-'89 winter timetable with a fleet of four Boeing 737-300 jet aircraft leased from Monarch Airlines. Monarch Airlines supplied all of Euroberlin's flightdeck crew, while Monarch's sister company Monarch Aircraft Engineering provided the maintenance support for the Euroberlin operation at Tegel, under a wet lease agreement. Air France staff at the French flag carrier's Paris headquarters performed all of Euroberlin's administrative functions.

Over the following two years, the airline's share of the total West Berlin ‚Äî West Germany air travel market collapsed from 9% to less than 5%. Following the beginning of BEA's jet operations from Tempelhof in late 1968, Air France's share dropped even further. Other factors that contributed to the company's progressive decline in traffic on its internal German services included Tegel's greater distance from West Berlin's city centre compared with Tempelhof, the lack of a motorway connecting the airport to the city centre and poor public transport links. Compared with its two bigger rivals in the Berlin market, it served fewer German domestic routes at lower frequencies and did not promote these as effectively.Aeroplane ‚Äî Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 5, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 To keep a presence in the internal German air transport market from/to West Berlin, Air France had entered into a collaborative agreement with BEA. This agreement covered the Berlin‚ÄìFrankfurt and Berlin‚ÄìMunich routes. The agreement's intention was to enable both BEA and Air France to compete better with Pan Am's more frequent services on these routes by pooling their resources. It entailed the joint operation of these routes from Tempelhof with BEA BAC One-Eleven 500 aircraft, BEA flightdeck crews and mixed BEA/Air France cabin crews.Berlin deal goes ahead, Air Transport ..., Flight International, 3 October 1968, p. 520One-Eleven 500 into service ..., Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 742 However, BEA's claim that it returned to profitability on both its Frankfurt and Munich routes from Berlin as a result of the collaborative agreement with Air France was contradicted by the latter's counter claim that it was still losing money on these routes, in spite of that agreement. This in turn led to the agreement's termination as of November 1, 1972. The same day, Air France introduced a second daily return flight between Orly and Tegel, which routed via Cologne in both directions to maintain the airline's internal German traffic rights from/to Berlin.Berlin Change, Air Transport, Flight International, 25 May 1972, p. 755British Airways Super One-Eleven Division ‚Äî Internal German Services, Air Transport, Flight International, 1 August 1974, p. 104Berlin Airport Company, November 1972 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1972 From April 1, 1974, Air France routed both of its daily Orly‚ÄìTegel services via Cologne, and from November 1, 1974, it switched them to the French capital's then new Charles de Gaulle Airport.Berlin Airport Company, April 1974 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1974 At the start of the 1976 summer timetable, Air France introduced a third daily CDG‚ÄìTegel frequency, which routed via D√ºsseldorf and utilised the Boeing 727-200, a bigger aircraft than the Caravelles used on the company's other services from/to Berlin.Berlin Airport Company, April 1976 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tegel Airport, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1976 Air France subsequently routed all of its CDG‚ÄìTegel flights via D√ºsseldorf and standardised the aircraft equipment on the 727-200/200 Advanced.) The perceived lack of genuine competition in a growing market coincided with continuing criticism of the ailing Pan Am's internal German operation.Berlin Airport Company, February 1988 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1988 This, as well as the desire to establish a bridgehead in Europe in anticipation of European air transport liberalisation, resulted in US majors American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and TWA expressing an interest in breaking the long-standing Pan Am/BA internal German duopoly in West Berlin.Berlin Airport Company, March 1988 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1988 Four of these airlines then proceeded to apply to the US FAA as well as to West Berlin's Allied Air Attach√©s to be licensed to begin operating scheduled internal German services from West Berlin. This in turn provided the impetus for Air France and Lufthansa to secure a share of this expanding and potentially lucrative market for themselves.New Berlin carrier formed, Flight International, 16 July 1988, p. 50 The only way for Air France and Lufthansa to compete successfully in this market was by way of establishing a subsidiary with substantially lower operating costs than those of the incumbent airlines. In addition, both airlines needed to find a way that would legalise Lufthansa's provision of commercial air services from/to West Berlin to comply with post-World War II Allied rules that restricted such services to the airlines of the three Western victorious powers of World War II only.Soviets oppose new Berlin flights, Flight International, 26 November 1988, p. 15 Both airlines therefore decided to establish Euroberlin France as a jointly owned operating company in which Air France became the controlling shareholder. This was achieved by Air France taking a 51% majority stake (as opposed to Lufthansa's 49% minority stake), thereby making Euroberlin a French legal entity and enabling it to conduct commercial airline operations in West Berlin. To make the newly formed airline cost-competitive with incumbents Pan Am and British Airways, Luton-based UK independent Monarch Airlines and its sister company Monarch Aircraft Engineering were contracted to provide all aircraft and flightdeck crew as well as the aircraft's maintenance support under a wet lease arrangement. Furthermore, all functions other than employing and managing local flight attendants as well as the operational management of the airline were outsourced. Operations commenced on November 7, 1988 with four Boeing 737-300s leased from Monarch. These inaugurated high-frequency shuttle services from Berlin Tegel to Cologne/Bonn, Frankfurt, Munich and Stuttgart. Euroberlin's livery incorporated elements of both Air France's and Lufthansa's contemporary liveries using the former's corporate colours (red and blue on a white background). From the start of the 1989 summer timetable, a fifth 737-300 was leased from Monarch to increase week day frequencies on the existing four routes as well as to launch two additional routes serving D√ºsseldorf and Hamburg respectively from Euroberlin's Tegel base. From then on, Euroberlin also entered the short- to medium-haul charter market from West Berlin to help it maintain a high aircraft utilisation at week-ends when frequencies on its scheduled route network were reduced. By 1990 Euroberlin's fleet had expanded to seven Boeing 737-300s. This firmly established it as the third-largest contemporary airline operator at Berlin Tegel, a position previously held by UK independent Dan-Air Services. (Dan-Air had established a base at Berlin Tegel in 1969Berlin Airport Company, April 1969 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1969 and was the airport's third-largest operator during the decade from 1978 until 1988.Berlin Airport Company ‚Äî Summary of 1978 Annual Report, February 1979 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1979 Berlin Airport Company ‚Äî Summary of 1988 Annual Report, February 1989 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1989 Kompass ‚Äì summer 1978 and summer 1988 editions, Dan Air Services Ltd., West Berlin, 1978, 1988 ) During the 1990/91 winter season, Euroberlin leased a further three 737-300s, two of which were previously operated by A√©romaritime. Euroberlin quickly made a name for itself in the Berlin air transport market and acquired a loyal customer following as a result of its high-quality in-flight service, which was modelled on Air France's contemporary, short-haul European in-flight service.Berlin Airport Company, November 1989 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1989 This, as well as its low cost base, helped make the airline profitable within a relatively short period of time, with an average scheduled load factor of 60%. Following German [re-]unification on October 3, 1990, Air France reduced its stake in Euroberlin by 1%, while Lufthansa increased its stake by the same amount. This resulted in both airlines becoming equal owners of Euroberlin. It also resulted in Euroberlin dropping the \\"France\\" suffix from its name, including its physical removal from the aircraft's fuselage titles. German [re-]unification moreover changed Euroberlin's strategic role for Lufthansa in the Berlin market. Henceforth, the German flag carrier subcontracted Euroberlin to operate some of its internal German services from Berlin Tegel for a limited period, during which it gradually replaced Euroberlin's aircraft and employees with its own planes and staff. This was part of Lufthansa's contemporary corporate strategy to re-establish its presence in Berlin as quickly as possible after a politically enforced absence of 45 years. As a consequence of Lufthansa's new strategy for the Berlin market, Euroberlin's aircraft fleet and employee strength gradually diminished. Euroberlin was finally shut down in December 1994, resulting in the return of its remaining three 737-300s to Monarch Airlines. Fleet Euroberlin operated a single aircraft type fleet built around the Boeing 737-300 throughout its entire existence. All aircraft operated were subleased from Monarch Airlines, which in turn had leased the aircraft from external lessors. From the start of the 1989 summer season, a fifth Boeing 737-300 was leased from Monarch Airlines.Berlin Airport Company, April 1989 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1989 By 1990, the Euroberlin fleet comprised seven Boeing 737-300s, all of which were leased from Monarch.Berlin Airport Company, April 1990 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1990 Euroberlin's fleet eventually grew to a total of ten aircraft, following the introduction of an additional three 737-300s during the 1990/'91 winter season.Air France ‚Äî Chapter 9, Other Associated Airlines, Jones, G., Midland Publishing, Hersham, 2008, p. 145 References =Citations= =Bibliography= * * (various backdated issues relating to Euroberlin, 1989‚Äì1995) * * Category:Defunct airlines of France Category:Defunct airlines of Germany Category:Airlines established in 1988 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1994 Category:1988 establishments in West Germany Category:France‚ÄìGermany relations Category:German companies disestablished in 1994 Category:German companies established in 1988 Category:French companies disestablished in 1994 Category:French companies established in 1988 ","title":"Euroberlin France"},{"id":"14905840","text":"Daniel Robert Jenky, CSC (born March 3, 1947) is an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church who serves as Bishop of the Diocese of Peoria, Illinois. Biography =Early life and education= Daniel Jenky was born in Chicago, Illinois, and attended St. Laurence High School, under the direction of the Irish Christian Brothers. He entered the University of Notre Dame in 1965, and the novitiate of the Congregation of Holy Cross at Bennington, Vermont in 1966. In 1970, Jenky obtained bachelor's degree in history. He made his profession as member of the Congregation of Holy Cross in 1973, the same year in which he earned his Master of Theology degree and received his diaconate. =Ordination and ministry= Jenky was ordained to the priesthood on April 6, 1974. He then taught social studies and religion at Bourgade Catholic High School in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1975, he returned to his alma mater of Notre Dame and was Rector of Dillon Hall, Director of Campus Ministry, and Rector of Sacred Heart Church (which would later become a basilica under his tenure), teaching courses as well. In 1985, he became Superior of the Holy Cross priests and brothers at Notre Dame. =Auxiliary Bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend= On October 21, 1997, Jenky was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend and Titular Bishop of Amantia by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 16 from Bishop John M. D'Arcy, with Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan and Archbishop Charles Asa Schleck, CSC, serving as co-consecrators. Jenky was assigned as rector of St. Matthew‚Äôs Cathedral and pastor of the parish. =Bishop of Peoria= Pope John Paul II appointed Jenky Bishop of Peoria on February 12, 2002, and he was installed on April 10 of that year at St. Mary's Cathedral in Peoria. Bishop Jenky has introduced the cause for the canonization of Archbishop Fulton Sheen, a native of Peoria. In an April 2012 men's march homily, Jenky, to the applause of the attendees, included the Obama Administration‚Äôs Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on a list of things the Catholic Church has survived including the early persecution of Christians, barbarian invasions, \\"wave after wave of Jihads\\", the \\"Age of Revolution\\", Nazism, and Communism. He continued, \\"‚Ä¶the Church will survive the entrenched corruption and sheer incompetence of our Illinois state government, and even the calculated disdain of the President of the United States, his bureaucrats and HHS, and the majority in today‚Äôs Federal senate.\\"Bishop Jenky, April 14, 2012 \\"cdop.org\\"Tom Dermody, \\"'Heroic Catholicism' needed in face of threats, bishop tells men\\" April 15, 2012 The Catholic PostEric Kleefeld, \\"Bishop Of Peoria Compares Obama And Contraception Mandates To Hitler And Stalin\\" Talking Points Memo More than 90 faculty members at the University of Notre Dame, where he served as Director of Campus Ministry and Rector of the Basilica of Notre Dame before he became Auxiliary Bishop, and where he sits on the 12-member University of Notre Dame Board of Fellows, signed a letter to the University President, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, CSC, and the Chairman of Notre Dame's Board of Trustees, asking that the Bishop renounce his remarks, which they described as insensitive and as too political in tone, or resign from the Board of Fellows, though they acknowledged his constitutional right to freedom of expression. The local chapters of the NAACP, the ACLU, and the Anti-Defamation League also demanded an apology, and there were calls to have the IRS investigate the Bishop because the Diocese, as a tax-exempt, non-profit private entity, is supposed to refrain from overly political comments. Rabbi Daniel Bogard of Peoria's Anshai Emeth Congregation said that Jenky was engaging in demagoguery and using the Holocaust \\"as a partisan political ploy that trivializes the memory of 13 million innocents killed.\\"Chris Kaergard, \\"Peoria bishop sparks controversy with homily remarks\\" April 19, 2012 The Peoria Journal Star Diocesan officials, including a Vicar General, Monsignor James E.

As the bishop of Peoria, he led the canonization cause of Fulton Sheen. He announced that he would not permit the cause to go forward until the body of Archbishop Sheen was removed to Peoria from St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral in New York. This led to a 3 year litigation against the Archdiocese of New York which ended in June 2019 with the body being moved to Peoria.

A retrospective cohort study, also called a historic cohort study, is a longitudinal cohort study used in medical and psychological research. A cohort of individuals that share a common exposure factor is compared with another group of equivalent individuals not exposed to that factor, to determine the factor's influence on the incidence of a condition such as disease or death. Retrospective cohort studies have existed for approximately as long as prospective cohort studies.http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/papers/doll-paper2.pdf Design The retrospective cohort study compares groups of individuals who are alike in many ways but differ by a certain characteristic (for example, female nurses who smoke and ones who do not smoke) in terms of a particular outcome (such as lung cancer). Data on the relevant events for each individual (the form and time of exposure to a factor, the latent period, and the time of any subsequent occurrence of the outcome) are collected from existing records and can immediately be analyzed to determine the relative risk of the cohort compared to the control group. This is fundamentally the same methodology as for a prospective cohort study, except that the retrospective study is performed post-hoc, looking back. The prospective study looks forward, enrolling patients unaffected by the outcome and observing them to see whether the outcome has occurred. However, both kinds of cohort studies share the same starting point (considering data from before the occurrence of the outcome). The first objective is still to establish two groups - exposed versus non- exposed - which are then assessed retrospectively to establish the most likely temporal sequence of events leading to the current disease state in both the exposed and unexposed groups. Retrospective cohort studies require particular caution because errors due to confounding and bias are more common than in prospective studies. Advantages Retrospective cohort studies exhibit the benefits of cohort studies and have distinct advantages relative to prospective ones: *They are conducted on a smaller scale. *They typically require less time to complete. *They are generally less expensive, because resources are mainly devoted to collecting data. *They are better for analyzing multiple outcomes. *In a medical context, they can potentially address rare diseases, which would necessitate extremely large cohorts in prospective studies. Retrospective studies are especially helpful in addressing diseases of low incidence, since affected people have already been identified so .http://www.fao.org/Wairdocs/ILRI/x5436E/x5436e06.htm The fact that retrospective studies are generally less expensive than prospective studies may be another key benefit. Additionally, it has essentially all the benefits of a cohort study. Disadvantages Retrospective studies have disadvantages vis-a-vis prospective studies: *Some key statistics cannot be measured, and significant biases may affect the selection of controls.http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/retrospective+study *Researchers cannot control exposure or outcome assessment, and instead must rely on others for accurate recordkeeping. When relying on individual recall of former exposure to risk variables, recall may be inaccurate and subject to biases. It can be very difficult to make accurate comparisons between the exposed and the non-exposed. *The retrospective aspect may introduce selection bias and mis-classification or information bias.https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat507/node/54 With retrospective studies, the temporal relationship is frequently difficult to assess. *Retrospective studies may need very large sample sizes for rare outcomes. Comparison with case-control studies While retrospective cohort studies try to compare the risk of developing a disease to some already known exposure factors, a case-control study will try to determine the possible exposure factors after a known disease incidence. Both the relative risk and odds ratio are relevant in retrospective cohort studies, but only the odds ratio can be used in case-control studies. Although most case-control studies are retrospective, they can also be prospective when the researcher still enrolls participants based on the occurrence of a disease as new cases occur.

S. Jones or Wil Sam, was a Welsh-language author, playwright and scriptwriter. Life Jones was born in Llanystumdwy, and lived in the Eifionydd region in north Wales for his entire life. He worked as a mechanic before opening his own garage in the village of Llanystumdwy. He registered as a conscientious objector during the Second World War, working in food distribution. He began writing as a young man and, from 1963 onwards, wrote plays to be performed at the Theatr y Gegin in Criccieth, Gwynedd. In the mid-1970s Jones began writing for television and radio and later becoming a full-time writer writing for television and national newspapers as well as for the stage. Jones was known for the use of comedy and dialect in his work. Many of his plays contained elements of absurdity and symbolism, leading critics to make connections with the works of Beckett, N. F. Simpson and Ionesco. His most famous character, Ifas y Tryc ('Evans the Truck'), was played by Stewart Jones, a Bafta-Cymru winning actor. Among his most famous works are his plays, Dinas Barhaus (\\"Abiding City\\") (1969), Bobi a Sami (\\"Bobi and Sami\\") and Y Sul Hwnnw (\\"That Sunday\\") (1981). Other writings include his lecture on the state of Welsh theatre, Y Toblaron (\\"The Toblarone\\") (1975), a selection of stories, Dyn y Mwnci (\\"The Monkey Man\\") (1979) and a selection of his comic verse, Rhigymau Wil Sam (\\"The Rhymes of Wil Sam\\") (2005).

Hyperthermia uses higher temperatures than diathermy, which is the deep heating of body tissue for relaxation or physical therapy. Techniques that bring local tissues to quite high temperatures, such as radio frequency ablation, are also not usually included in \\"hyperthermia\\".: Hyperthermia therapy entry in the public domain NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms When combined with radiation therapy, it is called thermoradiotherapy. Definition Hyperthermia is defined as supra-normal body temperatures. There is no consensus as to what is the safest or most effective target temperature for the whole body. During treatment the body temperature reaches a level between . However, other researchers define hyperthermia between (Europe, USA) to near (Japan, Russia). =Types= Patient is undergoing local hyperthermia treatment for head and neck cancer. * Local hyperthermia heats a very small area and is typically used for cancers near or on the skin or near natural openings in the body (e.g., the mouth). In some instances, the goal is to kill the tumor by heating it, without damaging anything else. The heat may be created with microwave, radiofrequency, ultrasound energy or using magnetic hyperthermia (also known as magnetic fluid hyperthermia)). Depending on the location of the tumor, the heat may be applied to the surface of the body, inside normal body cavities, or deep in tissue through the use of needles or probes. One relatively common type is radiofrequency ablation of small tumors.Information from the U.S. National Cancer Institute This is easiest to achieve when the tumor is on a superficial part of the body, which is called superficial hyperthermia, or when needles or probes are inserted directly into the tumor, which is called interstitial hyperthermia. * Regional hyperthermia heats a larger part of the body, such as an entire organ or limb. Usually, the goal is to weaken cancer cells so that they are more likely to be killed by radiation and chemotherapeutic medications. This may use the same techniques as local hyperthermia treatment, or it may rely on blood perfusion. In blood perfusion, the patient's blood is removed from the body, heated up, and returned to blood vessels that lead directly through the desired body part. Normally, chemotherapy drugs are infused at the same time. One specialized type of this approach is continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP), which is used to treat difficult cancers within the peritoneal cavity (the abdomen), including primary peritoneal mesothelioma and stomach cancer. Hot chemotherapy drugs are pumped directly into the peritoneal cavity to kill the cancer cells. * Whole-body hyperthermia heats the entire body to temperatures of about , with some advocating even higher temperatures. It is typically used to treat metastatic cancer (cancer that spread to many parts of the body). Techniques include infrared hyperthermia domes which include the whole body or the body apart from the head, putting the patient in a very hot room/chamber, or wrapping the patient in hot, wet blankets or a water tubing suit. Treatment The St. George Klinik for hyperthermia in Germany is using it to kill Lyme disease bacteria that spread throughout the whole body. The entire body including blood is heated for approximately 2 hours. It is hypothesized that hyperthermia may be able to decrease the size of cancers. Research is ongoing. Localized hyperthermia treatment is a well-established cancer treatment method with a simple basic principle: If a temperature elevation to 40¬∫C (104¬∫F) can be maintained for one hour within a cancer tumor, the cancer cells will be destroyed. The schedule for treatments has varied between study centers. After being heated, cells develop resistance to heat, which persists for about three days and reduces the likelihood that they will die from direct effects of the heat. Some even suggest maximum treatment schedule of twice a week. Japanese researchers treated people with \\"cycles\\" up to four times a week apart. Radiosensitivity may be achieved with hyperthermia, and using heat with every radiation treatment may drive the treatment schedule. Moderate hyperthermia treatments usually maintain the temperature for approximately an hour. Adverse effects External application of heat may cause surface burns. Tissue damage to a target organ with a regional treatment will vary with what tissue is heated (e.g. brain treated directly may injure the brain, lung tissue treated directly may cause pulmonary problems) Whole body hyperthermia can cause swelling, blood clots, and bleeding. Systemic shock, may result, but is highly dependent upon method difference in achieving it. It may also cause cardiovascular toxicity. All techniques are often combined with radiation or chemotherapy, muddying how much toxicity is the result of those treatments versus the temperature elevation achieved. Technique =Heat sources= There are many techniques by which heat may be delivered. Some of the most common involve the use of focused ultrasound (FUS or HIFU), infrared sauna, microwave heating, induction heating, magnetic hyperthermia, infusion of warmed liquids, or direct application of heat such as through sitting in a hot room or wrapping a patient in hot blankets. =Controlling temperature= One of the challenges in thermal therapy is delivering the appropriate amount of heat to the correct part of the patient's body. For this technique to be effective, the temperatures must be high enough, and the temperatures must be sustained long enough, to damage or kill the cancer cells. However, if the temperatures are too high, or if they are kept elevated for too long, then serious side effects, including death, can result. The smaller the place that is heated, and the shorter the treatment time, the lower the side effects. Conversely, tumor treated too slowly or at too low a temperature will not achieve therapeutic goals. The human body is a collection of tissues with differing heat capacities, all connected by a dynamic circulatory system with variable relationship to skin or lung surfaces designed to shed heat energy. All methods of inducing higher temperature in the body are countered by the thermo-regulatory mechanisms of the body. The body as a whole relies mostly on simple radiation of energy to the surrounding air from the skin (50% of heat lost this way) which is augmented by convection (blood shunting) and vaporization through sweat and respiration. Regional methods of heating may be more or less difficult based on the anatomic relationships, and tissue components of the particular body part being treated. Measuring temperatures in various parts of the body may be very difficult, and temperatures may locally vary even within a region of the body. To minimize damage to healthy tissue and other adverse effects, attempts are made to monitor temperatures. The goal is to keep local temperatures in tumor bearing tissue under to avoid damage to surrounding tissues. These temperatures have been derived from cell culture and animal studies. The body keeps itself normal human body temperature, near . Unless a needle probe can be placed with accuracy in every tumor site amenable to measurement, there is an inherent technical difficulty in how to actually reach whatever a treating center defines as an \\"adequate\\" thermal dose. Since there is also no consensus as to what parts of the body need to be monitored (common clinically measured sites are ear drums, oral, skin, rectal, bladder, esophagus, blood probes, or even tissue needles). Clinicians have advocated various combinations for these measurements. These issues complicate the ability of comparing different studies and coming up with a definition of exactly what a thermal dose actually should be for tumor, and what dose is toxic to what tissues in human beings. Clinicians may be able to apply advanced imaging techniques, instead of probes, to monitor heat treatments in real time; heat-induced changes in tissue are sometimes perceptible using these imaging instruments. There is the further difficulty inherent in the devices delivering energy. Regional devices may not uniformly heat a target area, even without taking into account compensatory mechanisms of the body. A great deal of current research focuses on how one might precisely position heat-delivery devices (catheters, microwave and ultrasound applicators, etc.) using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, as well as developing new types of nanoparticles that can more evenly distribute heat within a target tissue. Among hyperthermia therapy methods, magnetic hyperthermia is well known as the one that produce a controllable heat inside the body. Because of using magnetic fluid in this method, temperature distribution can be controlled by the velocity, size of nanoparticles and distribution of them inside the body. These materials upon application of external, alternating magnetic field convert electromagnetic energy into thermal energy and induce temperature rises. Mechanism Hyperthermia can kill cells directly, but its more important use is in combination with other treatments for cancer. Hyperthermia increases blood flow to the warmed area, perhaps doubling perfusion in tumors, while increasing perfusion in normal tissue by ten times or even more. This enhances the delivery of medications. Hyperthermia also increases oxygen delivery to the area, which may make radiation more likely to damage and kill cells, as well as preventing cells from repairing the damage induced during the radiation session. Cancerous cells are not inherently more susceptible to the effects of heat. When compared in in vitro studies, normal cells and cancer cells show the same responses to heat. However, the vascular disorganization of a solid tumor results in an unfavorable microenvironment inside tumors. Consequently, the tumor cells are already stressed by low oxygen, higher than normal acid concentrations, and insufficient nutrients, and are thus significantly less able to tolerate the added stress of heat than a healthy cell in normal tissue. Mild hyperthermia, which provides temperatures equal to that of a naturally high fever, may stimulate natural immunological attacks against the tumor. However it is also induces a natural physiological response called thermotolerance, which tends to protect the treated tumor. Moderate hyperthermia, which heats cells in the range of , damages cells directly, in addition to making the cells radiosensitive and increasing the pore size to improve delivery of large-molecule chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents (molecular weight greater than 1,000 Daltons), such as monoclonal antibodies and liposome-encapsulated drugs. Cellular uptake of certain small molecule drugs is also increased. Very high temperatures, above , are used for ablation (direct destruction) of some tumors. This generally involves inserting a metal tube directly into the tumor, and heating the tip until the tissue next to the tube has been killed. History The application of heat to treat certain conditions, including possible tumors, has a long history. Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians used heat to treat breast masses; this is still a recommended self-care treatment for breast engorgement. Medical practitioners in ancient India used regional and whole-body hyperthermia as treatments. During the 19th century, tumor shrinkage after a high fever due to infection had been reported in a small number of cases. Typically, the reports documented the rare regression of a soft tissue sarcoma after erysipelas (an acute streptococcus bacterial infection of the skin; a different presentation of an infection by \\"flesh-eating bacteria\\") was noted. Efforts to deliberately recreate this effect led to the development of Coley's toxin. A sustained high fever after induction of illness was considered critical to treatment success. This treatment is generally considered both less effective than modern treatments and, when it includes live bacteria, inappropriately dangerous. Around the same period Westermark used localized hyperthermia to produce tumor regression in patients. Encouraging results were also reported by Warren when he treated patients with advanced cancer of various types with a combination of heat, induced with pyrogenic substance, and x-ray therapy. Out of 32 patients, 29 improved for 1 to 6 months. Properly controlled clinical trials on deliberately induced hyperthermia began in the 1970s. Future directions Hyperthermia may be combined with gene therapy, particularly using the heat shock protein 70 promoter. Two major technological challenges make hyperthermia therapy complicated: the ability to achieve a uniform temperature in a tumor, and the ability to precisely monitor the temperatures of both the tumor and the surrounding tissue. Advances in devices to deliver uniform levels of the precise amount of heat desired, and devices to measure the total dose of heat received, are hoped for. In locally advanced adenocarcinoma of middle and lower rectum, regional hyperthermia added to chemoradiotherapy achieved good results in terms of rate of sphincter sparing surgery. = Magnetic hyperthermia = Magnetic hyperthermia is an experimental treatment for cancer, based on the fact that magnetic nanoparticles can transform electromagnetic energy from an external high-frequency field to heat. This is due to the magnetic hysteresis of the material when it is subjected to an alternating magnetic field. The area enclosed by the hysteresis loop represents losses, which are commonly dissipated as thermal energy. In many industrial applications this heat is undesirable, however it is the basis for magnetic hyperthermia treatment. As a result, if magnetic nanoparticles are put inside a tumor and the whole patient is placed in an alternating magnetic field, the temperature of the tumor will rise. This elevation of temperature may enhance tumor oxygenation and radio- and chemosensitivity, hopefully shrinking tumors. This experimental cancer treatment has also been investigated for the aid of other ailments, such as bacterial infections. Magnetic hyperthermia is defined by \\"Specific Absorption Rate\\" (SAR) and it is usually expressed in watts per gram of nanoparticles.

As an undergraduate, he studied economics at Ankara University, going on to earn a master's degree in public administration and a Ph.D in political science (1986). In the 1970s he was involved in Yeniden Milli M√ºcadele Hareketi (The War of Independence Anew Movement), an anti-communist, anti-zionist and anti-imperialist reactionary movement founded by Islamist students. In the mid-1980s, around 1984-85 according to his statement, he embraced liberal views.This statement comes from the radio programme Yayla attended in 2011, titled At 25:47 he can be heard saying in Turkish ‚ÄúActually, my liberalization was perhaps before that. For example, I was a liberal in the mid-80s, as of 84-85, but I wasn't very keen on using the label.‚Äù However, Yayla went on during the 1980s to support the military junta in Turkey, writing \\"Thanks to the 12 September 1980 operation, Turkey has been freed from the blaze of terrorism, which had almost turned into a civil war, and found peace.\\" Yeni Forum 6, No. 128 (1 January 1985): 36-37. He praised the army, writing \\"... the fact that the Turkish army has established an unprecedented tradition in terms of commitment to democracy is also the guarantee of our democracy's survival\\", and praised the leader of the military junta, the Chief of the General Staff, Kenan Evren, as \\"... one of the significant sources of hope for the survival of our democracy.\\" Yeni Forum 5, No. 112 (1 May 1984): 10.https://odatv.com/atilla-yayla-12-eylulde-neler-yazmisti-2606131200.html Again, in 2007, Yayla praised Evren for his views on a possible transition to a federal system in Turkey, saying: \\"No one dares [to express these views] since freedom of speech is not developed enough [in Turkey]. Kenan Evren is in the best position to express these views. He is opening a new era in our thought life, it is a pleasant development.\\" In 1992 Yayla founded the Association for Liberal Thinking (ALT) with his colleagues and served as its chairperson between 1997 and 2008. He remains an active member of ALT. He was a visiting professor at the University of Buckingham. He was the winner of the Anthony Fisher Prize in 2000 for his book \\"Islam, Civil Society and Market Economy\\". Yayla was awarded the Person of the Year Award by the Stockholm Network in 2007. Court case In 2006, Yayla was charged with insulting the legacy of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk by calling him \\"that man\\" in a speech where he argued that the one-party period of Republic of Turkey was less democratic than the preceding period of constitutional monarchy under Ottoman empire and the early and short-lived multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey, and also strongly criticized the cult of personality that has grown up around Atat√ºrk since. Some newspapers, notably Yeni Asƒ±r proclaimed him a traitor. In a court case, he was convicted and received a suspended 15-month jail sentence. Yayla was also dismissed temporarily from his academic post. Work and views In 2008 Yayla was one of the signees of the √ñz√ºr Diliyorum (I Apologize) campaign that caused an enormous reaction in Turkey by the government and the public. The participants implicitly claimed that the Ottoman Empire was responsible for the Armenian Genocide, which Yayla had denied in the 1980s as \\"an alleged genocide that never happened\\".

The building rises 253 feet (77 m) in Downtown Cleveland. It contains 21 floors, and was completed in 1972. The AECOM Building currently stands as the 29th- tallest building in the city, tied in rank with the Ohio Savings Plaza and Ameritech Center. The architectural firm who designed the building was Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, who also designed Chicago's Willis Tower and Dubai's Burj Khalifa. The building is a part of the Bond Court complex. The Bond Court area used to contain nightclubs and bars but was cleared in the 1960s to 1970s for the office block and the Westin Hotel Cleveland. The modernist tower served as the world headquarters of Penton Media from 2000 until the company's merger with Prism Business Media. Penton Media signed a 10-year lease agreement to occupy the building in 2000; in the process, the building was also renamed from the \\"Bond Court Building\\" to the \\"Penton Media Building\\". In 2010, Optima International LLC bought the Penton Building, they own the One Cleveland Center building diagonally across the street from the Penton Building.

Papilio godeffroyi in Seitz The Macrolepidoptera of the World (bottom row) The species was named to honour Johann Cesar Godeffroy by Georg Semper The collection was founded by Johann Cesar VI. Godeffroy, who became a wealthy shipping magnate a few years after the expansion of the trade towards Australia and the South Seas. His expert collectors and captains brought back to Hamburg zoological, botanical and ethnographic material. Captains of vessels, traders and missionaries received exact instructions and appropriate equipment so that they could collect soft bodied animals into alcohol, properly set butterflies or beetles, and prepare bird and mammal skins and skulls. Herbarium instructions and mineral collecting kits were also issued. Duplicate or unwanted parts were sold. Throughout the museum's history it also sold human skulls from the Pacific regions (including Australia) where the company had a monopoly. This was very profitable. Anthropometry and \\"Missing Link\\" theories required especially Aborigine skulls and these were sold to scientific institutions and museums worldwide. The more important material was sold to Otto Finsch and Rudolf Virchow, then pre-eminent German physical anthropologists. The museum opened in 1861 in parts of the Kontorh√§user (Counting House Building) of the company \\"J. C. Godeffroy & son\\". The exhibition on two floors covered the natural history, ethnography and anthropology of the South Seas. Mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibia, butterflies, beetles and other insects, marine life (especially shells), masks, totems, costume, weapons, personal ornament and anthropological subjects, aboriginal skulls, photographs of native peoples and so on were displayed in small cases. Larger items, such as boats and reconstructed houses, stood free. Admission was weekdays from 11 to 14 o'clock for one Mark, and on the weekends from 10 to 14 o'clock for 50 Pfennig. Experts in various fields (\\"Auftragssammler\\") were employed on expeditions and for scientific examination and other work on the collection. They included Eduard Heinrich Graeffe, Amalie Dietrich, Johann Stanislaus Kubary, Richard Parkinson, Andrew Garrett, Eduard D√§mel, Franz H√ºbner, Alfred Tetens and Theodor Kleinschmidt, among others. The overall curator was Johann Schmeltz (1839‚Äì1909). In addition, he provided 1865 and 1881 sales catalogs and edited the Journal des Museum Godeffroy. A number of binomial names were published for the first time in these publications giving them significance in classification. The Semper brothers, also from Hamburg, Otto (1830‚Äì1907), Karl (1832‚Äì1893) and Georg (1837‚Äì1909) played an important part in the assembly and conservation of the museum's holdings. Georg named the rare Samoa butterfly Papilio godeffroyi for Johann Godeffroy. After the discontinuation of all payments in Dec. 1879 the museum existed further as it did not belong to the company J.C. Godeffroy & Son anymore. Dr. Wilhelm Godeffroy became the owner for a grant to the company. Since 1881 the museum had been threatened in its existence, as all buildings should be pulled down in the area. The abridgement began 1885. The same year in which Cesar Godeffroy died, Dr. Wilhelm Godeffroy finished the negotiations without reaching his wish, to keep the collection in its own rooms in Hamburg. A large number of exhibits and specimens survive today in the Museum f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde zu LeipzigMuseum f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde zu Leipzig (now merged with the Staatlichen Ethnographischen Sammlung Sachsens and containing 5000 objects comprehensive for Micronesia and Fiji and including objects from Melanesia and Polynesia); the Museum f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde Hamburg; the Ethnological Museum of Berlin; the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford; and the D'Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum in Dundee. There is also zoological material in the Biozentrum Grindel und Zoologisches Museum,Biozentrum Grindel und Zoologisches Museum the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin, the Civico Museo di Storia Naturale di Trieste and the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna.The Godeffroy Collection of Australian and South Pacific insects is in the Victoria Museum in Melbourne, Australia.The zoological material supports Faunistic of Oceania and Australasia Johann Schmeltz, the former curator was already a co-worker of the Ethnographic Museum in Leiden (now the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde), which had purchased parts of the ethnographic collection.

They still supply the canal, and also provide leisure facilities, including sailing, fishing and walking. The northern banks of the lakes form the county boundary with the West Midlands. History Earlswood engine house The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal runs from Kings Norton Junction, where it joins the Worcester and Birmingham Canal to Stratford-upon-Avon, where it joins the River Avon, with a junction about halfway along at Kingswood, where it joins the Grand Union Canal. The initial 9.75 miles (15.6 km) to Hockley Heath is level, but after that, the canal drops through 55 locks on its way to Stratford-upon-Avon. In order to supply water to the system, the Earlswood Lakes were constructed in the 1820s. Construction took nearly 5 years to complete, and the labour force included prisoners of war from the Napoleonic wars. Some people say that lying at the bottom of all the lakes are the dead bodies of people who died while being forced to make the pools and they had no place to be buried so they were left there, either in groups or alone. Also the cost of construction was ¬£297,000. Being so near to Birmingham, the lakes proved attractive to visitors from the city from the early 1900s, and their popularity has been maintained, with recent improvements to the facilities which they provide. The Lakes railway station was built to bring tourists to the area and is on the Birmingham to Stratford line. The three reservoirs are called Engine Pool, Windmill Pool and Terry's Pool, and a Grade II listed engine house is located beside the Engine Pool. The lakes cover , and respectively. The lakes are fed by tributaries of the River Blythe, and in turn outfall into that river also. Facilities The lakes were managed by British Waterways, but in 1997, the Earlswood Lakes Partnership was formed, with additional representation from the Waterways Trust and the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust. This body has responsibility for the management of the lakes, which now provide a variety of recreational activities. Terry's Pool =Fishing= All three lakes are stocked with fish and are popular both locally, and as a venue for fishing matches. Prior to 1999, the fish stocks were mainly Bream and Roach and were unmanaged, but with a decline in the call for fishing of this type, major changes were made. The Engine Pool was drained to a very low level, and all of the large bream were moved to the Windmill pool, while the rest of the fish were moved to local canals. The pool was then refilled and stocked with five tons of Carp in 2000. New car parks, walkways and fishing platforms were constructed, to improve the facilities, and these are well-used, although the platforms are less useful during the summer months when the water levels drop, as water is used to feed the canal.Fisheries: Earlswood Engine pool was recently drained due to high levels of dirty water. All the fish from Engine pool have been put into the adjacent canal. Earlswood said that the pool that was drained out will hopefully be filled up by 2020 with a new stock of baby carps. The Engine Pool contains mainly carp, and has flourished, to the extent that it held the UK five-hour match record in 2000, when 414 lb (188 kg) of fish were caught in a five-hour period. Bream, together with roach and perch can be caught in the Windmill Pool, although care is needed as the pool is also home to a sailing club. Terry's Pool is still an unmanaged fishery, containing bream, roach and perch, together with pike and some carp. =Sailing= Windmill Pool is the home to the Earlswood Lakes Sailing Club, which was formed in 1963, by R Lewis, and as of 2007, has over 100 members. Most modern classes of boat can be sailed, including Merlin- Rocket, Enterprise, National 12, Laser, Toppers, Mirrors and Solos. Sailing by young people from 8 to 15 years of age is encouraged, using boats in the Optimist or Topper class. The sailing club have a clubhouse which overlooks the pool.Earlswood Lakes Sailing Club =Walking= The managing Partnership was awarded a grant from the Local Heritage Initiative in 2002, which resulted in the upgrading of pathways around the site, to create a trail around the lakes, much of which is accessible to mobility-impaired users. Leaflets and children's activity sheets have been produced, together with marker posts to aid the interpretation of the site.Solihull Online: Earlswood Lakes =Craft Centre= The Earlswood Lakes Craft Centre was established in 1981, when it was part of Manor Farm. Mr Terry Osborne sold it to a major company from Stratford. It has since become autonomous, changing its name and ownership in 2001, and currently contains 23 units providing a wide range of craft products. Great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum can be found around the lakes =Wildlife= Terry's Pool is a wildlife reserve, and the whole area has a rich variety of plant and animal life. This includes Pipistrellus and Daubenton's bats, muntjac deer,Earlswood Craft Centre: Wildlife and more recently, otters. Snapping turtles also dwell in the lakes, proved when a carp fisherman caught a 33 pound (16 kilo) specimen on 2 September 2008. Many varieties of plant and tree life can be found in and around the shores of the lakes and the water channels. Plants such as Angelica, great willowherb, amphibious bistort, betony, gipsywort and yellow flag iris are all common to the area. Many water loving willow trees can be seen around the lakes, these are managed to promote new growth and more willow trees. As of 2010, there are signs that otters frequent the Engine Pool, and there are hopes that breeding pairs will make it their permanent home. An unwanted pest however is the mink that have escaped or been released from fur farms and have found their way onto the lakes via the network of rivers and canals in the area. To the west, the lakes are bounded by the site of special scientific interest Clowes Wood and New Fallings Coppice. The site was notified in 1973, and includes for 45.3 hectares (111.9 acres) of woodland, divided in part by the Birmingham to Stratford railway. The ancient woodlands are excellent examples of lowland mixed oakwoods, and support a large and important breeding bird population. Forty-nine species of woodland bird breed in Clowes Wood, including all three species of woodpecker and six species of tits, including willow tit. Also the wood warbler, lesser whitethroat and grasshopper warbler breed regularly along with five other species of warbler. Predators include for Eurasian sparrowhawks, common kestrels and the tawny owl.

He was forced to surrender his boat in World War II after he had succeeded in rescuing her and her crew from the sea bed after she struck a mine. He was honourably acquitted at the inevitable court-martial after spending five years as a prisoner of war. After the war Lonsdale took Anglican holy orders, serving in several parishes. In 1952 he volunteered to go as a District Chaplain to Kenya, to help find a peaceful solution to the Mau Mau Uprising. Early life Lonsdale was born in Dublin and educated at St. Cyprian's School, Eastbourne and the Royal Naval College, Osborne. He began in the submarine branch of the service in 1927 and within four years was first lieutenant of XI, a large experimental submersible. With four 5.2-inch guns and displacing 2,780 tons this was one of the largest submersibles of the era. In 1934 he passed the demanding submarine command qualifying course, and his first command was H44, a legacy of World War I, of 440 tons, with four torpedo tubes and a machine-gun. Lonsdale was promoted lieutenant-commander in May 1936 and in 1937 he took over the newer Swordfish for a year. HMS Seal Lonsdale's next command on 1 November 1938 was Seal, a Grampus-class submarine, which he commissioned in May 1939. It undertook a mission in the China Sea. When World War II broke out it was held up at Aden. It returned to the North Atlantic and the North Sea Patrol.C. E. T.Warren and James Benson, Will Not We Fear, George G. Harrap & Co., 1961 pp. 46‚Äì138 The submarine was then given the task of crossing the Skagerrak and laying a minefield in the Kattegat. This operation, named FD7, was part of the Norwegian campaign of early 1940. Lonsdale's superior, Captain Jocelyn Slingsby \\"Jock\\" Bethell, commanding 6th Submarine Flotilla, considered the operation too dangerous for a large mine-laying submarine. But he failed to persuade Admiral Max Horton to reconsider his orders, and Seal sailed from Immingham on 29 April 1940. In the small hours of the morning of 4 May, Seal entered the Kattegat on the surface, where it was spotted by a Heinkel He 115 and bombed. After repairs, it continued south-east, encountering German anti- submarine trawlers between L√¶s√∏ and Gothenburg. Stymied in a calm sea, Lonsdale mined an area by Vinga. Turning back on a bearing for Skagen, Seal observed E-boats. As it took evasive action, it hit a newly-laid \\"Skagen barrier\\" minefield. While it dived, a diving plane snagged a mine's anchor line to escape the area when she went into an uncharted minefield. A mine explosion at 1855 caused serious stern damage to the submarine. The attempt to resurface had to wait some hours until it was dark. In three attempts, the damaged submarine failed to lift from the seabed and air quality deteriorated significantly. Lonsdale summoned his ship's company and led them in the Lord's Prayer. After taking some last desperate measures, he made another attempt and the submarine finally lifted. Once on the surface Lonsdale tried to make for the nearby Swedish coast and the crew destroyed the secret Asdic equipment and confidential papers. The submarine was spotted and attacked by enemy aircraft. Lonsdale sent his crew below, and under fire tried to hold the aircraft off with Lewis guns until these jammed. There was no realistic alternative but to surrender: actions were taken to scuttle it, but Seal stayed afloat. Prisoner of war Early on 5 May 1940, Lonsdale swam to a seaplane and gave himself up. Later it was known that Horton had sent two signals in response to his surfacing signal relaying his intention to make for Sweden: \\"Understood and agreed with. Best of luck. Well done\\", followed by \\"Safety of personnel should be your first consideration after destruction of Asdics\\". These were not received because the ciphers had been destroyed. He was mentioned in despatches four days later for his previous patrol work. During his five years of imprisonment, Lonsdale found comfort in his Christian faith. He maintained contact with the village of Seal who had adopted the crew. Once he wrote \\"Within the last few days I have had a talk with each one of my crew who are in this camp. Despite a hard winter, enforced idleness, and the unnatural life led by any prisoner they all look fit; I cannot emphasis this too much; they really do look well, which is great credit to them and I would be grateful if you could let their next of kin know as you kindly did before.\\" He worked to maintain morale and used his limited ration of mail on behalf of his crew members. After the war, Lonsdale was mentioned in despatches in June 1945 for his services as a prisoner of war, promoted to commander and placed on the retired list at his own request. His last command was the new , which he brought up from Glanton before joining an operational flotilla at Portsmouth in January 1946. Lonsdale was tried by court martial at Portsmouth, on 10 April 1946, for the loss of Seal. He was acquitted with an honourable discharge.C. E. T. Warren and James Benson, Will Not We Fear, George G. Harrap & Co., 1961, pp. 139‚Äì228 Kenya Lonsdale went to Ridley Hall in Cambridge in 1946 to prepare for his ordination and became a priest in 1949. His first curacy was with a mission church at Rowner, near HMS Dolphin, the submarine base at Gosport, followed by becoming vicar of Morden-with-Almer in Dorset in 1951. In 1953 he started a five-year tour in the White Highlands of Kenya as a district chaplain. He volunteered for this mission because he thought that his five years as a prisoner of war should help him to befriend the Mau Mau rebels, and at one point he offered to live in the bush as a hostage, to demonstrate Britain's benevolent intentions. England In 1958 he returned to England to be vicar of Bentworth-with-Shaldon in Hampshire but then in 1960 returned out of affection to Kenya for another tour of duty. He became a canon emeritus, and his last full-time incumbency was from 1965 to 1970 as vicar of Thornham-with-Titchwell on the north Norfolk coast. Lonsdale retired to Hampshire, but held several part-time chaplaincies for the Anglican Church's European diocese based on Gibraltar. This led to a three-year stay in Tenerife (1970‚Äì73) before he returned to England for some time in the clergy hospice at College of St Mark at Audley End. Lonsdale died at Bournemouth, Dorset. Personal life Lonsdale was married four times, and had one son. #His first wife Christina Lyall, whom he married in 1935, died in 1937 in childbirth.C. E. T. Warren and James Benson, Will Not We Fear George G Harrap & Co, 1961 p17 #In 1953 he married Kathleen Deal, whom he took out to Kenya; she died in 1961. #In 1963 he married Ursula Sansum, a former Women's Royal Naval Service officer, who also supported him in Kenya; she died in 1986. #He married Ethne Irwin in Malta in 1989. She survived him. He was survived also by his son John Lonsdale, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, a historian of East Africa. In 1960, C. E. T. Warren and James Benson asked Rupert Lonsdale for his help with their book about the loss of Seal, Will Not We Fear: The Story of His Majesty's Submarine \\"Seal\\" and of Lieutenant-Commander Rupert Lonsdale (1961). He agreed, provided that he could write a foreword making it clear that he was a reluctant contributor, who trusted that it might help some readers to find faith in God. The book includes a tribute from him to his ship's company and the authors prefaced his foreword with the first seven verses of Psalm XLVI from which they drew their title. Sainsbury wrote that \\"his quiet and considerate approach to command succeeded to an unusually high degree.\\" Notes References External links * Trial report * Rupert Lonsdale dies at 93 - The New York Times, 31 May 1999 Category:1905 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Royal Navy officers of World War II Category:Royal Navy submarine commanders Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany Category:British World War II prisoners of war Category:Anglicanism in Kenya Category:British people of the Mau Mau Uprising Category:20th-century English Anglican priests Category:People educated at St Cyprian's School ","title":"Rupert Lonsdale"},{"id":"14906277","text":"Only Angels Have Wings is a 1939 film starring Cary Grant and Jean Arthur.

In the game, players build domains by laying tiles representing buildings on three game boards, each representing the same area in three different ages. By paying one coin, players can time travel between the different ages. The game lasts seven turns. Players receive money based on the strength of their buildings in the various ages at the end of their fourth and seventh turns. There are three kinds of buildings, each represented by a different colour: military (orange), religious (purple), and civil (blue). Each colour is most powerful in one of the three ages. Each building costs a certain amount of correctly coloured cards (drawn on each turn) to build. The building cost is also the number of coins a building generates when scoring takes place.

The name derives from the fact that it is (usually) the largest church where all gather together to celebrate the major feast days of the liturgical year. In Russia, it is common for a katholikon to have a smaller church in the basement which can be more easily heated in the winter. A katholikon may have special architectural features in it, such as a kathedra (episcopal throne), or both an esonarthex (inner-narthex) and exonarthex (outer narthex), used for special services such as the Paschal vigil or a lity. The word katholikon is often translated into English as cathedral rather than assembly and that can cause confusion.

However an Eastern Orthodox diocese may have several katholikons, only one of which is the bishop's cathedral, other important churches being known as katholicons. The rector of such churches is usually an archpriest.

He is the Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island. Tobin is known for his conservative views and pro-life teachings. Biography =Early life and ordination= Thomas Tobin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He studied at St. Mark Seminary High School and Gannon University, both in Erie, before entering St. Francis University in Loretto where he received his BA in 1969, and the Pontifical North American College and Pontifical Gregorian University, both in Rome. He also pursued his graduate studies at the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm in Rome. Tobin was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Vincent Leonard on July 21, 1973, and then served as an assistant pastor at St. Vitus Parish in New Castle until 1979. From 1979 to 1984, he was an assistant pastor at St. Sebastian Parish in Ross Township, later becoming administrative secretary to Bishop Anthony Bevilacqua, Associate General Secretary of the Diocese of Pittsburgh (1987), and Vicar General and General Secretary (1990). =Bishop= Auxiliary Bishop of Pittsburgh On November 3, 1992, Tobin was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Pittsburgh and Titular Bishop of Novica by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on December 27, 1992, from Bishop Donald Wuerl, with Bishops Anthony Bosco and Nicholas C. Dattilo serving as co-consecrators. When a 2018 grand jury report detailed sexual abuse in the Diocese during his time there from 1992 to 1995, Tobin said he \\"became aware of incidents of sexual abuse when they were reported\\" but was \\"not primarily responsible for clergy issues ‚Ä¶ Issues involving clergy were handled directly by the Diocesan Bishop with the assistance of the clergy office‚Äù. He also said that he carried out \\"other administrative duties such as budgets, property, diocesan staff, working with consultative groups\\". Bishop of Youngstown Tobin was named Bishop of Youngstown, Ohio on December 5, 1995, and installed there on February 2, 1996. In 1997, he was given an honorary doctorate from his alma mater of St. Francis University. Bishop of Providence Pope John Paul II appointed Tobin Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, on March 31, 2005 as one of his last appointments of a bishop during the pope's 26-year reign; he was installed on May 31, 2005. Bishop Tobin sits on the Board of Trustees of Providence College and of Salve Regina University. He also maintains a column for his diocesan newspaper, Without a Doubt. These columns have been published in two volumes: Without a Doubt: Bringing Faith to Life and Effective Faith: Faith that Makes a Difference. =Views= In November 2009, Rhode Island Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy said Tobin told him not to take Communion because of his support for the legalization of access to abortion. Tobin said he had written Kennedy in confidence in 2007 and never intended a public discussion, adding \\"At the same time, I will absolutely respond publicly and strongly whenever he attacks the Catholic Church, misrepresents the teachings of the Church, or issues inaccurate statements about my pastoral ministry.\\" Tobin is an avid Pittsburgh Steelers fan, and displays a Steeler banner on his residence during each game day. When President Obama announced support for same-sex marriage, Tobin said it was \\"a sad day in American history\\". His views on Catholic morality and voting have included the concept that voting for a pro-choice, feminist, or pro-LGBTQ candidate is morally unacceptable. He also stated: In August 2013, Tobin announced that he had changed his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing the Democratic Party's support for abortion access as his primary reason for doing so. Later in the year, he criticized Pope Francis on multiple occasions. After the Pope reprimanded Catholics who \\"obsess\\" over abortion, Tobin, without mentioning the Pope by name, called it \\"a very important obsession\\". \\"It‚Äôs one thing for him to reach out and embrace and kiss little children,\\" Tobin said. \\"It would also be wonderful if in a spiritual way he would reach out and embrace and kiss unborn children.\\" He added that he was \\"a little disappointed in Pope Francis.\\" Many Rhode Island lawmakers criticized Tobin for his words, both on abortion and homosexuality, with one alleging that his tone was \\"not very Christian-like.\\" Many publicly stated that they preferred Francis's less dogmatic approach. Tobin later defended himself, referring to his comments as \\"little concerns,\\" adding that he had said \\"a lot of nice things\\" about the Pope. On a separate occasion, he asked, \\"Is an ‚Äòeasy‚Äô church, devoid of any moral imperatives or challenge, being faithful to its mission?\\" On June 1, 2019, Tobin tweeted: He received both backlash and support for the tweet, and as reported by the Catholic News Agency and others, of the over 88,000 responses and comments, most were critical. After the RI arts magazine Motif published a critical open letter to the bishop as a signed op-ed in response to the tweet, the diocese withdrew permission for the state Theater Awards, hosted and sponsored by the magazine, scheduled to be held only two months later at church-controlled McVinney Auditorium where the event had been held previously, with both The Boston Globe and The Providence Journal quoting a spokesperson for the Diocese of Providence citing the op-ed as the reason for canceling the booking: \\"Motif Magazine published and embraced an open letter which does not comply with our venue‚Äôs policies. McVinney Auditorium did not have a signed contract in place for this event and felt it in the best interest of both parties to not host the magazine‚Äôs award ceremony this year.\\"  References  External links *Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence Official Site *Book: Effective Faith: Faith that Makes a Difference *Without a Doubt Column Archive Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Providence Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Youngstown Category:American Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh Category:Gannon University alumni Category:Saint Francis University alumni Category:Religious leaders from Pennsylvania Category:Rhode Island Republicans ","title":"Thomas Joseph Tobin"},{"id":"14906448","text":"The Bega MicƒÉ is a left tributary of the river Timi»ôa»õ in Romania.

It is located to the NW of Pleasley village which sits above the north bank of the River Meden on the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire border. The colliery is located to the NW of Pleasley village which sits above the north bank of the River Meden on the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire border. It lies 3 miles (4.8 km) north of Mansfield and 9 miles (14.5 km) south of Chesterfield. From the south it commands a prominent position on the skyline, although less so now than when the winders were in operation and both chimney stacks were in place. The colliery is situated at about 500 ft (152m) above sea level and is aligned on a NE-SW axis following the trend of the river valley at this point. After closure of the colliery in 1986, most of the surface infrastructure was demolished and what remains are the two headstocks which stood above the shafts, the engine-house complex containing the two steam winders which were used to raise the coal, one dating from 1904 and the other from 1922, together with one of the 40m high brick chimneys which served the steam boiler range. The engine-house complex is a grade 2 listed building and the site has been scheduled as an Ancient Monument. The site is owned and managed by the Land Trust and the licensed occupiers are the Friends of Pleasley Pit restoration group who set the wheels in motion to ensure the preservation of the site and have been responsible for the renovation the two unique steam winders. The parent organisation of the Friends is the Pleasley Pit Trust, a registered charity, which is now undertaking the transformation of the site into a mining heritage centre. The old pit tip was reworked to extract residual coal after which it was landscaped to create a nature reserve consisting of footpaths and lakes. The two adjacent railway lines were part of an extensive network serving the Nottinghamshire - Derbyshire coal field and the disused tracks have been converted into cycle trails linking the collieries to the west and nearby Hardwick Hall. History =Timeline= It was sunk in the 1870s and produced coal until 1983. It still retains its headstocks, engine-houses and steam winders, one of which was installed in 1904 by Lilleshall Co. Ltd. and the other in 1922 by Markham & Co. Ltd. Pleasley Colliery is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is in the process of being developed into a mining heritage site. The headstocks, engine-houses and chimney have undergone major conservation work and the two unique steam winders have been restored by members of the Friends of Pleasley Pit preservation group. =1872-1879= In 1872 a lease for the extraction of coal from the Top Hard seam, together with the construction and operation of a colliery, was granted to the Stanton Iron Company by William Edward Nightingale, the father of the famous Victorian nursing pioneer, Florence Nightingale. (Florence is reputed to have ‚Äúturned the first sod‚Äù at the commencement of sinking). William (n√©e Shore) was lord of the manor of Pleasley, having bought the manor in 1823 for ¬£38,000. He died in a tragic accident in 1874 and the manor passed to his other daughter, Parthenon, the wife of Sir Harry Verney. A large field on the brow of the hill overlooking the River Meden valley was chosen and work soon started on leveling the site and preparing the surface infrastructure and access roads. During 1873 sinking commenced at the two 14.5 ft. diameter shafts and the engine-houses were constructed in time for the installation the following year of two pairs of steam winding engines built by the Worsley Mesnes Iron Co which were initially used for powering the pumps. The sinking soon ran into difficulties due to the high volumes of water encountered in the first 150 yd. and progress was halted for four to five months after the sinking pumps had been overwhelmed. In order to deal with the large feeders of water now encountered, four 18in. diameter pumps were then installed in the No. 1 shaft and sinking at the No.2 shaft was discontinued. The subsequent impact of the pumping was considerable, with wells and springs over a wide area drying up and the water disappearing from the Mansfield quarries almost 3 miles away. In order to hold back the water, the shaft had to be lined for about 115 yds with cast-iron tubbing, a slow and expensive operation. When sinking was resumed below this, the strata was much drier and most of the pumping equipment was removed. Sinking proceeded without further problems and the Top Hard seam was eventually reached in February 1877. The pumps were then installed in the No. 2 shaft and sinking was resumed there. Similar volumes of water were encountered and this shaft also required the installation of a similar length of tubbing. Later that year, in order to raise further capital, the Stanton Iron Co. decided to incorporate as a limited company and, early in 1878, 5752 shares were issued. The sinking headframes were then removed at the No. 1 shaft and the permanent headstocks erected. By the end of the year, the fitting-out work above and below ground was approaching completion and when the Top Hard seam was finally reached in the No. 2 shaft in February 1879 the Directors could report that the sinking had been completed and that production was ready to commence. =1881-1890= The sinking coincided with the onset of a serious depression in the iron and coal trade and although this continued for a number of years, output from Pleasley began to steadily increase, thanks to its freedom from serious geological problems. A disturbed fault zone was soon encountered a short distance to the north-east but the workings to the north and west were fault free. In 1881 electric lighting of the pit bottom and the coal face was demonstrated to the Royal Commission on Accidents in Mines by the electrical engineer R.E.B. Crompton. By October of that year the monthly output was about 9600 tons and by August the following year it had risen to 13,000 tons. Two years later, the figure for August stood at 17,250 tons, outstripping that of Stanton Iron Co.‚Äôs first colliery at Teversal which had been in operation since 1868. In 1888, production had increased to such an extent that the main winding shaft had reached its maximum capacity. The upcast shaft was then fitted out for coal winding and output continued to climb. By 1890, with output averaging 1000 tons per day, the underground haulage of coal from the North dip workings by ponies had become unsustainable and a 60HP electrically driven underground rope-haulage system - the first of its kind in the world - was installed near the downcast pit bottom to haul coal up the 1 in 12 roadway from the North workings. During the next seven years, a further four electrically driven rope haulages were installed, freeing up 44 horses and raising output to 1700 tons per day. =1899-1919= By 1899, despite having encountered a 25 ft. fault and an extensive washout in the workings to the West, output was such that the winding capacity had been reached at the upcast shaft and it was decided to install a more powerful winder and boilers whilst at the same time replacing the old wooden headstock which was now in a poor condition. This work was carried out in 1900, with all production temporarily shifted to the downcast shaft by means of two shift working. The following year, owing to the very poor condition of the old timber frame, the headstock at the downcast shaft was also replaced, although this time it was pre-erected on the pit-top and then winched into position. Over the next two decades, many changes took place on the surface. In 1904 the drum shaft on the downcast shaft winder fractured and a new, more powerful winder was installed. Older boilers were replaced, more powerful fans were installed, new screening plant erected and turbine generators running off the exhaust steam from the winders were commissioned. Finally, in 1919, work commenced on deepening the upcast shaft to enable access to the lower seams =1921-1938= In 1921 the deepening to the Blackshale seam was completed. In order to wind from this level a much larger winder was installed requiring part of the engine-house to be completely rebuilt to accommodate it. The steam plant was consolidated into a single range of boilers, and a new power-house containing a large mixed-pressure turbo-generator was constructed. Following inspection of the deeper seams, it was decided to only work the Deep Hard coal at that point. A 1 in 2 cross-measures drift was driven from the Top Hard seam for ventilation purposes and the opening-out began. Three longwall faces in the 3 ft thick seam were commenced, but the ensuing recession appears to have made it uneconomic and production ceased in 1927, all output then being concentrated back in the Top Hard seam, the workings of which were now becoming quite extensive. By this time, most of the coal to the north of the river Meden had been worked out and production had shifted to the reserves to the south. By the late 1930s, however, these reserves were diminishing rapidly, and exploratory working began in the two underlying seams, the Dunsil and 1st Waterloo. In 1938, 1,261 men were employed underground and a further 283 on the surface. Electric coal cutters had been in use for some time, but the coal was still being hand loaded, although now onto conveyor belts on the coal face rather than directly into tubs. The new seams were considerably thinner than the 5.5 ft. thick Top Hard and it was anticipated that a larger quantity of small coal would be created. In order to process this, a 150-ton per hour washery plant was constructed a few hundred yards to the south-west. This plant was to play a key role in subsequent years when mechanized loading was introduced and the demand for small coal for power generation soared. =1945-1951= After World War II, the development of the Dunsil and 1st Waterloo seams accelerated and, once again, the Deep Hard seam was revisited. Manpower was in short supply, though. In 1945, although there were still 281 men on the surface, there were only 895 underground. Now, however, Huwood power loaders were being deployed on the coal face and the washery plant really began to earn its keep. In the late 1940s, following nationalisation, a major development program was begun. Tubs were replaced by 3 ton mine-cars and on the surface, compact circuits were constructed, with fully automatic pneumatic systems controlling their movement and emptying. At the downcast shaft, a complete new pit-bottom and mine-car haulage system was constructed in the deeper 2nd Waterloo seam, with the shaft itself being deepened by driving up from below, whilst in the upcast pit-bottom, a compact mine-car circuit was constructed, with the coal now being transported almost to the shaft-side by powerful trunk conveyor belts. In 1951, the last face in the Top Hard seam finished, more than three miles traveling distance south of the pit bottom, but the main output from the downcast shaft had already moved to the Dunsil and 1st Waterloo seams. At this time, the Dunsil was being worked to the south-east of the shaft, whilst the 1st Waterloo workings were to the north-west. Meanwhile, in the Deep Hard seam, whilst redevelopment proceeded, production was focused on the north side. =1957-1983= Pleasley Colliery - South Shaft. In 1957 Pleasley saw the launch of a short enclosed tunnel carrying the trunk conveyor from the main intake airway through into a return airway close to the pit-bottom. With typical mining humour, it was named Sputnik by the men. Its official name has been long forgotten. At about this time, cross-measure drifts were also being driven down to the underlying Piper seam to the south of the pit-bottom and a new face was headed out. This face advanced below the earlier workings in the Deep Hard until it had reached a position beyond their final working point. Near to the pit-bottom, the Piper seam was separated from the Deep Hard by about 10yds but as the face moved out, the distance decreased until they were separated by only a short distance. At this point short drifts were driven up into the Deep Hard and new faces were then opened out back in this seam and within a short distance they were working a combined thickness of coal of about 2 ‚Äì 2.5 m. Two other faces had been opened out closer to the pit-bottom in the Piper, but no further development took place in that seam except for a parallel one running back towards the pit-bottom. By this time, production had ceased both in the Dunsil and 1st Waterloo seams and in the Deep Hard north-side districts. All subsequent output now came from the combined Deep Hard / Piper workings to the south-east. Although the projected output was high, the surface infrastructure at Pleasley was now feeling its age, and with the sinking of a large surface drift and the construction of new coal processing plant at nearby Shirebrook colliery it was decided to switch all output to there. With the cessation of coal-winding at Pleasley, the colliery had breathed its last, but it received a sort of artificial respiration by being used for man-riding and materials until eventual closure in 1983. =1983-1996= The upcast shaft was converted to supply air to Shirebrook‚Äôs workings for several years and this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The work involved in filling the downcast shaft, together with the removal of the baths, washery, screens etc. all took time and provided the opportunity for the local authority to have the remains given a preservation listing just as their demolition began in 1986. It then continued in a state of limbo for several more years until 1995 when the preservation group Friends of Pleasley Pit was formed and restoration work began. In 1996 Pleasley Colliery was scheduled as an Ancient Monument and the rapidly deteriorating roof on the engine-house complex was completely renewed and the 40m tall brick chimney underwent major renovation. = 1996-2016 = In the 10 years following the formation of the Friends of Pleasley Pit an enormous amount of work was done by the volunteers, first in clearing out the years of accumulated filth from inside the engine-house complex and then beginning the difficult task of dismantling the two steam winders ready for their subsequent renovation. By the end of 2005 the No. 1 winder had been reassembled and painted and by 2007 it was being turned by an electric motor friction drive. Restoration work then focused on the much larger No.2 winder. In 2010, with funding provided by English Heritage, the two headstocks and the engine-house complex underwent major conservation repairs by Robert Woodhouse Ltd. and as a result of the combined efforts of everyone involved, the restoration work won several regional and national awards including the English Heritage Angel Awards in 2011 and the EMCBE Constructing Excellence Heritage Awards. Meanwhile, the restoration and preservation of the two steam winding engines that are such a special feature of this pit continues in the capable hands of the Friends of Pleasley Pit volunteers whose next objective is to commission an electric motor friction drive for the No, 2 winder before beginning the next phase of converting the No. 1 winder so as to be turned under steam.

Hitchens wrote introductions to each article he compiled for the book. The main introduction is centered on an unbeliever's point of view, what he is constantly told, \\"and the errors incurred by religion, since the pre-history of our species, in identifying not just the wrong explanation but the wrong culprit in episodes of nightmarish ignorance and calamity\\". In an anthology of atheist and agnostic thought, going back to the early Greeks, Hitchens writes briefly about the selected essays of past and present philosophers, scientists, and other thinkers such as Lucretius, Benedict de Spinoza, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Mark Twain, George Eliot, Bertrand Russell, Emma Goldman, H. L. Mencken, Albert Einstein, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, Victor J. Stenger and Richard Dawkins ‚àí with original pieces by Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali. For Hitchens, \\"religion invents a problem where none exists by describing the wicked as also made in \\"the image of god and the sexually nonconformist as existing in a state of incurable mortal sin that can incidentally cause floods and earthquakes.\\"Humanist Society of Santa Barbara \\"The only position that leaves me with no cognitive dissonance is atheism. Death is certain ... Life on this earth, with all its mystery and beauty and pain, is then to be lived far more intensely: we stumble and get up, we are sad, confident, insecure, feel loneliness and joy and love. There is nothing more; but I want nothing more.\\" Hitchens dedicated the anthology to the memory of Primo Levi and prefaces the book with quotes from Levi's If This Is a Man and The Drowned and the Saved. Overview For Hitchens, arguments for atheism can be divided into two main categories: those that dispute the existence of God and those that demonstrate the ill effects of religion. \\"Religion\\", he defines, \\"is, after all, more than the belief in a supreme being. It is the cult of that supreme being and the belief that his or her wishes have been made known or can be determined.\\" He mentions great critics such as Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine, who perhaps paradoxically regarded religion as an insult to God. \\"An agnostic does not believe in god, or disbelieve in him\\", writes Hitchens. Non-belief is not quite unbelief, he explains. \\"One is continually told, as an unbeliever\\", he writes, \\"that it is old-fashioned to rail against the primitive stupidities and cruelties of religion because after all, in these enlightened times, the old superstitions have died away. Nine times out of ten, one will be told not of some dogma of religious certitude but of some instance of charitable or humanitarian work undertaken by a religious person. Of course, this says nothing about the belief system involved.\\" Hitchens points out that if Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam (NoI) succeeds in weaning young black men off narcotics, this would not alter the fact that the NoI is a racist crackpot organization. He reminds readers that Hamas ‚Äì which publishes The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion on its website ‚Äì won a reputation for its provision of social services. He challenges: which ethical statement made or which action performed by a believer could not have been made or performed by a non-believer? =Chapters= Hitchens and Richard Dawkins # Lucretius: De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things) ‚Äì Books I, II, III, V, translation by W.

Etymology The name Edayar came from two words in Malayalam. \\"Eda\\" in Malayalam means in-between and \\"Aar\\" means a small river. A small stream which is part of a tributary to Periyar River is passing through this village. This water stream was the life line of this small village. The water from this stream was used for agriculture and all other domestic uses by the villagers. The main occupation of the people is agriculture. Rubber, Coconut, vegetables, Pineapple and Paddy are the main crops cultivated in the village. Meat Products of India (MPI) is a public- sector unit in this village. The village has a primary school (L.P.S. Edayar) which is run by the State Government of Kerala, and an upper primary school (Jawahar U.P.S.), under private ownership are the only educational institutions in the village. The villages depend on St. Johns High School, Vadakara and Govt. High School Namakuzhy situated at a distance of about 3 km from the village for their children's high school education. These two high schools uses both Malayalam and English as the medium of education. People are depend on nearby towns and cities for their higher education. In spite of that short comings the people of this village are fully literate. Perhaps every house in the village can proudly say that there is at least one graduate in every family.  Religion  The majority of the people consist of two communities namely Jacobite Syrian Christians and Ezhavas a prominent community of Hindus. St. Mary's Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church, Kunnathu Mahadeva temple and Siva temple are situated in the village. St Mary's Church has celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2008. This church was built in 1908 and its architecture based on traditional Thach Sastra.St. Mary's Jacobite Syrian Church, Edayar Geography The central areas of this village are Kaniyalippady, Pallippaday, Peedikappady, Uzhalakkadu and Kollanpady. This is because of the main road connecting the nearby two towns Koothattukulam and Piravom, is passing through these regions. Among these, the oldest and famous one is Pallippaday. \\"Uzhavoor thodu\\" is crossing the main road here and this stream is the basic root of the name of this village. Post office, Milma (Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation KCMMF), Rubber Marketing Society (State Co-operative Rubber Marketing Federation Limited.), St. Mary‚Äôs Jacobite Syrian Church, Sree Narayana Guru Temple (SNDP temple), and both schools are situated here. Geographically upper placed Peedikappady is having the Library, Mahadeva and Siva temples. Uzhalakkadu, a fast-growing area of Edayar with the support of MPI , other commercial establishments and a small clinic. EPHANS Club is the cultural corner here with many entertainment activities for youths. The club offered and started by the merchant association of Uzhalakkadu in 1980(?). \\"Chathayam Naal\\" (the last day of Onam) and anniversaries of the club are celebrated with many cultural events.  Grameena Vayanasala  Edayar Grameena Vayanasala, is one of the \\"Grade A\\" public libraries in Kerala and the heart of the village. It is affiliated to Kerala State Library Council and has a collection of more than 12,000 books on various subjects. It was established earlier in 1924 as \\"Martha Mariyam Vayanasala\\" in St. Mary‚Äôs Jacobite Church with a good collection of books and opened for all public. After a few years, with the support of the people in Edayar, library owned about half acres of land in Peedikappady and constructed a new building with memorial hall, reading and circulation rooms and an independent office. A vast play ground with an open air auditorium served several cultural events happened through many years in this village. Apart from revenues from members, the library receives a government grant form the Kerala State Government. It includes a good amount for purchasing new books and other library activities. Library also gets grants from the local punchayat and different government sources. Around 500 new books are adding every year to the existing collection. Library organizing social programs such as Nursery school, (Adult literacy center) and a Kung fu Training Center. Various programs sponsored by local and government agencies are also hosted and held here. The major event celebrate here is Thiruvonam. On the day library organize different cultural programs and celebrate Onam with the entire people in Edayar. The library has an Administration Committee of ten members for a period of two years(?), elected by the library members. Election procedures are equal to a basic Indian election method and the candidates are among the library members, may be from different political groups. Youngsters of Edayar commonly active in election and do the administration of library. In 2001 library has celebrated its Platinum Jubilee with many events and opened a Platinum Jubilee Mandiram as a new recreation building. Politics The major political parties in this village are United Democratic Front (UDF‚Äîled by the Indian National Congress) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF‚Äîled by the Communist party of India (CPI)], [Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)).

He was kindly and reticent yet sometimes wild in character but had a gentle devotion to children. Dark-haired and clothed in leaves and moss, he lived in a birch wood within the Gairloch and Loch a Druing area of the north- west highlands of Scotland. Ghillie Dhu is the eponym for the ghillie suit.David Amerland (2017), The Sniper Mind: Eliminate Fear, Deal with Uncertainty, and Make Better Decisions, St. Martin's Press, p. 53, Etymology Ghillie is an English equivalent of the Scottish Gaelic word ; Edward Dwelly, a Scottish lexicographer, lists gille as a \\"lad\\", \\"youth\\" or \\"boy\\" with dubh translating as \\"dark\\" or \\"dark-haired\\". Folk beliefs =Description and common attributes= According to folklorist and scholar Katharine Briggs the Ghillie Dhu was a gentle and kind-hearted mountain spirit, or a \\"rather unusual nature fairy.\\" The Ghillie Dhu was an individual male modern day fairy described by Osgood Mackenzie, a Scottish landowner and horticulturist, in his memoirs that were published in 1921. The fairy was generally timid, yet he could also be \\"wild\\". Residing in the birch woods near Loch a Druing, in the north-west Highland area of Gairloch, he was mainly seen in the latter part of the 18th century. The woods are in a dip alongside a hilly area around from where Rua Reidh Lighthouse was later built. One summer evening a local child named Jessie Macrae wandered into the woods and became lost. Jessie was found by the Ghillie Dhu who looked after her until the next morning when he took her home. Over a period of four decades the fairy was frequently seen by many people but Jessie was the only person he conversed with. Generally of a dishevelled appearance, he used green moss and leaves taken from trees as clothing. As implied by his name, he had black hair; he was of a small stature. His fondness of children is similar to that displayed by the little known Hyter sprite of English mythology. Attempted hunt Shortly after the Gille Dhu rescued Jessie, a group of Mackenzie dignitaries were invited by the landowner, Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch, to get together to hunt and capture the Ghillie Dhu. The team of five hunters congregated at the home of one of Mackenzie's tenants where they were provided with a complimentary evening meal before setting off on their mission to shoot the child-rescuing, kind Ghillie Dhu. Despite searching extensively throughout the night, the hunters could not find their prey; according to Patricia Monaghan, a writer on Celtic mythology, the Ghillie Dhu was never seen again. Origins After researching folklore traditions gathered primarily from Gaelic areas of Scotland, an authority on congenital disorders, Susan Schoon Eberly, has speculated the tale of the Ghillie Dhu may have a basis in a human being with a medical condition; other academics, such as Carole G. Silver, Professor of English at Stern College for Women, agree and suggest he was a dwarf. Eberly maintained several other solitary or individual fairies, including the Brownie and the Manx Fenodyree, could also have a medical, rather than supernatural, explanation.

JB-2 being air launched for flight test by a Boeing B-17 during testing of the weapon at Eglin Field, 1944 In flight after air launch, 1944 Ground preparation prior to air launch, 1944 A JB-2 being prepared for a test launch at Holloman AFB about 1948. A Loon being fired from in 1951 The Republic-Ford JB-2, also known as the KGW and LTV-N-2 Loon, was a United States copy of the German V-1 flying bomb. Developed in 1944, and planned to be used in the United States invasion of Japan (Operation Downfall), the JB-2 was never used in combat. It was the most successful of the United States Army Air Forces Jet Bomb (JB) projects (JB-1 through JB-10) during World War II. Postwar, the JB-2 played a significant role in the development of more advanced surface-to- surface tactical missile systems such as the MGM-1 Matador and later MGM-13 Mace. Wartime development The United States had known of the existence of a new German secret weapon since 22 August 1942 when a Danish naval officer discovered an early test version of the V-1 that had crashed on the island of Bornholm, in the Baltic Sea between Germany and Sweden, roughly 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of the V-1 test launch ramp at the Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center, on Germany's Usedom Island. A photograph and a detailed sketch of the V-1 test unit, the Fieseler Fi 103 V83 (Versuchs-83, the eighty- third prototype airframe) was sent to Britain. This led to months of intelligence-gathering and intelligence-sifting which traced the weapon to the airfield at Peenem√ºnde, on Germany's Baltic Coast, the top-secret German missile test and development site.U.S. Air Force Tactical Missiles, (2009), George Mindling, Robert Bolton As more intelligence data was obtained through aerial photography and sources inside Germany, it was decided in 1943 for the United States to develop a jet-powered bomb as well. The United States Army Air Forces gave Northrop Aircraft a contract in July 1944 to develop the JB-1 (Jet Bomb 1) turbojet-powered flying bomb under project MX-543. Northrop designed a flying-wing aircraft with two General Electric B1 turbojets in the center section, and two 900 kg (2000 lb) general-purpose bombs in enclosed \\"bomb containers\\" in the wing roots. To test the aerodynamics of the design, one JB-1 was completed as a manned unpowered glider, which was first flown in August 1944. In July 1944, three weeks after German V-1 \\"Buzz Bombs\\" first struck England on 12 and 13 June, American engineers at Wright Field fired a working copy of the German Argus As 014 pulse-jet engine, \\"reverse-engineered\\" from crashed German V-1s that were brought to the United States from England for analysis. The reverse engineering provided the design of America's first mass-produced guided missile, the JB-2.USAFHRA document 01014091 The matter of guided missiles became a jurisdictional issue between Army ground Forces and the Army Air Forces. The dispute was decided in favor of the AAF as the JB-2 had wings and flew. It was decided that the JB-2 \\"should be placed in combat, needed or not, as an insurance measure for AAF claims.Rosenberg 1964 p. 19. By 8 September, the first of thirteen complete JB-2s, reverse engineered from the material received at Wright Field in July was assembled at Republic Aviation. The United States JB-2 was different from the German V-1 only slightly in dimensions. The wing span was only 2¬Ω inches wider and the length was extended less than . The difference gave the JB-2 60.7 square feet of wing area versus 55 for the V-1. One of the few visible differences between the JB-2 and the V-1 was the shape of the forward pulsejet support pylon ‚Äî the original V-1 had its support pylon slightly swept back at nearly the same angle on both its leading and trailing edges, while the JB-2's pylon had a vertical leading edge and sharply swept-forward trailing edge. A similar, completely coincidental re-shaping, but with a much broader chord, was used for the same airframe componentSideview of a preserved Fi 103R, with similar-shape, broader-chord forward pulsejet pylon to that of the JB-2 of the manned Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg, original V-1 ordnance development. Initial testing of the first batch of prototype missle resulted in a decision to change from the preset guidance of the V-i to a command guidance system utilizing a radar beacon in the missile and radio command guidance from a tracking SCR 548 radar.Werrell 1972 p. 65 The indigenously-designed, unpowered U.S. Navy's Bat anti-ship glide bomb already had an active radar homing system in its nose to locate its intended maritime targets so an American innovation in guidance was an obvious improvement. With its Ford-produced PJ31 pulsejet powerplant, the JB-2 was one of the first attempts at a powered cruise missile for potential usage in America's arsenal. The first launch of a JB-2 took place at Eglin Army Air Field in Florida by the 1st Proving Ground Group on 12 October 1944. In addition to the Eglin group, a detachment of the Special Weapons Branch, Wright Field, Ohio, arrived at Wendover Field, Utah, in 1944 with the mission of evaluating captured and experimental systems, including the JB-2. Testing was from a launch structure just south of Wendover's technical site. The launch area is visible in aerial imagery (). Parts of crashed JB-2s are occasionally found by Wendover Airport personnel. In December 1944, the first JB-1 was ready for launch. The missile was launched by a rocket-propelled sled along a 150 m (500 ft) long track, but seconds after release the JB-1 pitched up into a stall and crashed. This was caused by an incorrectly calculated elevon setting for take-off, but the JB-1 program was subsequently stopped, mainly because the performance and reliability of the GE B1 turbojet engines were far below expectations. In addition, the cost to produce the Ford copy of the Argus pulse-jet engine of the JB-2 was much less than the GE turbojets. Subsequently, work proceeded on the JB-2 for final development and production.Garry R. Pape, John M. Campbell: \\"Northrop Flying Wings\\", Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 1995 An initial production order was 1,000 units, with subsequent production of 1,000 per month. That figure was not anticipated to be attainable until April 1945. Republic had its production lines at capacity for producing P-47 Thunderbolts, so it sub-contracted airframe manufacturing to Willys-Overland. Ford Motor Co built the engine, initially designated IJ-15-1, which was a copy of the V-1's 900-lb. thrust Argus-Schmidt pulse-jet (the Argus As 014), later designated the PJ31. Guidance and flight controls were manufactured by Jack and Heintz Company of Cleveland, Ohio, and Monsanto took on the task of designing a better launching system, with Northrop supplying the launch sleds. Production delivery began in January 1945. At one point proponents envisioned 75,000 JB-2s planned for production. This was absurd as it would have competed with the established manned bomber forces for sealift from America to Europe. Commander of Strategic Air Forces in Europe, Spaatz proposed a much more limited role as a harassment weapon on days where weather limited bombers. Moreover the air forces only wanted the JB-2 if it caused no curtailment of the supply of bombs, artillery shells, and personnel being shipped to Europe.Werrell 1972 p. 64 A USAAF launching squadron was formed in anticipation for using the weapons both against Nazi Germany and Japan. However, the end of the European War in May 1945 meant a reduction of the number of JB-2s to be produced, but not the end of the program. Army commanders in Europe had dismissed it as a weapon against Nazi Germany, as the strategic bombing concept was implemented and by 1945 the number of strategic targets in Germany was becoming limited. However, the JB-2 was envisioned as a weapon to attack Japan. A 180-day massive bombardment of the Japanese Home Islands was being planned prior to the amphibious landing \\"by the most powerful and sustained pre-invasion bombardment of the war\\". Included in the assault were the usual naval bombardment and air strikes augmented by rocket- firing aircraft and JB-2s. A navalized version, designated KGW-1, was planned to be used against Japan from LSTs (Landing Ship, Tank) as well as escort carriers (CVEs). In addition, launches from PB4Y-2 Privateers were foreseen and techniques developed. As WWII ended in Europe the Army Air Forces had JB-2 crews on transports headed for use against Japan.Werrell 1972 p. 91 The war's end led to the cancellation of Operation Downfall and the production of JB-2s was terminated on 15 September. A total of 1,391 units were manufactured. Postwar testing Though production was halted in mid-September 1945 testing was continued with JB-2s already constructed.Rosenberg 1985 p. 38. Several launch platforms were developed, including permanent and portable ramps, and mobile launching from beneath the wings of Boeing B-17G or Boeing B-29 bombers, much as the Heinkel He 111H-22 had done late in the war for the Luftwaffe in offensive air-launches of V-1s against the Allies. Testing continued from 1944 to 1947 at Eglin to improve launch and guidance. Tests of the JB-2 were conducted by the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group. The testing was at Wendover Air Force Base, Utah and Eglin AFB, Florida. At Eglin the JB-2 was tested at three land sites at the Santa_Rosa Island Range Complex as well as air launches flown from Hurlburt Field. In 1947 the USAF decided to move JB-2 testing to Alamogordo Air Force Base, New Mexico using the test range at White Sands.Mattson and Tagg 1995, p. 97. When used to test launch methods the JB-2 was designated the LTV-A-1 by the Air Force.Parsch Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles LTV-N-2 The U.S. Navy's version, the KGW-1 was intended for installation on surface ships and shore installations.Stumpf, 1996, p. 13. In 1946 it was re-designated KUW as a test vehicle, then renamed LTV-N-2.Parsch Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles LTV-N-2 The first launch of a LTV-N-2 was from Point Mugu, California on January 7, 1946Stumpf, 1996, p. 13.. As KUW/LTV-N-2 and given the name of an aquatic bird the \\"Loon\\" it was developed to be carried on the aft deck of submarines in watertight containers. The submarine to carry the LTV-N-2 was which successfully launched its first Loon on 12 February 1947, off Point Mugu, CA. The was modified to provide mid-course guidance for Loon.Stumpf, 1996, p. 13. The Navy program lasted until the last launch of a LTV-N-2 on September 11, 1953Stumpf, 1996, p. 17.. The LTV-N-2 program developed a number of launchers and varied launching techniques, variations in guidance, command guidance computers, the TROUNCE guidances system for SSM-N-8 Regulus, telemetry systems, flight termination, and tested a J30 turbojet as a power plant.Navy Air Missile Test Center 1952 p. 4-26. After the United States Air Force became a fully independent arm of the National Military Establishment 18 September 1947, research continued with the development of unmanned aircraft and pilotless bombers, including the already available JB-2. The USAF Air Materiel Command reactivated the JB-2 as Project EO-727-12 on 23 April 1948, at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. The JB-2 was used for development of missile guidance control and seeker systems, testing of telemetering and optical tracking facilities, and as a target for new surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles (fulfilling the V1's cover name, Flakzielger√§t ‚Äî anti-aircraft target device). The JB-2 project used the North American Aviation NATIV (North American Test Instrument Vehicle) Blockhouse and two launch ramps at Holloman: a , two-rail ramp on a 3¬∞ earth-filled slope, and a trailer ramp.Mattson and Tagg 1995, p. 92. The trailer ramp was the first step toward a system which would eventually be adapted for the forthcoming Martin MGM-1 Matador, the first operational surface-to-surface cruise missile built by the United States. The program at Holloman was terminated on 10 January 1949 after successful development of a radio guidance and control system that could control and even skid-land a JB-2 under the control of an airborne or ground transmitter. The 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group used JB-2s in a series of tests in the late 1940s at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. In early 1949, the 3200th Proof Test Group tested launching JB-2s from the under the wings of B-36 Peacemaker bombers at Eglin AFB.USAFHRA Document 00103281 About a year later, JB-2s were tested as aerial targets for experimental infrared gunsights at Eglin.USAFHRA Document 00425257 The Navy version was featured in the movie The Flying Missile (1951), including submarine launches. The movie shows the missile being launched from a trolley with four JATO bottles. In the mid-1992, military crews uncovered the well-preserved wreckage of a JB-2 at a site on an Air Force-owned section of Santa Rosa Island. Most crash sites on the barrier island were little more than flaky rust, but after the find, officials were planning further searches.Associated Press, \\"V-1 copy sparks interest,\\" Northwest Florida Daily News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, 1 October 1992, p. 1B Surviving missiles JB-2 on display at the National Air and Space Museum, Steven F.

It was established to deal with the growing problem of HIV/AIDS in the United States since the early 1980s. It was formerly known as the Bureau of Health Resources Development.  Overview  HRSA drives innovation in the delivery of treatment and support services to about 530,000 uninsured and underinsured people affected by the virus, and their families.  Key facts  * HRSA‚Äôs Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, with a budget of more than $2.1 billion (FY 2008), funds primary health care, support services and life-sustaining medications for about half of the estimated 1.1 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States. * The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 directs that more funds be spent on ‚Äúcore services‚Äù (medical, dental and prescription assistance), rather than such support functions as housing and transportation. The new law also allows the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services greater flexibility in reallocating funds to respond to changes in the course of the epidemic. * The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) is the fastest growing grant component in Ryan White. First funded in FY 1996 at $52 million, state-run ADAPs today receive $808.5 million to provide antiretroviral medications to patients who cannot afford them. On average, more than 158,000 clients receive their prescriptions annually through ADAP. * Almost three-quarters of Ryan White patients are minorities, who have higher rates of HIV infection and are more likely to reside in areas with a shortage of health professionals, screening facilities and treatment centers. Providing HIV-testing, early diagnosis and ongoing care is made more difficult by the relative scarcity of health services in these communities, as well as social attitudes related to the disease and means of transmission.  History  The original Ryan White Program was enacted in 1990 to improve the quality and availability of care for people with HIV/AIDS and their families. It was reauthorized in 1996, 2000 and 2006. Another reauthorization was due in 2009. The HIV/AIDS Bureau was created in 1997, consolidating functions that had previously been dispersed among four other bureaus of HRSA.  Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program  The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides primary medical care ‚Äî including dentistry ‚Äî and support services to individuals living with the disease who lack health insurance or personal financial resources to pay for their own care. For most, it is the ‚Äúprogram of last resort,\\" covering those who do not qualify for any other health benefits program, including Medicare or Medicaid. While clinical care and support services are the primary focus of the program, Ryan White also funds training and technical assistance for medical professionals as well as demonstration projects aimed at identifying and slowing the epidemic in high- risk populations. At present, young males of color are at greatest risk. But HIV/AIDS is also increasing among women: in 1985 women made up only 8% of total cases; by 2006 that number had increased to 23%. HRSA-funded services are intended to reduce the use of costly inpatient care, extend screening and treatment into medically underserved populations, and improve the quality of life for those affected by the epidemic. The program achieves these goals by funding HIV/AIDS care and services through grants to state and local governments, health care providers and community- based organizations. = Funding for metropolitan areas = Through Part A of the program, HRSA provides funding to Eligible Metropolitan Areas and Transitional Grant Areas (those hardest hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic) for a wide range of community- based efforts, such as outpatient health care and case management. = Funding to states = Through Part B, HRSA provides formula funding to states and territories to strengthen the quality, availability, and organizational structures of their delivery networks. This funding includes the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), which supports the provision of prescription medications. About a third of the Ryan White budget is spent on ADAP. = Funding to communities = Through Part C, HRSA grants support public and private non-profit providers (such as community and migrant health centers, faith-based organizations, hospitals and university medical centers, and city and county health departments) for outpatient early-intervention services and capacity-building. As an example of what is possible, in 1989 Pernessa C. Seele worked with major religious leaders, such as Dr. Frederick B. Williams and Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker and their congregations in Harlem, New York, to create the first Harlem Week of Prayer for Healing of AIDS. She doubled the number of congregations the next year, and incorporated as \\"The Balm in Gilead, Inc.\\" The non-profit now provides educational and technical assistance as a center for public health through faith communities, with some funding from the US Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Beginning with organizing congregations in prayers, Seele and her staff work with them to provide education and work to prevent HIV/AIDS, as well as to provide faith community support to patients and families. They have involved 10,000 congregations across the United States, as well as establishing model programs in the Caribbean and some nations in Africa. = Funding for women, children and families = Through Part D, HRSA funds public agencies and private non- profits to build community- and faith-based programs for children, youth, women and families. Part D also provides for a Youth Services Initiative to identify HIV-infected adolescents; bring them into comprehensive, culturally and linguistically sensitive care; and retain them in treatment. Part F includes the Special Projects of National Significance Program, which provides funding to public and private nonprofit entities to develop innovative models of HIV care for underserved populations. Part F also includes the Dental Reimbursement Program, the Community-Based Dental Partnership Program and the AIDS Education and Training Centers.  The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006  Part A funds eligible metropolitan areas and transitional grant areas. 75% must be spent for core services. Part B funds states; 75% must be spent for core services. Part C funds communities for early intervention services; 75% must be spent for core services. Part D grants support services for women, infants, children and youth. Part F comprises Special Projects of National Significance, AIDS Education & Training Centers, Dental Programs and Minority AIDS Initiative.

Brookes, (born 28 September 1943) is an English cartoonist who has produced work for numerous publications, including Radio Times, New Society, New Statesman, The Spectator, and, most notably, The Times, for which he has been the leader-page cartoonist since 1992. He has won the title of Cartoonist of the Year at the British Press Awards in 2012, 2011, 2010, 2007, and 2002. On 12 October 2017 he was given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 21st Cartoon Art Trust Awards. Early life Peter Brookes was born in Liverpool, on 28 September 1943, the son of an RAF Squadron Leader and he attended Heversham Grammar School, Westmorland. After school, he initially joined the RAF to train as a pilot and studied for a University of London BA degree at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell, but left to go to art college in Manchester. He then attended the Central School of Art and Design in London. Career In the mid-1970s, he replaced Chris Achilleos as regular jacket illustrator for Doctor Who novelisations from Target Books but his cartoon- style artwork proved less popular than Achilleos's more naturalistic style and he completed only four covers. In the 1970s, he was also a cartoonist for the Radio Times, taking over the main back-page cartoon from Marc Boxer in 1979. He had a short stint as a political cartoonist for the New Statesman, before returning to academia and lecturing at the Central School of Art and the Royal College of Art. For a time, he worked as cover artist for The Spectator but, in 1992, he moved to The Times, as its leader-page cartoonist, at the invitation of its newly appointed editor, Peter Stothard. He is particularly noted for his \\"Nature Notes\\" series of cartoons, begun in February 1996, which portray various fictitious beasts, based on the appearance (and supposed habits) of well-known politicians. He has noted that a benefit of using animal images is that he can show his subjects doing things that, for reasons of decency, could not be published if they were portrayed as human--Brookes said: \\"you are able to depict crap and fornication and that sort of thing\\". In 2009, he drew a controversial portrayal of Pope Benedict XVI with a condom on his head, which elicited a rebuke from Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor.Ratzinger‚Äôs irresponsibility and religious mania bring condemnation He was also the subject of an exhibition at the Chris Beetles Gallery in London in October of that year. With the formation of the coalition government in 2010, he began a notable series of cartoons known as the \\"Westminster Academy\\", which depicted Nick Clegg as a public school fag to a red cheeked David Cameron, who was portrayed as a prefect dressed in an Eton suit and Union Jack waistcoat, with Boris Johnson and George Osborne also appearing in some cartoons as his cronies. During this period, he depicted leader of the opposition Ed Miliband and shadow chancellor Ed Balls as Wallace and Gromit.Cartoonist Peter Brookes on The Westminster Academy at The Times 11 May 2011 Retrieved 28 December 2015 Technique Brookes uses T. H. Saunders paper, on which he draws with Pelikan black ink and a dip pen, equipped with Gillott nibs, as well as watercolour and gouache. He says, \\"There are three stages to the way I draw cartoons: first they are rendered loosely in soft pencil, then I overlay that with pen and Indian ink, and finally I add tone and colour with watercolour.\\" Personal life Brookes is married to Angela and they have two sons, Will and Ben.

His (incomplete) boxing record comes out to: 38 wins (27 by knockout), 13 losses, and 11 draws. In 1923, he was considered a leading contender, and described in Time magazine as \\"possibly the fifth-best heavyweight in the ring.\\" His manager was Alec Greggains. After his boxing career ended, he went into promotion at White Center, Washington. and served as a deputy sheriff in King County, Washington in the mid-1920s. Early life and amateur career Born July 23, 1900 in Des Moines, Iowa, Johnson was partly of Scandinavian stock, a handsome, light complected, blonde, blue-eyed young man. At eighteen, he briefly attempted a career as an iron worker which ended after a dispute with a co-worker. Early in his boxing career, at least by 1921, he traveled to San Francisco where he could box away from the distractions of home and the objections of his parents. In one of his first amateur bouts, he won the Amateur Championship of the Pacific Coast by knocking out Sydney Chermis in one round. In what may have been his first amateur victory he knocked out Jack Morris in one round, and was awarded a diamond studded belt buckle which he wore for decades.Perry, Lawrence, \\"Shows Class of Champion in Big Test\\", Des Moines Register, Des Moines, Iowa, pg. 21, 21 January 1923 Boxing career highlights On February 17, 1922, some sources report that Johnson fought an exhibition with the great black former heavyweight champion Jack Johnson in Milwaukie, Oregon. In their first meeting on January 26, 1922, Johnson lost to Jack McCauliffe II, in a six-round points decision at the Auditorium in Tacoma, Washington. McCauliffe was a Michigan heavyweight who fought a few great heavyweights in his career, including Battling Levinsky and Primo Carnera. On July 12, 1923, Johnson defeated McCauliffe in a first-round knockout at Boyle's Thirty Acres in Jersey City, New Jersey. Joe Jeanette, the famed black heavyweight acted as referee, and counted out McCauliffe. On October 6, 1922, he defeated \\"Fighting\\" Bob Martin in a tenth-round technical knockout at Madison Square Garden. Johnson had a lead as early as the first round, had Martin dazed by the end of the third, and was indisputably in command by the fifth. Thirty seconds into the tenth round, Martin's seconds threw a towel into the ring to stop the fight. Martin was a talented boxer who was an American Expeditionary Forces boxing champion from the WWI era as well as a 1920 Ohio State Heavyweight Champion.\\"Bob Martin K.O.'d by Floyd Johnson\\", The Courier-Journal, Louisville, Kentucky, pg. 8, 7 October 1922 On December 22, 1922, he defeated \\"Italian\\" Jack Herman in the third round at the Arena in Syracuse, New York. The telling blow was a right to the chin of Johnson, who had far from a stellar boxing record, and was described by one publication as a \\"fifth rater\\". Herman's face was badly beaten in the bout, and the referee considered stopping the fight earlier.\\"K.O. For Floyd Johnson in Bout With Herman\\", The Evening World, New York, New York, pg. 7, 23 December 1922 =Win over Bill Brennan, January 1923= On January 12, 1923, he decisively defeated talented heavyweight \\"K.O.\\" Bill Brennan of Manhattan in a fifteen-round points decision at Madison Square Garden. Johnson was described as being the aggressor and both out fighting and outboxing Brennan throughout the bout. In the second round at least, Johnson had some problems and Brennan found his mark on several occasions. Brennan, who was a ring weary twenty-nine at the time of the bout, to Johnson's twenty-three was in serious distress in the twelfth and fifteenth rounds. In the twelfth, Johnson dished out a series of lefts and rights to the head of Brennan. In the fifteenth, Brennan took a number of additional blows to the head which forced him to clinch at times. The win targeted Johnson as a serious contender for Dempsey's title.\\"Floyd Johnson Looms As Dangerous Contender For Dempsey's Title\\", Times Herald, Olean, New York, pg. 3, 13 January 1923 Johnson was said to have exhibited exceptional boxing prowess and form in his win over Brennan. Brennan was so overwhelmed with the attack of Johnson, he was unable to wage an effective offensive against his opponent.\\"Floyd Johnson Easily Boxes Way to 15 Round Victory\\", Arkansas Democrat, Little Rock, Arkansas, pg. 8, 13 January 1923Igoe, Bert, \\"Floyd Johnson Qualifies as Contender For Title By Outpointing Bill Brennan\\", St. Louis Post Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 6, 13 January 1923 =Difficult win over a larger Fred Fulton, April 1923= On April 23, 1923, Johnson defeated Fred Fulton in a twelve-round newspaper decision at the Arena in Jersey City, New Jersey, and yet he took a bad beating and was close to being knocked out in the last round. According to the Los Angeles Times, Fulton had a nearly \\"insurmountable advantage\\" in weight in the bout, and Johnson had to be the aggressor throughout to win the newspaper decision. Johnson \\"pummeled\\" Fulton at will to keep him at bay, but took considerable punishment from Fulton's far less frequent but stronger blows. He may have been mismatched against an opponent who outweighed him by twenty pounds and had a three-inch advantage in height, as well as a reach advantage. In the final round, Fulton came \\"within an inch\\" of knocking out Johnson who had a decided disadvantage in the round. Johnson was given ten rounds by his ceaseless rushing and hammering, but clearly lost the eighth and twelfth rounds. In the eighth, Fulton hurt Johnson with lefts and rights to the jaw. A few boxing critics felt that Johnson's poor showing against Fulton should have prevented his manager subsequently matching him with the much larger, heavier, and stronger Jess Willard.Newman Harry, \\"Iowa Heavyweight on Verge of Knockout in Last Round\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 41, 24 April 1923 When Johnson did connect in the later rounds, his blows were considered by several newspapermen to be less telling than Fulton's.\\"Johnson Victor Over Fred Fulton\\", The Morning News, Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 8, 24 April 1923 Some boxing critics blamed Johnson's manager Charley Cook for matching him with larger, stronger opponents too early in his career. Cook said that he matched Johnson with Fulton specifically to prepare him for the heavier, and taller Willard, but Johnson fared poorly enough against both opponents that he may indeed have been mismatched. In his bout with Fulton, he was only twenty-two at the time of the fight to Fulton's thirty-one.Runyon, Damon, \\"Minnesota Boxer Makes Game Fight Against Youngster\\", The Times, Shreveport, Louisiana, pg. 8, 24 April 1923 =Loss to former heavyweight champion Jess Willard before huge audience, May 1923= Ex-champion Jess Willard On May 12, 1923, Johnson lost to Jess Willard in an eleventh-round TKO before a crowd of around 63,000 at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.\\"Winners of Bouts;Financial Figures\\", The Scranton Republican, Scranton, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 14 May 1923 The bout was an impressive comeback for Willard who had not fought since his loss of the Heavyweight title to Jack Dempsey on July 4, 1919 in a brutal third-round technical knockout in Toledo, Ohio. Willard was amazingly twenty three years older than Johnson's youthful twenty-two years, but had nearly a fifty-pound weight advantage as well as an advantage in reach and height.Butler, Joe, \\"Firpo Most Dangerous Challenger of Dempsey\\", The Scranton Republican, Scranton, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 14 May 1923 The first five rounds seemed even, and though Johnson pressed his attack in the sixth and seventh, he slipped to the floor in the eighth and had continued trouble in the remaining rounds.\\"Willard Stops Johnson in Twelfth\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 19, 13 May 1923 One boxing writer felt that Johnson should not have been matched with a boxer as strong as Willard and so much heavier, as the loss ruined his chances of coming through the ranks as a contender and the beating he took was formidable.\\"Tragedy of Greedy Fight Managers\\", The Evening Journal, Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 12, 26 May 1923 He defeated Willie Meehan in a fourth round points decision on September 26, 1923 before a capacity crowd of 8,000 at the Auditorium in Oakland, California. California law at the time prohibited fights of more than four rounds. Meehan was down in the first from a hard left and again in the fourth round from another left, though Johnson was unable to score a knockout.Smith, Harry B., \\"Fat Boxer is Funny as Ever But Loses Out\\", San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco, California, pg. 1, 27 September 1923 He had previously defeated Meehan on January 31, 1922 in a four-round points decision in Seattle's Pavilion. He would later make Washington state his home. =Loss to Jack Renault, November 1923= On November 2, 1923, Johnson lost somewhat badly to Jack Renault in a fifteen-round knockout at Madison Square Garden. Both boxers fought at a comparable weight of 196. According to Henry R. Farrell of the British United Press Service, Renault put down Johnson three times in the last round. In the final knockdown, it took doctors ten minutes to revive Johnson. The defeat took away Johnson's few remaining hopes of challenging Jack Dempsey for the World Heavyweight Title, as most considered Renault a good boxer, but a second rate contender.\\"Jack Renault Gains Prestige, But That Leaves Him Out\\", Pittsburgh Daily Post, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 10, 5 November 1923 Johnson had gone down twice in the final round when his seconds threw a towel into the ring to end the fight. Johnson had weathered great punishment in the first seven rounds, and was on the verge of a knockout in both the ninth and tenth rounds, though he continued to weather the punishment and even showed some offensive moves in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth.\\"Jack Renault Puts Floyd Johnson Out\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 23, 3 November 1923 Renault had taken the Canadian Heavyweight Title in October 1923. On May 9, 1924, he knocked out Chilean boxer Quinton Romero-Rojas before a crowd of 8,627 in the seventh round at New York's Madison Square Garden. Though his record was far from stellar, Romero-Rojas boxed several quality opponents in his career including Jack Sharkey, Harry Greb, and Jack Renault. Rojas was floored and counted out in the seventh by a sweeping right to the neck. Johnson knocked Romero-Rojas down a total of four times, but the fight was close in many regards, and at the end of the fifth Johnson was so fatigued and groggy that he walked to his opponents corner and sat down. Johnson was down on the mat once himself. The fourth and fifth rounds, when Romero-Rojas tried to pursue a knockout were particularly hard on Johnson.\\"Rojas Floored Four Times Drops American Once and Puts Up Desperate Fight\\", The St. Louis Post Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 5, 10 May 1924 On June 23, 1924, he lost to heavyweight boxer Jack Sharkey in a ten-round points decision at the Mechanics Building in Boston. Johnson was down for a short count in the second round and was rocked by hard rights to the jaw in the fourth.\\"Floyd Johnson loses verdict to Sharkey\\", The Times, Shreveport, Louisiana, pg. 10, 24 June 1924\\"Roxbury Jack Sharkey Defeats Floyd Johnson\\", The Decatur Herald, Decatur, Illinois, pg. 12, 25 June 1924 One newspaper gave Sharkey nine of the ten rounds. Johnson later said of Sharkey that \\"the right-handed punch which knocked me to the canvas was one of the hardest blows I ever received.\\"\\"Binghampton Boy is Highly Rated by Fight Critics\\", Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 21, 1 July 1924 On May 18, 1925, he lost a 15-round points decision of the New Orleans Times-Picayune in a bout with Martin Burke at the Colliseum Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana. Burke had boxed many of the better middle and heavyweights of the era including Gene Tunney, Jack Dempsey, Harry Greb and Tommy Loughran. At 203, Johnson outweighed his opponent by twenty-eight pounds, but more telling may have been the recent difficult losses he had sustained in the ring. Burke acted as a training partner for Jack Dempsey during his career. He pulled out a win against the great Black boxer Kid Norfolk, originally William Ward, on June 17, 1925 in a fourth round disqualification at the Auditorium in Oakland, California. Norfolk was a 1921 World Colored Light Heavyweight Champion and had claimed titles in Panama as well. Norfolk was barred from appearing in a California boxing ring for thirty days by the boxing commissioner following the foul against Johnson.\\"Kid Norfolk Suspended\\", The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 31, 19 June 1925 On October 26, 1925, he fell to a first-round technical knockout against accomplished Black heavyweight boxer Harry Wills in Newark, New Jersey. Wills held the World Colored Heavyweight Championship three times in his career. On July 18, 1931, Johnson fought a four-round exhibition bout with the great Black ex-heavyweight world champion Jack Johnson in Seattle, Washington. Johnson's last known professional bout was a six-round loss on points against Cyclone Thompson on November 26, 1931 in White Center Washington. Movie career He had a cameo in the 1925 MGM film Way of a Girl, and a publicity photo for the film featured actress Eleanor Boardman pretending to photograph Johnson. Johnson appeared in a ring scene in the movie.\\"The Scene\\", The News Paladium, Benton Harbor, Michigan, pg. 2, 3 October 1925 Johnson died on June 1, 1986.

Baseball  Adams was the Founder, Organizer and First President of the Boston Base Ball Association, the legal corporation that operated the baseball club initially known as the Boston Red Stockings. The club was Boston's first professional baseball team, continues to operate today as the Atlanta Braves, and is the longest continuously operating team in Major League Baseball. On January 20, 1871, the Boston Base Ball Association was legally organized by Adams with $15,000 raised from investors and the commitment of Harry Wright, manager of America's first professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, to manage the new Boston club.  Business career  Adams was a native of Ashburnham, Massachusetts, but left the town at the age of 19 to seek his fortune in Boston. He became the president of the American Net and Twine Company, which was the largest manufacturer of its kind in the world at that time. Throughout his life Adams kept an interest in the activities of his home community. Adams was an enthusiastic sportsman, he had a fishing lodge in Canada, from which he sent his Ashburnham friends fresh salmon, and a hunting preserve in Virginia. He was interested in the propagation of fish, and for some years leased from the town of Ashburnham, Upper Naukeag Lake, where he maintained a summer home on an island. One of Ashburnham's problems which concerned Adams was the town's inadequate water system. Adams presented Ashburnham with a new water system, which included a pumping station at Upper Naukeag Lake, a storage tank at Bulkeleys Corner and six and a half miles of new water mains. The town's new water system was dedicated on Columbus Day in 1912. Adams was the guest of honor. Bela Pratt's sculpture, Ashburnham's Schoolboy of 1850, was presented to the town of Ashburnham and Schools by Adams in 1913, a year before his death. The statue is a life size bronze figure on a granite base and depicts a 12-year-old schoolboy walking to his one-room district school in 1850. The boy is barefoot, wears a straw hat and is carrying a writing slate and lunch pail. Adams gave the statue to the town to honor and encourage young country boys, like he was at one point was, to value education so they could take their love of nature, community spirit and creative thinking learned in the Ashburnham pioneering woods out into the world. The Schoolboy Statue of 1850 stands now at the corner of School and Main Street, near the entrance of Cushing Academy.

Built upon the site of Beryl Hill (A Celtic name meaning Hill, Hill, Hill) which allegedly was the site of a cairn and a beacon to warn of a Napoleonic invasionhttp://www.blackpool.gov.uk/News/2009/Jul/HistoryofRockGardenscanyouhelp.htm The gardens run downhill toward Inver Road. Views from the top of the gardens can be seen toward Pendle Hill, Beacon Fell and the Bowland fells. History The gardens were founded in the early 1900s, and were opened to the public in 1925. Over the years the gardens fell into disrepair, were vandalised and used less and less by local residents. In 2002 the Friends of the Rock Gardens was formed to improve community access and use of the park; and to restore the park's amenities. The park has been regularly used for many years as a setting for wedding photography. Gardens renovation The Friends group has held fund raising events such as an Easter Extravaganza and a Teddy Bears' Picnic Fun Day, the first of which was held on 31 July 2007 and attracted about 300 people with Guests of Honour being the Mayor of Blackpool, Robert Wynne, and the area's MP, Joan Humble. The Heritage Lottery Fund gave a grant of ¬£20,000 in May 2006 to help restore the gardens which received a major revamp with the creation of an educational woodland walk and butterfly habitat. The Friends group forged links with local schools who use the park for outdoor projects such as mini-beast and pond studies. Also the Lancashire Wildlife Trust is monitoring the rare white-letter hairstreak butterfly which lives in the gardens. The Woodland Walk is designed to include a story telling ring, disabled friendly winding paths, a sculpture display area and mosaics. In November 2007 contractors started a project to completely re-lay the gardens paths. The project cost ¬£57,000 with funding coming from various sources, including Blackpool Borough Council, the local area forum and local firms. The project also received a ¬£39,000 grant from The Veolia Environmental Trust under the Landfill Communities Fund. The work on the paths makes them disabled friendly. Also included in the project is a new enclosed \\"hilly\\" landscape to provide runners with a challenging workout and grassed paths for light walks.

They discover that the present case is related to the mysterious death of a girl ten years prior. So-young becomes plagued with nightmares in which the girl appears, and the killings continue. The girl is actually Min-jeong, Hyun-ki's first love. Those who died are killed by Hyun-ki by giving them a cigarette that is inlaid with a gas which causes a simulated heart attack. Those who have the cigarette raped Min-jeong 10 years ago in an abandoned salt house. Hyun-ki was forced to tape the incident as he was emotionally wounded when he saw Min-jeong and her lover making out in the salt house at graduation day. Hurt, he agrees to tape the incident when the group who plans to rape Min-jeong persuaded him. Min-jeong's lover, who came by to save her, was killed by one of the group members. Min-jeong was said to have gone mad and disappeared after that incident, but in fact she was pregnant and buried under a mound of salt after one of the police officers who handled the rape incident tricked her into the salt house and locked her inside, burying her along with her unborn child. Hyun-ki threatens the police officer to go to the salt house and dig out Min-jeong. So-young catches upon both of them and also threatens Hyun-ki to put down his gun. Hyun-ki pleads with So-young to kill him, but So- young refuses, saying that she will let him live in regret and make him watch his children suffer after him, whispering in his ear when he's dying and says that his life is no better than a stray dog. Hyun-ki states that he can't bear it, and afraid to live that kind of life, ends his life by committing suicide. The water that rains down on that day washes away the salt that buried Min- jeong, and slowly, Min-jeong's body is revealed along with her dead baby between her legs. Her corpse is not rotten, thanks to the salt that preserved her body. The forensic doctor states that when a pregnant woman dies, gas formed inside the body. The gas pushes the baby out even after the mother is dead. So-young was once violated by an unknown man with a scar on his right hand when she was young. She stated that the reason she became a police officer was to find that man and kill him. After the incident, the man who once violated her, now a father and a successful businessman, mysteriously dies in a hotel room. It is said that the night before the man died, So-young dreamed about the girl wearing a white dress, smiling and laughing together in the salt house. She concluded that the dream she had signified that Min-jeong had helped her take her revenge by killing the man, and after that So-young writes a novel and gets it published. At the end of the film, there's a myth said to relate to the movie. The Legend of Arang 400 years ago states that there's a village full of new magistrates that are killed mysteriously. That is why no new magistrate dares to go to the village to be appointed. However, there's a new magistrate willing to go to the village. He found out that the spirit of Arang is full of hatred and revenge because she was raped and killed. After that, he helped the spirit to catch the culprit who raped and killed her, sending the culprit to justice. He found Arang's corpse and buried her. It was said that because of her hatred, her corpse did not rot when it is found after so many years. Cast * Song Yoon-ah... So-young * Lee Dong- wook... Hyun-ki * Lee Jong-su...

Researchers use single- subject design because these designs are sensitive to individual organism differences vs group designs which are sensitive to averages of groups. The logic behind single subject designs is 1) Prediction, 2) Verification, and 3) Replication. The baseline data predicts behavior by affirming the consequent. Verification refers to demonstrating that the baseline responding would have continued had no intervention been implemented. Replication occurs when a previously observed behavior changed is reproduced.Cooper, J. O., Heron, T. E., & Heward, W. L. (2007). Applied behavior analysis (2nd ed.). Columbus, OH: Merrill Prentice Hall. Often there will be large numbers of subjects in a research study using single-subject design, however‚Äîbecause the subject serves as their own control, this is still a single-subject design. These designs are used primarily to evaluate the effect of a variety of interventions in applied research.Kazdin p. 191 Design Standards = Effect size = Although there are no standards on the specific statistics required for effect size calculation, it is best practice to include an effect size estimate.Kratochwill, T. R., Hitchcock, J., Horner, R. H., Levin, J. R., Odom, S. L., Rindskopf, D. M & Shadish, W. R. (2010). Single-case designs technical documentation. Retrieved from What Works Clearinghouse website: http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/pdf/wwc_scd.pdf.  Reporting Standards  When reporting on findings obtained through single-subject designs, specific guidelines are used for standardization and to ensure completeness and transparency:Tate, R. L., Perdices, M., Rosenkoetter, U., McDonald, S., Togher, L., Shadish, W., . . . Vohra, S. (2016). The Single-Case Reporting Guideline In BEhavioural Interventions (SCRIBE) 2016: Explanation and elaboration. Archives of Scientific Psychology, 4(1), 10-31. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/arc0000027 thumb Types of Single-Subject Designs = Reversal Design = Reversal design involves repeated measurement of behavior in a given setting during three consecutive phases (ABA)- baseline, intervention, and return to baseline. Variations include extending the ABA design with repeated reversals (ABAB) and including multiple treatments (ABCABC). AB designs, or reversal designs with no return to baseline, are not considered experimental. Functional control cannot be determined in AB designs because there is no replication. = Alternating Treatments Design = Alternating treatments design (ATD) compares the effects of two or more independent variables on the dependent variable. Variations include a no- treatment control condition and a final best-treatment verification phase. = Multiple Baseline Design = Multiple baseline design involves simultaneous baseline measurement begins on two or more behaviors, settings, or participants. The IV is implemented on one behavior, setting, or participant, while baseline continues for all others. Variations include the multiple probe design and delayed multiple baseline design. = Changing Criterion Design = Changing criterion designs are used to evaluate the effects of an IV on the gradual improvement of a behavior already in the participant's repertoire. Interpretation of data In order to determine the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, the researcher will graph the data collected and visually inspect the differences between phases. If there is a clear distinction between baseline and intervention, and then the data returns to the same trends/level during reversal, a functional relation between the variables is inferred.Backman, C.L. & Harris, S.R. (1999). Case Studies, Single-Subject Research, and N of 1 Randomized Trials. Comparisons and Contrasts. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, 78(2), 170‚Äì6.

The overall average (mean) of the outcome measures within a phase. * Trend. The slope of the best-fitting straight line for the outcome measures within a phase. * Variability. The range, variance, or standard deviation of the outcome measures about the best- fitting line. * Immediacy of Effect. The change in level between the last three data points in one phase and the first three data points of the next. * Overlap. The proportion of data from one phase that overlaps with data from the previous phase. * Consistency of Data Patterns. The extent to which there is consistency in the data patterns from phases with the same conditions. Limitations Research designs are traditionally preplanned so that most of the details about to whom and when the intervention will be introduced are decided prior to the beginning of the study. However, in single-subject designs, these decisions are often made as the data are collected.Kazdin, p. 284 In addition, there are no widely agreed-upon rules for altering phases, so‚Äîthis could lead to conflicting ideas as to how a research experiment should be conducted in single-subject design. The major criticism of single-subject designs are: * Carry-over effects: Results from the previous phase carry-over into the next phase. * Order effects: The ordering (sequence) of the intervention or treatment affects what results. * Irreversibility: In some withdrawal designs, once a change in the independent variable occurs, the dependent variable is affected. This cannot be undone by simply removing the independent variable. * Ethical problems: Withdrawal of treatment in the withdrawal design can at times present ethical and feasibility problems.

(born 29 August 1942) is an Italian Catholic priest and the former director of the Holy See Press Office. He succeeded Joaqu√≠n Navarro-Valls and was succeeded by Greg Burke. Lombardi serves as the postulator for the beatification and canonization cause of Father Bernardo Mattio. Early life and ordination Lombardi was born on 29 August 1942 in Saluzzo, Piedmont, Italy, and was trained in mathematics and studied theology in Germany. He became a Jesuit priest in 1972, and then worked for the influential Jesuit-run magazine, La Civilt√† Cattolica, and served as superior of the Jesuits' Italian province. Vatican Radio Lombardi was named program director (1991) and later director general (2005) of Vatican Radio. He was also made general director of the Vatican Television Centre in 2001; a position he held until 2013 and in which he was succeeded by Dario Edoardo Vigan√≤. Press Office of the Holy See On 11 July 2006 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him director of the Vatican Press Office, replacing Joaqu√≠n Navarro- Valls, a layman who had held the post for 22 years. Lombardi's appointment to the Press Office of the Holy See merged with it the leadership of Vatican Radio and Vatican Television Center as well, as he continued to hold those directorships. Upon assuming the directorate, Lombardi said he would not be a papal \\"spokesman\\" since he believes Benedict XVI did not need an interpreter, saying, \\"I don't think my role is to explain the Pope's thinking or explain the things that he already states in an extraordinarily clear and rich way.\\" He is considered to have taken a more low-key approach than his predecessor. Crises in communication In an editorial for \\"Octava Dies\\", a weekly program of the Vatican Television Center, he criticized statements made by Bishop Richard Williamson denying the extent of the Holocaust. Lombardi was later criticized himself by Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos over the problems in communication revealed during the affair. Lombardi said that the Pope had never been a member of the Hitler Youth, but journalists quickly pointed out to him that Cardinal Ratzinger, later Pope, had admitted this himself in the 1997 book Salt of the Earth. In 2009 Lombardi said that in \\"cases like Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs Regensburg discourse, the Bishop Williamson affair, or the controversy over Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs statements regarding condoms and the spread of HIV and AIDS in Africa, ... once the first wave of criticism had passed, people were able to do some real hard thinking; ... subsequent reflections were serious, penetrating and well-argued.\\" In September 2012, Lombardi released a second statement on the 2012 diplomatic missions attacks which clearly condemned mob violence; his first statement had been criticized by Catholic bloggers for omitting to condemn the violence, and for emphasizing primarily the religious feelings of offended Muslims. Other In addition to his native Italian, Lombardi speaks French, German, and English, as well as reading and understanding Spanish and Portuguese. At the end of October 2011, he addressed his weekly editorial as a letter of welcome to the 7 billionth baby born on Earth. Succession His resignation, which had been expected for reasons of age, as Director of the Holy See Press Office was accepted by Pope Francis on 11 July 2016; he continued in his role until 31 July 2016. Father Lombardi was succeeded as Director of the Press Office on 1 August 2016 by the then-Deputy Director, Mr. Greg Burke, an American from Saint Louis, Missouri, who had held the Deputy Director's post since 2015, having worked beforehand in the Secretariat of State of the Holy See in the General Affairs Section, as Assessor for Communications. Burke was succeeded as Deputy Director by Paloma Garc√≠a Ovejero, a woman and a native of Madrid, Spain, who has been serving as a correspondent for Italy and the Vatican, and earlier as an editor and presenter for Cadena Cope, Radio Espa√±ola. Both Burke and Ovejero resigned their positions on 31 December 2018, upon which Pope Francis appointed Alessandro Gisotti as provisional director.

Biography Eliyahu Lankin was born in Gomel, and moved with his family to Manchuria at the age of three in the wake of the October Revolution. He studied at the Russian High School in Harbin. At the age of 16, he joined Betar and immigrated to Mandatory Palestine three years later. Lankin died in 1994, and was buried on Har HaMenuchot. A street in Jerusalem was named after him. Political activism In 1934, Lankin joined the Irgun. From 1935 to 1939, he was a member of the Notrim, responsible for defending Jewish lives and property from Arab raids. As an Irgun member, he participated in landing illegal Jewish immigrants on Palestine's Mediterranean coast. In May 1944, he was appointed Commander of the Jerusalem District. He took part in the attack on the British intelligence office in Jerusalem in July 1944. In December 1944, he was arrested by the British as a result of informing by the Haganah and was exiled to Africa. After several attempts, he succeeded - the only one of 107 prisoners \\\\- in escaping from the camp in Eritrea on November 10, 1945. Eventually, he arrived in Paris in January 1947 and was appointed commander of the Irgun headquarters in Europe. He commanded the Altalena, which he brought to Israel. After coming ashore, he was arrested by the Israeli government and was kept in administrative detention for two months, along with four other Irgun commanders. On release, he joined the IDF, graduated from an officer's course, and was a battalion commander. He served as a member of the first Knesset, representing Herut. Later, he studied law at the Hebrew University, and was certified as a lawyer in 1954. Diplomatic career After the Likud's rise to power, he was appointed ambassador to South Africa, serving from 1981 to 1985. In 1983, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin named Lankin ambassador to the United Kingdom. The British government was outraged over his selection due to his Irgun past, and warned that it would harm Anglo-Israeli relations.

(1667 ‚Äì 30 January 1728) was an English Franciscan friar and historian of his Order. Life Born in England, as a young man Parkinson left for the continent, where he entered the Order of Friars Minor, still banned in his homeland. In 1692 he was appointed professor of philosophy at the Franciscan community in Douai; the following year he was approved for preaching and hearing confessions. He returned to England to serve its Catholic population in 1695 and was president of the friars in Warwick 1698-1701, of Birmingham 1701-10, and Definitor of the restored English province 1707-10. Parkinson was also nominal guardian of the friars in Worcester 1704-7, and those of Oxford for 1710-1713. He then led the still- hidden province as Minister Provincial until 1716, and again 1722-25. As such he assisted at the General Chapter of the Order held in Rome in May 1723. Parkinson's chief work is the Collectanea Anglo-Minoritica, or a Collection of the Antiquities of the English Franciscans, or Friars Minors, commonly called Gray Friars, in two parts, with an appendix concerning the English Poor Clares, published in quartos in London in 1726.

After working as an export agent in Liverpool he joined with two managers of a Runcorn chemical factory to build what was initially known as the Old Quay Chemical Works, and later became Wigg Works. At first the works manufactured soap and alkali, but soon moved to extracting copper from pyrites ash, and later making bleaching powder and ferric oxide. During the later part of the 19th century it was one of the most successful businesses in Runcorn. Charles Wigg retired from the business shortly after it was taken over by the United Alkali Company and died eight years later. The site of the factory has been developed into a nature reserve called Wigg Island. Early life and career Charles Wigg was born in Liverpool and was the fourth child and the fourth son of John and Martha Maria Wigg. In 1847 his father was described being as an accountant and estate agent with offices in Liverpool and Birkenhead. On 29 April 1847 Charles married Georgiana Bird Burrell in St Michael's Church, Aigburth, when he was described as being a merchant. When John & Thomas Johnson, brothers and soap manufacturers from Runcorn, established an office in Liverpool in 1859, they appointed Wigg as the export agent for their trade with America. His younger brother, George, was a financial agent for the Confederate Government during the American Civil War. Possibly through this connection, the Johnson brothers attempted to run the Union blockade to supply materials to the Confederates. They succeeded in passing one ship through the blockade, as a result of which they made a profit of ¬£70,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). However, when they attempted to repeat the attempt with more ships, they lost them all in a naval battle at Charleston. They had overcommitted themselves, and this led to their eventual bankruptcy. The business was floated as a public company in 1865, and was known as the Runcorn Soap and Alkali company. Wigg played a part in establishing this company and became the Company Secretary, holding 250 shares. Chemical works Also in 1865, Wigg established a new chemical factory in Runcorn making soap and alkali. This was located on the north side of the Runcorn to Latchford Canal between the canal and the River Mersey. The area was known as the Old Quay, and the factory was called the Old Quay Chemical Works. Wigg was joined in the enterprise by Neil Mathieson, who had been the works manager for the Johnsons' business. They soon abandoned making soap and alkali, and began to extract copper from pyrites ash. In 1869 Wigg and Mathieson were joined by Duncan McKechnie. McKechnie had been a foreman at Johnsons', where he had gained expertise in the extraction of copper. However the partnership did not last, and in 1871 McKechnie left to form his own copper works in St Helens. In 1873 Mathieson was named in an action by Sir Richard Brooke of Norton Priory for \\"damage to his trees and pastures form noxious emissions\\". Mathieson decided to leave the Old Quay factory and establish his own factory in Widnes on the other side of the Mersey. In 1871 Matthew Steele, became a partner in the business. He was Wigg's son-in-law, having married his eldest daughter, Adelaide Sherriff, the previous year. Steele had studied medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, and had practised as a doctor before his marriage. In 1876 two of Charles' brothers, Frederick William and George Lloyd joined the company as partners, and the company became known as Wigg Brothers and Steele. Frederick William died in 1880, and was replaced as partner by Charles' younger son, Walter John. From 1876 the works had begun to produce bleaching powder, and in the 1880s they were making ferric oxide. By this time the company had become very successful. It was exporting a greater volume of freight through the local docks than any other works in the area. In 1875 70,000 tons of material was received and despatched at the works. The firm owned their own ships in which they transported iron ore, sulphur and chemicals between Widnes and Liverpool. In 1890 Wigg Brothers and Steele became part of the United Alkali Company. Charles Wigg retired from the business the following year. Personal life Charles Wigg and his wife had a total of ten children. During this time they were living in Toxteth in Liverpool, and then in Garston on the outskirts of Liverpool. After the collapse of the Johnson Brothers' business, Wigg bought Grice's farm from the Johnsons in the nearby village of Halton, where a new house, Halton Lodge, was built for him. By 1871 he was living in Great Crosby, and in 1881 in North Meols. By 1887 the family had moved to Hoole Bank, Chester. Charles Wigg was a staunch member of the Church of England and a supporter of many charities. Politically he was a Conservative, at one time being the chairman of the Conservative Association in Runcorn. He was invited to stand for election as a Member of Parliament, but declined. Wigg was involved more widely in the chemical industry, including overseeing changes at an alkali factory at Weston Point. He tried to develop a plant for manufacturing alkali by the ammonia- soda process, and took out a patent for it, but it was unsuccessful. He was involved with the organisation of the chemical industry, including working with the Alkali Makers Association, and the Bleaching Powder Association. Charles Wigg died on 18 July 1899 at the age of 75, leaving an estate of ¬£107,894 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). Legacy In 1894 the Manchester Ship Canal replaced the Runcorn to Latchford Canal alongside the works, creating an island which has been known since as Wigg Island. The factory became known as Wigg Works, and in 1926 merged with the Gaskell-Marsh group of factories in Widnes, but it closed in 1930. The site was re-opened in 1940 by the Ministry of Supply to manufacture sulphuric acid. This was taken over in 1946 by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), and renamed Wigg West. Manufacturing ended on Wigg Island in 1960. By the 21st century the land had been cleared, and it was opened up for public access and recreation in 2002. Wigg Island was declared a nature reserve in 2004. A visitor centre has been built, and this is managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust.

Founded in the early 1900s, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Elmwood Park Historic District on May 3, 1991.SCDAH  History  The land in the neighborhood was originally the State Fair Grounds, beyond the city limits. The area that is now between Park Street and Wayne Street was used for fairgrounds and a race track. After the state fair moved to its current location adjacent to the University of South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium, the various original owners of the area began selling the parcels for real estate development, as well as at least one owner leaving a bequeath in his will for local school development. Eventually, the lots were subdivided and offered to the public at a public auction sale in 1905. This auction date is generally recognized as the establishment of Elmwood Park. As the neighborhood quickly developed, it was annexed by the City of Columbia in 1907. This created the first suburb and the first expansion of the city outside its original planned boundaries.  National Register of Historic Places  The National Register lists 279 homes in the neighborhood, with 219 homes contributing. The housing styles range from Queen Anne style, American Foursquare, gable-front houses, and Colonial Revival houses, to the smaller one-story structures that are predominantly American Craftsman influenced. Brick bungalows are also present, largely later-built from the 1920s and 1930s. A number of shotgun houses still stand in the earliest developed part of the neighborhood. Two historic schools are located in the neighborhood, the still-functioning Logan Elementary, and the former Wardlaw Junior High, which is now a residential senior facility known as Wardlaw Apartments. Logan School is the work of a local architect, J. Carroll Johnson. James Burwell Urquhart, another prominent Columbia architect, designed Wardlaw Junior High School. Logan was built in 1913 and added to the National Register in 1979. Wardlaw was built in 1927 and added to the National Register in 1984.SCDAHSCDAH  References   External links  * Historic Elmwood Park Neighborhood Association * National Register of Historic Places, Richland County, South Carolina Category:Geography of Columbia, South Carolina Category:Neighborhoods in South Carolina Category:Houses in Columbia, South Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbia, South Carolina Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in South Carolina ","title":"Elmwood Park, Columbia, South Carolina"},{"id":"14907449","text":"Tatsuro Hirooka (Â∫ÉÂ≤° ÈÅîÊúó, Hirooka Tatsur≈ç born February 9, 1932 in Kure, Hiroshima, Japan) is a retired Japanese professional baseball player and manager.

He is the founder and lead vocalist of the band Emperor. Early life Zaw Win Htut was born into a musical family in Yangon, Myanmar. His father Kyi Khin () was a physician, and his mother Tin Aye was a famous Burmese classical singer with the stage name (). His maternal grandfather was (), a famous songwriter of classical Burmese music. His nickname was Nyi Htut. He received a bachelor's degree in zoology from Yangon University. Career Zaw Win Htut began his career in music as a drummer in a band called Oasis. He formed his own band, Emperor, in the 1980s with five members: Zaw Myo Htut (his brother and lead guitarist), Kyin Kham Phone (bass), Wai Tun (drums), Maung Maung Lwin (keyboards), John O'Hara (acoustics). He was strictly a country and rock and roll singer in his early career. His first album,\\"Mercury Night\\" released in 1983, was not a success. He produced three more solo albums, \\"New Road\\", \\"Comet\\", and \\"Power of Love\\" but they were not much of success either. In 1989, his greatest hits album \\"The Bests of Zaw Win Htut\\" was a huge success and made him a rock star. =Wearing someone else's clothes= Like most Burmese pop singers, Zaw Win Htut became famous with Burmese language covers of foreign (mostly Western rock and pop) hits, written by successful cover \\"songwriters\\" such as Thukhamein Hlaing, Min Chit Thu, Win Min Htwe, and Saw Khu Sae. Unlike most Burmese pop stars, this grandson of Shwe Taing Nyunt was actually embarrassed about it. He famously said that singing those songs were like wearing someone else's shirt. In a 2004 interview he said that his goal was to make original music. He decided to make only \\"original\\" (i.e. non- cover) albums in mid 1990s. He was one of the first artists in the Burmese pop music industry to break away from the cover song mold so many Burmese artists follow. He did score a few hits with A-Hnaing-Me and Achit Mya Thu Si Mha. He continues to perform his famous cover hits in concerts although he performs only the original songs in his overseas concerts. In a 2010 interview, he admitted that he refused to do any concerts overseas for many years because he did not have a sufficient number of original songs, and that he began doing overseas concerts only after he had collected enough original songs. In the same interview he said he had done over 20 overseas concerts. In 2000, he introduced the blues to his records. =Politics= \\"Though their profession calls for them to strut onstage like rebels, Burma's rockers can only mime the anti-establishment part.

Etymology The kibbutz is named for the three workers from Petah Tikva who were accused of espionage during World War I (Palestine was then under the rule of the Ottoman Empire), and were sent to a prison in Damascus. They were tortured and died in 1916. History Historic dining room, c 1939 The kibbutz was founded on 1 May 1925, by a group from the Zionist pioneering HeHalutz movement originating in the city of Kles√≥w in Poland (now Klesiv, Ukraine). Its original site was at a location west of Petah Tikva, which is now within the city, near the intersection of Arlozorov and Tzahal streets. A regional agricultural school was located on the outskirts of Givat Hashlosha. Yitzhak Rabin, later prime minister of Israel, was a student there in 1935-1937.Rabin: 20 Years After, Robert Slater Later it was named after Rosa Cohen, Rabin' mother. The site is now an urban farm and teacher training college. Today, a geriatric institution belonging to Tel Aviv is located at Givat HaShlosha. One of the largest dining halls in pre-state Israel operated in the kibbutz, designed by Israeli architect Aryeh Sharon along other buildings in the kibbutz. In the era before the founding of the state of Israel, Givat HaShlosha was one of the kibbutzim where the Palmach trained, and it had weapons caches for the Haganah. Subsequently, it was raided by the British Army during Operation Agatha. When Holocaust survivors arrived in Israel, the kibbutz absorbed many young people. By 1950, Kibbutz Givat Hashlosha was one of the largest in the country, with close to 900 members. In 1952, an ideological dispute led to the construction of a brick wall in the center of the dining hall to separate the two groups and finally the establishment of a new kibbutz, Einat near Rosh HaAyin.Waiting for Preservation Hall Haaretz Economy In 1968, Givat Hashlosha had 510 inhabitants.\\"Givat Hashlosha\\", Encyclopaedia Judaica.

One sirventes and one canso survive of his poems. Nonetheless, his reputation was high enough that he found his way into the poetry of Bernart de Ventadorn and Raimbaut d'Aurenga.Gaunt and Kay, 279. The work of Alegret is also intertextually and stylistically related to that of Peire d'Alvernhe. Alegret was also one of the first troubadours to employ the feudal metaphor to describe courtly love. He describes his relationship to his domna (lady) as that of vassalage by calling himself her endomenjatz (basically, vassal or liegeman).Paterson, 31. Pelligrini saw this passage as imitating Bernart de Ventadorn, considered the master of this metaphor: {  :De sol aitan mi tengr'ieu per pagatz :Quel vengues, mas jontas, denan :El mostres de ginolhs ploran :Cum suy sieus endomenjatz,  :I should be satisfied simply :if I might come before her with hands joined :and show her, weeping, on my knees, :how I am her endomenjatz,Paterson, 31. } Marcabru parodied the structure of Alegret's Ara pareisson li'aubre sec in his own poem Bel m'es quan la rana chanta.Gaunt, \\"Did Marcabru Know the Tristan Legend?\\", 110.

The scope is standardization of principles and methods relating to language resources in the contexts of multilingual communication. Objectives The goals of LMF are to provide a common model for the creation and use of lexical resources, to manage the exchange of data between and among these resources, and to enable the merging of large number of individual electronic resources to form extensive global electronic resources. Types of individual instantiations of LMF can include monolingual, bilingual or multilingual lexical resources. The same specifications are to be used for both small and large lexicons, for both simple and complex lexicons, for both written and spoken lexical representations. The descriptions range from morphology, syntax, computational semantics to computer-assisted translation. The covered languages are not restricted to European languages but cover all natural languages. The range of targeted NLP applications is not restricted. LMF is able to represent most lexicons, including WordNet, EDR and PAROLE lexicons. History In the past, lexicon standardization has been studied and developed by a series of projects like GENELEX, EDR, EAGLES, MULTEXT, PAROLE, SIMPLE and ISLE. Then, the ISO/TC37 National delegations decided to address standards dedicated to NLP and lexicon representation. The work on LMF started in Summer 2003 by a new work item proposal issued by the US delegation. In Fall 2003, the French delegation issued a technical proposition for a data model dedicated to NLP lexicons. In early 2004, the ISO/TC37 committee decided to form a common ISO project with Nicoletta Calzolari (CNR- ILC Italy) as convenor and Gil Francopoulo (Tagmatica France) and Monte George (ANSI USA) as editors. The first step in developing LMF was to design an overall framework based on the general features of existing lexicons and to develop a consistent terminology to describe the components of those lexicons. The next step was the actual design of a comprehensive model that best represented all of the lexicons in detail. A large panel of 60 experts contributed a wide range of requirements for LMF that covered many types of NLP lexicons. The editors of LMF worked closely with the panel of experts to identify the best solutions and reach a consensus on the design of LMF. Special attention was paid to the morphology in order to provide powerful mechanisms for handling problems in several languages that were known as difficult to handle. 13 versions have been written, dispatched (to the National nominated experts), commented and discussed during various ISO technical meetings. After five years of work, including numerous face-to-face meetings and e-mail exchanges, the editors arrived at a coherent UML model. In conclusion, LMF should be considered a synthesis of the state of the art in NLP lexicon field. Current stage The ISO number is 24613. The LMF specification has been published officially as an International Standard on 17 November 2008. As one of the members of the ISO/TC37 family of standards The ISO/TC37 standards are currently elaborated as high level specifications and deal with word segmentation (ISO 24614), annotations (ISO 24611 a.k.a. MAF, ISO 24612 a.k.a. LAF, ISO 24615 a.k.a. SynAF, and ISO 24617-1 a.k.a. SemAF/Time), feature structures (ISO 24610), multimedia containers (ISO 24616 a.k.a. MLIF), and lexicons (ISO 24613). These standards are based on low level specifications dedicated to constants, namely data categories (revision of ISO 12620), language codes (ISO 639), scripts codes (ISO 15924), country codes (ISO 3166) and Unicode (ISO 10646). The two level organization forms a coherent family of standards with the following common and simple rules: * the high level specification provides structural elements that are adorned by the standardized constants; * the low level specifications provide standardized constants as metadata. Key standards The linguistics constants like /feminine/ or /transitive/ are not defined within LMF but are recorded in the Data Category Registry (DCR) that is maintained as a global resource by ISO/TC37 in compliance with ISO/IEC 11179-3:2003. And these constants are used to adorn the high level structural elements. The LMF specification complies with the modeling principles of Unified Modeling Language (UML) as defined by Object Management Group (OMG). The structure is specified by means of UML class diagrams. The examples are presented by means of UML instance (or object) diagrams. An XML DTD is given in an annex of the LMF document. Model structure LMF is composed of the following components: * The core package that is the structural skeleton which describes the basic hierarchy of information in a lexical entry. * Extensions of the core package which are expressed in a framework that describes the reuse of the core components in conjunction with the additional components required for a specific lexical resource. The extensions are specifically dedicated to morphology, MRD, NLP syntax, NLP semantics, NLP multilingual notations, NLP morphological patterns, multiword expression patterns, and constraint expression patterns. Example In the following example, the lexical entry is associated with a lemma clergyman and two inflected forms clergyman and clergymen. The language coding is set for the whole lexical resource. The language value is set for the whole lexicon as shown in the following UML instance diagram.

Venice, around 1683; d. Padua, Nov., 1761) was a Marquess, physicist, mathematician and antiquarian. He was the son of Marquess Jacopo Poleni and studied the classics, philosophy, theology, mathematics, and physics at the School of the Padri Somaschi, Venice. He was appointed, at the age of twenty-five, professor of astronomy at Padua. In 1715 he was assigned to the chair of physics, and in 1719 he succeeded Nicholas II Bernoulli as professor of mathematics. As an expert in hydraulic engineering he was charged by the Venetian Senate with the care of the waters of lower Lombardy and with the constructions necessary to prevent floods. He was also repeatedly called in to decide cases between sovereigns whose states were bordered by waterways. Poleni was the first to build a calculator that used a pinwheel design. Made of wood, his calculating clock was built in 1709;Copy of Poleni's machine (it) Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia Leonardo Da Vinci. Retrieved 2010-10-04 he destroyed it after hearing that Antonius Braun had received 10,000 Guldens for dedicating a pinwheel machine of his own design to the emperor Charles VI of Vienna.Jean Marguin, p. 93-94 (1994) Poleni described his machine in his Miscellanea in 1709, but it was also described by Jacob Leupold in his Theatrum Machinarum Generale (\\"The General Theory of Machines\\") which was published in 1727. In 1729, he also built a tractional device that enabled logarithmic functions to be drawn. Poleni's observations on the impact of falling weights (similar to Willem 's Gravesande's) led to a controversy with Samuel Clarke and other Newtonians that became a part of the so-called \\"vis viva dispute\\" in the history of classical mechanics. His knowledge of architecture caused Benedict XIV to call him to Rome in 1748 to examine the cupola of St. Peter's, which was rapidly disintegrating. As part of the structural investigation of the dome he used a correctly loaded hanging chain to determine its funicular shape.Malcolm Millais, Building Structures: From Concepts to Design (2005) 2nd edition, p. 187. He promptly indicated the repairs necessary. He also wrote a number of antiquarian dissertations. In 1710 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, in 1739 the French Academy of Sciences made him a member and later the societies of Berlin and St. Petersburg did the same. The city of Padua elected him as magistrate, and after his death erected his statue by Canova. Venice also honoured him by striking a medal. He married Orsola Roberti of Bassano della Grappa.

Iraqi authorities hold 24,000 detainees and the United States 26,000. Critics say only a small proportion of those held are ever prosecuted. Sunni Arab leaders have repeatedly called for the release of detainees in American custody, most of whom are Sunni Arabs held as suspected insurgents. There has been a sharp increase in detentions since the United States 'surge' of mid-2007. Many prisoners are held without formal charges, and their fate is one of many sensitive issues believed to be complicating efforts to promote national reconciliation. The Iraqi cabinet approved a draft law on December 26 that will offer a general pardon to thousands of prisoners in US military and Iraqi custody, a government spokesman said. \\"The cabinet has passed the general pardon law, which will define who is eligible to be freed from all prisons, both Iraqi and American,\\" spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told Reuters. A draft law approved by the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki aims to identify prisoners who would be eligible for release under a general pardon. The law would have to be approved by Iraq's parliament to go into effect. Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffaq al-Rubaie, said that the draft law was aimed at boosting reconciliation between majority Shi'ite and Sunni Arab Muslims. The US military has said it intends to free most of its detainees by the end of 2008.

Its full title in German was the Reichskommissariat f√ºr die besetzten norwegischen Gebiete (\\"Reich Commissariat for the Occupied Norwegian Territories\\"). It was governed by Reichskommissar Josef Terboven until his deposition on 7 May 1945. The German military forces in Norway, then under the command of general Franz B√∂hme, surrendered to the Allies on 9 May and the legal government was restored. German recorrection and occupation of Norway Sign for \\"Reichskommissar f√ºr die besetzten Norwegischen Gebiete Dienststelle Trondheim\\". It was used at the Trondheim office for the national commissioner. The need by Nazi Germany to occupy and incorporate Norway into a German empire came about for two principal reasons. The first was that in 1940, Germany was dependent on natural resources, mainly iron ore, being sent from Sweden to Germany. If Norway allowed Allied vessels to pass through its waters, they could potentially blockade the trade routes. The second reason was that Germany feared an allied attack, either using Norway as a staging area, or moving through Sweden. Neutrality remained the policy of the Norwegian government until the invasion was a fait accompli. But its highest priority was to avoid a war with the United Kingdom. By the autumn of 1939, there was an increasing sense of urgency that Norway had to prepare, not only to protect its neutrality, but indeed to fight for its \\"freedom and independence.\\" Efforts to improve military readiness and capability, and to sustain an extended blockade, were intensified between September 1939 and April 1940. Several incidents in Norwegian maritime waters, notably the Altmark incident in J√∏ssingfjord, put great strains on Norway's ability to assert its (recently broken) neutrality. Norway managed to negotiate favorable trade treaties both with the United Kingdom and Germany under these conditions, but it became increasingly clear that both countries had a strategic interest in denying the other access to Norway. Convinced of the threat posed by the Allies to the iron ore supply, Hitler ordered the German high command (OKW) to begin preliminary planning for an invasion of Norway on 14 December 1939. The preliminary plan was named Studie Nord and only called for one army division. In March and April 1940, British plans for an invasion of Norway were prepared, mainly in order to reach and destroy the Swedish iron ore mines in G√§llivare. It was hoped that this would divert German forces away from France, and open a war front in south Sweden.Cf. French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud's memoirs In the Thick of the Fight (1955) and The Secret Papers of the French General Staff (1940) It was also agreed that mines would be laid in Norwegian waters and that the mining should be followed by the landing of troops at four Norwegian ports: Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger. Because of Anglo- French arguments, the date of the mining was postponed from 5 to 8 April. The postponement was catastrophic. Hitler had on 1 April ordered the German invasion of Norway to begin on 9 April; so, when on 8 April the Norwegian government was preoccupied with earnest protest about the British mine laying, the German expeditions were well on their way. The German invasions for the most part achieved their goal of simultaneous assault and caught the Norwegian forces off guard, a situation not aided by the Norwegian Governments' order for only a partial mobilization. Not all was lost for the Allies though, as the repulsion of German Gruppe 5 in the Oslofjord gave a few additional hours of time which the Norwegians used to evacuate the Royal family and the Norwegian Government to Hamar. With the government now fugitive, Vidkun Quisling used the opportunity to take control of a radio broadcasting station and announce a coup, with himself as the new Prime Minister of Norway. His first official act, at 19:30 that day, was to cancel the mobilization order. Quisling regime Norwegian parliament building in 1941 under German occupation, with the swastika flag and the German V sign on the front of the building Collaborationist support came from the pro-Nazi Nasjonal Samling (\\"National Gathering\\" or \\"National Unification\\") party led by Vidkun Quisling, who was allowed by Adolf Hitler to form a Norwegian government under German supervision. Quisling became Minister President of Norway in 1942 but lacked any real power. Reichskommissar Terboven held control over Norway as a governor, and all the military forces stationed in Norway were under German command.

It is a dam that curves upstream in a narrowing curve that directs most of the water pressure against the canyon rock walls, providing the force to compress the dam. It combines the strengths of two common dam forms and is considered a compromise between the two. They are made of conventional concrete, Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC), or masonry. Arch-gravity dams are not reinforced except at the spillway. A typical example of the conventional concrete dam is the Hoover Dam. Changuinola Dam is an example of the RCC arch-gravity dam. A gravity dam requires a large volume of internal fill. An arch-gravity dam can be thinner than the pure gravity dam and requires less internal fill. Overview Hoover Dam from the air Arch-gravity dams are massive dams of concrete that resist the thrust of water by their weight using the force of gravity and the arch action. An arch-gravity dam incorporates the arch's curved design that is so effective in supporting the water in narrow, rocky locations where the gorge's sides are of hard rock and the water is forced into a narrow channel. Therefore, the span needed for the dam is narrow; the dam's curved design effectively holds back the water in the reservoir using a lesser amount of construction material. When properly situated on an appropriate site, the arch-gravity dam, combining the load resisting qualities of both a gravity dam and an arch dam, inspires the most public confidence because of its appearance of massive permanence. However, curving a gravity dam may make it look stronger, but some of this effect may be psychological factors in operation in making a choice of dam style.

Gameplay  Building on the traditional SimCity formula, SimCity DS 2 offers a new Challenge Mode that sees players guide their city through different historical periods, always starting at the Dawn of Civilization stage, before the player can choose to deviate along a European Oriental city, a Feudal Japanese city, or American style city. Because of this, it is now possible to create cities with a historical theme. For instance, the player can create a Renaissance themed city, a pre-historic themed city or a futuristic city, and unlock famous landmarks as they progress through time that can be built in the open- ended free play mode. Players are also able to take pictures of their city and share them with friends through Local Wireless.  Zones  There are three types of zone featured in the game, and Density type (Low, Medium and High) determines the types of buildings that appear within a zone. *Residential - These zones allow Sims to construct different types of houses, from simple dwellings and huts at the Dawn of Civilization stage to sky-scraping high- rises in the future. The three densities each allow large family homes, multistory apartment buildings or large skyscrapers to be built at best land value. *Commercial - These zones allow trade centers to be built for Sims or large commercial centers where they can spend Simoleons. The three densities each allow large stores, supermarkets or gigantic shopping malls to be built at best land value. *Agri-Industrial - These zones allow orchards, rice paddies and pastures to be built to sustain the city's Sim populace. Once the civilization has gone beyond farming, industrial zones are where windmills and small and large factories are constructed.

Background In American football, a team is allowed four attempts or \\"downs\\" to move the ball or towards the goal line. If the offense moves ten yards in four attempts or fewer, it gains a \\"first down,\\" which restarts the process. If, after four attempts, the offense has neither scored nor gained ten yards, the other team is given possession of the ball. Under normal circumstances (for example, excluding penalties which can involve replaying a down), no team is supposed to be allowed five attempts. The Fifth-Down Game of November 16, 1940 Cornell entered the contest with 18 straight victories over a two-year period. Dartmouth would manage to hold off Cornell's offense for nearly the entire low-scoring game. Dartmouth scored first, achieving a field goal for three points in the fourth quarter. Finally, with less than a minute left in the game, Cornell got the ball on Dartmouth's six-yard line. Cornell expected to have four chances to win the game. On its first down, fullback Mort Landsberg gained three yards. On its second down, Cornell halfback Walt Scholl managed to run the ball to the one-yard line. On the third down, Mort Landsberg tried to run up the middle but did not gain more than a few inches. On the fourth down, Cornell was penalized for delay of game, and Referee Red Friesell spotted the ball just over the 5-yard line in order to replay the fourth down. With nine seconds left on the clock, quarterback \\"Pop\\" Scholl threw an incomplete pass into the end zone. Normally, the ball would have gone to Dartmouth, which would have used up the remaining seconds and won the game, 3‚Äì0. Following the fourth down, linesman Joe McKenney signaled that it was first down and that the ball should go to Dartmouth at the 20 yard line. Referee Friesell thought it was now fourth down, and placing the ball on the six-yard line and granting Cornell a \\"fifth\\" down. Making the most of the unexpected opportunity, quarterback Scholl threw a touchdown pass to William Murphy, and following the extra-point kick, Cornell won the game 7‚Äì3. The forfeit Officials discovered their error after reviewing the game films. Cornell's players, coach Carl Snavely, acting athletic director Bob Kane, and President Edmund Ezra Day, a Dartmouth alumnus, agreed that Cornell should send a telegram to Dartmouth offering to forfeit the game. Dartmouth accepted. If the schools had not agreed, it is unclear how the dispute would have been resolved. Friesell admitted his mistake to the Eastern Intercollegiate Football Association, but acknowledged that his authority \\"ceased at the close of the game\\". Similarly, the association's role was to schedule the referees, not to review or overturn game results. College football's only \\"official\\" record books at the time were kept by private publishers, based on information provided by individual schools. The New York Times compared the Fifth Down Game to a 1922 contest between Columbia and New York University where the schools disagreed on whether the deciding play counted as a touchdown or a safety. The newspaper noted that, as of 1940, both schools continued to claim that game as a win, and at least one record book publisher compromised by listing it as a Columbia win on Columbia's page, and an NYU win on NYU's page. Aftermath Although there is some doubt whether the 1940 Cornell forfeit was \\"official\\" according to NCAA rules, the game is regarded as a 3‚Äì0 Dartmouth victory, instead of a 7‚Äì3 triumph by Cornell. This was described in press accounts as the only time in the history of football that a game was decided off the field. The New York Times NFL sports blog \\"The Fifth Down\\" is named in part after the incident in this game.

He is best known for his innovations and discoveries in the interpretation of music, and for his contributions to the study of biological systems and neurophysiology. Overview Manfred Clynes' work combines music and science, more particularly, neurophysiology and neuroscience. Clynes' musical achievements embrace performance and interpretation, exploring and clarifying the function of time forms in the expression of music‚Äîand of emotions generally‚Äîin connection with brain function in its electrical manifestations. As a concert pianist, he has recorded versions of Bach‚Äôs Goldberg Variations and of Beethoven‚Äôs Diabelli Variations. As an inventor, his inventions (about 40 patents) include, besides the CAT computer for electrical brain research, the online auto- and cross- correlator, and inventions in the field of ultrasound (Clynes invented color ultrasound.) as well as telemetering, data recording, and wind energy. The creative process of computer realizations of classical music with SuperConductor is based on his discoveries of fundamental principles of musicality. Clynes was the subject of a front page article in the Wall Street Journal, September 21, 1991. =Emotion shapes, biologic primacy laws= Clynes concentrated on what he saw as the natural and unalterable interlocking of the central nervous system with basic expressive time forms, and on the innate power of those forms to generate specific basic emotions. He recognized that we are all familiar with this interlocking in our experiences of laughter and of yawning, although its scientific importance had been largely swept under the carpet by a Skinnerian bias and still largely is. According to Clynes's experimental researchClynes, M., Sentics: biocybernetics of emotion communication, Annals of the New York Academy of Science, Vol. 220, Art, 3: 55‚Äì131, 1973.Clynes, M., Sentics: The Touch of Emotions, 250 pp, Doubleday/Anchor, New York, 1977.Clynes, M., Generalised emotion, its production, and sentic cycle therapy, in Emotions and Psychopathology, M.Clynes and J. Panksepp, eds., pp. 107‚Äì170, Plenum Press, New York, 1988. these time forms (‚Äúsentic forms‚Äù), as embodied in the central nervous system, are primary to the varied modes in which they find expression, such as sound, touch, and gesture. Clynes was able to prove this by systematically deriving sounds from subjects‚Äô expressions of emotions through touch, and then playing those sounds to hearers culturally remote from the original subjects. In one trial, for example, Aborigines in Central Australia were able to correctly identify the specific emotional qualities of sounds derived from the touch of white urban Americans. (This experiment was featured on Nova, What Is Music? in 1988). Clynes found in this a confirmation of the existence of biologically fixed, universal, primary dynamic forms that determine expressions of emotion that give rise to much of the experience within human societies. Some of these dynamic forms appear to be shared by those animals that have time consciousnesses at a similar rate to humans; hence the intuition of pet owners that their dog or cat understands tone of voice and the emotional form of touch. Anger, love, and grief, for example, according to Clynes, have clearly different dynamic expressive forms. Importantly, a cardinal property of this inherent biologic communication language, in Clynes‚Äô findings, is that the more closely an expression follows the precise dynamic form, the more powerful is the generation of the corresponding emotion, in both the person expressing and in the perceiver of the expression. Hence, presumably, such phenomena as charisma (in persons whose performance of emotional expressions closely follows the universal form). His experience with Pablo Casals confirmed for Clynes the importance of this faithfulness to the natural dynamic form in generating emotionally significant meaning in musical performance. =Sentic cycles= Drawing on these findings, Clynes also developed an application‚Äîa simple touch art form‚Äîin which, without music, subjects expressed, through repeated finger pressure, a sequence of emotions timed according to the natural requirements of the sentic forms. The 25-minute sequence, called the Sentic Cycle, comprises: no-emotion, anger, hate, grief, love, sexual desire, joy, and reverence. Subjects reported experiencing calmness and energy. Many also evidenced progress in the alleviation of depression, and, to some degree, tobacco and alcohol addictions, as a result of repeated application of this process.Clynes, M., Essentic form-aspects of control, function and measurement Proceedings of the 21st annual Conference of Engineering in Medicine and Biology. Houston, Texas. November 1968. Thousands of people have by now experienced sentic cycles, some for years, some even decades. In the 1980s especially, Clynes taught various groups to conduct Sentic Cycles on their own. Nowadays, the Sentic Cycle kit is available on the Internet. Early work developing sentic cycles in the 1970s had convinced Clynes also that it is easy with it for most people to proceed from experiencing one emotion to another quite rapidly. After three or four minutes of one emotion, a person tended to be being satiated with the current emotion. The ready switching to the next emotion with quite fresh experience pointed to the existence of specific receptors in the brain, he suggested, that become satiated with particular neurohormones; this was later confirmed by the identification of a number of such receptors. This finding links well with the historic tendency of composers to vary emotions every 4 minutes or so in their compositions. The human need for variety is based on brain receptor properties. As anyone who has seen more than three Charlie Chaplin movies in a row can testify, laughter, too, palls after prolonged exposure, and it seems to be for the same reason. Clynes also studied laughter, \\"nature's arrow from appearance to reality\\". In (nonderisive) laughter, according to Clynes, a small element of disorder is suddenly understood to be only apparently disordered, within an actual, larger, order. He then predicted the existence of soundless laughter, in which the sound production is replaced by tactile pressure at the same temporal pattern. In studies at UCSD the mean repetitions of the \\"ha's\\" was found to be approximately 5.18 per second.Clynes, M., The communication of emotion: theory of sentics, in Emotion: Theory, Research and Experience, Vol. 1 Theories of Emotion, R. Plutchik, H. Kellerman (eds.), pp. 271‚Äì300, Academic Press, New York, 1980. Clynes further hypothesized that couples with unmatched speeds of laughter might not be as readily compatible as those whose laughter was harmoniously coordinated. Clynes enthusiastically published his realization that love, joy, and reverence were always there to be experienced, capable of being generated through precise expression and accessible by simple means, due to the connection to their biologic roots. Music had always been a special means for this, but now, with this touch artform, it was universally accessible. By this means, even negative emotions, such as grief anger, could be enjoyed in a compassionate non-destructive framework. In the 1970s and in the 1980s Clynes had started to write poems, a few of which had found their way into his book Sentics. Later, Marvin Minsky quoted from them in his book The Society of Mind. In the late 1980s and in the 1990s he wrote his 12 Animal Poems.Dr. Manfred Clynes Boundaries of Compassion is a substantial set of poems growing out of his experience in Germany while doing experimental work at the Luedenscheid hospital in the summer of 1985, poems in regard to what Germans call \\"the Jewish Question.\\"Farewell to Australia < Boundaries of Compassion =Cyborg (cybernetic organism)= Clynes is credited with developing and coining the term cyborg, which refers to beings with both biological and artificial parts. In other words, cyborgs are beings whose abilities have been enhanced due to the presence and advancement of technology. The term cyborg has become an important concept to technoself studies; an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society focusing on the changing nature of relationships between the human and technology. Biography and career =Education and influences= Early invention of inertial guidance at age 15 Manfred Clynes was born on August 14, 1925, in Vienna, Austria, the son of Olga and Marcel Clynes. His family was Jewish.http://www.rebprotocol.net/senmanfredclynes2.pdf His parents emigrated to Melbourne, in September 1938 to escape Nazism. In Australia, at fifteen, in his last year at high school, having newly learned calculus, he invented the inertial guidance method for aircraft using piezoelectric crystals and repeated electronic integration, but Australian authorities denied that it would work. In fact, the same system Clynes had invented was later used with great success, during the last part of the Second World War. The detailed descriptions of this invention as written by the fifteen-year-old Clynes are rigorous; it was the first of his many inventions to come that worked. (Clynes' earlier attempt, at the age of thirteen, to create a perpetual motion device was naturally a failure). In 1946 Clynes graduated from the University of Melbourne having studied both engineering science and music. Around this time he also had lessons with the Polish virtuoso Ignaz Friedman, then resident in Sydney. Having seen Friedman play in concert several times, Clynes approached him by letter and was accepted sight unseen. He hitchhiked from Melbourne as he could not afford the train fare, let alone the fee charged by Friedman.Allan Evans, Ignaz Friedman: Romantic Master Pianist, p. 322 His musical talent was recognized by a series of awards, concerto performances and prizes, one of which provided a three-year graduate fellowship to the Juilliard School. At Juilliard, he was a piano student of Olga Samaroff and Sascha Gorodnitzki. He received his MS degree from Juilliard in 1949, after having performed Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 at the Tanglewood Music Festival (in 1948) then under the direction of Serge Koussevitzky in a performance of which the pianist Gerson Yessin, who was present, recently recalled as \\"monumental.\\" [Yessin: \\"Manfred played beautifully, outstandingly\\"]. After graduating from Juilliard (It gave no doctorates then), Clynes retreated to a small log cabin at six thousand feet altitude in the solitude of Wrightwood, California. There he learned Bach's Goldberg Variations and other works. He performed them for the first time in October 1949, in Ojai, at Jiddu Krishnamurti's school, and, in 1950, along with other works, in all the capital cities of Australia, to great acclaim. He soon became regarded as one of Australia's outstanding pianists. In 1952 he was invited to Princeton University as a graduate student in the Music Department, and issued a green card, to pursue his studies in the Psychology of Music, with a Fulbright and Smith-Mundt Award. There he became aware of the work of G. Becking, who in 1928 had published a sensitive, if nonscientific, study of distinctive motor patterns associated in following the music of individual composers. It was this work that led, in the late 1960s, to Clynes' scientific sentographic studies of what he termed composers' pulses, as their motor manifestation, in which Pablo Casals and Rudolf Serkin were to be his first subjects.Tedeschi, Bob. \\"How Would Great Composers Play It? Some Clues\\", The New York Times, February 22, 2000. Retrieved January 2, 2008. Young Clynes had a personal letter of introduction to Albert Einstein from an elderly lady in Australia, with whom, in her youth, Einstein had exchanged poems. Soon Einstein invited him repeatedly to dinner at his home, and a friendship sprang up between the two men. Clynes played for Einstein on his fine Bechstein piano, especially Beethoven, Mozart and Schubert. He loved Clynes' playing of Mozart and Schubert, calling Clynes \\"a blessed artist\\" (\\"Ein begnadeter K√ºnstler\\") In May 1953 Einstein wrote Clynes a personal letter by hand to help him in his forthcoming European tour. Letter from Einstein (Translation of Einstein's letter, dated Princeton, May 18, 1953: \\"Dear Mr. Clynes, I am truly grateful to you for the great enjoyment that your piano playing has given me. Your performance combines a clear insight into the inner structure of the work of art with a rare spontaneity and freshness of conception. With all the secure mastery of your instrument, your technique never supplants the artistic content, as unfortunately so often is the case in our time. I am convinced that you will find the appreciation to which your achievement entitles you. With friendly greetings yours, A. Einstein.\\") Concert tours in 1953 Goldberg Variations In 1953, helped by the letter from Einstein, Clynes toured Europe with great critical success, playing the Goldberg Variations. The tour ended with a solo concert before an audience of 2500 at London's Royal Festival Hall, which had just been built.< Dr. Manfred Clynes =Inventions and scientific discoveries= In 1954, to provide for his parents and to raise funds necessary to underwrite his musical career, Clynes, on the basis of his scientific training, took a job working with a new analog computer, a device about which, at the time, both he and his interviewer were ignorant. In short order, however, Clynes mastered that computer, and then within a year created a new analytic method of stabilizing dynamical systems, which he published as a paper in the IEEE Transactions. Bogue, the company he was working for, doubled his salary, after a year, unasked. \\"Only in America!\\" was Clynes' reaction. (He became a citizen in 1960.) In 1955, at Clynes' suggestion, Bogue employed his father, then aged 72, from Australia, as a naval architect; the elder Clynes had not been permitted to work in his profession in Australia, because he was not British-born. For a time Clynes father and son went to work together every morning (to Clynes‚Äô rejoicing). As the result of a chance meeting, in 1956, Dr Nathan S. Kline, Director of the Research Center of Rockland State Hospital, a large mental hospital, offered Clynes a substantial research job at the Center, where he in 1956 became ‚ÄòChief Research Scientist‚Äô. Kline was to become the recipient of two Lasker Awards, and had built up that research center to formidable renown. (It is now called the Nathan S. Kline Psychiatric Center.) CAT computer An autodidact in physiology, Clynes applied dynamic systems analysis to the homeostatic and other control processes of the body so successfully in the next three years, that he received a series of awards, including, for the best paper published in 1960 ‚Äì Clynes' annus mirabilis (miracle year), the IRE W.R.G. Baker Award (1961). In 1960 he invented the CAT computer (Computer of Average Transients) a $10,000 portable computer permitting the extraction of responses from ongoing electric activity‚Äîthe needle in the haystack. The CAT quickly came into use in research labs all over the world, marketed by Technical Measurements Corp., advancing the study of the electric activity of the brain (enabling, for example, the clinical detection of deafness in newborns). In this way, Clynes made his fortune by age 37. URS law Also in 1960, he discovered a biologic law, \\"Unidirectional Rate Sensitivity,\\" the subject, in 1967, of a two-day symposium held by the New York Academy of Science. This law, related to biologic communication channels of control and information, is basically the consequence of the fact, realized by Clynes, that molecules can only arrive in positive numbers, unlike engineering electric signals, which can be positive or negative. This fact imposes radical limitations on the methods of control that biology can use. It cannot, for example, simply cancel a signal by sending a signal of opposite polarity, since there is no simple opposite polarity. To cancel, a second channel involving other, different molecules (chemicals) is required. This law explains, among other things, why the sensations of hot and cold need to operate through two separate sensing channels in the body, why we do not actively sense the disappearance of a smell, and why we continue to feel shocked after a near-miss accident.1967 NY Times article on Clynes Also in 1960, in collaboration with Nathan S. Kline, Clynes published the cyborg concept, and its corollary, participant evolution. \\"Cyborg\\" became a household word and was misapplied, much to the dismay of Clynes, in films such as Terminator. Cyborgology is now a field taught at numerous universities. In 1964 the University of Melbourne awarded Clynes the degree of D.Sc, a degree superior to PhD and rarely given by British universities. =Towards synthesis of scientific and musical work= 1960 NY Times article on ClynesAlready in 1960 The New York Times had noted Clynes' remarkable double-stranded gifts. In 1965 he began to offer concerts at his newly acquired home on the Hudson, which had a real pipe organ in the living room, and of land. With the financial stability resulting from his scientific discoveries, it became possible for Clynes to return to music. An ardent admirer of the great master musician Pablo Casals since early childhood, Clynes now attended all Casals' master classes, many with his family. In 1966, Clynes played both the Diabelli Variations of Beethoven and Bach's Goldberg Variations for Casals, and was invited to join Casals in Puerto Rico for several months to take part in his music and to accompany some of the master classes at the Casals home in Santurce. Clynes considered this contact with Casals to be a fulfilment of his most cherished lifelong dream. Casals exceeded his expectations in every way, and Clynes considered his friendship with Casals to have been the highpoint of his life. As no one else, Casals had, by Clynes' estimation an immediate contact with the profound in music. After his return to New York City, Clynes performed Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto and also gave several concerts at his mansion for invited audiences that included Erich Fromm. Color and the brain With his new CAT computer, Clynes studied the relation of color processing in the brain and the dynamics to sound, and, jointly with M.Kohn, to color of the pupil of the eye. He showed that brain electrical responses to the color red from previous black produced similar patterns from several distinct brain sites, for all subjects. Other colors produced their own distinct patterns. These results from 1965 went a long way to help dispel the Skinnerian notion of tabula rasa. By 1968 he was able to show that it was possible to distinguish which of 100 different objects a person was looking at from his electrical brain responses alone, with repeated presentations. In other experiments in 1969 he described what he called the R-M function (from Rest to Motion) detectable at the apex of the brain for various modalities of stimulation, showing how two sets of unidirectionally rate sensitive (URS) channels in series could produce an effect corresponding to the mental concepts Rest and Motion. What could three URS channel sets do in combination? He never found out. But here were the beginnings of the embodiments of mental concepts in a wordless manner‚Äîa way of representing intuitive concepts to the brain wordlessly. =The brain as an output device= His work until around 1967 had been concerned with the brain as an input device i.e. for perception; now he began to study it as an output device. He turned first to the question of the characteristic pulse in the music of various composers, which had been on his mind since his Princeton years. In 1967 Clynes designed an instrument he called the sentograph to measure the motoric pulse. The experiments required outstanding musicians to \\"conduct\\" music on a pressure-sensitive finger rest, as they were thinking the music without sound. Rudolf Serkin and Pablo Casals were his first subjects. Soon it became apparent that the ‚Äòpulse shapes‚Äô for Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, and Mendelssohn were consistently different from each another, but similar across their different pieces (when normalized according to selection of similar tempo). Encouraged by these positive findings relating outputs to specific inner states of the brain, first presented at a Smithsonian Conference in 1968 at Santa Inez, Clynes then proceeded to measure the expressive form of specific emotions in a similar way, by having subjects generate them by repeatedly expressing them on the finger rest, thus finding specific signatures for the emotions, which he called sentic forms. As in the case of composers' pulses, the form associated with each emotion consistently appeared for that emotion and was distinct from the forms of other emotions. In 1972 Clynes, whose work had long been supported by NIH Grants, received a grant from the Wenner Gren Foundation in Sweden, allowing him to collect data in Central Mexico, Japan, and Bali, using the sentograph to investigate emotional expression cross-culturally. Though considerably more limited in scope than the nature of that inquiry would demand, the data were largely confirmatory of Clynes' theories of universal biologically determined time forms for each emotion. At the invitation of the NY Academy of Sciences, Clynes wrote an extensive monograph on his findings and theories to date, which the Academy published in 1973.Clynes, M., Sentography: dynamic forms of communication of emotion and qualities, computers in Biology & Medicine, Vol, 3: 119‚Äì130, 1973. That same year he accepted a visiting professorship in the music department of the University of California at San Diego, where he completed his book Sentics, the Touch of Emotion, which he had begun in 1972. In it he summarized the theories and findings on sentics, and outlined hopes for the future that his work contained. In 1970 and 1971, the American Association for the Advancement of Science held two symposia on Sentics. Since the sentic cycles suddenly helped individuals feel better without drugs, Clynes' work was now deemed contrary to the line of research sponsored at the Rockland State Research Center, headed by Nathan Kline, whose supporters were the major drug companies. As a result, Clynes was unable to continue the work at that facility. In his new environment, there was no laboratory in which to amass new data. Although dismissed by the NY Times, Sentics was lauded extravagantly in other publications. (The book is considered a classic today). It was read in manuscript with great approval and excitement by several authorities: Yehudi Menuhin volunteered a foreword, itself a remarkable document, welcoming Clynes \\"as a brother.\\" Rex Hobcroft, the director of the New South Wales State Conservatory in Sydney, the foremost musical institution in Australia, compared it to Beethoven's Opus 111, the last of Beethoven's sonatas and held to be his most profound work. (Hobcroft's endorsement appears on the jacket.) Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's resident psychiatrist, Dr. H. Bloomfield joined in. During his three years at UCSD, in La Jolla, Clynes gave a concert at Brubecker Hall, playing the Beethoven Diabelli Variations, as well as a first performance of a group of 5 songs he composed, called \\"Sentone Songs,\\" employing the remarkable vocal range of Linda Vickerman who performed them. The songs, in his own avant garde style, contained many varied syllables but no known words of any language. He did studies of laughter at the brain Institute of UCLA at that time, unsuccessfully attempting to measure the electric counterpart in the brain of the moment that initiates laughter. He was the first to discover, in studying voice recognition in 1975 that a speaker's identity, though unimpeded by changes in speed (tempo), was masked by transposition of as little as a semitone in pitch.Clynes, M., Speaker recognition by the central nervous system, Society for Neuroscience, Abstract, New Orleans, November 1975. This seemed to indicate that perfect pitch was involved far more universally than thought possible. He began work on a book on laughter, which, however, was only two-thirds completed. In 1977 Rex Hobcroft, director of Sydney's New South Wales State Conservatory, who had praised Clynes' Sentics, offered Clynes a substantial position at the Conservatory initially connected with the International Piano Competition held at the time in Sydney. Accordingly, Clynes moved to Sydney in what proved to be the beginning of ten fruitful years of research and music making. In 1978 Clynes gave performances of both the Goldberg Variations and the Diabelli, as well as works of Mozart, at the Verbruggen Hall in Sydney. These performances were recorded live and are today regarded as unsurpassed. From a concertizing point of view, there were unusual difficulties: Clynes' two big-city performances had not been preceded by the usual shake-down cruise of smaller venues: Clynes had only one chance to get it right‚Äîand did. Hobcroft and the government of New South Wales provided Clynes with a Music Research Center and staff at the Conservatory for his work, supplied be the state of NSW Ministry of Education. The staff were mostly enthusiasts of Clynes' work from the United States. Predictive amplitude shaping in music The following year 1980, at the occasion of the 10th International Congress on Acoustics in Sydney, Clynes and his staff presented no fewer than four papers. With the aid of his new DEC PDP 23 computer and associated oscillator gear, he discovered the principle of Predictive Amplitude Shaping (a precise rule for how the shaping of each note is influenced by what note is next and when it will occur) applicable to music in general, a result he presented at an international conference in Stockholm at their invitation.Clynes, M., Expressive Microstructure in Music, linked to Living Qualities in Studies of Music Performance, J. Sundberg (ed.), Publication of Royal Swedish Academy of Music No. 39, pp, 76‚Äì181. Stockholm. Encouraged by the enthusiastic reception of this work in Stockholm, Clynes, on his return to Sydney, now made the major leap to discern how a composer's unique pulse is manifest in each note. It had been known (Leopold Mozart, C.P.E. Bach) that in the work of many composers of the \\"classic\\" period, a group of, say, four notes, when notated equally, were not meant to be played equally. The leap was in treating the four durations and loudnesses not as separate entities, but as a group, an interconnected organism, a ‚Äòface‚Äô in which each component played a unique role, but all combined together to form a gestalt. To find this gestalt, and how it worked organically in the music, he intuited a specific combined amplitude and timing \\"warp,\\" so that each such group has a configuration‚Äîa gestalt‚Äîthat is characteristic of the particular composer. (Now there was also a link to the motoric pulse, previously identified, which had contained no information about single notes but gave a motoric identity to the output of the brain in conducting music of a particular composer). The identification of composers' pulse, and its use in interpreting classical works via computer, was later extended by Clynes, according to his knowledge and experience with dynamic forms, to comprise several levels of time structure. Shortly after this, in 1983‚Äì84 Clynes, with the programming help of N. Nettheim, found a method of allowing computers to design vibrato suitable for each note, depending on the musical structure, also sometimes anticipating next events. Further, all these principles could be easily generically adjusted for the requirements of each musical piece. Of course, a work's interpretation was not robotically created: the computer needed to get adjustments to correspond to the concept of the interpreter. The computer did not replace the human sensitivity, it empowered it instead When Clynes' longtime close friend and supporter Hephzibah Menuhin had launched his book Sentics in 1978 in Australia, small symptoms of her developing throat cancer had made their first appearance. Ms. Menuhin died in 1981, and Clynes gave a memorial concert for her in the Verbruggen Hall, of the last three sonatas of Beethoven, Op 109, 110, and 111. He had learned Beethoven's Opus 110 especially for that occasion, never having performed it before. Intensive practice resulted in his losing an exquisite living place in Vaucluse and his subsequent relocation to an apartment in Point Piper, an adjacent suburb in Sydney. In 1982, Clynes undertook further extensive studies on the nature of the expression of emotions through touch. Subjects were touched on the palm of the hand, from behind a screen, with specific emotional expressions, to discover whether they could identify the emotion. In fact, they could. Clynes and Walker extended this work in a research trip to central Australia, to the Yuendumu Reservation, to test if Aborigines would recognize emotions expressed by touch of white urban dwellers when transformed into sounds that conserved the dynamic shape of the touch. The test was highly positive: the Aborigines did in fact successfully identify the emotions expressed by the touch, of white urban subjects, from which were produced (through a simple transformation, preserving the dynamic shape) the sounds they heard. The American television program Nova reenacted this experiment in 1986, effectively linking the expression of emotions through touch to musical expression, using Beethoven's Eroica Funeral March to exemplify grief, and a Haydn sonata for joy. In 1986, Clynes gave his (or anyone's) first classical concert played entirely by computer, according to the three principles he had discovered, to a full house in a free concert at the Joseph Post Hall of the Sydney Conservatory. As a result of the application of those principles, the music, ranging from Bach to Beethoven to Robert Schumann and Felix Mendelssohn was musically expressive and meaningful, even though all sounds, except for the piano, were produced by computer-controlled oscillators, and so did not represent familiar instruments‚Äîthe real time expressive modification of the canonical orchestral sounds remained elusive until 1993. In 1986, the Fairlight Company, a maker of top-of-the-line synthesizers in the hundred thousand dollar range, immediately opted to license what they called \\"the best sequencer in the world.\\" Clynes, at that time, did not even know what a sequencer was. Fairlight started paying royalties on the patent; however, not long afterwards, the company went bankrupt, having lost government subsidies through a change of government, before bringing the product to market. Reaching retirement age in Sydney, Clynes left to be professorial associate in the Psychology Department at Melbourne University and became Sugden Fellow at Queen's College, which he had attended as an undergraduate. He stayed for three years. During that time he found an analytic equation for an egg, incorporating fractals, which also provided, with some modification of the equation, beautiful shapes of flowers and of vases. He also performed as pianist, in a Sunday series at Queens College, twelve of the Beethoven sonatas, lecturing to the Physics Department on Time, (starting with a poem beginning, \\"What time is it?\\") and to the Medical Faculty on the biologic nature of dynamic expressive forms. Composers' pulses Also during this period, Clynes undertook a large statistical study with various groups of the perception of composer's pulse. In the study, Clynes played four different pieces by computer, by each of four different composers (sixteen in all), with what his studies had determined to be the composer's own pulse and three times the same with a ‚Äòwrong‚Äô composer's pulse, to see which one subjects actually preferred. There were four groups of subjects: internationally well-known pianists, Juilliard graduate students, students at the Manhattan School of Music, and college students at the University of Melbourne, altogether some 150 subjects. The results, published in the journal Cognition,Clynes, M., Microstructural Musical Linguistics: composer's pulses are liked best by the best musicians, COGNITION, International Journal of Cognitive Science, 1995, vol. 55, pp. 269‚Äì310. showed that the \\"correct\\" pulse was preferred in all groups; more pronouncedly so the higher the musical standing of the subjects. (Among the ‚Äòfamous pianist subjects‚Äô were friends of Clynes, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Paul Badura-Skoda.) Clynes returned to the United States in 1991 and settled in Sonoma, California. Not long after his return he was featured in a large front-page article of The Wall Street Journal, an outgrowth of his invitation to a Canadian meeting on music. This highly favorable article opened many doors. Two vice presidents from Hewlett Packard flew separately to Clynes' home to learn about his findings. When they arrived, Clynes played versions of the same Mozart sonata K 330 by six famous artists, including Vladimir Horowitz, Alicia de Larrocha, Claudio Arrau, and Mitsuko Uchida, and included the computer performance at a random position among them. The visitors from HP not only could not identify the computer version, but they rated it second best of the seven. (MIDI versions were considered too musically crude to be included). As a result, Clynes received a development contract that would for the first time enable the expressive implementation of real instrumental sounds other than the piano, using a workstation made available to him by HP, a $40,000 computer, which was, at 150 MHz, barely fast enough to do this. Clynes enlisted his gifted son Darius as software engineer on the HP team to help make it possible. Nine months later, a critical demonstration took place to show that the principles Clynes had discovered would work well with real instruments, not just with oscillators, to enable music played with meaningful phrasing and expression.Riordan, Teresa. \\"Patents\\", The New York Times, April 18, 1994. Retrieved January 2, 2008. \\"Dr. Clynes, whose algorithms are being developed commercially in cooperation with Hewlett-Packard, said his technology would allow a musician to instruct a computer to play a given score with certain phrasings as well as changes in volume, tempo, timbre and rhythm.\\" Clynes and the assembled HP researchers first heard the sound of flute, violin, and cello from the HP workstation performing a Haydn trio expressively in real time over the loudspeakers of the vast halls of the HP Research Building. The inanities of MIDI had been conquered. Once Clynes had successfully developed a real-time implementation of his principles for musical interpretation via computer, using UNIX, HP gave Clynes' company, Microsound, Intl, a second development contract to bring this capacity into the burgeoning world of personal computers (PCs), which, in 1994, functioned at 60 MHz. A French division of HP, then in charge of PC development, supported this enthusiastically. Clynes was fortunate to obtain the help of Steve Sweet, a programmer, to carry out the conversion. However, soon thereafter, HP transferred the PC work to a new division in the United States whose director favored popular music. SuperConductor Henceforth, with the help of Steve Sweet, Clynes developed the software program, called SuperConductor himself. By 1996 they had a fully working version, incorporating all the new principles, with which they interpreted, first, all the Brandenburg Concertos of Bach, and then all of Bach's solo violin and cello works and the last six quartets of Beethoven. All these works were recorded on CDs. Clynes further expanded SuperConductor's capacity for real life expressive interpretation of music with a fourth principle he called \\"Self-tuning Expressive Intonation,\\" which unfixes the equal temperament tuning and permits the sharpening of the leading tone and other modifications of the sort executed by fine players of stringed instruments and other instruments whose intonation is actively controlled in the playing; now even a piano could exhibit this technique‚Äîby means of a laptop computer and synthesizer. Since it is a melodic tuning, depending on intervals, no transposition was required. The same interval going up received a different small pitch increment from that interval going down. Moreover, similarly to known use in tones like the leading tone, Clynes found it appropriate to provide quite small, specific increments to all melodic intervals, 24 in all (twelve up and twelve different ones down). A new patent [US 6,924,426] was granted in 2006. This now made it possible for all computers and synthesizers to benefit from expressive intonation, a non-static, dynamic tuning, in which the same note has a slightly different pitch depending on the melodic structure (the demise of equal temperament). After a four-year absence in Thailand, Steve Sweet returned to Sonoma and resumed his development work with Clynes, incorporating the new functionality into SuperConductor II. (ref to mp3s on the webpage of SuperConductor) With SuperConductor, Clynes performed Beethoven's Emperor Concerto at MIT's Kresge Auditorium in 1999 to the astonishment and wonder and thunderous applause of over two thousand people.Wright, Sarah H. \\"Pair of Media Lab events showcase toys and inventions\\", Massachusetts Institute of Technology press release, dated October 27, 1999. Retrieved January 2, 2008. In 2006, using Self-tuning Expressive Intonation, he performed the Schubert Unfinished Symphony and Beethoven's Eroica Symphony at the University of Vienna in the Kleine Konzertsaal. It became Clynes' aim gradually to make music better than had ever been possible before: to empower the computer in an enterprise of historic proportions to incrementally improve, and increase in profundity, the musical interpretations of great works of our music heritage. With computers, this work of increasing musical perfection could span years, decades, and even centuries. Clynes has also kept up his own playing of the piano. In 2002, he gave a very substantial concert program (of which a videotape exists) as a memorial for a prominent resident of Sonoma. The program included including Liszt‚Äôs Sixth Hungarian Rhapsody, Campanella and Beethoven‚Äôs Waldstein Sonata as well as several major works of Chopin. In 2007, at the age of 82, Clynes has developed new exercises for piano playing away from the piano, which may permit the improvement of piano technique even for octogenarians. In 2007 he applied for three new patents related to SuperConductor, to enhance computer interpretation of music, through: (1) increased mathematical subtlety of note shaping and resulting timbre variations, as earlier, dependent on musical structure, resulting in (2) ‚Äòinstant rehearseless conducting‚Äô, and (3) importation of note-specific vibrato and shaping from SuperConductor into MIDI files. [patent numbers when available] Clynes married in 1951, divorced in 1972 and has three children and eight grandchildren. He died in West Nyack, New York in January 2020, at the age of 94.Manfred Edward Clynes References External links * Category:1925 births Category:2020 deaths Category:American classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:American male pianists Category:Australian classical pianists Category:Austrian classical pianists Category:20th-century American inventors Category:Australian inventors Category:Computer music Category:Austrian emigrants to Australia Category:Musicians from Vienna Category:Musicians from Melbourne Category:Scientists from Melbourne Category:People from Sonoma, California Category:People from Wrightwood, California Category:University of California, San Diego faculty Category:20th-century Austrian musicians Category:20th-century scientists Category:20th-century American scientists Category:American scientists Category:Cyberneticists Category:Systems scientists Category:20th-century American pianists Category:Burials at Cedar Park Cemetery (Emerson, New Jersey) Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Manfred Clynes"},{"id":"14907773","title":"2006 European Speedway Club Champions' Cup"},{"id":"14907809","text":"The Ohio Savings Plaza is a commercial high-rise building in Cleveland, Ohio.

Mahmoud Siam (Guitars) joined the band in 2008. It presents a kind of alternative Egyptian music, mixing rock, jazz and blues with Oriental music. \\"Massar Egbari\\" means \\"Compulsory Detour\\", a name intended to reflect how society forces people to think and live their lives in a certain way. The band pokes fun at typical social norms and trends. The band mainly concentrates on presenting music and songs talking about social problems. Love is not their main concern although it represents a part of their songs. Performances In 2007, the band played for the first time in Europe as part of the Malta Arts Festival held in Valletta, Malta. The same year, they also appeared in the Barisa Rock Festival (Rock for Peace) held in Istanbul, Turkey. In 2008, the band played in The Biennale of young artists from Europe and the Mediterranean in Bari, Italy. In 2009, Massar Egbari played at a festival in Cairo in support of the people of the Gaza Strip, then at the International Adriatic-Mediterranean Festival in Ancona, Italy. In the same year, Massar Egbari was invited to perform as a special guest in the Bienale of young artists in Skopje to perform with Monistra band from Macedonia in their common project Alexsopje (Alexandria-Skopje) and in 2010, the band performed for the first time along with other artists from Africa in Sauti Za Busara Festival in Zanzibar. On May 29, 2014, Massar Egbari performed alongside Black Theama and Cairokee. Massar Egbari members (nationally and internationally) attended several workshops, won several prizes, as well as composing music for a number of movies.

From 2003 to 2013, he co-hosted the 1:00 AM (ET) weekday broadcast of TSN's SportsCentre, alongside Jay Onrait. In May 2013, O'Toole and Onrait revealed they would be leaving TSN and Canada at the end of June to work as co-anchors on the newly created Fox Sports 1 channel based in Los Angeles. He began working for Fox Sports 1 in August 2013 after he and Onrait hosted their final show on TSN on June 28, 2013. After their Fox show was cancelled in 2017 the duo returned to TSN where they currently host SC With Jay and Dan.  Early life  O'Toole grew up on a farm in the rural community of Keene, Ontario and attended St. Peter's Secondary School in nearby Peterborough, Ontario.  Broadcasting career  O‚ÄôToole‚Äôs broadcasting career began at Algonquin College where he did play-by-play for the Ottawa 67s. Following his graduation, O‚ÄôToole moved to Vancouver in 1997 where he reported on traffic from a four-seater plane for CJJR-FM and CFUN-AM. He moved to Fort McMurray, Alberta in 1998 where he worked as a sports director for CJOK-FM and CKYX-FM for three years. While there, O'Toole called play-by-play for the Fort McMurray Oil Barons of the AJHL. In 2000, O‚ÄôToole began working at CTV Edmonton as the Fort McMurray news reporter in the evenings, while continuing to work as the radio sports director in the morning. From 2003 to June 28, 2013, O'Toole co-hosted the 1:00 AM (ET) weekday broadcast of SportsCentre alongside Jay Onrait. As host of Sportscentre, he brought viewers a complete summary of the day's sports events, including highlights and post-game reports. During his time at TSN, O'Toole routinely travelled to communities across Canada co-hosting SportsCentre with Onrait as part of the annual summer TSN and Kraft Celebration Tour. O'Toole was alongside Cory Woron hosting SportsCentre International Broadcast Centre for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games. On May 3, 2013, TSN announced that O'Toole and his broadcast partner Jay Onrait would be leaving SportsCentre for \\"broadcast opportunities on U.S. television [in Los Angeles, but] will continue hosting Sportscentre until late June 2013. The two confirmed the revelation on their weekly podcast and announced they would be working as co-anchors for the newly created Fox Sports 1 channel based in Los Angeles. They cited a promising opportunity to revive the sports highlights culture in American broadcasting as one of the key factors in their decision to leave TSN. During the week of Super Bowl 50, O'Toole was unusually harsh and biting toward his employers at Fox Sports 1. He sent several tweets toward people that were the subject of a Deadspin news article. The tweets may have been attributed to the recent layoffs and budget cuts at Fox Sports Live. On February 23, 2017, Fox Sports Live was cancelled and the two hosts' contracts were not renewed. On March 1, 2017, during NHL trade deadline coverage, TSN announced it had re-signed both Onrait and O'Toole in their previous roles at the network. They currently host the show SC With Jay and Dan at 12:00 am EST.  Podcast  Following the London 2012 Olympics, where O'Toole was presenting daily SportsCentre highlights from Trafalgar Square with Onrait, O'Toole and Onrait took their television personas and unique brand of humour to the sound booth and began a weekly podcast. The \\"Jay and Dan Podcast\\" soon became one of the most successful podcasts in Canada. Along with discussing O'Toole's childhood, current events, TV commercials, and vintage television show themes, the duo played host to a variety of guests. When Onrait and O'Toole returned to TSN in 2017, the podcast returned as well with Coors Light as the sponsor.  Family  O'Toole has two daughters, Ruby and Sydney, with his ex-wife Corrie. O'Toole announced the birth of his third daughter, Oakland, on May 26, 2020. On July 2, 2020, O'Toole announced on Twitter and his Instagram page that his one-month-old daughter Oakland was missing, but that he believed her to be alive. Hours later, after controversially retorting to a reporter trying to help, he posted that Oakland had been located. According to a Durham Regional Police police contact, there was never any abduction and crime. O'Toole has since deleted all of his Twitter and Instagram posts which pertain to this matter.

Retrieved June 6, 2020 born June 13, 1950 in Janesville, Wisconsin) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Detroit Tigers in 1972. He wore number 46 in his only year in the Majors. His father, Bob Strampe, Sr., pitched in the minor leagues in 1934 for the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and Brainerd-Little Falls Muskies. Originally drafted by the Tigers in the 18th round (414th overall) of the 1968 amateur draft, Strampe saw a fair amount of success in the minors as a starter, never posting a season ERA higher than 3.42. Perhaps his best season was his first - 1969 for the Batavia Trojans. In 115 innings of work that year, he went 10-5 with 138 strikeouts and a 2.97 ERA. He made his major league debut at the age of 21 on May 10, 1972 against the Chicago White Sox. The 6'1\\", 185 pound right- hander came in to relieve for Ron Perranoski, and didn't have much luck, surviving only 1/3 of an inning. He gave up four hits and a walk, allowing in four earned runs. Overall, he pitched in seven games in 1972, posting an ERA of 11.57. In 4 innings, he allowed six hits, seven walks and six earned runs. He struck out only four batters. Although his performance was unimpressive, he did not allow a single home run, which is notable considering the circumstances. He played his final big league game on September 19 of that year. He went out much better than he came in - he struck out the final batter he ever faced, Mike Kilkenny of the Cleveland Indians. Although his major league career ended in 1972, Strampe continued to pitch professionally in the minor leagues. On November 18, 1974, Strampe was involved in a three-team trade involving the Tigers, Padres, and St. Louis Cardinals. The Tigers sent Strampe and Dick Sharon to the Padres and the Padres sending Nate Colbert in return. The Padres sent a player to be named later (it would end up being Danny Breeden) to the Cardinals, and the Tigers sent Ed Brinkman to the Cardinals. The Cardinals sent Alan Foster, Rich Folkers, and Sonny Siebert to the San Diego Padres. In total, seven players were involved in the trade, with the Tigers receiving Colbert, the Padres receiving Sharon, Foster, Folkers and Siebert and the Cardinals receiving Brinkman and Breeden. At last check, Strampe resided in Cheney, Washington.

In 1893, in San Francisco, Walker at the age of 20 met Bert Williams, who was a year younger. The two young men became performing partners. Walker and Williams appeared in The Gold Bug (1895), Clorindy (1898), The Policy Player (1899), Sons of Ham (1900), In Dahomey (1903), Abyssinia (1906), and Bandanna Land (1907). Walker married dancer Ada Overton, who later also was a choreographer. The two men set up an agency, The Williams and Walker Company, to support African-American actors and other performers, create networking, and produce new works. Early life George W. Walker was born in 1873 in Lawrence, Kansas, the son of a policeman and his wife. He began his career as a child performer, touring in black minstrel and medicine shows. George Walker and Bert Williams Williams & Walker Walker and Bert Williams became two of the most prominent figures of the minstrel era and a famous duo. They met in 1893 in San Francisco and formed a vaudeville act when Walker was 20. Bert Williams had come to the United States as a child with his parents from the Bahamas, and became a vaudeville entertainer. Peterson, Bernard L. \\"George Walker.\\" The American Mosaic: The African American Experience. ABC-CLIO, 2015. Web. 24 Sept. 2015. The two men decided to subvert vaudeville stereotypes and play against their appearances. With lighter skin expressing some European ancestry, and a fine voice, by the expectations of the time Williams would have performed as the \\"straight man\\" in comedy routines. Williams was very talented, and he played all instruments very well. Walker had darker skin, and was a great comedian and dancer. He would be expected to play the fool. The two realized that they were much funnier when they reversed their roles, so \\"...Walker became the straight man--dressed a little too high-style and spending all the money he could borrow or trick out of the lazy, careless, unlucky Williams--and Williams became the blumbery, sorrowful, comical-in- spite-of-himself patsy.\\" Bert Williams's first ambitions had been to attend Stanford University and become an engineer. Since he could not afford to go, he had worked as a singing waiter in hotels in San Francisco. George Walker had performed in traveling medicine shows before ending up in San Francisco and joining up with Williams. Once they became organized, they needed a selling point to get their names out in the theatre world. Their act grew popular in West Coast theatres, where the minstrel shows were being called vaudeville. At the same time, white performing duos were billing themselves as \\"coons\\" (a disparaging term for blacks) and performing vaudeville in blackface. Williams and Walker decided to market themselves as the \\"Two Real Coons.\\" In 1896, they appeared in a New York City production called The Gold Bug at the Casino Theatre. It was a short run and the production did not receive good reviews, but they were hired by another theatre for a record run of twenty-eight weeks. During that time, they popularized the cakewalk. This dance became very popular in high society in New York City and spread throughout all classes of whites. Their next project was The Sons of Ham. Williams and Alex Rogers wrote a song for it called \\"I'm a Jonah Man\\", and the song became a trademark for Williams. They participated in a \\"Benefit for New York's Poor\\" held on February 9, 1897 at the Metropolitan Opera House, their only appearance at that theater.\\"Monster All Star Benefit! Benefit for New York's Poor. Metropolitan Opera House: 02/9/1897,\\" MetOpera Database CID:18300 (accessed 24 May 2019). When Williams and Walker began to perform together, they wanted to change the dynamics of the theatre. But, they also had to satisfy audience demand, and audiences were predominately white. They began to feature the traditional cakewalk, a dance from slavery times. It is known to have been based in West African festive dances commonly performed during harvest festivals. Couples would form a circle, promenade, prance with buckets of water on their heads to the sound of banjos playing, and clap their hands. The winning couple got a cake. When Williams and Walker worked with the cakewalk, \\"the dance had many variations and in some was apparently a slightly veiled comic parody of their masters' pretentious posturing and high falutin' attitudes.\\" After Williams and Walker introduced this dance into their act, the cakewalk started being danced in stage shows, exhibitions, contests, and ballrooms. These were open only to white communities, with different venues appealing to working class through upper class. It eventually spread through the United States and over to Europe. The two men were interested in incorporating African themes and characters into American shows. That opportunity came with the production of In Dahomey. Williams and Walker teamed up with composer Will Marion Cook, librettist Jesse Ship, and poet/lyricist Paul Laurence Dunbar to produce the musical comedy, In Dahomey, the first full-length musical to open on Broadway written and performed entirely by Blacks. This musical comedy had all original music and was supported by scenery and props. Unlike the vaudeville shows, it had a complete story line from beginning to end, although the songs were often loosely related to it. Some critics have suggested that the story lines of later Bing Crosby and Bob Hope comedy films were similar. \\"The Crosby/Hope films may well have been inspired by Williams and Walker shows like 'In Dahomey'.\\" This show generated so much success that it received great reviews in London, and toured throughout the United Kingdom and United States. Williams and Walker worked very hard to produce quality theatre. They wanted their sets and costumes to be just as extravagant as those in the white theatres. They also had great lighting and elaborate props. Walker was the more business-savvy of the two and handled most of the management responsibilities of their productions. Walker's goal was to elevate the professionalism in black theatre. By 1906, Williams and Walker were active in organizing an African-American actors' union called The Negro's Society. In 1908 Walker founded The Frogs, an organization for African-American professional entertainers. It was a place for black entertainers to get together and socialize in order to get to know each other and to create a support base. His organization held events that included black acts, dining, and dancing. They encouraged young performers to achieve a standard of excellence in their stage work. The team produced and starred in two more successful plays, In Abyssinia and their final show, Bandanna Land (1907). Walker was taken ill and forced to retire from show business in the middle of the 1908-1909 season. Death While touring with Bandanna Land in 1909, Walker began to stutter and suffer memory loss. They were the symptoms of syphilis. He died on January 8, 1911, and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery, in his hometown of Lawrence, Kansas. In the early 20th century, other notables such as Scott Joplin and Louis Chauvin also died of syphilis, which was an incurable disease before the advent of penicillin. Many African-American performers contracted the disease. By 1911, most of the small, close-knit group who had managed to bring their artistry to Broadway were dead. African Americans did not return in numbers to the stages of the Great White Way for eleven years. Williams's later years After Walker died, Williams had a hard time keeping their company operating. He was approached by Florenz Ziegfeld to perform in his Follies. Williams agreed and signed a three-year contract. The white actors threatened to walk out because they did not want competition from a black actor, but changed their minds when Ziegfeld said he could replace any of them except for Williams, because he was unique and talented. After his contract was up, Williams performed for another three years with the Follies because of his success. By 1913, Williams gained success as a recording star. He starred in two short, silent films, Fish and Natural Born Gamblers, in 1916. In 1920, he appeared in the Broadway Brevities of 1920, followed by Shuffle Along, in 1921. This seemed to reopen Broadway to black musicals. He produced an all-black show called Under the Bamboo Tree, which was not a great success. His health began to fail, and Williams died on March 4, 1922. Contributions Walker became more than an entertainer, and was considered a race leader. He made many significant contributions through his shows and the management of his The William and Walker Company.Sotiropoulos, Karen. Staging Race: Black Performers in Turn of the Century America. Cambridge, MA, USA: Harvard University Press, 2006. =Contributions as an artist= As vaudevillians, Walker and Williams reached the top of national theatre by performing on Broadway and beyond. Vaudeville was known for its performers' playing to the audience, creating an air of intimacy usually absent in legitimate theater. Walker and Williams brought some of this intimacy to In Dahomey (1903) and Bandanna Land (1907-1909). They fought against racism and challenged stereotypes, as well as teaching white audiences about African-American culture. In Dahomey In Dahomey (1903) was the first full-length African-themed musical comedy. Led by Bert Williams and George Walker, it broke the color line on Broadway. The musical tells a story about a group of African Americans who find a pot of gold and move to Africa to become rulers of Dahomey. The film's song \\"Swing Along\\" captured the mindset of black artists. In this song, dialect speech encouraged black audiences to ‚Äúlif‚Äô a‚Äô yo‚Äô heads up high, Wif‚Äô pride an‚Äô gladness beaming‚Äô from ya‚Äô eye,‚Äù encouraged people to ‚Äúswing along‚Äù despite the pervasive white gaze; to ‚Äùswing along‚Äù even though ‚Äúwhite fo‚Äôks jealous when you‚Äôse walkin‚Äô two by two‚Äù; to ‚Äúswing along despite the horrors and dehumanization of life under Jim Crow‚Äù. Bandanna Land (1907-1909) Cover of the song \\"Bon Bon Buddy\\" that closed Act 2 of the 1908 musical \\"Bandanna Land\\". Bert Williams is in the photo on the lower left; George Walker on the lower right The story is about African- American realtors putting one over on white folks. Preying on white fears of a black-owned, black-controlled public space, the realty corporation opened an African-American amusement park and ‚Äúorganized a big noisy negro jubilee to raise such Hades that the people bought them out‚Äù at an inflated price. Again, Williams and Walker addressed segregated public space, white racist stereotypes, and African-American exploitation of stereotypes for economic gain. According to Sotiropoulos, while most white reviewers commented on the show's ‚Äúnegro flavor‚Äù, or praised its ‚Äúpicturesque rural scenery‚Äù, and \\"naturalness\\", they did not understand that the larger joke was on the whites' being taken advantage of due to their racism. The phenomenal success of The Williams and Walker Company depended on pushing beyond the stereotypes but only so far as white audiences could accept. The boundary between pushing the limits and being offended has to be carefully manipulated on stage by artists. This was something the black critics fully appreciated. =Contributions as a business owner = ‚ÄúWe thought that as there seemed to be a great demand for black faces on the stage, we would do all we could to get what we felt belonged to us by the law of nature.‚Äù - George Walker Forbes, Camille F., Aug 01, 2008, Introducing Bert Williams: Burnt Cork, Broadway, and the Story of America's First Black Star, Basic Books, New York, As a leader of The William and Walker Company, Walker provided a place for talented colored artists to gather and communicate, which encouraged African American performers‚Äô presence on stage.  Providing a meeting space for Black artists  Once Williams and Walker first became successful in New York with their 1896 vaudeville act, their ‚Äúfirst move was to hire a flat in Fifty-third Street, furnish it, and throw our door open to all colored men who possessed theatrical and musical ability and ambition.‚Äù They wanted to provide a space where ‚Äúall professional colored people could meet and exchange views and feel perfectly at home,‚Äù and their own flat became ‚Äúthe headquarters of all artistic young men of our race who were stage struck.‚Äù Walker explained, ‚Äúby having these men around‚Äù, he and Williams ‚Äúhad an opportunity to study the musical and theatrical ability of the most talented members of our race.‚Äù (Theater Magazine, August 1906) Later, this place was known as the most ‚Äúculturally stylish‚Äù black area of the city, became the center of the black theatrical world offstage and was later referred as ‚ÄúBlack Broadway‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack Bohemia.‚Äù  Providing jobs for Black artists  In addition to offering a creative outlet to talented Black American performers, The William and Walker Company supported their performers with pay. They put a lot of their earnings back to their company, supporting the actors, writers, musicians, stagehands, and the rest of the personnel who made their company so successful. As Walker said, ‚ÄúFiguring out how many families that would support. Then look at the multifaceted talent we are employing and encouraging. Now, do you see us in the light of a race institution?‚Äù Veronica Adams, ‚ÄúThe Dramatic Stage as an Upbuilder of the Races,‚Äù Chicago Inter Ocean, January 17, 1909 The New York Age commended him for bringing ‚Äúabout conditions providing positions for colored writers, composers and performers‚Äî positions paying large salaries,‚Äù and declared him to be ‚Äúthe commander-in-chief of the colored theatrical forces.‚Äù New York Age, March 12, 1908 See also *The Frogs (club) *African-American musical theater *Blues dance Notes References *Biography Resource Center.

He started working on motors on his neighbor's tractor engine. He began drag racing in a 1955 Chevrolet convertible at Berwyn, Pennsylvania before going off to college at Cornell University for engineering. He left college in his third year. He became nationally known after helping to build 30 cars that set national records. He became known in national circles as the engine builder for Dave Strickler in the early 1960s. Jenkins teamed with Strickler to win Little Eliminator at the 1963 Nationals with an A/FX 427 Chevy.NHRA.com (retrieved 23 May 2017) He drove hemi-powered Dodges in 1964 and 1965 after Chevy left drag racing early in the 1963 season. In 1964, Jenkins and Strickler travelled to England, as part of the U.S. Drag Racing team, to take part in the First International Drag Festival, a series of six events held that fall. He won the A/MP (A/Modified Production) class in a 1965 Plymouth gasser at the 1965 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis Raceway Park, with a pass of 11.11 seconds at .Davis, Larry. Gasser Wars (Cartech, 2003), p.184. He would also win S/SA at the 1965 Winternationals in a hemi-powered Plymouth named Black Arrow.NHRA.com (retrieved 23 May 2017) His winning pass in the final round was an 11.39 second e.t., overcoming Dick Housey's 11.37 with a holeshot Jenkins couldn't agree on terms with Chrysler for 1966, so he decided to run a Chevy independently by making his own Chevy engine package. Without factory support, Jenkins developed his first Grumpy's Toy, a 327 cubic inch / 350 horsepower Chevy II. When he found the compact car was to be placed in the same class as the 426 ci/425 horsepower hemi Dodge and Plymouth muscle cars, he commented it \\"looked like a pretty good gimmick at the time\\". The lower displacement engine in the smaller car, hence lighter minimum weight, enabled it to outrun the larger-engined but heavier cars. He set a class record with an 11.66 second pass. He was added to Chevrolet's team in 1967. He became known as the premiere normally aspirated drag race engine builder after his Super Stock victory at the 1967 Nationals. He entered Pro Stock when NHRA started it in 1970, and won the first two events of the year (the Winternationals and Gatornationals) in a 1968 Chevrolet Camaro, ultimately taking the national title. His first car built specifically for Pro Stock, a 1970¬Ω Camaro, would be the first of the class to make the cover of Hot Rod (their July 1970 issue).Hot Rod staff writers. \\"The History Of Hot Rodding ‚Äì 1970s\\", written 29 August 2013, at Hot Rod Network (retrieved 19 June 2017) Jenkins went winless in 1971. NHRA changed the 1972 rules to allow drivers with a small block wedge engine to run a lighter car. Jenkins used a small block-based in a Chevrolet Vega fitted in the class' first tube chassis, which debuted at the 1972 Winternationals. He had a subpar 9.90 second pass in the untested Vega, qualifying 17th of the 32 entries at the season-opening event. After tuning the chassis, the car clocked low-9.6 second passes on race day and Jenkins won the event. Jenkins used the car to win five of the first eight events of the season (some of them regionals) and six of eight Nationals. Jenkins earned a total of $250,000 that year, including event and manufacturer support. He matched Wilt Chamberlain as the professional athlete with the highest salary in the United States. That year he was featured in Time magazine, the first drag racer to experience mainstream national coverage. In 1973, following an NHRA rule change to allow records to be set at any national meet, Jenkins drove his Vega to Pro Stock's first official record, a pass, at the Winternationals; \\"Dyno Don\\" Nicholson set the e.t. record with a 9.33.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"The Time Machine: 1973\\", written 17 August 2018, at NHRA.com (retrieved 16 September 2018) Jenkins built a Vega in 1974 (dubbed Grumpy's Toy XI) that had several firsts which impacted future drag racing cars, including the first dry sump oiling system and a MacPherson strut front suspension. This car would give him thirteen wins in Pro Stock that year. Car owner and engine builder Jenkins retired as a driver, hiring Larry Lombardo and Ken Dondero to drive his cars so that he could concentrate on research and development.Jenkins' 'Grumpy' ways make for a winning way; Bill Stephens; January 20, 2006, ESPN, Retrieved December 27, 2007 Lombardo replaced Jenkins in the driver's seat for the second race of the 1976 season in NHRA. Lombardo won that season's NHRA Winston Pro Stock championship despite the late start. Dondero won the AHRA title. Lombardo raced for Jenkins until 1979, finishing third in 1977 points, second in 1978, and seventh in 1979. Jenkins cut down the team's match races in the early 1980s until his final season as a team owner in 1983. Joe Lepone won the 1985 Winternationals with a Jenkins Pro Stock engine. Grumpy's main focus was on Comp engines, which were used by a large client list, including national event winners Garley Daniels, Steve Johns, and Bob Kaiser. He led development of GM's new splay-valved cylinder heads for the Chevrolet small block V8 engines, utilized in the new Pro Stock Truck category in 1998. He fitted the splay- valve heads in a engine, used by Larry Kopp to win the 1998 Winston drag championship, and by 1998 national event winners Tim Freeman, Brad Jeter, Johns, Mark Osborne, Scott Perin, and Don Smith. Jenkins-built engines continue to be used. A Jenkins powerplant was used by Dave Connolly in his title-contending Pro Stock Cobalt to win the 2005 Winternationals and briefly placed Connolly in the POWERade points lead. In 2006, two-time Pro Stock champion Jim Yates announced a testing program with a Jenkins motor in his 2005 Pontiac GTO. Jenkins also worked on some NASCAR engines. He built the engine Donnie Allison used to take the pole position in the 1975 Daytona 500. Mike Swaim used a Jenkins motor to take the pole for the 1987 Busch Series race at Daytona.

This leads to an inflammatory response, hence the alternative names neoplastic meningitis (NM), malignant meningitis, or carcinomatous meningitis. The term leptomeningeal (from the Greek lepto, meaning 'fine' or 'slight') describes the thin meninges, the arachnoid and the pia mater, between which the cerebrospinal fluid is located. The disorder was originally reported by Eberth in 1870. It occurs with cancers that are most likely to spread to the central nervous system. The most common cancers to include the leptomeninges are breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanomas because they can metastasize to the subarachnoid space in the brain which offers a hospitable environment for the growth of metastatic tumor cells. Individuals whose cancer has spread to an area of the brain known as the posterior fossa have a greater risk of developing a leptomeningeal cancer. The condition can also arise from primary brain tumor like medulloblastoma. Leptomeningeal disease is becoming more evident because cancer patients are living longer and many chemotherapies cannot reach sufficient concentrations in the spinal fluid to kill the tumor cells.  Epidemiology  In the United States, 1‚Äì8% of cancer patients are diagnosed with leptomeningeal disease, with approximately 110,000 cases per year. The exact incidence of leptomeningeal disease is difficult to determine, since gross examination at autopsy may overlook signs of leptomeningeal disease, and microscopic pathological inspection may be normal if the seeding is multifocal or if an unaffected area of the central nervous system (CNS) is examined.  Causes  Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis occurs when the cancer cells invade the cerebrospinal fluid and spread throughout the central nervous system. The metastatic tumor cells grow either attached to the pia mater covering the brain and spinal cord or floating unattached to the subarachnoid space. Tumors of diverse origins and hematologic cancers may spread to this space. Some patients can develop a leptomeningeal tumor while receiving chemotherapy for their primary tumor.  Pathology  There are three anatomic patterns by which the tumor can spread in the subarachnoid space. More than one pattern may coexist in the same patient. First, there may be plaque-like deposits of cells in the leptomeninges with invasion of Virchow-Robin spaces and, usually, the shedding of tumor cells into the cerebrospinal fluid. Second, there may only be a thin coating of meninges, in some cases with only a single cell layer, but also with shedding of tumor cells into the cerebrospinal fluid. Third, there may be a pattern of nodular deposits of tumor on cranial and spinal nerve roots, frequently without tumor cells being shed into the cerebrospinal fluid. The first and third patterns are common in solid tumors whereas the second occurs most frequently with leukemia and lymphoma. =Spinal cord= Neoplastic meningitis (NM) shows diffuse infiltration of tumor cells into the subarachnoid space which may be associated with increased intracranial pressure, signs of meningeal irritation, and damage to the cranial and spinal nerve roots. Pathological feature include: *Circular necrosis of the white matter in the periphery of the spinal cord was also noted which probably resulted from circulatory disturbance secondary to tumor infiltration. *Dorsal radiculopathy which is secondary ascending degeneration of the posterior funiculus may also occur due to malignant cells collecting or a presence of tumor which cause compression of the nerve. *Tumor cell proliferation is observed around nerve roots as well as loss of myelinated nerve fibers and axonal swelling. In areas of tumor cells, infiltration of macrophages is observed. Nerve root infiltration has shown positive correlation with meningeal dissemination. *Infiltration of the spinal cord parenchyma is found with destruction of the pia mater. Tumor cell infiltration is associated with spongy changes in the white matter of the spinal cord beneath the pia mater with demyelination, axonal swelling, and macrophage infiltration. Transverse necrosis of the spinal cord is usually marked with bleeding from tumor growth in the subarachnoid space and is the result of compression by the hematoma in the subarachnoid space. =From primary cancer to the meninges= NM is a secondary cancer meaning that it is the result of neoplastic cells that have metastasized from a primary cancer site. These cancers develop an enzyme that is able to break down blood vessels at a microscopic level. These cells enter the blood vessels and travel across the body. Once the brain is reached, they break down the blood‚Äìbrain barrier to enter the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). There the cancerous cells seed and disseminate into the leptomeninges which are composed of the arachnoid and the pia. The CSF continues to carry neoplastic cells through the brain tracts and spreads the cancerous cells. Lung cancer, breast cancer, and malignant melanoma comprise the majority of solid tumors spreading to the leptomeninges. Although rare, meningeal carcinomatosis can arise from cervical cancer. Only eight cases of MC arising from squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix are previously reported in the literature. Since NM is a result of primary cancer metastasis and can develop from primary brain tumors or parenchymal metastasis when tumor cells are lodged in small central nervous system (CNS) vasculature, causing local ischemia and vessel damage which result in tumor spillage into the Virchow-Robin spaces and providing access to the subarachnoid space. =Invasion routes= *Hematogenous spread, or spread through blood vessels, occur either through the venous plexus of Batson or by arterial dissemination. This occurs with arterioles as a result of tumor cells being lodged in vessels that feed the meninges and later causing leakage into the meninges and CSF. This same situation also appear with spinal arteries where leakage of tumor cells is into the nerve roots. More regarding the effects of NM on spinal cord is discussed later. Tumor cells may also seed the choroid plexus, where CSF is produced, and ultimately gaining direct access to the CSF. Seeding of the choroid plexus is most common in patients with third and lateral ventricular hydrocephalus. *Venous spread may occur when intra- abdominal or thoracic pressure increases and venous flow is retrograde which then allows tumor cells in the systemic venous system to enter the vertebral venous system. *Centripetal migration from systemic tumors along perineural, invasion of nerve space, or perivascular spaces.Chamberlain, Marc C. (2008). Neoplastic meningitis. The Oncologist, 13(9), 967-977. Malignant cells can migrate along spinal or cranial nerve epineurium-perineurium, invade the subpial space, and travel along blood vessels into the endoneurial space, or invade the nerve parenchyma. Infiltration happens most often at the base of the brain, dorsal surface, and especially at the cauda equina (bundle of nerves occupying spinal column) which is largely due to the effect of gravity. Once in the CSF, malignant cells can extend along the membrane surfaces or spread freely in the CSF and attach to other locations. These cells have the ability to penetrate the pial membrane and invade the spinal cord and cranial nerves.Mammoser, A., & Groves, M. (2010). Biology and therapy of neoplastic meningitis. Current Oncology Reports, 12(1), 41-49. =Infiltration to spinal cord= Infiltration from the subarachnoid space into the spinal cord occurs primarily along the perivascular tissues that surround blood vessels at the brain entrance. Infiltration from the anterior median fissure, a 3mm deep furrow on the anterior side of the spinal cord, to the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the ventral grey matter of the spinal cord, is found along the central artery. Direct infiltration of the nerve roots is also observed, mostly from the dorsal roots (the afferent sensory root of the spinal nerve) than the ventral roots (the efferent motor root of a spinal nerve). With mild infiltration, tumor cells are found diffusely in the subarachnoid space from the cervical to sacral levels. In some cases however there are no differences between spine levels. Infiltration from the subarachnoid space into the spinal cord occurs mainly along the perivascular space of the white matter. However, in some cases, direct infiltration into the spinal cord parenchyma is found together with destruction of the pia mater.Kizawa, M., Mori, N., Hashizume, Y., & Yoshida, M. (2008). Pathological examination of spinal lesions in meningeal carcinomatosis. Neuropathology, 28(3), 295-302.  Signs and Symptoms  The most common symptoms of leptomeningeal cancer is pain and seizures. The other symptoms may include headaches (usually associated with nausea, vomiting, light-headedness), gait difficulties from weakness or ataxia, memory problems, incontinence, sensory abnormalities. In some cases, symptoms may include double vision, numb chin, back pain, leg weakness, sphincter-related problems, hydrocephalus, loss of urine control, and difficulty walking. Depending on where the tumor cells settle, leptomeningeal cancer can cause almost any neurological problem. Other symptoms that are less common cranial nerve abnormalities, spinal symptoms such as limb weakness and paresthesia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Diplopia is the most common symptom of cranial nerve dysfunction. Trigeminal sensory or motor loss, cochlear dysfunction, and optic neuropathy are also common findings. Spinal signs and symptoms include weakness, dermatomal or segmental sensory loss, and pain in the neck, back, or following radicular patterns. 3 affected domains of neurological function: *Cerebral hemisphere (15%) *Cranial Nerves (35%) *Spinal cord and roots (60%) Signs reported: *headache *mental status change *confusion *cognitive impairment *seizures *hemiparesis *gait instability  Diagnosis  Screening involves an MRI scan to identify and diagnose tumors in the subarachnoid region of the brain. MRI can make a diagnosis even without an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid but it can sometimes be difficult to detect because MRI scans cannot always pick up the problem. Diagnosis is most commonly made by lumbar puncture to detect malignant cells in the CSF, although the tests may be negative in roughly 10% of patients. Diagnosis often requires a high index of suspicion and is confirmed by neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. CSF examination is the most useful diagnostic tool for NM. Patients with suspected NM should undergo one or two lumbar punctures, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spinal MRI, and a radioisotope CSF flow study to rule out sites of CSF block. If the cytology remains negative and radiological studies are not definitive, consideration may be given to ventricular or lateral cervical spine CSF analysis based on the suspected site of predominant disease. Consideration of signs, symptoms, and neuroimaging can help with the placement to where CSF is drawn. Median time of diagnosis from initial primary cancer diagnosis is between 76 days and 17 months.Park, K., Yang, S., Seo, K., Kim, Y., & Yoon, K. (2012). A case of metastatic leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from early gastric carcinoma. World Journal of Surgical Oncology, 1074. doi:10.1186/1477-7819-10-74 NM diagnosis has been increasing and will continue to increase due to better primary care and longer survival time of cancer patients. =Difficulties in diagnosis= NM is multifocal and CSF at a particular site may show no abnormalities if the pathological site is far away. Only 50% of those suspected with NM are actually diagnosed with NM and only the presence of malignant cells in the CSF is diagnosis conclusive. =Techniques= *MRI: Meningeal findings are described with the following characteristics: Nodular meningeal tumor, meningeal thickening >3 mm and a subjectively strong contrast enhancement. A smooth contrast enhancement of the meninges was judged to be typical for inflammatory, nonneoplastic meningitis.Pauls, S., Fischer, A., Brambs, H., Fetscher, S., H√∂che, W., & Bommer, M. (2012). Use of magnetic resonance imaging to detect neoplastic meningitis: limited use in leukemia and lymphoma but convincing results in solid tumors. European Journal of Radiology, 81(5), 974-978. *CSF cytology: is performed after drawing the CSF by lumbar puncture. *Cytogenetic: measures chromosomal content of cells and fluorescence in situ hybridization which detects numerical and structural genetic aberrations as a sign of malignancy. This is especially useful for liquid tumors such as leukemia and lymphoma. Some of the techniques that achieve this are flow cytometry and DNA single-cell cytometry. However, cytogenetic only assist in diagnosis and is less preferred. *Meningeal Biopsy: may be performed when all of the above criteria is inconclusive. Biopsy is only effective when performed at the region where there's enhancement on the MRI. =Cerebral spinal fluid= Criteria for CSF abnormalities include: *Increased opening pressure (> 200mm of H2O) *Increased Leukocytes (>4/mm3) *Elevated protein (>50 mg/dL) *Decreased glucose (<60 mg/dL) Tumor markers These markers can be good indirect indicator of NM but most are not sensitive enough to improve cytogical diagnosis: *Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) *alpha-fetoprotein *beta- human chorionic gonadotropin *carbohydrate antigen19-9 *creatine-kinase BB *isoenzyme *tissue polypeptide antigen *Beta-2 microglobulin *beta- glucoronidase *lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme-5 *vascular endothelial growth factor Avoiding false-negative *Draw CSF from symptomatic or radiographically demonstrated disease. *Draw large amount of CSF (>10.5mL). *Don't delay processing of specimen. *Obtain at least 2 samples. The first sample has diagnostic sensitivity of 54% but with repeated sampling, diagnostic sensitivity is increased to 91%. =Ideal procedure for diagnosis= Lumbar puntures --> cranial MRI --> spinal MRI --> radioisotope CSF flow --> ventricular or lateral cervical spine CSF analysis (if previous step yields no definitive answer)  Treatment  There is currently no cure for leptomeningeal disease as the tumor is hard to eradicate. Current treatments for leptomeningeal tumors are palliative. The goals for treatment include prolonging survival and stabilizing neurological symptoms. A combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy treatment can be used to help improve the prognosis of the disease. The identification of malignant cells in the cerebrospinal fluid should be confirmed and if there is any doubt about the diagnosis, potential treatments should not be initiated as they can be toxic. =Radiotherapy= Radiotherapy is used mostly for focal type of NM due to the nature of damage and success rate associated with the treatment. Radiotherapy targets the tumor and destroys the collective tissues of cancerous cells. =Chemotherapy= Chemotherapy is injected directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, either by lumbar puncture (‚Äúspinal tap‚Äù) or through a surgically implanted device called an Ommaya reservoir. Intrathecal Therapy is preferred since intravenous chemotherapy do not penetrate the BBB.Gaviani, P., Silvani, A., Corsini, E., Erbetta, A., & Salmaggi, A. (2009). Neoplastic meningitis from breast carcinoma with complete response to liposomal cytarabine: case report. Neurological Sciences, 30(3), 251-254. The most common chemicals used are liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX). The downside of a spinal tap diagnosis is that while it is highly accurate and reliable, it can also report false-negative results. Chemotherapy is delivered intrathecally as it is hard for drugs to make it into the central nervous system. Intrathecal chemotherapy can only penetrate a few millimeters. If the tumor is any thicker, radiation is given to shrink it down. The treatment is done to reduce pressure on the brain caused by any cerebrospinal fluid buildup and to reduce the number of cancer cells causing the pressure. For the best care, patients should see a physician who regularly treats leptomeningeal cancer and is most up-to-date on medicines that penetrate the blood-brain barrier, how to treat the symptoms, and clinical trials that might include patients with leptomeningeal cancer. In combination, intrathecal chemotherapy most often comprises methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa and steroids. Ventriculoperitoneal shunts may also be applied with chemotherapy to avoid invasive surgery to gain access to the CSF. =An example of treatment= Intrathecal MTX injection at a dose of 15 mg/day for 5 days every other week with hydrocortisone acetate injecting IT on day one to prevent arachnoiditis, the inflammation of the arachnoid. MTX administration is continued until neurological progression or relapse occurred. Systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery are performed depending on the need of the patient. =Risks of treatments= Both Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy are harmful to the body and most definitely the brain. Caution must be utilized in treating patients with NM. Another factor that makes treatment difficult is that there is no suitable method to evaluate the disease progression.Goto, Y., Katsumata, N., Nakai, S., Sasajima, Y., Yonemori, K., Kouno, T., & ... Fujiwara, Y. (2008). Leptomeningeal metastasis from ovarian carcinoma successfully treated by the intraventricular administration of methotrexate. International Journal of Clinical Oncology, 13(6), 555-558.  Prognosis  The prognosis is generally poor with survival typically measured in months. The median survival time of patients without treatment is four to six weeks. The best prognosis are seen from NM due to breast cancer with the median overall survival of no more than six months after diagnosis of NM.Gauthier, H., Guilhaume, M., Bidard, F., Pierga, J., Girre, V., Cottu, P., & ... Di√©ras, V. (2010). Survival of breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis. Annals of Oncology, 21(11), 2183-2187. Death is generally due to progressive neurological dysfunction. Treatment is meant to stabilize neurological function and prolong survival. Neurological dysfunction usually cannot be fixed but progressive dysfunction can be halted and survival may be increased to four to six months. It occurs in approximately 3-5% of cancer patients. The disease is usually terminal and if left untreated, the median survival is 4‚Äì6 weeks whereas if treated, the median survival can increase to 2‚Äì3 months. Treatment will be more effective if it is done on the primary tumor before it metastasizes to the brain or spinal cord. Patients with leukaemia achieve better results compared to patients with solid tumours who have undergone treatment. It was found that 75% of patients stabilize or improve over several months as opposed to 25% of patients who do not respond and have progressive disease. But despite initial improvement, most patients survive only a few months. Breast cancer and small cell lung cancer are the two solid tumors that respond best to treatment Some patients do better than others, particularly those whose primary cancer is hematologic, bone marrow and lymph nodes. =Factors that lower survival= Much of prognosis can be determined from the damage due to primary cancer. Negative hormone receptor status, poor performance status, more than 3 chemotherapy regimes, and high Cyfra 21-1 level at diagnosis, all indicates lower survival period of patients with NM. Cyfra 21-1 is a fragment of the cytokeratin 19 and may reflect the tumor burden within the CSF.  Current research  New treatments and clinical trial for breast cancer patients and non-small cell lung cancer patients with leptomeningeal disease are currently being explored. Diagnostics that improve early detection and chemotherapeutics tailored to the primary malignancy will likely be the most significant advances in improving survival. Patients with leptomeningeal metastasis are generally excluded from clinical trials, thereby limiting the systematic assessment of novel therapies in this subgroup of patients with poor prognosis. More patients with leptomeningeal metastasis should be enrolled into trials investigating novel agents with the potential to penetrate the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Novel approaches are being studied as currently available therapies are toxic and provide limited benefits. History Neoplastic Meningitis (NM) was first reported in the 1870s.Herrlinger (2004).

The monastery was built in the 14th century on the left bank of the Mondego River, but had to be abandoned in the 17th century due to frequent floods. The well-preserved Gothic ruins of the monastery were excavated in the late 20th century, more than 300 years after being abandoned by the nuns. Ruined Eastern apse of the church of the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha. The main chapel in the middle of the fa√ßade lost its stone roof The ruined church recently reopened to the public after 12 years of restorations with a new visitor center. History =Middle Ages= The Monastery of Santa Clara of Coimbra was founded in the 1280s by Mor Dias as a house of the Order of the Poor Clares. This early monastery was dissolved in 1311, but in 1314 it was refounded by Queen Elizabeth, wife of King Denis of Portugal. Elizabeth was admired for her pious and charitable nature, and her devotion led to her canonisation in 1626. The palace of the Queen, of which only ruins remain, was located near the monastery. The works sponsored by the Queen started in 1316 on the same spot of the previous foundation and gave rise to the ensemble that exists today. The first architect associated with the monastery was Domingos Domingues, who had worked on the cloisters of the Monastery of Alcoba√ßa. His work was continued after 1326 by Est√™v√£o Domingues, who had worked on the cloisters of Lisbon Cathedral. The church was consecrated in 1330 and shows the influence of the Alcoba√ßa building in its floorplan and many other architectural details. Elizabeth died in 1336 and was buried in the monastery in an impressive Gothic tomb. A large cloister was built to the south side of the church within the same 14th century. Already in 1331 the monastery and church had been flooded by the nearby Mondego River. The site of the foundation proved to be unsuitable, as the monastery was repeatedly invaded by the waters of the river in the following centuries. The nuns of the monastery responded by elevating the floor levels of the monastic buildings to reduce the damage caused by the floods. In spite of the problems, the monastery was frequently enriched by donations. In the early 16th century, under King Manuel I, the church was decorated with Sevillian tiles and several painted altarpieces. View of the ruined cloisters and South fa√ßade of the church with rose window and bell tower. =Decay and rescue= Around 1612, as the river flooded the monastery every year, the nuns built an elevated pavement in the church half way to the roof. Finally, in 1647, as the frequent floods made life in the monastery impossible, King John IV ordered the nuns to abandon the structure. The last nuns left the ensemble in 1677, as a new monastery, called Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova (New St. Clare) was built on a hill nearby. The Gothic tombs of Queen Isabel and other royal princesses were transferred to the new building. As the centuries passed, the old monastery fell into ruin and became partially covered by the marshes of the Mondego River. Its historical and architectural importance led to it being declared a National Monument in 1910, and some conservation works were done in the first half of the 20th century. After 1995, a large archaeological campaign led by the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico cleared the mud and water from the ruins, which were found to be in a remarkable good state of conservation. The excavations allowed for the recovery of a large number of architectural and decorative fragments and a better understanding of the monastery plan. In 2006 the building of an interpretation centre and new tours were estimated at 27 million euro and the project completed in April 2009.Article on the Correio da Manh√£ newspaper. Art and architecture =Ruins= Saint-Clara-a-Velha monastery, Coimbra The floorplan of the church of the Monastery of Santa Clara reveals the influence of the Monastery of Alcoba√ßa. The church nave has a nave and two aisles and is fully covered with stone vaulting, something rare in mendicant monastic foundations in Portugal, which usually used wooden roofs over the nave. Another influence of Alcoba√ßa is seen in the vault types: pointed barrel vault in the nave and groin vault in the side aisles. The structure of the columns of the nave also resembles Alcoba√ßa. The nave is illuminated by tall mullioned windows of Gothic design and three rose windows. Unlike Alcoba√ßa, the church of Santa Clara lacks a prominent transept. The nave used to be divided in two parts, one of public access and the other reserved for the nuns, separated by a dividing wall. An elevated choir, now lost, used to house Queen Isabel's tomb. The apse of the church has three chapels of polygonal shape, the central chapel being the largest. The central chapel has lost its stone roof and used to be illuminated by three windows. A portal on the South fa√ßade of the church connects it with the cloister ruins, which have been preserved up to the level of the double columns of the arches. The capitals are decorated with vegetable motifs. Also visible are the remains of a Gothic fountain with a circular basin. The excavations also revealed the foundations of the chapter house, refectory, a smaller cloister and the old palace of Queen Elizabeth. =Artwork= During the centuries the monastery and church were decorated with religious works of art that are now dispersed. The Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova, to which the nuns were relocated in the 17th century, houses three Gothic tombs which were also relocated from Santa Clara-a-Velha, including that of Queen Isabel. Her tomb, dated from circa 1330, displays her full-size recumbent figure over the lid and is by Aragonese sculptor Mestre Pero. Many works of art of the monastery are now in the Machado de Castro Museum in Coimbra. Painted altarpieces include a triptych of circa 1486 about the life of Clare of Assisi and a painted triptych commissioned to Flemish painter Quentin Metsys in 1517 . Others pieces of sculpture and metalwork in the museum testify to the wealth and prestige of the monastery.

It was rebuilt in Irish Romanesque style (c750) and the Great Nave was erected in the year 1220. The roof timbers have been carbon dated by Queen's University Belfast to the year 1170. There was an early 13th century re- building and this was under the direction and hand of the Masters of four local guilds of operative masons, whose marks are still to be found on the pillars of the gothic arches. The earliest entry in the vestry book of Youghal is a statement of parish accounts for 1201. Pope Nicholas IV, in the taxations of 1291, described Youghal as being the richest benefice in Cloyne. The list of clergy can be traced back to this date. =Formation of the Collegiate Church= On St John's day (27 December) 1464 St. Mary's was made a Collegiate Church, with the foundation of Our Lady's College of Yoghill by Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond (proprietor of Youghal and Lord Deputy of Ireland), for the purpose of training seminarians. It was served by a Warden and Clerks consisting of eight Fellows and eight singing men. =Reformation= Following the English Reformation, the church and its assets came into the control of the Established church. The majority Roman Catholic population was obliged to quit the church and to conduct their services elsewhere on private premises. Due to the Penal Laws, it was not possible to construct another church until 1796 when St. Mary's parish church was built.Youghal Catholic Parish website. That church remains the oldest Catholic church in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne still active as a parish church. The last Catholic warden was Thomas Allen (1533); Roger Skiddy was appointed by King Edward VI of England. He is described as \\"Warden of Youghal\\" in 1567.Catholic Encyclopedia - Youghal. Sixty years later all the endowments were acquired by the Earl of Cork, and in 1639 the rectory was united to the wardenship. A Catholic succession of wardens was maintained as late as 1709, when Father Richard Harnet held the position, which by then was merely titular. In the Anglican succession, the Bishop of Cloyne was and is deemed to be the Warden. In 1597, the college house was plundered and laid in ruins by the insurgent forces of Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, who, among other acts of desecration, unroofed the beautiful High Chancel. Sir Walter Raleigh was Mayor of Youghal in 1588 and lived in the Warden's Residence (now known as Myrtle Grove). Having bought Sir Walter's land for ¬£1,000 in 1596, Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, bought the church on 29 March 1606. Two years later, at the cost of ¬£2,000, he rebuilt the church making good the devastation of the Desmond Rebellion. He endeavoured at the same time to increase the population of the town by infusion of \\"an active and enterprising race of English inhabitants\\". In the civil war or 1641, Richard Boyle added two large towers to the house, built five circular turrets to around the park and cast a platform of earth on which he placed ordnance to command the town and harbour. He erected a marble monument for himself and his family which almost reaches the roof of the chapel. In 1649, during the Commonwealth, Oliver Cromwell conducted his campaign from Youghal and delivered a funeral oration from the top of a chest which is still preserved in the church. In 1782, the house passed to Nicholas Giles who converted it for use as a dwelling. It is this house that is seen today surrounded by just two of the original defence towers, the rest having been removed in 1782. George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne and philosopher, took up residency as Warden of the College in 1734 and conducted services in the church. John Wesley, also visited Youghal in 1765 and attended Divine Service in St. Mary's. Large-scale works of restoration, including the re-edification of the Chancel, were carried out between 1851 and 1854. In 1833, ¬£200 was given to the parish for slating the church roof and the present roof was accordingly put in. A restoration of a remedial nature was carried out between 1970 and 1973. In the late 1980s a Chapel in the North Transept, using the furnishing of the closed church of Templemichael, was created.

It is now a National Monument of Ireland. The Collegiate Church is under the care of the government, by way of a lease between the Church of Ireland Representative Church Body, and the Youghal Urban District Council. =Burials= Burials in the church's graveyard include Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, who died 1643.

Orr Music There has been a long history of music in the church. From 2005, music was provided by \\"The Clerks Choral\\", which sang traditional Anglican repertoire throughout the Irish academic year. The then Organist and Master of the Clerks Choral, was Ian Sexton. The Clerks continue, but sing more often now in Cloyne Cathedral and other venues. The Collegiate Church is still used for recitals, concerts and festivals, including for some concerts in the East Cork Early Music Festival. Due to a decision in the 1970s to remove the lime plaster from the rubble walls, the acoustics of the building are less than ideal for choral music. It is, however, a good venue for instrumental music as well as folk, etc. =Organ= In 1812 an organ was purchased and a gallery erected for it at the western end of the nave.Clerical and Parochial Records of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, Taken from Diocesan and Parish Registries, Mss. in the Principal Libraries and Public Offices of Oxford, Dublin, and London, and from Private Or Family Papers edited by William Maziere Brady.

From its earliest days, VME/B was developed with the aid of CADES, which was built for the purpose using an underlying IDMS database (latterly upgraded to IDMS(X)). CADES was not merely a version control system for code modules: it was intended to manage all aspects of the software lifecycle from requirements capture through to field maintenance. It was the design of CADES that paved the way for the Alvey Project in IPSE (Integrated Project Support Environments) and Process Control Engines. Because CADES was used for more than 20 years throughout the development of a large software engineering project, the data collected has been used as input to a number of studies of software evolution. Early history CADES was conceived in 1970 by David Pearson and Brian Warboys when working for ICL's New Range Operating System Technology Centre, OSTECH, in Kidsgrove.B.C.Warboys \\"The IPSE 2.5 Project: Process Modelling as a basis for a support environment\\" International Conference on System Development Environments and Factories, May 1989, BerlinMartin Campbell-Kelly \\"ICL: A business and technical history\\" Clarendon Press, Oxford 1989 Pearson, a theoretical physicist by training, had become a computer simulation specialist and joined ICL in 1968 after working in finite- element modelling at Cambridge and simulation research at Imperial College. Warboys had been chief architect for the ICL System 4 multi-access operating system, Multijob. ICL's commitment to large scale software development for the 2900 Series of computers provided the basis for the Pearson and Warboys early work on a new software development environment which would address the issues of designer/programmer productivity, design integrity, evaluation and testing, version control and systems regression.D.J.Pearson \\"CADES - Computer-aided development and evaluation system\\" Computer Weekly, 1973D.J.Pearson and B.C.Warboys \\"Structural Modelling - A Philosophy\\" OSTC/IN/40 July 1970 In designing the initial architecture of the CADES environment, Pearson in particular looked to parallels with the leading hardware computer-aided design systems of the time, even attempting the use of graphics in the design process. The CADES design approach, called Structural Modelling, was rigidly data-driven and hierarchical, and expressed in a formal design language, SDL. Design specifications written in SDL were processed by the Design Analyser, before being input to the CADES Product Database, a design and implementation database supporting its own query language and forming the kernel of the Product Information System.G.D.Pratten and R.A.Snowden \\"CADES, support for the development of complex software\\" EUROCOMP,1976M.A.Firth and Others \\"Improving a software development environment using object-oriented technology\\" TOOLS (8), 1992B.W.Chatters, M.M.Lehman and Others \\"Modelling a software evolution process\\" Software Process: Improvement and Practice, September 2000 The intention was that these designs could be evaluated/simulated using the Animator, and S3 implementation code automatically generated from them using the Environment Processor. Build generation and version control was also based on the Product Database, resulting in a highly disciplined approach to new system builds. System Regression was therefore controlled from a very early stage in the software life-cycle.D.J.Pearson \\"The use and abuse of a software engineering system\\" National Computer Conference, New York 1979Don Leavitt \\"Development method review held useful\\" Computerworld June 1979 Fundamentals In order to control the development of VME/B, each development was sub-divided for easier management. The structure was hierarchic, with each significant components of VME (kernel, file store, etc.)divided into sub-systems. Development activity on each sub-system created a sequence of versions. These divisions and sub-divisions of VME/B were reflected in the hierarchical structure of the CADES database. This enabled the reuse of code within VME/B (one of the goals of software engineering). This, coupled with a suite of tools, and the use of SDL (Software Design Language) as the development language, version history and the concept of source code (that is code that has passed QA and subsequently resides within CADES filestore) improved development time whilst providing satisfactory audit trails and QA processes. CADES adopted the term \\"holon\\" to refer to modules of code (such as procedures and macros). The word came from the Greek holo meaning whole, and was lifted from Arthur Koestler's book 'Ghost in the Machine'. Pearson always claimed that he formulated the architecture of CADES while studying Koestler's book on a beach in Tunisia. Arranged in a hierarchy, holons provide a 'family tree' (for each sub-system), utilising parent/child relationships. Holons also maintained attributes of interaction, enabling one Holon to interact with other Holons, thus enabling more modular development and facilitating reuse. In a similar fashion CADES also retained information with regard to constant values (aka literals), user-defined types and user- defined structures. Development using CADES Development under CADES was achieved using a suite of tools known as MODPRO (Module Processing) which acted as an interface (or broker) between developer and CADES. These tools enabled the developer to focus more on development that administrative, QA or SCM tasks. It was not necessary to know to manipulate data within CADES, the application generated the required DNL (Data Navigation Language) to achieve the required results. Development using MODPRO did not require specific knowledge of either S3 nor SCL (target language for subsequent compilation), but SDL, the Software Design Language: an abstraction above the former two. Which when coupled with the enhance-editor EDSDL (Edit SDL) interacted with CADES to manage development, or re-work. Then, again with information from CADES, when used with MODPRO tool EPETC (aka Environmental Processor or EP etc.) enabled the resultant file to be correctly targeted for S3 or SCL compilation. Subsequent tools within the suite facilitated various steps within development, such as: * Detailed Holon information using CHED (CADES Holon Environment Details), * Interaction with CADES using DIL (Database Interface Language, used to produce DNL), * Report production, using CRP (CADES Report Producer), * Transfer valid files/code in to or extract out of the secure repository, namely CADES, using XFER. The following illustrates the typical MODPRO development route.

Life and career Bland, the youngest of 19 children, first sang professionally in 1947 in New York City, and sang with a group called The Bees in the 1950s on New Orleans's Imperial Records. In 1954, \\"Toy Bell\\" by the group caused some unrest by veering into the dirty blues genre. Dave Bartholomew brought them to New Orleans, where they recorded a song he had written and recorded twice before: firstly in 1952 for King Records as \\"My Ding-a-Ling,\\" and later that year for Imperial as \\"Little Girl Sing Ting-A-Ling.\\" Bland later pursued a solo career. In 1960, Bland heard Titus Turner recording the song \\"Let the Little Girl Dance\\" in the studio, and demonstrated for Turner how to sing it (along with guitarist Mickey Baker and other session musicians). The event was recorded by record producer Henry Glover, and was eventually released as a single. The tune was a hit in the US, peaking at number 11 on the US Billboard R&B; chart. and number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Bland had two other minor hits that year, \\"Harmony\\" (U.S. Hot 100 number 91) and \\"You Were Born to Be Loved\\" (U.S. Hot 100 number 94). He recorded until 1963 for Old Town, and then quit the music industry. In the 1980s, he ran a soul food restaurant in Harlem. Bland died on March 22, 2017, at age 84. His death was reported in a Facebook post by his grandson Jermain.

He attended the seminary at Zacatecas on a scholarship, in 1881. He was ordained as priest in 1893 at the age of 27. As a young priest, he gave first communion to Miguel Pro who also became a priest and was later martyred. Fr.

Correa was arrested by soldiers as he was bringing Viaticum to a woman invalid. Accused of being part of the armed Cristero defense, he was jailed in Zacatecas, and then in Durango. On February 5, 1927, Fr. Correa was asked by General Eulogio Ortiz, to hear the confessions of some imprisoned members of the Cristeros, an uprising of Catholic men who decided to fight back against the persecution of the Church led by Mexico's president Plutarco Elias Calles. Father Correa agreed to administer the Sacrament of Confession to these prisoners, but afterward General Ortiz demanded to know what the condemned prisoners had confessed. Fr. Correa refused. General Ortiz then pointed a gun at Fr. Correa's head and threatened him with immediate death. Fr. Correa continued to refuse, and at dawn on February 6, 1927, he was taken to the cemetery on the outskirts of Durango and shot through the head.

Some time later he was moved to the Tribune‚Äôs rewrite desk, and in 1961 Noonan became a beat reporter with the City News Bureau of Chicago. Noonan spent seven years at City News, where he was overnight city editor and broadcast editor. During his 14-year tenure at the Desplaines Valley News, Noonan exposed a new generation of reporters to the ‚ÄúCity News‚Äù style of journalism, training wide-eyed upstarts to think like beat reporters ‚Äì be tenacious, make friends, get lots of information and make sure it‚Äôs good.

One was in conjunction with the programme Streetwise (which was a show all about cycle couriers and starred the then-unknown Andy Serkis). Viewers had to design and draw a customised bike of their own, featuring reflective lights and other things, so it could be ridden safely in the dark. The main prizes for the winners were two Muddy Fox mountain bikes, with some special CITV reflective safety jackets and cycle lights as runner-up prizes. The competition had over 32,000 entries in total. Another competition was a tie-in with the adventure game-show Knightmare. Eagle-eyed viewers had to look out for random letters appearing on-screen during Episode 7 of Series 3, which would eventually spell out a word connected with fantasy. The actual word was 'Excalibur' and the prizes for the winner were a ZX Spectrum computer system and a copy of the first Knightmare computer game. Hordriss, a character from the show, appeared on CITV to set the competition and Foulkes announced the winner on 8 December 1989, just before Episode 14 of Series 3 of the show. =Special guests= Many special guests appeared in the studio during Foulkes' time on CITV. Various pop stars such as Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Sonia, Big Fun, Lisa Stansfield, The Primitives and many more all appeared in 1989. Donovan's appearance on CITV was quite memorable, as due to him being stuck in traffic, he arrived at the CITV studios in Birmingham just before the start of the final programme of the day, which was a repeat of Scooby-Doo. However, the show was started a bit earlier than originally planned and the final CITV link of the day was quite longer than usual, which gave Foulkes and Scally a bit more of air-time to chat to Donovan. Other stars who appeared in 1989 were the late TV presenter and practical joker Jeremy Beadle and the Australian cartoonist Rolf Harris, who drew portraits of both Jerry and Scally throughout the links on the day he appeared. =Departure= Foulkes left CITV on 22 December 1989, and on 2 January 1990, fellow CITV presenter Jeanne Downs (who had presented CITV's summer mornings service in 1989) took over co-presenting the afternoons with Scally, until 29 March 1991, when Stonewall lost the contract to produce CITV back to Central Television (who had also done it previously from 1983 to 1989). On the first day that Downs took over from Foulkes (on 2 January 1990), they had a mop and a bucket in the studio, with a name tag of Foulkes on it, and during the links both she and Scally made some amusing comments about it. Also, due to frequent CITV opt-outs by TSW, in order to fit in their local birthdays programme, Gus Honeybun, ITV viewers in the South West missed out on many of Foulkes' links during 1989, most notably his final day on 22 December 1989, as they opted out of several links, including the final one, which meant that TSW viewers never got to hear him say \\"Goodbye\\" for the last time. Foulkes was one of several former CITV presenters who didn't appear on CITV's 20th Birthday Bash on 3 January 2003, although he was briefly mentioned and several clips of him were shown during the show. Other TV and radio work After he graduated from Leicester University in 1983, Foulkes started his media career in radio, working on both BBC Radio Leicester and BBC Radio Norfolk in the 1980s. During his time at BBC Radio Norfolk, amongst other things, he presented an evening show called Nightdrive. After four years there, he left in 1987 to become a video jockey on the newly launched music channel MTV Europe. He left MTV in 1989 to join Children's ITV. After he left Children's ITV, he then moved into the world of television production, starting a very long and successful career as a producer and editor. He joined the BBC and worked on many different TV and radio projects, which included programmes for Children's BBC, BBC World Service and BBC Radio 1. Whilst at Radio 1, he was the producer of the Dave Lee Travis show. In 1993, he became the producer of the BBC1 daytime show, Good Morning with Anne and Nick for three years. Also, in 1992‚Äì3, he returned to presenting on BBC Radio 5, when he co-presented the pop music magazine show On The Level, with the actress and singer Tracy Elster. Also in 1992, he very briefly appeared in an episode of the BBC TV series That's Life!, in a short featurette about their talent contest winner, Allison Jordan. This also featured a young and then-unknown Simon Cowell and Andi Peters (the then current Children's BBC presenter) in it too. Later in 1996, Foulkes moved to Channel 4 and was the editor of their long-running TV review show Right To Reply for three years. In 1997, he was also the editor of another Channel 4 TV review show, the short-lived Nightwatch, which was presented by Pat Kane. In 1999, he then returned to the BBC and became a commissioning executive in factual programming for four years. In 2003, he joined talkbackTHAMES and was the editor of their factual programmes, one of which was the popular Channel 4 show, How Clean Is Your House?, which began in 2003. He left there after 2 years in 2005. Recent work Foulkes continues to work in television as a producer/editor, some of his more recent work including Fear Of Flying (Channel 4, 2006), Britain's Dream Homes (BBC TV, 2008), Jimmy's Food Factory (BBC TV, 2009) (which starred the farmer, Jimmy Doherty) and Cowboy Trap (BBC TV, 2010). In January 2010, he became the head of Mentorn Scotland, which is part of the Tinopolis group, but left them a year later in January 2011. In September 2012, he co-founded (with Andrea Miller) a new company called Sunnyside Productions.

Early life Derek Goldby was born in Adelaide, South Australia where his father had moved form Cambridge, England, with his family in 1937, to take up the post of Professor of Anatomy in the University of Adelaide Medical School. Derek was born in 1940. In 1945 the family returned to the UK where his father became Professor of Anatomy at St Mary's Hospital Medical School and settled in South London. Derek attended Dulwich College Preparatory School and then Dulwich College where he first developed an interest in the theatre and directed several successful school productions. He then read modern languages at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, England. While at Caius, he directed a production of Arnold Wesker's The Kitchen which led to his first professional job as Assistant Director at the Royal Court Theatre in London. Work in Britain He left the Royal Court Theatre after one year to direct a repertory season at Barrow-in-Furness, which was followed by a season at Harrowgate Theatre. The following two years he directed free-lance productions at Dundee, Bristol and Sheffield Repertory Companies, as well as at Stratford-on-Avon. In 1963, Goldby directed Chips with Everything, then produced Twelfth Night and Tons of Money at Her Majesty's, Barrow.\\"Higher Education Helps,\\" The Stage (28 February 1963). Altogether, he directed 150 productions in these regional towns, including the English language premiere of Berthold Brecht's A day in the life of the great scholar Wu.Much of this early information comes from Goldby's thumbnail biographical sketches appearing in the programs for the Broadway production of Her First Roman and Loot. In 1966, Goldby became an assistant director to John Dexter at the National Theatre of Great Britain (now the Royal National Theatre) and worked on The Storm and Much Ado About Nothing. At age 25, he became the youngest director that the National Theatre had had up to that time when he directed Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead by the then mostly unknown Tom Stoppard. At that point, the play had been performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, but it was Goldby's 1967 National Theatre production at the Old Vic that brought the play to international attention. Work in the United States Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead went on to play on Broadway, where it was nominated for eight Tony Awards and received four, including Best Play. Goldby went on to direct several other productions on Broadway, including Loot by Joe Orton, and Her First Roman, a musical based on George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra (for which Goldby was brought in late in rehearsals as a replacement director).IBDB; conversation with Derek Goldby.Sam Zolotow, \\"Vale Atque Ave\\", New York Times, 15 August 1968, p. 45.

After a long absence, Goldby returned to New York in 1991 to direct Brad Fraser's Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love at the Orpheum Theatre. International work Goldby spent most of the 1980s in Canada, where he directed for the Shaw Festival, the Stratford Festival, the Tarragon Theatre, CanStage, Th√©√¢tre de Quat'Sous and the National Theatre School. Among his work were several productions at the Shaw Festival, including Georges Feydeau's A Flea in Her Ear and a production of Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, featuring comic actor Heath Lamberts in the title role, which played at The Shaw in 1982 and 1983, and which was revived for a run at the Royal Alexandra theatre in 1985. Other work includes productions of Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and August Strindberg's the Father at the Tarragon Theatre; and productions of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest and Frank Wedekind's Spring Awakening at CanStage.Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia; personal observation In Belgium, Goldby worked at Brussels' Th√©√¢tre de Poche, where he directed, amongst other work, productions of Martin McDonagh's The Lieutenant of Inishmore and Simon Stephens' Motortown. Since 2000 In the 2000s (decade), Goldby worked in drama schools in England including RADA, Rose Bruford College and Central School of Speech and Drama, and directed a number of other plays including Autumn and Winter, by Lars Noren, at the Orange Tree Theatre.

It's still interesting because of what each new cast of actors brings to it. The text has in many ways the polished surface of metal. The values are verbal, like the plays of Wilde and Shaw, really.

In the book Collier argues that there are many countries whose residents have experienced little, if any, income growth over the 1980s and 1990s. On his reckoning, there are just under 60 such economies, home to almost 1 billion people. Synopsis =Development traps= The book suggests that, whereas the majority of the 5-billion people in the \\"developing world\\" are getting richer at an unprecedented rate, a group of countries (mostly in Africa and Central Asia but with a smattering elsewhere) are stuck and that development assistance should be focused heavily on them. These countries typically suffer from one or more development traps. The Conflict Trap: Civil wars (with an estimated average cost of $64bn each) and coups incur large economic costs to a country. Additionally, in the time period immediately following a major conflict, relapse is highly likely. Collier also argues that the longer a country stays in a state of conflict, the more players become established that profit from the state of tumult, making the situation increasingly intractable. The Natural Resource Trap: Countries that are rich in natural resources are paradoxically usually worse off than countries that are not. Collier attributes this to a variety of causes: * Resources make conflict for the resources nearly inevitable due to the lack of transparency provided by government officials who often use surpluses of natural resources for their own benefit * Natural resources mean that a government does not have to tax its citizens. Consequently, the citizenry are less likely to demand financial accountability from the government. * The exploitation of valuable natural resources can result in Dutch disease, where a country's other industries become less competitive as a result of currency valuation due to the revenue raised from the resource. Landlocked with Bad Neighbours: Poor landlocked countries with poor neighbours find it almost impossible to tap into world economic growth. Collier explains that countries with coastline trade with the world, while landlocked countries only trade with their neighbors. Landlocked countries with poor infrastructure connections to their neighbors therefore necessarily have a limited market for their goods. Bad Governance in a Small Country: Terrible governance and policies can destroy an economy with alarming speed. The reason small countries are at a disadvantage is that though they may have a low cost-of- living, and therefore be ideal for labor-intensive work, their smallness discourages potential investors, who are unfamiliar with the local conditions and risks, who instead opt for better known countries like China and India. =Solutions= He suggests a number of relatively inexpensive but institutionally difficult changes: # Aid agencies should increasingly be concentrated in the most difficult environments, accept more risk. Ordinary citizens should not support poorly informed vociferous lobbies whose efforts are counterproductive and severely constrain what the Aid agencies can do. # Appropriate Military Interventions (such as the British in Sierra Leone) should be encouraged, especially to guarantee democratic governments against coups. # International Charters are needed to encourage good governance and provide prototypes. # Trade Policy needs to encourage free trade and give preferential access to Bottom Billion exports. = Bottom billion countries = The book does not include a list of bottom billion countries because Collier believes this might lead to a \\"self-fulfilling prophecy.\\" However, he states that there are 58 such countries mentioned throughout the book. In his book Wars, Guns, and Votes, Collier lists the Bottom Billion, to \\"focus international effort\\": Afghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Kazakhstan, Kenya, North Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Reception Martin Wolf in the Financial Times called it \\"a splendid book\\" and \\"particularly enjoyed the attack on the misguided economics of many non-governmental organisations.\\" He says that Collier sheds much light on how the world should tackle its biggest moral challenge. It shows, too, how far western governments and other external actors are from currently giving the sort of help these countries desperately need.Martin Wolf, Financial Times \\"How the bottom billion are trapped\\" The Guardian called it an important book and suggested that citizens of G8 countries should fight for change along the lines he suggests.The Guardian Action will speak louder than words The Economist said it was \\"set to become a classic\\" and \\"should be compulsory reading for anyone embroiled in the hitherto thankless business of trying to pull people out of the pit of poverty where the \\"bottom billion\\" of the world's population of 6.6 billion seem irredeemably stuck\\".The Economist Springing the traps Nicolas Kristof in the New York Times described it as \\"'The best book on international affairs so far this year\\".New York Times 14 June 2007 William Easterly, an influential American economist specialising in economic growth and foreign aid, critically assessed The Bottom Billion in The Lancet. He lambasts it for being an \\"ivory tower analysis of real world poverty.\\" Easterly notes that much of Collier's advice is constructive, but he is concerned that it is advice based on shaky argument, argument which relies on statistical correlation to establish causation. For example, Collier makes much of the \\"conflict trap\\" and clearly poverty and civil war do occur together, but this may be, according to Easterly, \\"[perhaps] only because they are both symptoms of deeper problems, like Africa's weak states, ethnic antagonisms, and the legacy of the slave trade and colonial exploitation.\\"William Easterly The Lancet Volume 370, Issue 9597, pp. 1475‚Äì76, 27 October 2007 Collier counters, \\"At present the clarion call for the right is economist William Easterley's book The White Man's Burden. Easterly is right to mock the delusions of the aid lobby. But just as [Jeffrey] Sachs exaggerates the payoff to aid, Easterly exaggerates the downside and again neglects the scope for other policies.

She appeared with her husband and his performing partner Bert Williams, and in groups such as Black Patti's Troubadours. She was also a solo dancer and choreographer for vaudeville shows such as Bob Cole, Joe Jordan, and J. Rosamond Johnson's The Red Moon (1908) and S. H. Dudley's His Honor the Barber (1911). Aida Overton Walker is also well known for her 1912 performance of the \\"Salome\\" dance at Hammerstein's Victoria Theatre. This was Aida's response to the national \\"Salomania\\" craze of 1907 that spread through the white vaudeville circuit.Office of the Dean, \\"Bad girls of the 20th century: UCI professor's new book highlights four performance icons who embodied and defied stereotypes\\", review of Jeanne Scheper, Moving Performances: Divas, Iconicity, and Remembering the Modern Stage (Rutgers University Press, 2016), UCI School of Humanities. Biography Aida Overton was born in Richmond, Virginia on February 14, 1880. Her family moved to New York City when she was young. There, she gained an education and considerable musical training. At 15, she joined John Isham's \\"Octoroons,\\" a Black touring group. In the following years she became a chorus member in ‚ÄúBlack Patti's Troubadours,‚Äù where she met her future husband George Walker, a vaudeville comedian. Her early career was defined by her collaborations with him and his partner Bert Williams, who together soon became the major black vaudeville and musical comedy powerhouses of the era. She and George Walker married within a year of meeting. Overton Walker first gained national attention in 1900, with her performance of \\"Miss Hannah from Savannah\\" in the show Sons of Ham. For the next ten years, she was known primarily for her work in musical theater. Her song and dance made her an instant hit with audiences at the time. She, Walker, and Williams worked together on such musicals as In Dahomey (1903), In Abyssinia (1906), and Bandanna Land (1908). In 1904, after two seasons in England touring with In Dahomey, the group returned to New York. She created a version of the Salome dance, a popular dance routine of the time. Working alongside her husband, Walker's career and performances were praised by critics. Her successes were well known. She was both financially successful and respected by the industry. In late 1908, Walker's husband fell ill and the partners closed In Dahomey in 1909. She left the stage for a time to care for her husband. In 1910, Overton Walker joined the Smart Set Company. During this time she also began touring the vaudeville circuit as a solo act. In 1911, she performed in His Honor the Barber with Smart Set Company. Overton Walker performed as a male character in Lovie Dear, as well as in Bandanna Land, in which she took over her husband's role. Her husband died in 1911. In 1912, Overton Walker went on tour with her show for 16 weeks, then returned to New York, where she performed as Salome at the Paradise Roof Garden on Broadway.Krasner, David. A Beautiful Pageant: African American Theater Drama and Performance in the Harlem Renaissance 1910‚Äì1927. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, pp. 68‚Äì69. Her success at Hamerstein's theatre led to an invitation to return the following year in Bon Bon Buddy, a musical developed from a song which her husband had popularized in Bandanna Land years before. An ode to her late husband, Overton Walker's performance was so successful she was asked to perform two extra weeks. Walker died suddenly from kidney failure in 1914.Brian Galindo, \\"The vaudeville actress who refused to be a stereotype\\", Buzz Feed She had continued performing until only two months before her death.

These conflicts were intimately linked with the wars between Timur (Tamerlane) and Tokhtamysh, the last khan of the Golden Horde and Timur's major rival for control over the Islamic world. Timur officially proclaimed his invasions to be jihad against the region's non-Muslims. Although he was able to invade parts of Georgia, he was never able to make the country Muslim and even recognized Georgia as a Christian state. In the first of eight invasions, Timur sacked Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, and captured the king Bagrat V in 1386. Georgian resistance prompted a renewed attack by the Turco-Mongol armies. Bagrat's son and successor, George VII, put up a stiff resistance and had to spend much of his reign (1395‚Äì1405) fighting the Timurid invasions. Timur personally led most of these raids to subdue the recalcitrant Georgian monarch. Although he was not able to establish a firm control over Georgia, the country suffered a blow from which it never recovered. By the time George VII was forced to accept Timur's terms of peace and agree to pay tribute, he was a master of little more than gutted towns, ravaged countryside and a shattered monarchy.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation, p. 45. Indiana University Press,  History  Timur orders the campaign against Georgia Timur's first appearance in the Caucasus was a response to Khan Tokhtamysh's marauding inroad into Northern Iran through the Caucasian lands in 1385. This marked an outbreak of outright hostility between the two Islamic monarchs. Timur responded by launching a full-scale invasion of the small frontier countries, which lay between the western border of his emerging empire and Tokhtamysh's khanate. After having overrun Azerbaijan and Kars, Timur marched into Georgia. The official history of his reign, Zafarnama, represents this campaign in Georgia as a jihad. Timur set out from Kars and assailed Samtskhe, the southernmost principality within the Kingdom of Georgia later in 1386. From there, he marched against Tbilisi which the Georgian king Bagrat V had fortified. The city fell on November 21, 1386, and King Bagrat V was captured and converted to Islam at sword point. The Georgian Chronicle and Thomas of Metsoph mention the apostasy of the king but represent it as a clever ruse which enabled him to earn a degree of Timur's trust. Bagrat was given some 12,000 troops to reestablish himself in Georgia, whose government was run by Bagrat's son and co-ruler George VII during his father's absence at Timur's court. The old king, however, entered into secret negotiations with George, who ambushed Bagrat's Islamic escort, and freed his father.Minorsky, Vladimir, \\"Tiflis\\", in: M. Th. Houtsma, E. van Donzel (1993), E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913‚Äì1936, p. 757. Brill, . In the spring of 1387, Timur returned to Georgia to take revenge for the ambush and escape. Bagrat and George managed to evacuate the civilian population of the frontier regions to the mountains and forests, and began organising their defences. Khan Tokhtamysh's reappearance in Iran forced Timur to temporarily withdraw. However once the Golden Horde was defeated, Timur returned to attack Georgia again. In 1394, he dispatched four generals to the province of Samtskhe, with orders to apply the Islamic law of ghaza (i.e. the systematic raiding of non-Muslim lands). The same year, Timur in person punished the mountainous Georgian communities in the Aragvi Valley whom the Zafarnama calls Kara-Kalkanlik (\\"with black bucklers‚Äù, i.e., the eastern Georgian mountaineers, the Pshavs and Khevsurs), and returned via Tbilisi to Shekki upon hearing of yet another offensive by Tokhtamysh. In 1395 the desperate Georgians allied themselves with Sidi Ali of Shekki and inflicted a crushing defeat on the invading armies of Miran Shah, a son of Timur, who was besieging Alindjak (near Nakhichevan), and captured the Jalayirid prince Tahir, who was shut up in it. This event prompted Timur to return, later in 1399, to inflict massive revenge on the general population of the region. He took Shekki and devastated the neighboring region of Kakheti. The Mongol dominions, 1300‚Äì1405; the Timurid Empire is shaded. The Caucasus, c. 1378‚Äì1502. In the spring of 1400, Timur moved back to destroy the Georgian state once and for all. He demanded that George VII should hand over the Jalayirid Tahir. George VII refused and met Timur at the Sagim River in Lower Kartli, but suffered a defeat and retreated deeper into the country, relentlessly chased by Timur. Timur destroyed the Georgian capital Tbilisi, left a garrison there, and laid siege to Gori, where George was entrenched. The king made a bold sortie westward, but having failed to thwart the enemy's advance at the fortresses of Dzami and Savaneti, fled to the inaccessible forests of western Georgia, where the armies of the Islamic ruler could not penetrate. Timur turned back in fury and thoroughly pillaged the rest of Georgia. This bloody campaign lasted for several months, with Timur's armies systematically moving from province to province. Virtually all major cities and towns were destroyed and their populations decimated; the countryside (with its villages and food sources) was burnt; monasteries and churches were systematically razed to the ground. Of those who survived the fighting and reprisals, many thousands died of hunger and disease, and 60,000 survivors were enslaved and carried away by Timur's troops. In late 1401, Timur invaded the Caucasus once again. George VII had to sue for peace, and sent his brother with tribute. Timur was preparing for a major confrontation with the Ottoman dynasty and apparently wished to freeze the currently prevailing situation in Georgia, until he could return to deal with it more decisively and thoroughly at his leisure. Thus, he made peace with George on condition that the king of Georgia supplied him with troops and granted Muslims special privileges.Sicker, Martin (2000), The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna, p. 155. Praeger, . Timur nonetheless undertook some preventive measures and attacked the Georgian garrison of Tortumi, demolishing the citadel and looting the surrounding area. Once the Ottomans were defeated, Timur, back in Erzurum in 1402, decided to punish the king of Georgia for not having come to present his congratulations on his victory. George VII's brother, Constantine, who was then on bad terms with his brother, arrived with gifts, as did the king's defiant vassal Iwane Jaqeli, prince of Samtskhe. Sheikh Ibrahim I of Shirvan went to estimate the revenues and expenses of Georgia. George sent new presents but Timur refused them and summoned George to appear in person. In the meantime, he himself laid siege to the previously impregnable fortress of Birtvisi, stubbornly defended by a tiny Georgian garrison. Having captured the fortress in August 1403, Timur sent his army to plunder and clear the frontier regions of Georgia and set out in pursuit of the retreating king George VII as far as Abkhazia. Timur's historian reports that 700 towns were destroyed and their inhabitants massacred.Grousset, Ren√© (1970), The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia, pp. 433‚Äì4. Rutgers University Press, . Timur only stopped his army when the ulema and the mufti decided it was possible to grant the king of Georgia clemency (aman). George VII had to pay a huge tribute, including 1,000 tankas of gold struck in the name of Timur, 1,000 horses, a ruby weighing 18 mithkals, etc. Timur then passed through Tbilisi, destroying all monasteries and churches on his way, and went to Beylagan early in 1404. All the territories from Beylagan to Trebizond were officially given by Timur as an appanage to his grandson Khalil Mirza. Timur then finally left the Caucasus and headed for Central Asia, where he died on February 19, 1405.

Stultitia (folly) was shown as the opposite of Prudentia (prudence). Foolishness is the unawareness or lack of social norms which causes offence, annoyance, trouble and/or injury. The things such as impulsivity and/or influences may affect a person's ability to make otherwise reasonable decisions. In this sense, it differs from stupidity, which is the lack of intelligence. An act of foolishness is called folly.  Concept  Andreas Maercker in 1995 defined foolishness as rigid, dogmatic, and inflexible thinking which makes feelings of bitterness and probable annoyance. It is considered the foundation of illusions of grandiosity like omniscience, omnipotence and inviolability. The Book of Proverbs characterizes traits of foolishness.Eldon Woodcock, [Proverbs: A Topical Study https://books.google.com/books?id=tbVKAwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA20] Foolishness and wisdom are contrasted in Paul's letter to the Corinthians. He condemns intellectual arrogance and advocates a humble attitude instead of foolishness, in which it is then possible to learn. Plato transvalued reason over foolishness, to him integrity of acceptance of a state itself was the beginning of wisdom, he said \\"He is the wisest man who knows himself to be ill-equipped for the study of wisdom\\".

Completed in 1964, the building was the first private investment for the urban renewal of the Independence Mall area. Only two blocks from Independence Hall the building, designed by Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co., was lauded for its respect to the nearby park and historical buildings. Philadelphia's city planners praised the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters as a standard for all redevelopment buildings. The nine-story building's most notable feature is its translucent, corrugated sunscreens. Supported by aluminum lattices throughout the building's facade, the sunscreens are made of Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas. In 2007 the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and today is considered one of the best examples of the International style. History The Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters was conceived as part of the city of Philadelphia's plan to improve and revive the area around Independence Hall. Along with the creation of a park north of Independence Hall, the area saw the construction of new and modern buildings including a federal courthouse, a new Philadelphia Mint and the Rohm and Haas Building. For the revival of the Independence Mall area, city planner Edmund Bacon approached Otto Haas to move Rohm and Haas, a Philadelphia-based chemical manufacturing company, to Independence Mall. According to legend, Haas reportedly said, \\"This city may or may not survive. But if companies like Rohm and Haas desert it, then surely the city will not survive!\\" Federal funds for private investors investing in urban renewal land was also a significant factor in Rohm and Haas's decision to stay in Philadelphia. In 1959 Rohm and Haas, the first private investor to build on the Independence Mall, first commissioned Philadelphia-based George M. Ewing Co. to design their new headquarters. Ewing's design was met with a poor response from the City Art Commission, and Rohm and Haas decided on using a leading architect and approached Pietro Belluschi. At the time the dean of architecture and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Belluschi worked with George M. Ewing Co. to redesign Ewing's original plan. The new design was completed in a few months and was approved by Rohm and Haas, the City Planning Commission, the Redevelopment Authority, and the City Art Commission. Construction began in 1963 and was completed in 1964, costing close to US$10 million. Rohm and Haas moved from their old Washington Square headquarters into the new building in 1965. By the 2000s, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters needed upgrades to its building systems and facilities. The company spent two years deciding whether to renovate its current building or to move to cheaper, more modern space in Center City. In 2006 Rohm and Haas decided to stay in the current building and spend up to US$25 million on renovations. The building's architecture and layout were the main reason for the company to stay. The building allows single departments to stay together on the same floor, while in a Center City skyscraper departments would likely have to be spread out over several floors. RMJM Hillier was hired to handle the building's renovations. The original plan was well received but exceeded the renovation's budget. To help pay for the renovations, RMJM Hillier tried to get the building declared a National Historic Landmark, which would allow the company to get tax credits. Usually buildings less than fifty years old are not considered, but the building's significance in Modern architecture kept the state of Pennsylvania and the National Park Service interested. While not designated a National Historic Landmark, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 9, 2007. To help get the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters listed as a landmark, RMJM Hillier and Rohm and Haas focused renovations on opening up floor space and modernizing systems. A part of the original plan that altered the building's facade was abandoned, but the facade received a thorough cleaning. Inside, most of the enclosed office space was removed and replaced with open workstations. The new layout was also designed to let more light into the interior of the building. The work spaces also received new furniture, which replaced some that dated back to the 1960s. The dining area was moved from the basement to street level in a space that was previously occupied by a bank, but had lain vacant for several years. Security, telecommunications, and central plant systems were also upgraded and modernized. The interior renovations finished around May 2008, with improvements to the surrounding plaza completed several months later. Headquarters at dusk Building Starting from George M. Ewing's original design of an office tower, Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co. turned the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters into a , nine-story low horizontal block. At the corner of 6th Street and Market Street, two blocks away from Independence Hall, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters front facade runs parallel along 6th Street looking towards the Independence Mall. The reinforced concrete framed building sits on flaring concrete columns and is set back from the street by a raised plaza. The landscaped plaza cuts through the middle of the ground level of the building, opening up to a larger plaza with a fountain and small pool. The plaza behind the building allows public access to an alley that leads to Seventh Street. To help keep the building cool, Belluschi added bronze-colored translucent corrugated panel sunscreens to the facade. Supported by a bronze anodized aluminum lattice, the sunscreens are made of Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas. The use of sunscreens and dark colors gave the facade a textured pattern and overall effect of avoiding making the building appear oversized. Besides the sunscreens, Plexiglas was used in the board room, in a few of the artistic commissions and light fixtures by designer Gy√∂rgy Kepes. The building was very well received by Philadelphia's city planners, who felt it set a standard for redevelopment buildings. The building was designed to contrast, but not overwhelm the nearby 18th-century Georgian architecture. The Washington Post architecture critic Wolf Von Eckardt praised the building for its sensitivity to the nearby historic buildings, and how it related to the texture and small size of Independence Hall and at the same time the large open space of Independence Mall. The Corporate Headquarters has also been praised for its logical configuration, the building being described as \\"a very well done rational office building.\\" Today the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters is considered one of the best examples of the International style.

Campbell originally published in 1934 in Astounding Stories, and apparently inspired by H. G. Wells' article The Man of the Year Million.The Man Who Invented Tomorrow In 1970, it was selected as one of the best science fiction short stories published before the creation of the Nebula Awards by the Science Fiction Writers of America. As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964. Plot summary The narrator relates his conversation with an oddly dressed man whom he had picked up by the side of the road. The traveler claimed to have been from the year 3059, and to have developed time-travel technology with which he had first traveled 7 million years forward in time. He then overshot on his return trip, landing himself in 1932. In the future, man has colonized the solar system but is dying out. Human existence is free of difficulty, as all illness and predators have been eliminated and all work is done by perfect machines. Almost all other living species have been made extinct by the advancement of man; the oceans are empty of life, all other mammals, as well as birds, lizards, insects and microbes, have been eradicated and even traditional pets are gone for good. Only some plant life still exists--and machines who blindly follow orders given by the previous generations of humans. Humans, though highly intelligent, have lost their curiosity, drive, much of their knowledge and have accomplished nothing new in about two million years. They are, as things then stand, a dying race, which retreated from the outskirts of the solar system back to Earth, abandoned most of the mega-cities (such as \\"Yawk City\\", a megalopolis stretching from north of Boston to south of Washington D.C.) and hardly reproduce anymore. All they are able to do is stare at their remote ancestors' achievements, while comprehending none of them. The machines go on; each of the long-deserted cities keeps running perfectly, as if nothing has changed. Cities, where human foot has not stood for hundreds of thousands of years, are still cared for by the machines, who never stopped supplying the city all its human needs, because no one has ever told them to stop; no human of that time can remember how. Highly intelligent machines capable of independent thought had existed, but were shut off for an unknown reason. No human alive knows of their existence any more, aside from the traveller. To try and ensure that there remains something that can strive and evolve on Earth, he orders several of the remaining machines to figure out how to recreate a curious, thinking machine, even if it takes millions of years. Critical reception Algis Budrys said that \\"Twilight\\" \\"attracted a decade- long series of engineers/mystics as the archetypical writers of the 'Golden Age' and brought about the late Victorian Edwardian flavor of 'Modern' science fiction.\\"\\"Books\\", F&SF;, October 1979, p.30 Everett F.

Roy Focker is a fictional character from the Japanese anime science fiction series Macross (which was loosely adapted as the first story arc of Robotech) and the prequel OVA Macross Zero. He is voiced by Akira Kamiya in the original Japanese anime television series and by Brett Weaver in the 2006 ADV Films English dub. =Fictional character biography= Roy in Macross Zero. Roy F√∂cker is a Dutch-American who was born and lived in the United States in the late 20th century. During his college days he had interest in prehistorical civilizations and archeology studies, and was in a relationship with his senior Aries Turner. However, after being left by her, Roy dropped his studies and became a stunt pilot in the air circus led by Hikaru Ichijyo's father. Some time later he decided to join the U.N. Spacy after most of his friends died in the U.N. Wars. His flight instructor during this time was D.D. Ivanov. During the war Roy became a talented and strong-willed fighter pilot, known for his love of women and alcohol. During the war he shot down 180 enemy fighters. F√∂cker was selected later as one of the first test pilots for the development of the variable fighters by the U.N. Forces. In 2008 he is deployed as a squadron commander with the Skull Team aboard the stealth carrier CVN-99 Asuka II on a secret mission in the South Pacific and flies the VF-0 Phoenix in battle against the SV-51s of the Anti-U.N. Forces. The work done on the VF-0 helps the coinciding development of the VF-1 Valkyrie. Despite his long absence during the U.N. Wars and the death of Hikaru's father, Hikaru still remained a close friend to Roy and considered him his senpai. After the end of the U.N. Wars, F√∂cker involved himself in the VF-X development project flying both the VF-X and the VF-X-1 (non-transformable and transformable flight test prototypes of the VF-1 Valkyrie), and his flight experience earned him the command of the VF-1 Skull Squadron aboard the super- large-scale semi-submersible attack aircraft carrier CVS-101 Prometheus. During Space War I Roy F√∂cker is still a smoking, drinking womanizer who constantly defies death and, when not on another desperate mission, enjoys life and its pleasures to the fullest. He has a relationship with Claudia LaSalle, an officer stationed on the SDF-1 Macross bridge.Character of Macross: Roy F√∂cker. Page 122. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book.

Roy dies in episode 18 (\\"Pineapple Salad\\"), from wounds sustained while defending Macross from Milia Fallyna's force of Queadluun-Rau battle suits. Instead of going to the hospital to treat his wounds, he chooses to play the guitar while waiting for Claudia LaSalle to finish her pineapple salad; while she's cooking for him, he collapses from a sudden internal bleeding and passes away few minutes later.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: \\"Pine Salad\\". Pages 34 and 35. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. Minori Library, 1983 October 10. . To Hikaru's chagrin given his then shaken self-confidence in his flying skill in war, he is promoted as the new leader of Roy's squadron, using his mecha as well. In the 1984 The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love? film adaptation of the original TV series, the character Roy F√∂cker dies aboard an alien Zentradi ship while fighting Quamzin Kravshera. In the movie Roy sacrifices himself to let both Hikaru Ichijyo and Misa Hayase escape. =Character creation= Roy F√∂cker was named in honor of the Fokker aircraft company, and its founder Anthony Fokker who built the Fokker E.I, the Fokker Dr.I and Fokker D.VII fighter aircraft during World War I. In flashback sequences, Roy flies a reproduction Fokker D.VII, and gives Hikaru a model of one as a \\"get well\\" gift. Furthermore, although several possible scenarios regarding his death abound, the Red Baron (for which the Fokker Dr.I was most famous) was possibly shot down in combat by a Canadian pilot called Roy Brown, the origin of Roy F√∂cker's first name. The colors on Roy's VF-1S Valkyrie are similar to those of the VF-84 Jolly Rogers unit that flew the F-14 Tomcat, a plane that inspired the basic design of the VF-1 Valkyrie. =In other media= In any rendition of the famous RPG crossover of Super Robot Wars involving Macross, Roy F√∂cker constituted a major character in the overall story, and did not die as per the scenario of Macross. In these games, F√∂cker was fighting alongside many other robot anime icons, especially those voiced by his voice actor Akira Kamiya (e.g. Ryoma Nagare of Getter Robo, Akira Hibiki of Reideen, Kazuya Ryuzaki of Daimos, and Sanshiro Tsuwabuki of Gaiking). In the sequel series Macross Frontier, the leader of the Frontier fleet's S.M.S. Skull Platoon is Ozma Lee. Like Roy, he shows elements of the same personality and becomes a mentor figure to series protagonist, Alto. In addition, food involving pineapples (in this case, pineapple cake) appears to have nearly lethal effects - Ozma is badly wounded on the day he promised to prepare pineapple cake for Ranka with Cathy's recipe, and the evidence of his injury produces a similar shock with SMS groundcrew as that produced after Roy F√∂cker's final flight. Breaking the fourth wall, Michel notes that if Ozma had died, it would have been \\"The most moving scene ever!\\". Bruno J. Global  is the fictional captain of the SDF-1 Macross in the anime series The Super Dimension Fortress Macross. In the Macross TV Japanese series Captain Global is an Italian submarine skipper and UN Spacy officer who was involved in the refit of the crashed Alien Star Ship 1 (ASS-1) into the SDF-1 Macross during the U.N. Wars. He is the SDF-1 ship's plankowner and sees her through many adventures and hardships battling the Zentradi aliens during the original series. He regularly pulls out and lights up his smoking pipe when he feels nervous. =Macross= According to the fictional continuity of the Macross series, Bruno Global is of Italian ethnicity. Before commanding the Macross, Global's commanding officer during the U.N. Wars was Misa Hayase's father Takashi.U.N. Wars Official Information. Retrieved on 04-26-09. He was the captain of the U.N. Navy submarine Marco Polo and the UN Spacy Oberth class space destroyer Goddard, which engaged and destroyed her hijacked sister ship Tsiolkovsky in the first ever use of reaction weaponry in real ship-vs- ship space combat during the U.N. Wars. Bruno J. Global rose through the ranks of the United Nations Forces thanks to his exploits during the Unification Wars until he was assigned as Captain of the flagship of the infant Spacy, the SDF-1 Macross fortress. During the skirmishes of Space War I, Global came up with various strategies (with a little help from First Lieutenant Misa Hayase) to evade the Zentradi, rather than attacking them head-on. The most tragic event under his command came with the collapse of the Macross ill-fated omnidirectional barrier, wiping out a large city in the Ontario region. The event caused a wider rift between him and the U.N., leading to the temporary exile of the Macross from Earth. Eventually, when Milia Fallyna of the Lap Lamiz fleet defected to the Macross and wished to marry Maximilian Jenius, Global gave them permission, and by doing so made the first true step toward peace with the Zentradi. After Space War I, he took an administrative position in the U.N. Government and designed the Human Emigration Project, a space colonization scheme followed by the U.N. for the following years to ensure the survival of mankind and its culture in case of further appearances of Zentradi and Supervision Army fleets. In the Macross continuity he became an admiral as well as commander of the U.N. Spacy after the battle against Boddole Zer. He survives the Macross series to become U.N. Representative in 2014, and retires from the Spacy as a full Admiral. In Macross, he married Miho Global in March 2003. It's unknown if they had any children, or if they survived the Battle with the Boddole Zer Main Fleet. The voice of Captain Bruno J. Global was provided by Michio Hazama in the original Japanese version and John Swasey in the English dub by ADV Films released in January 2006.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Cast. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, October 10. =Legacy= * As a tribute to the series, the character design for Nemo in Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water, looks almost exactly like Global. In the AD Vision English dub of the series, it is taken a step further as the voice of Nemo (supplied by Ev Lunning Jr.) resembles Gloval from Robotech. * The Battlecruiser Captain of StarCraft and StarCraft: Brood War bears some minor resemblance to Global, and speaks in a manner and tone similar to his Robotech counterpart. * In episode 13 of the Macross Frontier animated T.V. series the ruins of what appears to be a production version of the SDF-1 Macross are found. This new ship is named the Global. Also, the Captain of S.M.S Macross Quarter, Jeffrey Wilder, physically resembles Bruno J. Global. * The Captain of the Alliance submarine Pincer X2 located in Vash'jir in the game World of Warcraft is named Captain Glovaal and speaks in a manner and tone similar to his Robotech counterpart. Hayao Kakizaki is a fictional character in the science fiction television series The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, voiced by Katsumi Suzuki.ADV Films Official Macross English Dub Page. English/Japanese Cast Information. 04-09-09 In the ADV Films dub of Macross, he is voiced by Jason Douglas. In the fictional world of Macross Hayao Kakizaki is a tall and strong, but not very smart, U.N. Spacy japanese variable fighter pilot who was assigned to the Vermilion Squadron, along with Maximilian Jenius, to be under the command of Hikaru Ichijyo. He pilots a brown-white VF-1A Valkyrie in the television series and in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love? movie he pilots a green-striped VF-1A Valkyrie.Mechanic of Macross: VF-1 \\"Valkyrie\\". Pages 151-160. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, October 10. Among the pilots of the Vermillion Squadron, Kakizaki is the least serious and skilled. His characterization adds to an already heavy laden humorous anime even more comic relief. He is portrayed also as being a laid back character, which often at times would endanger him while out battling the Zentradi. Compared to his teammates, Kakizaki is also the least experienced pilot, and from time-to- time, Hikaru and Max had to save him from being killed. In November 2009, when Gunsight One's radar system was damaged, Kakizaki, along with Max and his superior, Hikaru Ichijyo accompanied Misa Hayase to scout the surrounding of the SDF-1 Macross.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: Blind Game. Page 25. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10. During this mission, he and the others were captured by the Zentradi.

Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10. In episode 19: Burst Point, Kakizaki was killed in action when the Macross's barrier system overloads and Kakizaki's Valkyrie was caught in the blast field.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: Burst Point. Pages 36 and 37. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10. In the Macross chronology, he was KIA just after the episode of Roy Focker's death. However, in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love? movie, he was killed in battle by missiles fired by a group of Queadluun-Raus led by Milia Fallyna while joking with Max and Hikaru (Ironically underestimating their enemy's strength due to them being female). In the Robotech western adaptation his ethnicity was changed to American and his name became Ben Dixon. Hayao Kakizaki also appears in videogames such as The Super Dimension Fortress Macross for the PlayStation 2 and Macross Ace Frontier for the PlayStation Portable. In the sequel series Macross Frontier, an in-direct reference is made to Kakizaki by Alto Saotome, who mentions the \\"Valkyrie's Curse\\", as he says \\"It's bad luck to talk about women when in combat...If you do, then you might get shot down\\".

She and fellow bridge officer Misa Hayase are close friends, and she is often there to give her friend advice on matters of the heart (especially when it comes to Misa's confused feelings for Hikaru Ichijyo), something Hayase is awkward in.

Max Jenius  ' is a fictional character in the science fiction television series Macross, voiced by Sh≈ç Hayami. In the new English adaptation by ADV Films, he is voiced by Chris Patton. =Role in Macross= He is a young fighter pilot, having joined Hikaru Ichijyo's Vermillion Team, along with Hayao Kakizaki, at the age of only 16. Jenius shows in his first sortie that he is a preternaturally talented ace pilot who is nearly invincible in combat, despite his need to wear corrective lenses on duty. Max is quickly recognized as the top pilot of the force, as marked by being granted to distinctively repaint his mecha into his preferred blue color. Jenius' skill at piloting mecha becomes even more celebrated with feats that no other pilot would have thought of, much less achieved. One outstanding incident involves his infiltrating a Zentradi battleship in his valkyrie and disguising it with a Zentradi uniform, allowing him to escape detection.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: Big Escape. Pages 25 and 26. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10. Although Jenius is not above an occasional egotistical musing when he is off duty, he is also well known for his affable and courteous personality and his comrades hold him in high favor on top of his impressive skill. He is also an incurable romantic in his youth which shows when he meets his future wife. That occurred when the top Zentradi ace pilot, Milia Fallyna, hears about a formidable pilot aboard the humans' SDF-1 Macross space fortress and seeks to challenge him personally in battle. Max manages to defeat Milia not once, but thrice. The first in their respective mechas, the second in simulated combat (a video game) and finally in a knife fight to the death. It is this final fight where the two rivals fall in love. Immediately after the knife-fight in the park Max proposes to Milia who accepts.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: Virgin Road. Page 44. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10. Afterward, Milia is allowed to join the mainline fighting forces of the SDF-1 Macross and becomes Max's wingmate on duty, piloting a distinctive red Valkyrie alongside Max's blue one. After the Zentradi Fleet that nearly destroys the Earth is vanquished, Max and Milia settle down in the new city built around the SDF-1 Macross and begin a new life together. In March 2011, they give birth to a daughter (the first of seven) named Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius.Character of Macross: Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius. Page 118. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, October 10. The name Komilia (which means \\"Little Milia\\") is chosen because with her green hair and green eyes, she looks so much like her mother (although it has also been suggested that the \\"ko\\" simply refers to the Japanese kanji character \\"child\\" that is often used on the end of Japanese female personal names - a suggestion which is supported by the title of episode 30: Viva Maria, as opposed to Viva Komilia). Komilia proves how related the Humans and Zentradi are. The \\"first stellar interracial child\\" is very unabashed baby, and proves resilient to Milia's sometimes rough and inexperienced handling. Max, despite his relatively young age, proves to be a happy and successful father, although he clearly has a strong dislike of Komilia's playfulness with his hair. Misa Hayase and Claudia LaSalle find Komilia adorable and are amazed that she isn't shy at all, and envy Max and Milia for having such a beautiful child. Max and his family play a crucial role in the U.N.' capture of a factory satellite in November 2011. After blasting their way into the enemy command ship, Max and Milia proudly display their child, cradled in Milia's arms and wearing a tiny pink and white spacesuit, to the hostile Zentradi. Max smiles as Milia explains that Komilia \\"was created by the two of us...\\". The hostile Zentradi, who have had no exposure to human culture and have never seen a baby before, become terrified of Komilia and flee in fear, causing chaos aboard the command ship and disorder throughout the enemy fleet. This allows the Earth forces and the allied Zentradi to seize the factory.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: Viva Maria. Page 73. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10. In the original Macross series, Max and Milia have seven natural daughters and adopt a Zentradi girl over a period of twenty years from 2011 to 2031. The oldest is Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius, who is the only one seen in the original series. The youngest is Mylene Flare Jenius, who becomes a major character in Macross 7. Emilia Jenius is seen briefly in Macross 7 the Movie: The Galaxy's Calling Me!. His granddaughter Mirage Fallyna Jenius is a major character in Macross Delta. =Role in Macross 7= Prior to the events of Macross 7, Max is appointed commander of the 7th Macross Fleet and captain of the flagship Battle 7, with a de-micronized Exsedol Folmo as his advisor. Although separated from Milia, he is in almost-daily contact with her, due to her position as mayor of the civilian ship City 7, and possibly continues to harbor feelings for her. Despite being in his fifties, Max appears to have aged very little from his original appearance. Character designer Haruhiko Mikimoto half-jokingly said that is the case \\"Because he's a genius. Growing old is a state of mind for average men...\\".Comment on Maximilian Jenius by Haruhiko Mikimoto Max and Milia, in addition to being legally separated from each other, are also separated from most of their children - all but their youngest daughter, Mylene Flare Jenius, have moved away from the Macross 7 fleet. Max often checks up on Mylene, whom he feels very protective of. As the series progresses, Max becomes responsible for the establishment of \\"Sound Force\\", a trio of Valkyries piloted by the members of Fire Bomber which includes Mylene. Initially, he forbids Mylene from joining Sound Force, for fear of putting her life in danger, but is persuaded to allow her to join after witnessing her skill as a pilot and musician. Max often clashes with Milia about Mylene, but the two are able to remain civil (usually) around each other for the sake of their daughter, who unsuccessfully tries to bring them together again. Late in the series, Max and Milia are able to overcome their troubled past and resume flying together in their distinctive blue and red VF-22 Sturmvogels in order to save the fleet from threat posed by the Protodeviln. In the final battle, Max, Milia and Mylene fight side-by-side against Lord Geperunitch. =Role in Macross: Do You Remember Love film= In The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?, an animated film adaptation of the original series, Max and Milia met in a completely different way. After the Macross returns to Earth, the Meltrandi, under the command of Lap Lamiz, launched their own campaign against the Macross. The Meltrandi fleet sends in their highly trained Queadluun-Rau power armor fighters, led by their ace pilot, Milia Fallyna, to retrieve a Protoculture tablet containing an ancient song they believed could help them defeat their Zentradi enemies. In the ensuing battle with the Macross and subsequent death of Hayao Kakizaki, Max and Milia fight against each other. In the last phase of the battle, Max and Milia enter the Lap Lamiz's ship and there, Max manages to down his opponent. Upon breaching the armor, Max is enamored by Milia as she is with him, and expresses his awe at the Meltran pilot. In the final battle between Boddole Zer and the Macross fleet, a macronized Max is seen with Milia battling together in their respective specialized blue and red Queadluun-Raus. This scene is one of the few scenes showing Max without his glasses. Another difference in the movie is that after Roy Focker's death, Max is promoted to leader of the Skull Squadron, thus having Hikaru Ichijyo and Hayao Kakizaki briefly as his subordinates. =References in other media= In Macross Frontier, the character Michael Blanc resembles Max in being a star pilot that wears glasses. He has a romantic interest in Klan Klang of the Meltrandi, who resembles Milia.

Boddole Zer was voiced by Osamu Ichikawa in the original Macross TV series. The character was also voiced by Mike Kleinhenz in the English dub by ADV Films released during January 2006. Golg Boddole Zer ordered his subordinate Britai Kridanik to track down and recover the Supervision Army spaceship which had crashlanded on Earth, thus starting Space War I. After the failures of Britai and his other subordinate Moruk Lap Lamiz to capture the SDF-1 Macross and their subsequent \\"cultural contamination\\" by the miclones (humans), Boddole Zer ordered all 4,795,122 ships in the Boddole Zer Main Fleet to fold to Earth and destroy the SDF-1 Macross, the defecting Zentradi forces, and the Earth itself in 2010. Boddole Zer was killed when an unorthodox tactic by the SDF-1 Macross destroyed his massive flagship, but not before he ordered the obliteration of the Earth's surface with less than one million human survivors in the Battle with the Boddole Zer Main Fleet. Boddole Zer also appeared in the movie The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love? as a cyborg Zentradi leader who was fused with a massive combat mobile fortress that had a 120,000 cycle history of space battles. In the movie, Boddole Zer was also in command of a male Zentradi fleet which had been at war with the female Meltlandi for hundreds of thousands of years. He orders the destruction of Earth after his fleet discovers a rebuilt Meltlandi ship on the planet before the beginning of the film.Sega Saturn Compatible CD-ROM Video Game.

After both the Zentradi and the Meltlandi become \\"cultured\\" by an ancient Protoculture song and join the surviving humans, Boddole Zer and his fortress are attacked by the combined forces of both fleets and the SDF-1 Macross. Boddole Zer himself is destroyed by Hikaru Ichijyo flying a VF-1 Valkyrie variable fighter at the end of the film.  Exsedol Folmo  is a fictional character in the Macross universe. He first appeared in the original Macross and then in Macross: Do You Remember Love?, Macross: Flash Back 2012, Macross 7, the movie Macross 7: The Galaxy Is Calling Me! and the OVA Macross 7 Encore. The character was voiced by Ry≈´suke ≈åbayashi in the original 1982 Japanese animated TV series. In the 2006 ADV Films Dub he was voiced by Andy McAvin. According to the fictional continuity of Macross, Exsedol is an alien Zentradi records keeping officer (a walking living encyclopedia) attached to fleet commander Britai Kridanik, and would always be seen at the side of his superior during Space War I giving advice.Character of Macross: Exsedol Folmo. Page 130. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, October 10. He is a Zem First Class \\"Archivist\\" Official in the Britai Fleet and his memory capacity is said to surpass any electronic device that ever existed, as he keeps details of every combat in the entire 500,000-year-old Zentradi history for instant recall. During their first contact with the humans and upon their discovery that they were miclones, Exsedol advised that they should be left alone, quoting an ancient Zentradi battle directive. However, this particular piece of advice was ignored by his superiors.General Folmo Information. Retrieved on 04-23-09. Much later, when the Britai fleet had decided to defect to the humans side, he was micloned and sent to the Macross as a peace envoy. When the war ended and UN Spacy was re-established he joined up as an advisor. Some time later, he reverted to his larger size and his body went through major alterations as a precaution against him losing the trove of information lying in his mind, which explains his altered appearance in the later Macross productions. =Other appearances= Exsedol as he appeared in Macross: Do You Remember Love?. Exsedol appeared in the movie The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?, also as a Zentradi advisor who becomes a defector to the human side. However, his appearance was radically redesigned, with a bald, swollen head, green skin, a cloak covering his body, and retractable tendrils for arms. This design was carried over to his subsequent appearance in the TV series Macross 7, with some slight differences, namely that he has a blue collar, green tendrils, and a slightly darker skin tone. Exsedol in Macross 7 is also rarely seen without a hemispherical cap on his cranium, usually connected to the ceiling. When the Macross 7 launched, Exsedol joined Cpt. Maximilian Jenius as an advisor aboard the Battle 7, and was a great source of information on the new and unknown (to the humans) enemy, the Protodeviln, though in earlier episodes Exsedol's instinctive terror of the Protodevlin gets the better of him, and he prefers to hide away from the new enemy. For the entire series, Exsedol is depicted as being at full Zentradi size, initially with his head sticking up through an opening in the bridge floor, close to where Cpt. Jenius sits; several other such openings are seen to exist in the ship, so that Exsedol can participate in military conferences. Sometimes the animation depicts Exsedol as much larger than his original Zentradi form, but that could be attributed to variance in the artwork. Episode 37 of Macross 7, The Mystery of the Ruins? also depicts Exsedol walking outside for the first time since the colony fleet launched, in order to investigate ancient Protoculture ruins. Later episodes have him leaving the Battle 7 for the science ship Einstein, where he sits among the crew instead of underneath the floor. An unnamed Zentradi advisor who greatly resembled the Macross 7 Exsedol also appeared in episodes 12 and 13 of the Macross Frontier TV series.Macross Frontier (TV Series).

Episode 5. 05-01-08 =Character notes= The original in-story explanation for the character's new appearance was that Exsedol had been physically modified between series, presumably from his original design. This was found in the liner notes for the Macross 7 DVDs: ‚ÄúAlthough he was Micloned at one time, he purportedly returned to his former Zentradi size and realtered his body makeup for fear of losing his cerebral capacity and memories‚Äù.Exsedol Folmo‚Äôs entry in the Macross Compendium Many flashbacks to the original series in later Macross productions featured the new design for Exsedol. Kawamori described the relation between the different depictions of Space War I: \\"The real Macross is out there, somewhere. If I tell the story in the length of a TV series, it looks one way, and if I tell it as a movie-length story, it's organized another way.\\" According to him, the changes in the appearance of Exsedol Folmo in the different Macross series is due to them being all equally fictional and open to changes in the style and design of their plot and characters.  Milia Fallyna Jenius  is a fictional character in the Macross Japanese animated science fiction series, voiced by Eri Takeda. In the 2006 English adaptation by ADV Films she is voiced by Luci Christian. =Role in Macross = Milia is an ace Quimeliquola Queadluun-Rau power armor pilot, a Meltlandi, or female Zentradi, a giant race of warriors in Macross: Do You Remember Love??. Serving on board a Meltlandi ship in the Lap Lamiz fleet, she joined Commander Britai Kridanik's investigation of the \\"miclones\\" of Earth, and their spacecraft, the SDF-1 Macross. After being beaten in a pitched battle against the human pilot Maximilian Jenius, she volunteered for micloning and, reduced to human size, infiltrated the Macross.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: Pine Salad. Pages 34 and 35. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, 1983 October 10. Y2800. Rather than espionage, her real aim was to find and kill the man who had humiliated her. At a video game arcade, she again finds herself unbeatable until she is challenged to a duel by Max, an incredibly skilled pilot and the pilot whom Milia had dueled against in real combat. Milia concludes (correctly) that Max must be the ace pilot which she faced in real combat. Max asks Milia out on a date, and Milia accepts although she secretly plots to kill him. Later, when Max meets with her in a park, Milia reveals that she is a Zentradi and tries to kill him with a knife. After a short fight, Max disarms her. Beaten for a third time, she falls to her knees, begins to cry and asks Max to kill her. Yet, despite everything that has occurred, Max puts his finger under her chin and the two look into each other's eyes for a long moment. It is then that Milia has a revelation: that the emotion Max had awoken in her was not hate, but love. The two seem to float towards each other and then passionately kiss. They are then quickly married and Milia puts her life as a Zentradi warrior behind her, choosing instead to live with Max. After defecting to the Macross and marrying Max, Milia was allowed to become a member of the UN Spacy in her own right and piloted a red-painted VF-1J Valkyrie fighter into battle thereafter as her husband's wingmate. However, caring for her own people, she convinced Max and the other pilots to capture, rather than kill, their Zentradi opponents. This deed actually saved the ship during an all out attack by her race to destroy the ship as it, among other events, led to mutiny in the Zentradi forces severe enough for Commander Vrlitwhai to call a ceasefire.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: Messenger. Page 45. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10. After the Zentradi Fleet that nearly destroys the Earth is vanquished, Max and Milia settle down in the new city built around the SDF-1 Macross. In March 2011, Milia gives birth to a daughter (the first of seven) who is named Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius. The name Komilia (which means \\"Little Milia\\") is chosen because, with her green hair and green eyes, she looks so much like her mother (although it has also been suggested that the \\"ko\\" simply refers to the Japanese kanji character \\"child\\" that is often used on the end of Japanese female personal names - a suggestion which is supported by the title of the episode 30: Viva Maria, as opposed to Viva Komilia) Komilia proves how related the Humans and Zentradi are as she is the \\"first stellar interracial child\\". She proves to be an unabashed baby who is tough enough to handle Milia's often inexperienced handling. Komilia is also very playful with Max's long hair, and pulls on it while giggling. The birth of her first child was another profoundly moving event for Milia when the artificially gestated woman realized that she created life inside her own body. It takes time for Milia to learn about motherhood - when Misa Hayase asks if she could hold Komilia, Milia initially refuses and tells Misa \\"If you want to hold a baby, why not make one of your own? I made this one.\\" When Milia does agree, she throws Komilia to Misa, who barely manages to catch the baby in time. Komilia proves adorable to Misa Hayase and Claudia LaSalle, who are amazed that she doesn't appear to be shy at all, and envy Milia for having such a beautiful little girl. Misa is overjoyed when she gets the opportunity to hold Komilia while she and Claudia admire her, argue who should hold her, and make her laugh. Later, Komilia can be seen peacefully asleep in her mother's arms. Milia, despite her past as a ruthless Zentradi warrior, embraces her role as a mother and feels as much love for Komilia as any human mother could feel towards her child. Komilia, along with her parents, plays an important role in the U.N.' capture of a factory satellite in November 2011. After blasting into the enemy command ship in their fighters, Max and Milia face the hostile Zentradi and Milia reaches into her fighter and lifts baby Komilia (in a tiny pink and white spacesuit) into view, causing the enemy Zentradi who have never seen a baby before to recoil in shock and fear. Komilia coos as she brings her hands to the faceshield of her helmet in an effort to rub her eyes, promoting the Zentradi to shout \\"It moves!\\" Milia, smiling, states \\"This is called a baby. Her name is Komilia Maria Fallyna Jenius. She'll gradually grow bigger until she's the same size as us. She was created by the two of us,\\" as she motions towards Max. Milia then raises Komilia high over her head, proudly proclaiming her birth to be a symbol of protoculture. The hostile Zentradi now filled with terror, abandon their posts, which causes disorder and allows the U.N. forces and the allied Zentradi to destroy the enemy fleet and seize the factory. =Role in Macross Do You Remember Love?= Just as in the original The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Milia is depicted as an ace pilot. Milia is first seen when the Meltrandi breached Vrlitwhai Kridanik's Nupetiet-Vergnitzs battleship. As she entered the ship, Milia starts killing every Zentran she sees, and after executing her task, flees with gusto. Milia's subsequent appearance in the movie is during the battle between the Macross fleet and the Meltrandi. In this battle, Milia entered into Lap Lamiz's ship with a tailing Maximilian Jenius behind her. She was shot down within the ship. Upon breaching the Queadluun-Rau armor, Max is enamored by Milia (as she is with him) and expresses his awe of the Meltran pilot. Milia and Max are finally seen battling together against Boddole Zer and his fleet, Max having been expanded to Meltrandi size. =Role in Macross 7 = In Macross 7 Milia sports a new short hairdo rather than her original long hair in Macross. Like Max, she doesn't seem to have aged. However, she is sensitive whenever people, especially Basara Nekki, refer to her age. Milia is elected overwhelmingly as the mayor of City 7, the largest and main ship of the Macross 7 colonization fleet. She is accompanied by Mylene, her daughter, who lives separately. Max is also present as commander of the Macross 7 fleet, although the couple are now separated. It is also implied that she still may have feelings for her estranged husband. As City 7's Mayor, Milia is determined not only to maintain law and order among her citizens, but to marry off the rebellious Mylene as well. In the series, Milia still possesses her red VF-1J Valkyrie, and like Max, she can still fly a Valkyrie exceptionally and as passionately as she did in the original The Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Milia clearly shows signs of affection towards her antique red VF-1J when it was destroyed by Sivil while being piloted by Gamlin Kizaki. Later in the series, Milia, while serving as City 7's mayor, would from time-to-time pilot her Valkyrie - first piloting her VF-1J and gradually moving on to more advanced Valkyries, the VF-17D Nightmare and VF-22S Sturmvogel II respectively, all of which are colored deep red - to assist the battle of the Macross 7 fleet against the Protodeviln and their Varauta Army. In the final episode of Macross 7, Milia and Max fought side-by-side in their own custom colored VF-22 Sturmvogel variable fighters against Lord Geperunitch. = In other media = * In the sequel series Macross Frontier there is a Meltlan pilot called Klan Klang who dons a red Queadluun-Rhea power armor (the successor to the Queadluun-Rau) as the captain of the S.M.S Pixie Platoon. She has blue hair and like Milia, seems to be in love with a human pilot, Mikhail Blanc, who resembles Max.The FOOL's Progress, DECULTURE!!. Anime Blog. 08-01-2008 However, their relationship is a rocky one, and made difficult as Klan's adult body would convert to a childlike physical appearance upon micronization. * Klan's red Queadluun-Rea is a reference to Milia's red Queadluun-Rau, which appeared in Macross: Do You Remember Love? * Milia's granddaughter Mirage from Macross Delta shares many similarities with her. Aside from being a pilot, Mirage also has an antagonistic relationship with a possible love interest, Hayate Immelman, who himself also flies a blue fighter jet. * In one episode of Delta, Mirage and Hayate fly red and blue VF-1EXs similar to those of Milia and Max.

He entered Space War I when the commander of the Adoclas fleet, Vrlitwhai Kridanik, ordered his battalion to join up with Vrlitwhai's fleet to aid in the capture of the Macross. The choice of Quamzin was a particularly unsettling one for Vrlitwhai's archivist Exsedol Folmo who believed Quamzin to be irrational, selfish, violent and as dangerous to his own side as to the enemy. This perception was reinforced when, while recklessly coming out of spacefold right into the main fleet, Quamzin's ships collided with some of Vrlitwhai's force ‚Äî and that Quamzin and his men had placed bets on how many ships they'd hit. He was immediately dispatched to Mars in a plot to disable the Macross while she was landed and taking supplies from an abandoned U.N. Spacy base on the planet. The plan failed. However, this merely led the megalomaniacal Quamzin to continue to redouble his efforts, including disobeying Vrlitwhai's direct order on not harming the Macross while conducting an intimidation barrage. He destroyed the Macross' radar installations, forcing Misa Hayase, Hikaru Ichijyo, Maximilian Jenius and Hayao Kakizaki to conduct a recon mission, and resulting in the foursome's capture.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: \\"First Contact\\". Page 26. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, October 10. Finally, Quamzin undertook a daring, almost suicidal plan‚Äîhe used the Macross' devastating \\"Daedalus Attack\\" against the ship by forcing his troops up the Daedalus' boarding ramp. In the end, Quamzin's troops were able to do massive damage to Macross City before the assault fell apart. Some of the Zentradi who had taken part in the assault were actually defectors smitten by the ship's culture and the ship's resident singer, Lynn Minmay.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: Love Concert.

Page 41. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, October 10. Soon after, Boddole Zer, the commander of the Zentradi fleet, arrived to finally put an end to what he saw as the corrosive effects of culture. Quamzin, unwilling to take part in a Zentradi civil war (Vrlitwhai and his fleet had recently decided to take up the defense of the Earth alongside Macross) departed for parts unknown, and disappeared from the historical record for two years.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: \\"Aiwa Nagareru\\". Page 47-52. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, October 10. Those two years had been spent building a base for a Zentradi militarist revival. He recruited Zentradi who had either been not fully \\"cultured\\" or who had grown disenchanted with their new, peaceful lives and wanted to return to a time of constant warfare. In the jungles of South America, his small but loyal cadre worked to restore a Zentradi ship that had crash-landed intact during the battle with Boddole Zer and, in furtherance of this goal, assaulted a number of newly established cities across the globe. Among the most damaging of the assaults was the last one, the battle of Onogi City on Christmas Eve,Choujikuu Yousai Macross, episode 35 ROMANESQUE 2011\\\\. Quamzin, as he and his forces left with the reactor that was their target, left a nasty surprise behind: Detonator-controlled bombs that levelled great swathes of the city.The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Visual Story: \\"Romanesque\\". Pages 79-81. Macross Perfect Memory. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, October 10. With the reactor, the restoration of the ship was complete. Quamzin, with a fully operational Zentradi ship under his feet again, was ready to do the thing Vrlitwhai never did: Incapacitate or destroy the Macross. In January 2012, Quamzin's ship, with his new love, Moruk Lap Lamiz (the two had made this one concession to a culture they otherwise despised) on board, made their run for Macross City in Alaska. The run ended with Quamzin ramming his vessel into the Macross, causing massive damage to both ships. With that, he was presumed dead, although the Zentradi militarist resistance he helped foster would still be active as late as the 2050s.

She exists as a computer which produces a hologram. While her producers say that she has an artificial intelligence that includes emotional programming, it is later revealed that this programming is incomplete and her emotions are provided by Myung Fang Lone. In public, Sharon appears as a black box, with a red optical sensor for a 'face'.Sharon Apple's Biography. Macross Compendium. Myung Fang Lone masquerades as Sharon's producer, and during the concerts she is connected to Apple's system to create the unique music that has swept the galaxy. However, the lead scientist on the project, Marge Gueldoa, goes against the wishes of others on the project and implants an illegal chip into her system. This chip makes Apple an artificial lifeform complete with sentience and emotion. Because of the close connection with Myung, Apple becomes intrigued by Myung's childhood friends, the test pilots Isamu Alva Dyson and Guld Goa Bowman. Apple causes a fire, and warns the two of the danger to see how they react. When Gueldoa takes Apple to earth for a concert in Macross City, she begins a plan to take over the city by hacking into the Macross and a new experimental X-9 Ghost drone ship. Isamu and Guld both arrive to stop her. During the course of the battle, she traps Myung and reveals her plan to show her love for Isamu by giving him the ultimate thrill that he has been looking for. Her plan is to kill him, and she uses the defenses of the Macross as well as her own hypnotic powers. Guld is killed in the battle, and through the efforts of Myung and Isamu, Apple is defeated and destroyed. =Guld Goa Bowman= A Zentradi/human hybrid, Guld grew up with his two friends Myung and Isamu on the rural planet of Eden. He shared a fascination for flying with Isamu, and the two managed to build a man powered flying machine together. Another thing he shared with Isamu was his love for Myung. One day Guld walked in on Isamu and Myung sharing a tender moment. His Zentradi warlike tendencies explode with jealous rage and he attacks his two former friends. As a result, Guld knocks out Isamu and attacks Myung. The trio broke up, Myung and Isamu leaving Eden. Alone on Eden, Guld's psyche managed to suppress the memories of his assault, convincing him that he was protecting Myung from Isamu's unwanted advances. Years later, he became an employee for General Galaxy, both as a designer of variable fighters and a test pilot. His pet project, the controversial mind controlled YF-21, became General Galaxy's entry in the Project Super Nova competition. Much to his distaste, the test pilot for Shinsei Industries' YF-19, is none other than his old rival Isamu. The competition between the two, flamed by their old rivalries, becomes a bitter one. Things get even more complicated when Myung shows up in Eden as well, now the producer for the popular AI singer Sharon Apple who is on tour. In an early test flight of the YF-21, Guld fantasizes about forcing Isamu's VF-11 Thunderbolt to crash (having been rescued from a certainly fatal crash by Isamu's quick thinking himself moments earlier). The YF-21's control system interprets this as a command and pushes down hard on Isamu's fighter, forcing it to crash, which Isamu survives with only superficial injuries. Guld, determined to win, even manages to sabotage one of the tests in his favour by swapping live ammunition into Isamu's gun pod, which he later uses to fire into the YF-19 and nearly kills Isamu (he had been originally intending for the ammunition to be used by Isamu against him, to make it look as though Isamu had plotted to murder him). Just as Guld is starting to patch things up between him and Myung, she leaves for Earth to attend the anniversary of the end of the Space War. Meanwhile, Project Super Nova is cancelled when U.N. Spacy announce that they will go for the A.I. controlled X-9 Ghost. While Guld is mulling this, Isamu steals the YF-19 to stop the Ghost's inauguration on Earth. Guld is then tasked to bring him back using the YF-21. He succeeds in tracking down his rival and an intense dogfight ensues. During the duel, Guld accuses Isamu of stealing Myung from him, of ruining everything. Just as Guld landed a mortal shot on Isamu, all the suppressed memories flood back in, and Guld realizes his mistake. Luckily for the grieving Guld, Isamu managed to escape in the last moment. But just as they start to bond again, the X-9 Ghost appears, now controlled by the crazed Sharon Apple and attacks the two. Guld manages to convince Isamu to leave this fight to him, and go rescue Myung instead. The fight goes in the Ghost's favour in the beginning, as Guld can barely keep up with the Ghost's aerobatics - as the fighter was computer controlled, it could move at velocities and maneuver in such ways that would kill a typical pilot. In one last act of sacrifice, Guld removes all the inhibitors from the YF-21, allowing him to execute dangerously high-G maneuvers. He reconciles himself with both Isamu and Myung over the radio and destroys the X-9 Ghost, killing himself in the process. =Isamu Alva Dyson= Born on Earth, March 27, 2015,Macross Plus Isamu Dyson grew up with his two friends Myung and Guld on the rural planet of Eden. A student of Della Musica High School, he shared a fascination for flying with Guld, and would often go chasing the planet's indigenous giant birds just to watch them fly. Another thing he shared with Guld was his love for Myung. When he and Myung finally had a tender moment, Guld walked in on them and exploded with rage attacking his former friends. The trio broke up and both Myung and Isamu leave planet Eden separately. Not long after, on September 1, 2034, Isamu realized his dream of flying by joining the U.N. Spacy as a fighter pilot. He showed his extraordinary skill again-and-again as he fought renegade Zentradi in his VF-11 Thunderbolt variable fighter leading to an astronomical kill count. However his skill came with a penchant for showmanship, dare devilry, and an independent smart-mouth personality. Vices that did not endear him to his superiors, no matter how skilled he was. An incident during an asteroid skirmish finally convinced his superiors to get rid of him by assigning him to Project Super Nova as a test pilot, ironically something Isamu had desired for a long time. The move transferred him January 5, 2040, to New Edwards Test Flight Center on his home planet of Eden. There he becomes Shinsei Industries' newest test pilot, flying their prototype the YF-19. To his surprise he finds that his former friend Guld is the test pilot for the opposing team vying for the contract, and a bitter rivalry -fueled by old differences- arises between the two that gets transferred to the competition. A rivalry that soon comes to low blows. Things get further complicated when Myung shows up in Eden as well as the producer for the galaxy sensation Sharon Apple. Meanwhile, Isamu also develops what he perceives as a rivalry with the base commander, Col. Millard Johnson, who uses a gruff demeanor and feigned disdain for the hotheaded young pilot to push him to try and use his airframe to its utmost limits. When Project Super Nova is cancelled due to the introduction of the unmanned X-9 \\"Ghost\\" drone, hot headed Isamu steals the YF-19, aided and abetted by its chief engineer Yang Neumann, and heads to Earth to disrupt the Ghost's inauguration. There he finds that he was followed by Guld who was sent to bring him back and a dogfight breaks between them. During the fight, the two finally confront each other with their grievances and in the end manage to settle them and become friends again. The new alliance is tested when the crazed Sharon Apple takes control of the Ghost and attacks them. Guld however convinces Isamu to leave and rescue the imprisoned Myung. There he is faced by intense fire from the Macross itself, also controlled by Sharon Apple. Soon after, Isamu succumbs to Sharon's hypnotizing powers and takes his fighter into a death plunge. But thanks to Myung's singing he breaks from Sharon's hold and destroys her. Unfortunately Guld is killed during his battle with the Ghost in a kamikaze-like attack destroying both himself and the drone. In the movie version, Isamu is last seen standing with Myung on the platform of the Macross, and she promptly sings \\"Voices\\", as he puts an arm around her shoulder, winning her at last. Isamu also made a brief cameo appearance in Macross Frontier: The Wings of Goodbye as a Member of S.M.S fighting against the Vajra. =Myung Fang Lone= Myung grew up on the planet Eden with her two best friends Isamu Alva Dyson and Guld Goa Bowman. Singing was her passion, and her song \\"Voices\\" was a hit during her school's festival. She, Isamu and Guld were a love triangle that eventually exploded when Guld found Myung and Isamu having a tender moment, and ended with Guld assaulting his two friends. The trio broke up and Myung left Eden soon after. Years later, Myung returned to Eden as the producer for Sharon Apple, the computerized singer on tour. The secret was that Sharon Apple was incomplete. She had no emotions. Myung's real job was to supply these emotions. On Eden, Myung is shocked when she meets Isamu and Guld there, the two now pilots competing in the Super Nova Project. The reunion brings back the old rivalry between the two and feelings that Myung thought she had left behind. Before settling matters between her and her two suitors, she leaves Eden with Sharon Apple for Earth to celebrate the anniversary of the armistice between the humans and the Zentradi. There, the awakened Sharon Apple imprisons Myung so she can have free rein with Isamu and Guld. It also reveals Myung's love for Guld, but greater love for Isamu. Myung manages to free herself and stop Sharon Apple, but not before she settles all the lingering emotions with her two friends. Isamu is later seen in the second movie of Macross Frontier, Sayonara no Tsubasa. Flying his old YF-19. Revealing that Isamu, left the conventional military sometime between 2040 and 2059 and joined the S.M.S. =Lucy Macmillan= Lucy is a researcher for Shinsei Industries assigned to the YF-19 project. It is there that she meets the young and rough test pilot Isamu who immediately attracts her by his roguish nature and the bold way he asked her out for a date. She unwittingly gets herself entangled in the bitter love triangle between Isamu and his two ex best friends Myung Fang Lone and Guld Goa Bowman. In the end she reluctantly relinquishes her hopes for a romantic relationship with Isamu. =Yang Neumann= A brilliant variable fighter designer and a genius hacker at only sixteen, Yang is a true prodigy by all standards. Shinsei Industries was confident enough in his genius to make him the chief engineer for their experimental fighter; the YF-19, their entry for the competition to select U.N. Spacy's next gen fighter known as Project Super Nova. Due to his age, he is the butt of a lot of jokes, especially from his test pilot Isamu who likes nothing better than to ruin Yang's precious prototypes with his dare devil antics. Yang is also a huge fan of Sharon Apple, and has used his hacker skills to infiltrate her highly guarded computer systems in an effort to steal her AI. He has all the parts except her emotions module which has proven to be beyond his skills since, unbeknownst to him, it doesn't actually exist (Sharon's emotions are actually provided by her alleged producer Myung Fan Lone). When Project Super Nova gets cancelled, he correctly predicts that Isamu is going to steal the YF-19 to stop the inauguration of its replacement, the X-9 Ghost, back in Macross City and manages to convince the hot headed pilot to take him along for the ride. When the crazed Sharon Apple takes control of the city she also successfully hypnotizes Yang into shooting Isamu. He misses and Isamu ejects him from the plane, presumably landing somewhere safe. =Milliard Johnson= Chief Millard Johnson is in charge of Project Super Nova, a UN Spacy program deployed to determine the next generation of Variable fighter. Chief Millard is most often found in the anime trying to control the feud between Guld Goa Bowman and Isamu Alva Dyson, many times counseling Isamu with words of wisdom that mostly infuriate the young pilot. In Macross Plus the Movie, after Isamu stole the YF-19 to interfere with the introduction of Ghost X-9 UCAV and Guld was sent in the YF-21 after the runaway VF, Millard commented that he used to steal planes as well and decided to cover up for the two of them just like his then-superiors did for him. Whether he stole planes as a covert job or simply as an act of misconduct remains unexplained.

As a child in 1999, he witnesses the fall of the Macross and the following U.N. Wars. His family is killed before his eyes, a memory that would haunt him and turn him into a quiet and untrusting person. He joins the U.N. Spacy as an F-14 fighter pilot. During a mission he is shot down by the anti-U.N.'s transformable SV-51 and lands in Mayan Island. He later flies the VF-0 Phoenix variable fighter under the tutelage of Roy Focker. Aside from his rear-seat radar intercept officer, Edgar La Salle, he has few friends and is slow to trust. His interactions with the cheerful Mao Nome and his growing attraction to her more reserved sister, Sara, help him open up. During the final episode, the extraterrestrial object known as Bird Human by the Mayan people awakens, assimilating Sara into the cockpit located at its head. He manages to break through the Bird Human's attacks and makes Sara realise that it is Shynn instead of an evil spirit (called a \\"Kadun\\" by the Mayans). The UN forces, however, see the Bird Human as a liability and launch reaction weapons at it. Sara sacrifices herself to save Shynn and the rest of the Mayan Island which would have been destroyed by the nuclear fallout. The Bird Human is critically damaged from the blasts and shoots off into space incredibly fast in what appears to be a space fold. Shynn's VF-0 suffers engine damage from the blasts and plunges towards the ocean. He is seemingly saved from certain death by Sara. Finally, an amazed Mao Nome watches Shynn and his damaged fighter ascending into space in the same way that the Bird Human did. In the tenth episode of the 2007 sequel Macross Frontier, the events of Zero are portrayed in a movie. Frontier protagonist Alto Saotome, a former kabuki actor, agreed to appear as Kudo during an underwater sequence that the original actor refused to do. In the Japanese-language website for Macross Zero, his name is romanized as Shin Kudou. The character is voiced by Kenichi Suzumura. =Edgar LaSalle= is Shynn's Radar Intercept Officer and best friend. Voiced by Sousuke Komori. =Sara Nome= As Mayan Island's priestess/shaman, a position of great spiritual importance to the people of the secluded island, has the mystical power of interacting with the island's mysterious alien ruins, a little- understood ability that she manifests through singing an ancient Mayan chant. She also gets occasional visions into the future. This power seems to run through her family's blood as her little sister, Mao Nome, also displays the same abilities to a lesser degree. As a child, she agrees to let a visiting scientist test her blood, an act forbidden by the island's traditions, in exchange for a pretty bauble. The test confirms her special skills and later makes the island's inhabitants the focus of research and armed conflict. Due to this incident Sara grows up to become suspicious of outsiders and very protective of her people's beliefs. She resents the wind of change that the abrupt arrival of U.N. pilot Shynn Kudo brings to her home, yet she realizes how powerless she is against it as she foresees the destruction and violence that is to come. In the final episode, the extraterrestrial object known as Bird Human awakens due to Sara's chant, assimilating her into its head. Shynn Kudo manages to break through the Bird Human's attacks and makes Sara realise that it is him instead of an evil spirit (called a \\"Kadun\\" by the Mayans). The U.N. Forces, however, see the Bird Human as an uncontrollable liability and launch several reaction missiles at it. Sara sacrifices herself to save Shynn and the rest of the Mayan Island, which would have been destroyed by the nuclear fallout. She makes the Bird Human create a force field that keeps the explosions away from the island. The Bird Human becomes critically damaged from the blasts and then shoots off into space incredibly fast, in what appears to be a space fold, with Sara Nome still inside. This character is voiced by Sanae Kobayashi. =Mao Nome= appears in Macross Zero, voiced by Yuuka Nanri,Macross Zero (OVA). Character Section: Mao Nome. Macross Official Website.

A member of the Mayan people who live in an island on the South Pacific, Mao initially knows nothing but her home, like her older sister Sara. Mao's fascination with the technology that the outsiders bring masks her deep mystical link to the island's mysterious alien ruins, a link she shares with her sister. The sudden arrival of Shynn Kudo to the island in 2008 sparks dreams of freedom in eleven-year-old Mao, who then yearns for a life in the cities beyond the island. Unlike her older sister Sara, she is carefree and spritelike. She becomes infatuated with Shynn, impressed by his skill in manipulating and repairing the island's scarce machinery.Mao Nome Official Character InformationMao Nome.

Her adoptive brother Ozma is also shown reflecting on his sister playing \\"Doctor Mao\\" indicating that she may have more than a few links to that series. This assertion is further developed when research into the past of Sheryl Nome, Mao's granddaughter, shows that during 2047 a fifty-year-old Mao (who survived the events of Space War I) was the chief scientist of the 117th Long Distance Research Fleet with a background researching the Protoculture Civilization and also headed a project to manage and prevent an alien infection (the V-Type infection) with Grace O'Connor and Ranshe Mei (Ranka's mother) as her assistants.Macross Frontier (TV Series).

As a former U.N. Spacy pilot, (or \\"Daisy\\" as he is affectionately known by his friends and comrades) was Roy Focker's instructor. After defecting to the Anti-U.N. side, D.D. becomes the leader of a squadron of experimental SV-51 variable fighters. The reason for his defection remains unknown. Sent by the Anti-U.N. as part of the team investigating the alien ruins in Mayan Island, the mission brings him into conflict with his former student, Focker. An intense rivalry develops between the two as they continue to dogfight to a standstill throughout the whole campaign. Ivanov was later killed when his SV-51 was blown apart by the power of the Bird Human while attempting to avenge the death of his lover and wingman Nora Polyansky. =Nora Polyansky= appears in the animated video series Macross Zero voiced by Minami Takayama. She debuts as a 25-year-old Anti-U.N. variable fighter pilot who single-handedly takes down a squadron of U.N. Spacy F-14's, including one piloted by protagonist Shynn Kudo, with the new Anti-U.N. SV-51 variable fighter. Highly skilled in both flying and close quarters combat, she is dedicated to the defeat of the U.N. forces who have killed her family and inflicted a huge scar, both physical and mental, upon her. She is attached to the SV-51 squadron led by D.D. Ivanov and acts as his wingmate, right hand pilot and lover. Ruthless in her mission, she represents Shynn's chief rival in the sky and on the ground. She is killed in the final episode of the series by an energy blast from the Protoculture biomecha known as the Bird Human while attempting to shoot down Shynn's VF-0.

It is commonly used in human medicine for administration of anticancer drugs directly to an arm or leg. It is also used in veterinary medicine to deliver drugs to a site of infection or injury, as well as for the treatment of cancer in dogs. In both cases, a tourniquet is used to reduce blood flow out of the area that is being treated. Use in human medicine Isolated limb perfusion was first introduced into the clinic by American surgeons from New Orleans in the mid-1950s. The main purpose of the isolated limb perfusion technique is to deliver a very high dose of chemotherapy, at elevated temperature, to tumour sites without causing overwhelming systemic damage. (Unfortunately, while these approaches can be useful against solitary or limited metastases, they are - by definition - not systemic and therefore do not treat distributed metastases or micrometastases). The flow of blood to and from the limb is temporarily stopped with a tourniquet, and anticancer drugs are put directly into the blood of the limb. This allows the person to receive a high dose of drugs in the area where the cancer occurred. The temperature is also increased to 42C causing an increased uptake of the drug by the tumor. The combination of high drug dose and high temperature is toxic systemically, thus the isolation of the limb. Blood flow through the limb is typically achieved using an extracorporeal circuit consisting of cannulae, tubing, peristaltic roller pump, heat exchanger, and pressure monitoring/safety devices. Care must be used in handling the drugs and waste material as they are extremely toxic. Among other types of cancer, isolated limb perfusion has been used to treat in transit metastatic melanoma. In the early 1990s an alternative technique was developed at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia: isolated limb infusion. This technique is less complex and uses a minimal invasive percutaneous approach to circulatorily isolate a limb. Use in veterinary medicine Limb perfusion is also used in veterinary medicine, where is it usually referred to as regional limb perfusion (RLP). It is most commonly used in large animals, such as horses, cows, small ruminants, and camelids. These species often require large, cost-prohibitive doses of medications to treat systemically. Regional limb perfusion allows drug dose to be reduced while maintaining therapeutic concentrations at the site of interest, thereby reducing the cost of treatment, localizing application, decreasing systemic side effects, and improving efficacy.WHITEHAIR, K. J., BOWERSOCK, T. L., BLEVINS, W. E., FESSLER, J. F., WHITE, M. R. and VAN SICKLE, D. C. (1992), Regional Limb Perfusion for Antibiotic Treatment of Experimentally Induced Septic Arthritis. Veterinary Surgery, 21: 367‚Äì373. doi: 10.1111/j.1532-950X.1992.tb01713 =Method= Horses are sedated and the procedure is performed standing.Hanson RR. Complications of Equine Wound Management and Dermatologic Surgery. Veterinary Clinics of North America: Equine Practice. Vol 24(3): 663-696. Horses must be sedated, because movement can force blood past the tourniquet and reduce the concentration of drug below the site of the tourniquet. The area of needle insertion is clipped and scrubbed. A wide tourniquet is placed above the site of interest, and a needle inserted into a superficial vein of the limb below the tourniquet. The medication is delivered and the tourniquet is removed after 20‚Äì30 minutes. Because of the size of the limbs, RLP is not possible above the elbow or stifle of a horse because of inadequate compression of the underlying blood vessels. =Medications used= Limb perfusion is commonly used for antibiotic administration in cases of localized infection, such as lacerations, cellulitis, infection of a synovial structure (joint, tendon sheath, bursa), or osteomyelitis.Baxter GM. Management of wounds involving synovial structures in horses. Clinical Techniques in Equine Practice. Vol 3(2): 204-214.WHITEHAIR, K. J., ADAMS, S. B., PARKER, J. E., BLEVINS, W. E. and FESSLER, J.

Veterinary Surgery, 21: 286‚Äì292. doi: 10.1111/j.1532-950X.1992.tb0006 RLP has been shown to produce antibiotic concentrations 25-50 times the minimum inhibitory concentration in septic joints.Murphey ED, Santschi EM, Papich MG. Local antibiotic perfusion of the distal limb of horses. Proceedings. 40th Annu Conv Am Assoc Equine Practnr 1994;141‚Äì142. Antibiotic selection is important. Antibiotics must be approved for intravenous use, and are ideally chosen based on culture and susceptibility results. Concentration- dependent antibiotics, such as gentamicin and amikacin, are best suited for RLP because they have higher efficacy at higher concentrations, while time- dependent antibiotics such as penicillin and ceftiofur may be used, but have a shorter duration. However, expense is usually less of a limiting factor because a smaller amount may be used relative to systemic administration.

Partial thrombosis of a vein can occur, especially with repeated use of a vein, but complete thrombosis is rare. There may also be localized tissue irritation. Topical application of an anti- inflammatory, such as DMSO or Diclofenac sodium may be used.

The beach is known for its size, seclusion, and beauty. Location Secret Beach is located approximately one-half mile northwest of the town of Kilauea and is situated between the Kilauea Lighthouse and Kalihiwai Valley. As its name suggests, the beach is not easily accessible and no public roads lead to it. To find it, take the Kuhio Highway past Kilauea and turn right on Kalihiwai Road. Follow the road for about 50 yards and then turn right into an unmarked, unpaved road. Proceed to the end and park. Nearby is the footpath leading to the west end of the beach. =Trail Conditions= The trail winds steeply downhill through brush and may be barely discernible in places. The hike takes about 10 minutes in good weather. On rainy days and particularly in the winter, the trail is dangerously slick. Be prepared to be covered in reddish hued clay that is notoriously difficult to remove from clothing. Locals recommend braving the hike either barefoot or using Neoprene booties that kayaking enthusiasts tend to use. Since the return requires hiking back up the same path, most visitors will want to come on a dry day to avoid these conditions. Topography Secret Beach looking toward Kilauea Lighthouse Secret Beach is quite large by Hawaiian standards, approximately 3000 feet long and 75 feet wide.Kauapea Beach - aka Secret Beach - Kauai Hawaii Its surface is predominantly covered with fine white sand and with outcrops of black lava rock. The beach‚Äôs seclusion and beauty are further enhanced by the cliff backdrop and the brilliant turquoise-colored ocean water in the foreground. The cliff face, notably on the east and west ends of the beach, is sheer red and black rock. Where the gradient is less steep, the cliff is covered with lush vegetation, consisting of ironwood trees, taro plants, and other tropical plants.Princeville Beaches (site contains many photos of Secret Beach) Also there are several small cascading waterfalls. Clearly visible to the east is Kilauea Lighthouse set atop a cliff that faces Moku'ae'ae Island. About a quarter mile beyond the west end of the beach is a substantial waterfall that plunges about 15 feet into the Pacific Ocean.Secret Beach near Princeville Kauai The ocean floor is mostly sand-covered and its descent is steep. Activities Water conditions at the beach vary by season. Although the beach is accessible year round, swimming is only advisable in the summer and even then swimming can be risky when the surf is high or rough because of strong, unpredictable currents. In winter the surf is turbulent and dangerous; accordingly, swimming is not recommended for anyone who is inexperienced under these conditions. Other beach activities include picnicking, seashell hunting, surfing, sunbathing, snorkeling, and fishing. Also tidal lagoons form on the west end of the beach, offering a kind of kiddie pool. There are no facilities at the beach, so visitors must bring their own food and beverages. Naturism Secret Beach has for many years attracted nude sunbathers, particularly toward the east and west ends of the beach. Although public nudity is not legal in Hawaii and despite the beach‚Äôs reputation, the beach is rarely patrolled and no one seems much concerned with the practice. In the rare instances that patrols are conducted, violators will invariably just be asked to dress.

Usually the complex involves microscopic beads of activated carbon, which bind the anticancer drug. A magnet applied from outside the body then can direct the drug to the tumor site. This can keep a larger dose of the drug at the tumor site for a longer period of time, and help protect healthy tissue from the side effects of chemotherapy. Composition and characteristics The use of MTCs as therapeutic agents for oncology treatment has been increasing exponentially over the past decade. Currently the magnetic vehicle composition relies on the properties of the magnetic component, which is usually ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic or superparamagnetic, owing to their ability of expressing strong magnetization in the same direction of the external magnetic field while also retaining their magnetization once the external magnetic field is removed. Magnetic vehicles have been focusing on the particle size, aiming to have the MTCs in the nanoscale, which is mainly due to the fact that ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials show remnant magnetization with and without the external magnetic field, which in turn causes particle aggregation complications. Very small nanoparticles exhibit superparamagnetic properties, which are able to obtain a high degree of magnetization while being able to avoid the particle aggregation issue caused by remnant magnetization. Iron oxide is a common metal used for this purpose, which is usually used as magnetite, maghemite or a combination of the two, due to their high magnetization values between the different iron oxides. Iron oxide gives the impression of lacking remnant magnetization even though magnetite and maghemite are ferromagnetic due to thermal fluctuations, which mostly accounts for the internal interactions of the particles affecting energy densities. MTCs carry the drug molecules to the tumor site by either having them bound to the surface or by being enclosed within the magnetic vehicle, which can be referred to as the MTC-drug complex. Magnetic-targeted carriers possess unique intrinsic properties, developing magnetic polarization and magnetophoretic mobility once the external magnetic field and field gradient are applied. Selective application of the magnetic field gradient is applied to the target area, which in turn guides the MTC-drug complex to the desired location with a relatively high degree of accuracy, minimum surgical intervention and maximum dose. In order to be able to successfully deliver the drug at the desired tumor location, the magnetic vehicles are responsive to a specific tumor signal, which is commonly a temp- or pH-sensitive release due to the higher temperature and lower pH observed in tumor microenvironments, relative to the rest of the body. Site-specific targeting requirements Different requirements exist for magnetic nanoparticles involved in site- specific targeting, which are dependent on either physical or biological reasons. The nine different main requirements the magnetic-targeted carrier should possess are the following: 1) Sufficient magnetic moment to overcome drag and yield forces. 2) Superparamagnetism to prevent agglomeration and embolism. 3) Biocompatibility to prevent toxicity, enhance cell survival and reduce inflammatory responses. 4) Biodegradability to improve clearance from the body. 5) Capability to act as a carrier and exhibit controlled sustained release. 6) Structural stability to allow delivery of therapeutic agents after reaching target site. 7) Stealth and functional surface characteristics to prolong the circulation half-life, improve colloidal stability, prevent agglomerations and reduce toxicity. 8) Reproducible sizes and shapes for clinical applications 9) Reproducible and scalable methods to allow mass production. Clinical Applications The most common current clinical application involving a MTC-drug complex is the doxorubicin-magnetic targeted carrier complex, which is composed of a formulation of the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin and is bound to microscopic beads of activated carbon. Iron is used as the magnetic-targeted carrier. History Magnetic vehicles started being used for drug delivery purposes of chemotherapeutic agents around 1960‚Äì1970. MTCs composition has varied over the years and differed between in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Dr. Widder synthesized albumin microspheres in the 1970s encasing Adriamycin, a chemotherapeutic drug, and used magnetite as the susceptible magnetic component to the external magnetic field. One of the first in vivo experiments using magnetic vehicles performed in humans was done by John F. Alksne and his associates in the 1960s, using carbon-coated iron and applied an external magnetic field in order to occlude intracranial aneurysms, which was considered a successful therapeutic once the X-ray results were analyzed. Currently, magnetic nanoparticles, such as iron oxide, take advantage of their multimodality since they can integrate various functionalities, such as imaging agents, targeted-delivery and induce hyperthermia. In addition, iron oxide nanoparticles are being tested in emerging medical fields, such as multimodal imaging, theranostics and image- guided therapies.

Diagnosis  Inverted papillomas are definitively diagnosed by histologic examination. However, Magnetic Resonanace Imaging (MRI) may show a characteristic feature described as a Convoluted Cerebriform Pattern (CCP). A retrospective study published in the American Journal of Neuroradiology concluded that identification of CCP by MRI in a patient with a nasal tumor made the diagnosis of Inverted papilloma quite likely. The study reported the sensitivity and specificity to be 100% and 87% respectively. CCP can be associated with other malignant tumors as well.

This is the premiership flag flown the Carlton Football Club in 1907 for the premiership it won in the 1906 Grand Final. A pennant is a commemorative flag typically used to show support for a particular athletic team. Pennants have been historically used in all types of athletic levels: high school, collegiate, professional etc. Traditionally, pennants were made of felt and fashioned in the official colors of a particular team. Often graphics, usually the mascot symbol, as well as the team name were displayed on pennants. The images displayed on pennants were either stitched on with contrasting colored felt or had screen-printing. Today, vintage pennants with rare images or honoring special victories have become prized collectibles for sporting enthusiasts. While pennants are typically associated with athletic teams, pennants have also been made to honor institutions and vacation spots, often acting as souvenirs.  Pennants as trophies  In Major League Baseball, a pennant typically refers to such a flag flown specifically by the National League or American League championship team of a given season, or to such a championship itself. The last few weeks of the regular American professional baseball season are known as a pennant race. This is a holdover from the time (pre-1969) when the league championships were determined by the team with the best record at the end of the regular season. The pennant winners earn the right to play in MLB's title round, the World Series. Since 1969 the pennants are determined by the National and American League Championship Series playoffs, analogous to the NBA and NHL Conference Finals series and the NFL's NFC/AFC Championship Games. In Australian sports, the term flag is used in the same context. The pennant is waved around in the crowd to show support to the sport team they are cheering for.

Scholars suggest that the house was originally designed for Joshua Melson, the co-developer of Rock Crest-Rock Glen, in Mason City, Iowa. On that site was built one of a collection of homes designed by Wright's associate, Walter Burley Griffin.Architecture - Melson House Over time, the house went through at least two renovations. The first was a renovation by Prairie school architect William Drummond in 1922. In 1958, Frank Lloyd Wright undertook a second remodeling of the house, which brought the design forward so that as it stands, it is a blending of Wright's Prairie Style and his later Usonian architecture. The Isabel Roberts House is privately owned. It is a contributing property to the River Forest Historic District. Design thumb The Isabel Roberts house is sometimes credited as being the first split-level house. It also has features typical of Wright's mature Prairie style, including broad overhanging eaves, low hip roofs, continuous bands of windows which he called ‚Äúlight screens‚Äù, an emphatic water table, cruciform plan, large fireplace surrounded by Roman brick, built-in bookcases, stained woodwork, a tree growing through the roof, elimination of basement and attic space, and an overall emphasis on the horizontal line. Wright's Vosburgh House is similar in conception to the Isabel Roberts house. The living room boasts groupings of windows on three of the four main walls, some 1¬Ω stories high, and some clerestory; this provides a gracious feeling of light and airiness. Among the Isabel Roberts House's most appealing features is the balcony overlooking the tall living room, a design element Wright used here and elsewhere to create a sense of spaciousness in a small house. The Clients: Isabel Roberts and Mary Roberts Isabel Roberts (1871‚Äì1955) has been described by Wright scholars as Frank Lloyd Wright's secretary, bookkeeper or office manager.

The boat periodically passes a pair of docks arranged across from each other on either side of the river. If the boat moves to the upper dock, and explorer will run out of the jungle onto the boat. Stopping at the lower dock causes any explorers already on the ship walk back off to safety.

Dually, the figures are said to be perspective from a line if the points of intersection of corresponding lines all lie on one line. The proper setting for this concept is in projective geometry where there will be no special cases due to parallel lines since all lines meet. Although stated here for figures in a plane, the concept is easily extended to higher dimensions. Terminology The line which goes through the points where the figure's corresponding sides intersect is known as the axis of perspectivity, perspective axis, homology axis, or archaically, perspectrix. The figures are said to be perspective from this axis. The point at which the lines joining the corresponding vertices of the perspective figures intersect is called the center of perspectivity, perspective center, homology center, pole, or archaically perspector. The figures are said to be perspective from this center. Perspectivity If each of the perspective figures consists of all the points on a line (a range) then transformation of the points of one range to the other is called a central perspectivity. A dual transformation, taking all the lines through a point (a pencil) to another pencil by means of an axis of perspectivity is called an axial perspectivity. Triangles An important special case occurs when the figures are triangles. Two triangles that are perspective from a point are called a central couple and two triangles that are perspective from a line are called an axial couple. Notation Karl von Staudt introduced the notation ABC \\\\doublebarwedge abc to indicate that triangles ABC and abc are perspective.H. S. M. Coxeter (1942) Non-Euclidean Geometry, University of Toronto Press, reissued 1998 by Mathematical Association of America, . 21,2. Related theorems and configurations Desargues' theorem states that, a central couple of triangles is axial. The converse statement, an axial couple of triangles is central, is equivalent (either can be used to prove the other). Desargues' theorem can be proved in the real projective plane, and with suitable modifications for special cases, in the Euclidean plane. Projective planes in which this result can be proved are called Desarguesian planes. There are ten points associated with these two kinds of perspective: six on the two triangles, three on the axis of perspectivity, and one at the center of perspectivity. Dually, there are also ten lines associated with two perspective triangles: three sides of the triangles, three lines through the center of perspectivity, and the axis of perspectivity. These ten points and ten lines form an instance of the Desargues configuration. Two triply perspective triangles BbY and CcX If two triangles are a central couple in at least two different ways (with two different associations of corresponding vertices, and two different centers of perspectivity) then they are perspective in three ways. This is one of the equivalent forms of Pappus's (hexagon) theorem.

Products sold at Champs Sports include apparel, equipment, footwear, and accessories. As of June 2019, there were 540 store locations found throughout the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The stores are mainly located in shopping malls, and are on average. History =Early years= Champs Sports was acquired in the 1980s by the Woolworth Corporation, then a specialty store division of the F. W. Woolworth Company. It, along with Foot Locker, sold athletic merchandise, replacing the five and dime and department store concepts with the increasing specialty store concept. In 1997, the Woolworth Corporation acquired the mail-order catalogue athletic retailer Eastbay for approximately 146 million dollars. A few months later, on July 17, 1997, the F. W. Woolworth Company closed their remaining department stores. The surviving Woolworth Corporation changed its name to Venator Group, Inc., while continuing its focus on the specialty store idea. =21st Century= In 2000, after a decline in the market of sports apparel, Venator Group shuttered many of their stores, including 27 Champs Sports locations. This proved successful as high-end footwear grew in popularity. Marketing =Swag Magazine= With the first issue released on August 28, 2012, Swag Magazine is a quarterly online magazine focused on showing sports fans a different side of athletes and celebrities. Champs Sports partnered with many companies, including Under Armour, Adidas, and Nike, giving fans an interesting look on sports. The magazine features athlete interviews, athletic gear, and interactive videos. =Nike Yardline= On September 8, 2012, Champs Sports and Nike launched Nike Yardline, a store specializing in NFL apparel. The first store opened in the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, New Jersey. Champs Sports and Nike stated that they are looking to expand the concept in the future. Between January 5‚Äì6, 2013, a Nike Yardline location was also opened in South Beach, Miami Beach, Florida during BCS weekend. The store displayed college football apparel featuring participating bowl teams, including Alabama Crimson Tide and Notre Dame Fighting Irish. On June 19, 2013, Champs Sports and Nike launched their second mall-based location in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. Promoting the grand opening was Minnesota Vikings's running back Adrian Peterson, who signed autographs and released a new shoe style. =Sponsorships= From 2004 until June 18, 2012, Champs Sports sponsored the Florida Citrus Sports's annual college football bowl game. Each sponsorship is a four-year deal costing them $4.25 million. Vice president of Champs Sports Rob Brodersen commented, \\"As the premier mall destination for the core sports enthusiast, it is a natural fit for Champs Sports to continue our partnership with FCS. We are excited to strengthen our relationship and look forward to further success by building upon our athletic heritage with this high profile college bowl game.\\" Although the name of the bowl was changed, Champs Sports continued to remain an official partner of both the Russell Athletic Bowl and the Capital One Bowl through 2014. Controversies =Dispute with Nike= In late 2002, Nike placed restrictions on stores that sold their products. These restrictions required stores, including Foot Locker and its subsidiaries, to sell less popular lines of merchandise alongside the high-end products. Knowing the sale of these products could negatively impact profits, Foot Locker refused to sell any Nike products unless they received better quality products. Both Nike and Foot Locker suffered from the lack of sales. A negotiated agreement ended the dispute in late 2003, and Nike products were re-admitted to the stores.

McCord (December 18, 1916 - January 17, 2004) was an American radio and television announcer. Born in Colville, Washington, McCord moved to Spokane in the 1930s, where he began his broadcasting career. During World War II, he served as a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps, stationed in Riverside, California, and rose to the rank of First Lieutenant. For several years starting in the 1940s, he was based out of WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio, and announced on a few programs that aired on NBC, including The Circle Arrow Show. McCord joined the announcing staff of NBC in New York in the early 1950s. His radio announcing credits for the network included Easy Money, Monitor, and a 1956 episode of X Minus One. On television, McCord was one of several announcers, including Don Pardo, Bill Wendell, Roger Tuttle, Vic Roby and Wayne Howell, whose voice was heard on several NBC game shows. His most notable credits in that realm, in the 1950s, included Twenty One, Concentration, and Tic-Tac-Dough. In his later years with the network, up to his retirement in 1980, McCord's announcing work largely consisted of sub- announcing on NBC Nightly News and the one-minute NBC News Updates (as a frequent fill-in for regular announcer Bill Hanrahan), as well as occasional booth announcing duties for the local flagship station, WNBC-TV. McCord hosted shows like 30 Minutes in New York until he moved to California. Following his retirement, McCord moved to San Diego, California. He died there of complications from pneumonia at age 87. His son is rock musician Billy Vera.

Robbins' setting differs from the original version by Vaslav Nijinsky by placing the danseur in a ballet studio (a three wall set), lounging on the floor. A ballerina enters and they dance facing the audience as though looking into the mirrored wall of the studio. He kisses his partner on the cheek and she bourr√©es out of the studio and off-stage.

Marais is the longest serving head of any political party in Afrikaner history, with a term of 23 years. Early life and family history During the Second Boer War, Marais‚Äôs paternal grandmother was the leader of group of Boer women who for 18 months roamed about the western Transvaal and western Free State with their young children so as to avoid capture by British forces. His father, Jaap Sr., and paternal grandfather, Sarel Jacobus Stefanus, did active service on the Western front with the Bothaville commando. Both were made prisoner of war after Boer general Piet Cronj√©‚Äôs surrender at the Battle of Paardeberg. Father Jaap Sr. was sent to Broadbottom Camp at St. Helena, whilst grandfather Sarel was held het Green Point, after which he received \\"parole\\" due to illness. He died a month after the end of the war. Marais‚Äôs mother, together with her mother and siblings, was interned at the Klerksdorp concentration camp. Jaap Marais was one of nine children, six sons and two daughters, of whom one brother died in infancy. Marais grew up on the farm Maraisdeel (\\"Marais‚Äôs share\\") in the district of Vryburg. It originally formed part of the larger farm, Donkerpoort (\\"Dark port\\"), which belonged to grandfather Sarel. With his younger brother Jan he attended a local farm school, both using a donkey for transport. Marais matriculated in 1940 at Vryburg Ho√´rskool. With tensions simmering between Afrikaner nationalism and British nationalism during the Second World War, Marais and a number of his class mates organized a \\"strike\\" on 10 October 1940, on account of it being the birthday of former president and bastion of Boer independence, Paul Kruger. After school Marais enrolled at the Ho√´r Handelskool at Potchefstroom, where he received the National Diploma in 1942. Political life =Early years= Marais was active in Afrikaner nationalist politics from his twenties onwards. =Member of Parliament (1958-1969)= He was elected as a Member of Parliament for the ruling National Party in 1958 and served until 1969. The HNP was formed in 1969 by Albert Hertzog (son of former Prime Minister General JBM Hertzog) and a cabinet minister, Marais, and two other MPs, Louis Stofberg and Willie Marais. The founding of the party occurred three years after the assassination of Hendrik Verwoerd, when his successor BJ Vorster authorised the presence of MƒÅori players and spectators during the tour of New Zealand rugby union team in South Africa in 1970. Marais considered this measure as a concession under pressure that would result in other concessions until the whole political order in South Africa, at the time based on racial and cultural differentiation, separate group areas and white rule, had been dismantled. Jaap Marais was thrown out of the Broederbond shortly after the HNP was formed, and all other identified HNP members or sympathisers were also purged from the Broederbond. =Fighting against concession, and the founding of the Herstigte Nasionale Party (1969-1982)= The HNP found it difficult to make headway against the entrenched and relatively conservative ruling National Party in the 1970s. It succeeded in winning 18% of the vote in the white parliamentary elections of 1981. However, it did not gain any seats due to the electoral system, which was based on a Westminster system of electoral districts rather than a proportional system. Its electoral growth played a role in encouraging the breaking-away from the National Party in 1982 of the Conservative Party under Andries Treurnicht. =Fighting against reform and the dismantling of Apartheid (1982-1994)= Jaap Marais arch conservative arrives in a horse-drawn carriage at Church square, Pretoria. The two flags beside Marais are those of the former Boer republics of the Orange Free State (viewer's left) and Transvaal (viewer's right). Under the leadership of Marais, the HNP challenged the policy of the National Party to negotiate with the African National Congress and South African Communist Party. He tried in vain to obtain the co-operation of the CP. He proposed a Volksfront, being a coalition of all the right-wing organisations with one objective; to stop president FW De Klerk from handing over the reins of government to the African National Congress. Instead, in 1992, a Volksfront was created from the ranks of the Conservative Party, and after 1993 led by Constand Viljoen. In July 1993, in an open letter, Marais demanded a whites only election from president De Klerk. In the same letter, Marais put it to De Klerk that Afrikaners did not give De Klerk a mandate in the March 1992 referendum \\"for their downfall and suicide\\". Marais wrote to De Klerk that \\"hundreds of thousands of Afrikaners regarded De Klerk‚Äôs actions as treason, and are \\"disgusted by the fall of moral standards and political deceit which [De Klerk‚Äôs] regime represented\\". Marais was of the opinion that De Klerk would lose \\"every by- election in the run up to a general election\\" in which De Klerk and the National Party \\"would be smashed\\". In September 1993 Marais repeated his request, again by open letter. This time Marais accused De Klerk and his cronies of being \\"retarded (slow) communists\\", in the sense that they were handing concession after concession to the ANC/SACP alliance. Marais further rhetorically asked De Klerk: \\"How would a \\"hidden\\" communist South African head of state have acted differently than you have done since February 1990?\\" =Resistance in the New South Africa (1994-2000)= After the country‚Äôs first non-racial democratic elections on 27 April 1994, which constituted the birth of the new South Africa, Marais‚Äôs HNP maintained a policy of non-participation in the formal political and electoral system. Marais propagated the rhyming motto Kies Reg: Bly Weg!, which translates as \\"Decide/vote Correct: Stay Away!\\" In an email teeming with spelling errors, addressed to Oom Jaap niksdoen (\\"Uncle Jaap Do-nothing\\") Solidariteit‚Äôs Flip Buys, then at the Mine Worker‚Äôs Union, as the former was still known, accused Marais personally of slander and defamation against Bruwer, Hartzenberg and Viljoen, who Buys regarded as \\"men who sacrifices everything for their People\\". Buys further expressed his wish that Marais‚Äôs \\"role in the dismantling of our People\\" be \\"laid bare in court\\". Marais replied: \\"Your letter is an interesting experience. I have never before dealt with a case where a writer's level of ignorance is exceeded so clearly by the degree of his rudeness.\\"http://www.afrikanervolksparty.org/index.php/media/160-artikels/6167-solidariteit- en-die-afrikaner-se-vryheidstryd.html Today, the party still does not recognise the right of the African National Congress government to rule over Afrikaners in South Africa. The party also has not relinquished its claim to the previously white-dominated part of South Africa. It continues to encourage its supporters not to vote, as part of its policy of resistance. Jaap Marais claimed that it was the British and not the National Party of 1948 who had invented apartheid. \\"Is it asking too much of English-speaking South Africans to acknowledge this evident truth?\\" Marais, who up to his death held to Verwoerdian apartheid ideology, wrote in the \\"Sunday Independent.\\" Marais also demanded an apology from then UK prime minister Tony Blair for Britain's conduct during the Anglo Boer War of 1899-1902, when it had instituted concentration camps in which 27,000 Boer civilians perished (24,000 children and 3,000 women). Blair refused to do so. Private life Marais became engaged to Marie Rautenbach in 1957, and the two were married on 6 January 1959 in Patensie. They had two daughters, Marjori√© and Karina, and a son, Japie. Marais had an affinity for the work of Afrikaans poets N.P. van Wyk Louw and D.J. Opperman, as well as those of the Dutch and Flemish poets Marnix Gijsen, Henriette Roland Holst, Hendrik Marsman, and Martinus Nijhoff. His favourite English poetry was that of Roy Campbell, T.S. Elliot and John Keats, the latter of whom he described as \\"evergreen\\". During the 1950s, Marais translated William Shakespeare's Julius Caeser into Afrikaans. Marais was an avid breeder of budgerigars. Political views Marais exercised influence as a thinker in rightwing Afrikaner nationalist circles from the 1970s to the 1990s. His thinking was influenced by Hans Strijdom and Hendrik Verwoerd, two Afrikaner nationalist leaders and prime ministers of South Africa. He wrote a political biography of Hendrik Verwoerd and many political articles and booklets. In his writings and speeches, Marais often referred to Richard Weaver, C.J. Langenhoven, Tobie Muller, James Burnham, Alexis de Tocqueville, Edmund Burke, G.K. Chesterton, Alain de Benoist, Oswald Spengler, Arnold Toynbee, Ludwig von Mises, F.A. von Hayek and Ortega y Gasset. Marais considered identity, continuity, and freedom as the three key themes of Afrikaner nationalism. He emphasized that identity rested on each group's preference for its own. Such a group preference implied a related right among members of the group to differentiate and discriminate to exercise a group's preference. Among each people, according to Marais, there was a center of authority that determined who was included and excluded. In the case of Afrikaners, their centers of authority ensured that a racial preference for whites, the Afrikaans language, a distinctive Western culture, traditions and history had formed the Afrikaner identity in southern Africa. According to Marais, continuity depended on each generation maintaining what had been built up by previous generations and transferring it to the next generation. He emphasized Afrikaners' freedom struggle against foreign domination by British imperialism in the Anglo Boer War, but also against American or Soviet Russian forces during the Cold War or the greater numbers of various black ethnic peoples in South Africa. In his view, this freedom was linked to the fatherland of Afrikaners, which he defined as South Africa minus the Asian and Coloured group areas and the various black ethnic homelands.

It simulates an Old West fast draw duel between the player and the computer. Outlaw was a response to Gun Fight, released by Midway in North America the year before. In 1978, a port was released for the Atari Video Computer system (renamed to Atari 2600 in 1982). Technology The game is housed in a custom cabinet that includes a light gun. The game PCB is composed of discrete technology, with game sprites stored in ROM. Playfield graphics are provided by a screen overlay representing an Old West town street. Gameplay Players select one of two characters: Half-fast Pete or Billy- The-Kid. Pete is more accurate while Billy can draw faster. An outlaw appears somewhere in the town, the object being to fast draw your gun as soon as he draws his. Shooting him before he shoots you scores points, with points counting toward end-of-game ratings such as \\"Dude\\", \\"Greenhorn\\", and \\"Top Gun\\". Atari VCS port Outlaw on the Atari 2600 An enhanced home video game console port was developed for the Atari VCS by then-Atari employee David Crane and released in 1978. This version is more directly comparable to Midway's Gun Fight, allowing two players to engage in a shoot-out using Atari CX40 joysticks. There are multiple modes that differ slightly from the arcade game, including target practice and versions with obstacles that must be shot around or shot through. There is also a multiplayer mode in which two players fight against each other. =Reception= Eric Thompson reviewed the Atari 2600 port of Outlaw in The Space Gamer No. 34.

The rabbi, Dov Kofman, an affable man who walks with a cane, says when the ceremony is over: \\"I love Israel, my son is now there serving in the army, but this is my fatherland.\\" Suddenly a non-Jewish neighbor stops by to say hello, sitting down on one of the benches. An engineer by training, Yevgeni Stolbov oversaw the construction of most of Birobidzhan, and is now retired. \\"I love coming here, I would do anything to help this synagogue, it's part of my life and want to see it here forever,\\" he says as his friend, the rabbi, looks on with a smile.

Carbonate hardgrounds are surfaces of synsedimentarily cemented carbonate layers that have been exposed on the seafloor (Wilson and Palmer, 1992). A hardground is essentially, then, a lithified seafloor. Ancient hardgrounds are found in limestone sequences and distinguished from later-lithified sediments by evidence of exposure to normal marine waters. This evidence can consist of encrusting marine organisms (especially bryozoans, oysters, barnacles, cornulitids, hederelloids, microconchids and crinoids), borings of organisms produced through bioerosion, early marine calcite cements, or extensive surfaces mineralized by iron oxides or calcium phosphates (Palmer, 1982; Bodenbender et al., 1989; Vinn and Wilson, 2010; Vinn and Toom, 2015). Modern hardgrounds are usually detected by sounding in shallow water or through remote sensing techniques like side-scan radar. Cretaceous hardground from Texas with encrusting oysters and Gastrochaenolites borings. The scale bar is 1.0 cm. Carbonate hardgrounds often host a unique fauna and flora adapted to the hard surface. Organisms usually cement themselves to the substrate and live as sessile filter-feeders (Brett and Liddell, 1982). Some bore into the cemented carbonate to make protective domiciles (borings) for filter-feeding. Sometimes hardgrounds are undermined by currents which remove the soft sediment below them, producing shallow cavities and caves which host a cryptic fauna (Palmer and F√ºrsich, 1974). The evolution of hardground faunas can be traced through the Phanerozoic, from the Cambrian Period to today (Taylor and Wilson, 2003). Middle Jurassic hardground (Carmel Formation) with encrusting oysters and borings. Aragonite and calcite sea intervals are plotted on the time axis. Carbonate hardgrounds were most commonly formed during calcite sea intervals in Earth history, which were times of rapid precipitation of low-magnesium calcite and the dissolution of skeletal aragonite (Palmer and Wilson, 2004). The Ordovician-Silurian and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Systems have the most hardgrounds (sometimes hundreds in a single section) and the Permian-Triassic Systems have the least (usually none). This cyclicity in hardground formation is reflected in the evolution of hardground-dwelling communities. There are distinct differences between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic hardground communities: the former are dominated by thick calcitic bryozoans and echinoderms, the latter by oysters and deep bivalve (Gastrochaenolites) and sponge (Entobia) borings (Taylor and Wilson, 2003). Stratigraphers and sedimentologists often use hardgrounds as marker horizons and as indicators of sedimentary hiatuses and flooding events (F√ºrsich et al., 1981, 1992; Pope and Read, 1997). Hardgrounds and their faunas can also represent very specific depositional environments such as tidal channels (Wilson et al., 2005) and shallow marine carbonate ramps (Palmer and Palmer, 1977; Malpas et al., 2004) Image:Liberty Hardground 090114.jpgHardground in the Liberty Formation (Upper Ordovician) of southern Ohio.

The result was the EoN A.P.4 (more commonly called the Newbury Eon,Flight p497 a wooden four-seat monoplane with a fixed tricycle landing gear. The design had been carried out by Aviation and Engineering Products Ltd of Feltham, Middlesex. The prototype Eon 1 registered G-AKBC powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) Blackburn Cirrus Minor engine first flew at Welford, Berkshire, on 8 August 1947. After initial testing was completed, the prototype was modified to reflect the planned production version. The main changes were a new engine, a de Havilland Gipsy Major of 145 hp (108 kW), and a lengthened nose-wheel leg. The modified aircraft was redesignated the Eon 2. The company decided not enter production and it continued as a glider manufacturer. The sole completed Eon aircraft was used as a glider-tug to demonstrate the company's gliders. The aircraft met its end at Lympne airfield, Kent, on 14 April 1950, when, with a glider attached the pilot started the aircraft by swinging the propeller with the aircraft's wheels not secured by chocks. The engine started, and the craft moved forward; the pilotless aircraft and the glider were damaged as the aircraft passed through a boundary hedge. The glider pilot had also abandoned his cockpit when he realised what was happening.Philpott Air Pictorial December 1969, p. 457.

It must follow that the wood-offering should take ... The wood- offering comes before the blood rite, and the blood rite comes before the burning of the incense.\\"  In the Hebrew Bible  The sacred incense prescribed for use in the wilderness Tabernacle was made of costly materials that the congregation contributed (Exodus 25:1, 2, 6; 35:4, 5, 8, 27-29). The Book of Exodus describes the recipe: At the end of the Holy compartment of the tabernacle, next to the curtain dividing it off from the Most Holy, was located the incense altar (Exodus 30:1; 37:25; 40:5, 26, 27). According to the Books of Chronicles, there was also a similar incense altar in Solomon's temple in Jerusalem (1 Chronicles 28:18 and 2 Chronicles 2:4). Every morning and evening the sacred incense was burned (Ex 30:7, 8; 2 Chronicles 13:11). Once a year, on the Day of Atonement, coals from the altar were taken in a censer, or fire holder, together with two handfuls of incense, into the Holy of Holies, where the incense was made to smoke before the mercy seat of the ark of the testimony (Leviticus 16:12-13). The book of Exodus lists four components of the incense, while the Talmud lists seven additional components from the oral Torah. The four components from the book of Exodus are *stacte (◊†÷∏◊ò÷∏◊£ nataf) *onycha (◊©÷∞◊Å◊ó÷µ◊ú÷∂◊™ shekheleth) *galbanum (◊ó÷∂◊ú÷∞◊ë÷∞÷º◊†÷∏◊î khelbanah) *pure frankincense (◊ú÷∞◊ë◊ï÷π◊†÷∏◊î ◊ñ÷∏◊ö÷∞ levonah zach) The components are still being studied and are not determined with absolute certainty. Stacte is variously described as being the extract of the transparent portion of the myrrh resin which exudes spontaneously from the tree, or a balsam from a tree such as opobalsamum or a styrax. Onycha, which in Greek means ‚Äúnail,‚Äù is variously described as being the operculum from a shell found in the Red Sea (which are said to resemble a fingernail), the exudation from the rock rose bush called labdanum (both petals and markings which are said to resemble a fingernail), Styrax benzoin, bdellium, or even cloves. Galbanum is generally considered to be Ferula galbaniflua. Also considered is a milder variety from the Levant or possibly even a close relative of Ferula galbaniflua called narthex (or giant fennel). Pure frankincense is the resin of a tree of the boswellia species. In Hellenistic Judaism Josephus mentions the incense, numbering thirteen ingredients.Paul Heger The development of incense cult in Israel 1997 - Page 94 \\"This would imply that the incense was composed of only four elements, which would contradict the talmudic record that the incense had eleven ingredients, as well as Josephus' account of thirteen ingredients. In rabbinic literature  The rabbis of the Talmud expanded the description of the recipe for the incenses from 4 ingredients of the Hebrew Bible to 11 ingredients.Paul Heger The Development of Incense Cult in Israel 1997 - Page 94 \\"Hence it is likely that the composition which was narrated in the Talmud was based, in this case, not on a speculative tradition, but on the actual practice during the last part of the Second Temple period. The talmudic sages attempted to find support from Scripture for the actual custom.\\" as follows: According to the Talmud, the House of Avtinas was responsible for compounding the qetoret incense in the days of the Second Temple. In Christianity The New Testament makes several typological references to incense, including a Christological reference to the coals from the altar of incense taken behind the veil on the Day of Atonement (Hebrews 9:3-4), J. Carl Laney Answers to Tough Questions from Every Book of the Bible: 1997 \\"While the altar of incense stood in the Holy Place before the veil, its ritual use on the Day of Atonement was connected with the Holy of Holies. The high priest would take coals from the altar of incense to burn incense within the Holy of Holies \\" and a reference to the prayers of believers as incense (Revelation 5:8).James E Smith The Pentateuch - 2006 Page 243 \\"Typology is the study of these foreglimpses of Christ and the Christian age. Persons, places, objects and even events can be typical of New Testament realities. ... The incense altar points to the prayers of the saints of God (Rev 8:3-4).\\" In later Christian typology the smoke of incense in the tabernacle typically signifies offered prayer.Evangelical Dictionary of Theology Walter A. Elwell - 2001- Page 49 \\"The smoke of incense arising and filling the tabernacle signified offered prayer\\". This was developed in medieval Christian art.Leslie Ross Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary - 1996 Page 253 \\"TYPOLOGY The elders carry harps and golden vessels of incense which are described as containing the prayers of *saints.\\" In the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and a considerable part of the Anglican Church incense is still used in liturgical rites as well as in some popular devotions outside of church liturgies.

Meteorological history  On August 17, an area of circulation within the monsoon trough located in the Philippine Sea became more organized and the JTWC issued a TCFA. The developing cyclone slowly moved to the northwest, becoming Tropical Depression 16W nine hours after the TCFA was first issued. As the cyclone continued to intensify, it became Tropical Storm Sam on August 19. Around this time, the subtropical ridge to Sam's north shifted its track in a westwards direction towards Luzon. The storm passed over the north of the island on August 20 and entered the South China Sea reaching typhoon strength the next day. Sam gradually intensified further as it approached the Chinese coast and it made landfall about to the northeast of Hong Kong at its peak with 140 km/h (85 mph) winds on August 22. Sam continued to move to the northwest over China dissipating about 24 hours later. PAGASA named the developing storm Luding shortly before the JTWC began to issue advisories.  Impact  Typhoon Sam was responsible for seven deaths in the Philippines. In addition, flooding from its rainfall displaced over 4000 people, and many major roads were closed due to landslides near Baguio. Sam became the wettest tropical cyclone to affect Hong Kong since records began in 1884, dropping over 616 mm (24.2 inches) of rain, exceeding the previous record set in 1926. Peak sustained winds of 96 km/h (60 mph) were recorded on Waglan Island as the typhoon passed over the territory. The heavy rain led to many instances of flooding and over 150 landslides throughout Hong Kong, killing 1 person and forcing the evacuation of about 1,000. A total of 328 people were injured in various incidents relating to the storm, and total losses in Hong Kong totaled to approximately $17 million. In addition to the direct casualties from the storm, China Airlines Flight 642, using an MD-11 aircraft, crashed while attempting to land at Hong Kong International Airport, killing three on board and injuring 219. At the time of the crash wind gusts in excess of 65 km/h (40 mph) were recorded at the airport. After moving into China, Sam killed at least 17 and injured 100 people in Guangdong. Direct economic losses in the province were about $18 million.

Born in Swan River, Manitoba to Douglas MacLennan and Sigri√∞ur Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, he received a BSA from the University of Manitoba in 1959 and a DSc (hc) in 2001. He received MS (1961) and PhD (1963) degrees from Purdue University under Harry Beevers, and was then a Postdoctoral Fellow (1963-1964) under David E. Green and an Assistant Professor (1964-1968) at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In 1969, he was appointed Associate Professor in the Banting and Best Department of Medical Research and, later, Professor (1974), Chair (1978-1990), J. W. Billes Professor of Medical Research (1987-2007) and University Professor (1993-2015). MacLennan made fundamental contributions to our understanding of the mechanism of ion transport by SR calcium pumps, the storage of calcium in the SR by acidic lumenal proteins and the release of calcium from the SR by calcium release channels. He led teams that defined the genetic basis for the human skeletal muscle diseases, malignant hyperthermia, central core disease and Brody disease and was part of the team that demonstrated that mutations in phospholamban, a regulator of the calcium pump, can cause cardiomyopathy. His identification of a calcium release channel mutation that causes porcine stress syndrome resulted in a diagnostic test that has decreased the incidence of the disease dramatically, with substantial economic benefits to the swine industry.

Irish Script on Screen. is a medieval Irish vellum manuscript containing Middle Irish and Hiberno-Latin writings. The manuscript is held in the library of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, where it is catalogued as RIA MS 23 P 16 or 1230. It was most probably compiled by Murchadh (Riabhach) √ì Cuindlis of Ballaghdacker, at Duniry between the years 1408 and 1411. Duniry ‚Äî D√∫n Daighre, D√∫n Doighre ‚Äî in eastern Clanricarde (now east County Galway) is situated south-east of the town of Loughrea, and in the medieval era was home to a branch of the bardic Clann Mac Aodhag√°in (the MacEgans), who served as brehons for the O'Connors of Clanricarde. History In the 16th century, the manuscript was in the possession of the Mac Egans of Duniry, hence the older title Leabhar M√≥r D√∫na Doighre. In 1629, the manuscript was held in the convent of Kinalehin, County Galway. It was consulted by M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh, brother of the Four Masters, who copied pp. 272‚Äì7. The book passed into the possession of √âamon √ì Ceallaigh (Co. Roscommon) in 1732, then of Dr. John O'Brien by 1768 and finally of Cornelius O'Daly (Mitchelstown, Co. Cork). The Royal Irish Academy acquired the first volume in 1789, when General Charles Vallancey purchased it for the academy for 3 guineas from Cornelius O'Daly. O'Daly also owned the second volume, which comprises nine leaves, but was unaware that it belonged to the larger volume. In 1789, this volume was acquired by Chevalier O'Gorman, by George Smith of College Green in the next century and by the Academy sometime after 1844. The manuscript is held in the Academy's library in Dublin to this day.Irish Script on Screen. Description The manuscript is of a large size, measuring 40.5 cm x 28 cm, which makes it the largest Irish vellum manuscript to have been written by a single scribe.Royal Irish Academy, \\"Leabhar Breac\\" It contains 40 folios, which are written in double columns. Capitals are decorated in a simple style, with some letters having been interwoven with zoomorphic patterns and coloured in red, vermilion, yellow and blue. There are two drawings, a flower-like diagram on p. 121 and a drawing of the Crucifixion on p. 166.See the images at ISOS. Contents The manuscript consists almost entirely of religious writings in Latin and Middle Irish. It includes homiletic Lives of Saint Patrick, Saint Columba, Saint Brigid, Saint Cellach, and Saint Martin, the earliest version of F√©lire √ìengusso (\\"Martyrology of √ìengus\\"), the Rule of the C√©li D√©, Aislinge Meic Con Glinne (\\"The Vision of Mac Conglinne\\"), a version of F√≠s Adamn√°in (\\"The Vision of Adamn√°n\\"), Saltair na Rann, Stair Nicomeid (\\"Gospel of Nicodemus\\"), Amra Choluim Chille, a Marian litany, and various ecclesiastical legends, hymns, catecheses and homilies.

Glosses and notes The numerous notes which Murchadh √ì Cuindlis jotted into the margins afford us a unique glimpse of the circumstances of the writing process. These range from everyday details like a cat straying about or a robin singing in a beautiful voice to a nearby pillage in Lorrha by a certain Murchad Ua Madag√°in. A persistent object of complaint for the writer is the weather, in particular the cold.O'Neill, \\"Leabhar Breac.\\" Based on the notes, Tom√°s √ì Concheanainn has been able to reconstruct the time span in which certain sections had been written. For instance, it took the scribe about 6 weeks to write 35 pages (pp. 141‚Äì75), while some parts proved more challenging, such as a column for a poem with interlinear glosses, which cost him a day.

Seashell resonance refers to a popular folk myth that the sound of the ocean may be heard through seashells, particularly conch shells. This effect is similarly observed in any resonant cavity, such as an empty cup or a hand clasped to the ear. The resonant sounds are created from ambient noise in the surrounding environment by the processes of reverberation and (acoustic) amplification within the cavity of the shell. The ocean-like quality of seashell resonance is due in part to the similarity between airflow and ocean movement sounds. The association of seashells with the ocean likely plays a further role. Resonators attenuate or emphasize some ambient noise frequencies in the environment, including airflow within the resonator and sound originating from the body, such as bloodflow and muscle movement. These sounds are normally discarded by the auditory cortex; however, they become more obvious when louder external sounds are filtered out. This occlusion effect occurs with seashells and other resonators such as circumaural headphones, raising the acoustic impedance to external sounds.

Astonishman blamed himself for the state of the world due to his involvement in the Green Event (see below). He possessed super strength, super hearing, flight, and invulnerability. Astonishman drew energy from the Earth's core. When his skin was broken, he leaked the very energy that granted him his powers. Upon his death, the energy vacated his body in a blast of nuclear proportions. He died from grievous injuries sustained at the hands (and hammer) of Thor. *Soldier American (Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Winters) ‚Äì Active since the 1930s, Soldier American participated in a government program that gave him the speed and strength of ten men. He also has the ability to create energy machetes. During a raid on a food facility, he killed his longtime sidekick, The Devil Boy, while possessed by the villain Scarecrow Sinister. *Blur Girl (Rebecca Watts) ‚Äì Blur is the fastest human left alive. She is Astonishman's goddaughter and is in a romantic relationship with The Blue Gauntlet. *The Blue Gauntlet (Palmira) ‚Äì Described by writer Rick Remender as \\"a pacifist powered by an ancient alien parasite,\\" Palmira is in a lesbian relationship with Rebecca. Her powers seem to be mainly energy-based. She can also fly. Though she has fought valiantly by the sides of the rest of the End League, Mother Hive will not confide in her as she does the rest of the team due in great part to the fact that she has mental blocks that prevent Mother Hive from accessing her mind telepathically. *Mother Hive ‚Äì Mother Hive is a powerful telepath who coordinates the team's missions from the safety of the Citadel of Seclusion. *The Arachnakid ‚Äì A young (15 years old) and extremely tall and lithe adventurer with two pairs of arms, sharp teeth, and an acerbic wit used to hide his loneliness and self-pity. He seems to be in love with Blur Girl. *The Prairie Ghost ‚Äì Deemed by writer Rick Remender a \\"living poltergeist,\\" the Prairie Ghost's powers and personality have yet to be fully revealed. He possesses a strong, ghostly steed (CrowBait) and wields mystical chains as weaponry. He speaks with a Southern accent and seems to be of a rather bellicose mentality. He, like Codename Black, does not seem to have any compunctions regarding using lethal force when necessary. *Brother Occult ‚Äì Called the \\"mysterious Master of the Nether Realms,\\" this mage's power seems to be derived mainly from the bargains he makes with various demons, such as one known as Azul. Azul is supposedly bound in servitude to Brother Occult. *Divinity ‚Äì A self-described \\"god-killer,\\" Divinity is one of the \\"big three,\\" a subgroup comprising the leadership of The End League. The other members are Codename Black and Astonishman. Divinity wields a powerful sword that can both wound and heal (as evidenced by its temporary restoration of Thor's mental capacity, post-lobotomy). The series hints at strong sexual/romantic tension between her and Astonishman. It is hinted that she also played a part in the Green Event, as she was supposed to be Earth's protector when the event happened. There is also mention of her having killed Thor, a fact that only she and her father Zeus know about. *Codename Black (Zane Ladle) ‚Äì A mysterious non-Magnificent\\"Magnificent\\" needs to be defined by someone with knowledge of the series. clad in an impressive suit of armor and revealed to have extensive knowledge of martial arts, as well as near-perfect skills in planning. He also seemingly shows little to no hesitance when it comes to the use of lethal force (as seen in issue #2). According to a conversation with his nemesis, the Smiling Man, Black's family all received powers during the Green Event. They subsequently went mad and became super villains. This further stoked the flames of Codename Black's paranoia regarding all Magnificents. Soldier American openly described him as a \\"schizophrenic.\\" *Grimwood ‚Äì Described by writer Rick Remender as a \\"spirit-man made of Earth stuff,\\" Grimwood is an enormous humanoid with an extremely easygoing demeanor. He also seems to be the most philosophical of the remaining Magnificents, and does his best to keep his friends optimistic. He has something of a father-son relationship with Arachnakid, and is relentless in his desire to protect his friends and the remaining innocents on Earth after the Green Event. =Adversaries= *Thor ‚Äì The Norse God of Thunder and son of Odin, Thor disobeyed his father's orders, refusing to return to Valhalla, instead staying on Earth to help mankind. He is mysteriously absent and presumed dead on the day of the Green Event. It is hinted that he and Astonishman are at around the same level in terms of sheer power; Astonishman's monologue in issue #1 supports the theory that the two titans were friends at some point. Thor arrives at the end of issue #1, lobotomized by and completely under the control of Dead Lexington. He beats Astonishman to death between moments of lucidity brought about by Divinity's sword. *Charles \\"Dead\\" Lexington ‚Äì Archenemy of Astonishman, Dead Lexington was responsible for tricking Astonishman into triggering the Green Event. Following \\"The Day of Annihilation\\" (an event in which most of the world's superheroes died, see Plot Synopsis below), Dead Lexington appointed himself ruler of the world. In exchange for power, he made a deal with a demon called Nargor'ri the Ravager, offering the demon all the nations of the world except for his city, New Lexington. *Scarecrow Sinister ‚Äì Capable of possessing others, Scarecrow Sinister operates a food facility for Dead Lexington in the remains of northern Canada and seems to have the ability to possess the bodies and minds of others, turning them into puppets to follow his will. While Scarecrow Sinister was possessing Prairie Ghost to kill Soldier American, Blur Girl killed the villain by throwing his body out of a building. *The Smiling Man ‚Äì A clown-like villain inhabiting a trap-filled amusement park in the city of Lore, formerly known as Los Angeles. Easily the most unhinged villain, he openly acknowledges the homoerotic undertones of his relationship with Codename Black. He evidently keeps a \\"stable of wives\\" with whom he regularly seems to have sex with. He is also related to Codename Black, but not a member of the Family Fear. *Wolfsangel ‚Äì A brutal Nazi warlord with seemingly reptilian characteristics. He plans to overthrow Dead Lexington by using the hammer of Thor and the clones of dead superheroes. He conducts his experiments in his city, called the Berlin Dome. *Minister of Matter (Peter Ladle) ‚Äì Member of the Family Fear, Dead Lexington's most trusted associate, and one of Codename Black's brothers. He joined forces with Wolfsangel and other villains to overthrow Dead Lexington. *Sonic Eel (Jen Ladle) ‚Äì Member of the Family Fear and Codename Black's sister. *Azul ‚Äì A demon once forced to serve Brother Occult. It has become a herald to Nargor'ri. *Nargor'ri the Ravager ‚Äì An inter-dimensional demon whose sole purpose is to end all life for mortals and gods. It has already killed all the Norse gods in Asgard and is moving on to Olympus and Earth. Magnificents During the Green Event, Astonishman uses his super-hearing to determine which city needs his help the most. While doing so he overhears survivors of the Green Event gaining and using their powers for the first time. Most of these survivors become selfish and corrupt, looking only for ways to exploit their new-found abilities for any type of monetary gain. The majority of the Magnificents live in \\"Dead\\" Lexington's city (New York), but the few heroes that survive live with Astonishman in his Citadel of Seclusion in Australia, now a snow-covered wasteland. Plot In May 1962, the superhero Astonishman triggers a worldwide cataclysm known as the Green Event. His archenemy, the villain Dead Lexington, leads Astonishman to believe that an alien ship at the bottom of the ocean is a Communist nuclear facility. Astonishman detonates a nuclear missile in the ship, which explodes the alien power core, releasing a wave of radiation and knocking the Earth off its axis. The resulting radiation kills three billion people, with one in ten thousand of the survivors later developing superhuman abilities. Astonishman's responsibility for the Green Event is a fact of which only he and Dead Lexington are aware. The Norse god Thor is the sole remaining classical god on Earth. Believed to be the only being whose power equaled Astonishman's, Thor goes missing on the day of the Green Event and is believed dead. In reality, he is slain by Divinity using her father's (Zeus) sword (God Killer) . Only Divinity and Zeus know of this. Selecting the most noble of the super-humans, Astonishman forms the Squadron of Righteousness. Its mission is to repair the damage done to the planet and to protect humanity against the other super-humans who have become super-villains. Eventually, the super-villains join forces and eliminate the world's superheroes in an event known as the Day of Annihilation. Astonishman and the surviving superheroes escape to his Citadel of Seclusion located in Australia, which has turned into a frozen wasteland. There, they remain hidden for twelve years. Known as The End League, the heroes spend that time focusing on survival and searching for the hammer of Thor, Mj√∂llnir, which they believe can save the world. On the twelfth anniversary of the Day of Annihilation, the starving members of The End League plan a raid on Scarecrow Sinister's food facility in northern Canada. Astonishman gathers a strike team consisting of himself, Soldier American, Prairie Ghost, Divinity, Brother Occult, and the rookie Blur Girl. When they arrive, Brother Occult's demon servant, Azul, attacks the team and betrays them to Dead Lexington. Dead Lexington appears via remote monitor, gloating that he knows the location of the Citadel of Seclusion and would be attacking it shortly. As Blur Girl runs off to warn the team, she is stopped by a now-lobotomized Thor, who stands ready to kill his former allies. The brain-damaged Thor and The End League battle. Blur Girl and Soldier American are quickly incapacitated. Astonishman is initially paralyzed by doubts about his team's ability to defeat Thor, but ends up joining in the fight. Divinity temporarily restores Thor's lucidity with her sword. Thor warns Astonishman that a greater danger threatens Earth and then tells Astonishman that he must kill him. When Thor loses his mind once again, Astonishman is still reluctant to kill him. Thor strikes a mortal blow against Astonishman with Mjolnir by piercing the armor that holds in Astonishman's energy. The energy released from Astonishman's body explodes, apparently killing both men. Mjolnir is undamaged and recovered by an unknown figure who may possibly be Lexington. Lexington proclaims Astonishman's death to the public and moves to consolidate his power. He sends his agents to abduct Kelly Klein, the leader of an underground church and Astonishman's wife. Promising Astonishman that he would protect her, Codename Black battles the agents, even going so far as to utilize a lethal, throat-crushing maneuver against his sister Sonic Eel to stop her from using her powers. Unfortunately, he fails to stop them from capturing Klein. In the Nether Realm, Azul gloats to the captive Brother Occult and tells him that while Lexington freed the demon, Azul himself serves a greater power known as Nargor'ri the Ravager. Nargor'ri appears in the final scene of Book 1 with a promise to \\"end all.\\" In Book 2, we see a familiar- looking boy dressed in Nazi attire in 1941. He is brought to Wolfsangel and trained to kill Jewish prisoners. He is among a group of other children, each of whom appear to have been experimented on, and possesses super powers. When one of the children, a girl named Elsa refuses to kill the Jewish prisoners, Wolfsangel murders her. The execution of the Jewish captives is interrupted by Astonishman and a group of soldiers known as the Flying 33rd. The young man seen at the beginning of the book can form light daggers and possesses telekinesis. He seizes Astonishman's shield and uses it to kill all of the Nazis except Wolfsangel, who teleports away. The reader is led to believe that the boy is the future Soldier American. After this incident, Astonishman never uses his shield again. More to come...

Microsoft claimed to have the fastest Java implementation for Windows, although IBM also made that claim in 1999 and beat the Microsoft and Sun virtual machines in the JavaWorld Volano test. =Antitrust trial= Microsoft's proprietary extensions to Java were used as evidence in the United States v. Microsoft Corp. antitrust civil actions. A Memorandum of the United States in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction in the case of United States of America vs. Microsoft claimed that Microsoft wanted to kill Java in the marketplace. > In short, Microsoft feared and sought to impede the development of network > effects that cross-platform technology like Netscape Navigator and Java > might enjoy and use to challenge Microsoft's monopoly. Another internal > Microsoft document indicates that the plan was not simply to blunt > Java/browser cross-platform momentum, but to destroy the cross-platform > threat entirely, with the \\"Strategic Objective\\" described as to \\"Kill cross- > platform Java by grow[ing] the polluted Java market.\\"Memorandum of the > United States in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction UNITED STATES > OF AMERICA v. MICROSOFT CORPORATION, May 18, 1998 =Sun vs. Microsoft= In October 1997, Sun Microsystems, the creator of Java, sued Microsoft for incompletely implementing the Java 1.1 standard. In January 2001, Sun and Microsoft settled the suit. Microsoft paid Sun $20 million and the two agreed to a plan for Microsoft to phase out products that included the older version of Microsoft Java that allegedly infringed on Sun's Java copyrights and trademarks. *Office XP Developer *Office 2000 Developer *Office 2000 Premium Service Release 1 *Microsoft BackOffice Server 2000 *Internet Security and Acceleration Server (ISA) 2000 *Internet Explorer 5.5 *Visual Studio 6 Microsoft Developer Edition *Windows 98 and Windows ME The Microsoft Java Virtual Machine was discontinued in 2003 in response to the Sun Microsystems lawsuit. Microsoft continued to offer support until December 31, 2007. =Windows XP= The initial release of Windows XP in 2001 did not ship with a Java virtual machine, because of the settlement with Sun. The settlement required people who wanted to run Java Applets in Internet Explorer to download and install either the standard Sun Java virtual machine, or to download a copy of the Microsoft Java virtual machine. Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on September 9, 2002. It contained post-RTM security fixes and hot-fixes, compatibility updates, optional .NET Framework support, and enabled technologies for new devices such as Tablet PCs. It also included the Microsoft Java virtual machine. On February 3, 2003, Microsoft re-released Service Pack 1 (SP1) as Service Pack 1a (SP1a). This release removed Microsoft's Java virtual machine in compliance with the lawsuit with Sun Microsystems. See also *Visual J++ References External links *Modern support of Java at Microsoft .

The unit was formed in 1985 by the consolidation of two inactive units. The 399th Bombardment Group was activated in March 1943 and served as an Operational Training Unit, then as a Replacement Training Unit until it was disbanded in March 1944 when the Army Air Forces reorganized its training and support units in the United States. The 589th Tactical Missile Group was a TM-61 Matador training unit, which served in Florida from 1957 through 1958. History =Bombardment training= B-24 Liberator as flown by the group The wing's first predecessor was the 399th Bombardment Group, which was activated at Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona on 1 March 1943, but made two moves the following month, arriving at Wendover Field, Utah on 27 April. The group was composed of the 604th, 605th, 606th, and 607th Bombardment Squadrons. At Wendover, it served as an Operational Training Unit (OTU) for Consolidated B-24 Liberator units until August.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 285 The OTU program involved the use of an oversized parent unit to provide cadres to \\"satellite groups\\".Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi The group became a Replacement Training Unit (RTU). Like OTUs, RTUs were oversize units, however their mission was to train individual pilots and aircrews. Following this mission change, the 399th was reassigned from Second Air Force to Fourth Air Force, then moved to March Field, California in December. However, the Army Air Forces was finding that standard military units like the 399th, which were assigned personnel and equipment based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were not proving well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit, which was manned and equipped based on the station's requirements.Goss, p. 75 The 399th Group was disbanded, and along with its elements and supporting units at March was used to form the 420th AAF Base Unit (Bombardment Replacement Training Unit-Heavy).See Mueller, p. 370 (showing simultaneous disbanding and organization of units). =Missile training= The second predecessor of the wing was the 589th Tactical Missile Group, which was activated at Orlando Air Force Base, Florida on 8 March 1957 as a training unit for the TM-61 Matador cruise missile. The group formed part of the 4504th Tactical Missile Wing. In April 1958, the group's missile squadron, the 24th Tactical Missile Squadron was transferred to the 588th Tactical Missile Group, when the 588th's 17th Tactical Missile Squadron deployed to Taiwan independently and plans were developed to deploy the 588th to Osan Air Base, South Korea. Although the 24th engaged in crew training at Orlando, it never received any missiles. The squadron did, however, deploy to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, where it launched TM-61 Matador missiles under the guidance of the 6555th Guided Missile Squadron. The group was then inactivated on 8 June 58, when its training functions were assigned directly to the 4504th Wing's 4504th Missile Training Squadron. The 399th Bombardment Group was reconstituted in July 1985 and consolidated with the 589th Tactical Missile Group as the 399th Tactical Missile Wing, but has not been active since.Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 648q, 31 July 1985, Subject: Reconstitution, Redesignation, and Consolidation of Selected Air Force Organizations Lineage ; 399th Bombardment Group * Constituted as 399th Bombardment Group (Heavy) on 15 February 1943 : Activated on 1 March 1943 : Disbanded on 31 March 1944 * Reconstituted and consolidated with the 589th Tactical Missile Group as the 399th Tactical Missile Wing on 31 July 1985 ; 399th Tactical Missile Wing * Constituted as the 589th Tactical Missile Group on 9 November 1956 : Activated on 8 March 1957 : Inactivated on 8 June 1958 * Consolidated with the 399th Bombardment Group as the 399th Tactical Missile Wing on 31 July 1985 =Assignments= * II Bomber Command, 1 March 1943 * Second Air Force, 6 October 1943 * IV Bomber Command, 3 December 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1944 * 4504 Tactical Missile Wing, 8 March 1957 ‚Äì 8 June 1958 =Components= * 24th Tactical Missile Squadron: 15 March 1957 ‚Äì 25 April 1958 * 589th Support Squadron: 15 March 1957 ‚Äì 8 June 1958 * 604th Bombardment Squadron: 1 March 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1944Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 682 * 605th Bombardment Squadron: 1 March 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1944 * 606th Bombardment Squadron: 1 March 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1944 * 607th Bombardment Squadron: 1 March 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1944 =Stations= * Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona, 1 March 1943 * Gowen Field, Idaho 10 April 1943 * Wendover Field, Utah, 27 April 1943 * March Field, California, 3 December 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1944Station information through 1944 in Maurer, Combat Units, p. 285 * Orlando Air Force Base, Florida, 8 March 1957 ‚Äì 8 June 1958 =Aircraft and missiles= * Consolidated B-24 Liberator, 1943‚Äì1944 * Martin TM-61 Matador, 1957‚Äì1958 References =Notes= =Bibliography= * *:  * Category:Military units and formations established in 1985 Category:Missile wings of the United States Air Force Category:1985 establishments in the United States ","title":"399th Tactical Missile Wing"},{"id":"14910358","text":"James Patrick Aylward (September 10, 1885 - July 22, 1982) was a Missouri attorney, Democratic party leader, and a political associate of President Harry S. Truman. Early life James Patrick Aylward was born in Peoria, Illinois on September 10, 1885 to Irish Catholic immigrants. When he was about six months old, his family relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, where his twelve brothers and sisters were born. He left school after fifth grade and began to take on a variety of jobs: newspaper carrier, Western Union delivery boy, office boy. Legal career In 1899, he came to work for a prominent Kansas City attorney, Frank P. Walsh. Walsh inspired Aylward's interest in both the law and in Democratic politics.See, James R. Fuchs, \\"Oral History Interview with James P. Aylward\\" June 12, 1968. Oral History of Aylward Available Online at Truman Presidential Library He began the study of law in that law office, and eventually went to night school at the Kansas City School of Law (now the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City School of Law), where he joined the Phi Alpha Delta law fraternity. He was admitted to the bar in 1908, and became partners with longtime mentor Frank Walsh. He continued his involvement in Missouri politics as well as in the Phi Alpha Delta national organization, and lectured on insurance law at the Kansas City School of Law. Democratic politics From 1918 to 1936, he served as chair of the Jackson County Democratic committee. In 1934, Democratic boss Tom Pendergast asked him to run for U.S. Senator; he declined, and recommended county judge Harry S. Truman instead. When Truman became a candidate, Aylward served as his campaign manager, helping him win the Democratic primary and the general election. Success on the Truman campaign helped Aylward take over as state chair of the Missouri Democratic Party from 1934 to 1940 and serve as a member of Democratic National Committee for Missouri from 1934-1944. In 1936, he had the honor of seconding the nomination for Franklin D. Roosevelt at the 1936 Democratic National Convention. Death and legacy Aylward died in Kansas City, and is buried in Calvary Cemetery there. His son, James P. Aylward, Jr. (1918-2011) was also prominent in Missouri Democratic politics, serving as Jackson County Tax Collector and as Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1972.

He served as the chief of General Independent Administration of Anti Corruption since January 2007. As anti-corruption chief Wasifi leads an 84-person staff. Part of their responsibility is addressing Afghanistan's problems with opium. Early life Wasifi is reported to have been a childhood friend of the President Hamid Karzai. His father, Azizullah Wasifi, was the Minister of Agriculture under King Mohammed Zahir Shah. He belongs to the Alakozai tribe of Pashtun group. Wasifi earned a degree from the Punjab Agricultural University in India. Life in the United States Wasifi's family left Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in 1979. They lived in Pakistan for a short time and around 1983 immigrated to the United States. Wasifi's first job in there was working as a waiter in a restaurant in Maryland, which happens to be owned by Qayum Karzai, Hamid Karzai's brother. Drug conviction Wasifi served three years and eight months in a prison after a drug conviction in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1987. He acknowledged the conviction, but disputed the circumstances. According to the Associated Press a: \\"...review of criminal records in Nevada and California revealed that the 48-year-old Wasifi was arrested at Caesars Palace on July 15, 1987, for selling 650 grams (23 ounces) of heroin.\\" The Associated Press reported that he had tried to sell 650 grams of heroin to and undercover detective for $65,000. The drugs had a street value of US$2 million. His ex-wife, Fereshteh Behbahani, who now works for California Environmental Protection Agency and lives in Los Angeles, was sentenced to three years' probation. Wasifi acknowledged that he was arrested on July 15, 1987, his 29th birthday. According to his account he and his wife were on their honeymoon. According to his account his wife had purchased some cocaine in the hotel bar‚Äîan amount for personal use, and the pair were arrested when she returned to their hotel room. Wasifi suggested that his drug use was a youthful indiscretion that should mar his later political career than the youthful drug use of United States President George W. Bush. The appeal Wasifi filed with the Parole Board offered a third account. In his appeal American drug enforcement officials agreed to release Wasif and Behbahani, without charge, if they lead them to higher-level drug dealers. USA Today reported: Wasifi told his Parole Board he could not find his original dealer and that he: \\"...did not know anyone in the drug underworld.\\" He further said he was unaware that he had been indicted in September 1987, two months after his initial arrest and release, and had not been attempting to flee when they were arrested for \\"unlawful flight\\" in March 1988. He and his wife Behbahani were arrested for \\"unlawful flight\\". Pizza franchise owner Between 1994 and 1999 Wasifi and his brother Bashir owned a franchise of Ameci Pizza & Pasta. Return to Afghanistan Wasifi returned to Afghanistan in 2001, following the Taliban's ouster. Governor of Farah Province Karzai appointed Wasifi the Governor of Farah Province. Accounts from Western officials generally agree that his leadership was ineffective. He made no real efforts to control Afghanistan's poppy harvest in his province. Appointment to head the General Independent Administration of Anti Corruption Karzai appointed Wasifi to head the General Independent Administration of Anti Corruption in March 2007. The appointment raised some controversy, because of the twenty-year-old US drug conviction.

An area of is a nature reserve managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. Bowdown Woods Nature Reserve lies between Greenham Common and the River Kennet The site is an area of ancient woodland lying on the scarp slope north of Greenham Common, close to the eastern edge of Newbury, most of which is a Nature Reserve open to the public. Nature Reserve It has a diverse range of tree species, an 'exceptionally rich woodland ground flora' and a diverse fauna, notably birds, reptiles, dragonflies and butterflies. The Nature Reserve is open to the public and has three car parks, all accessed from Bury's Bank Road, between Greenham and Thatcham. The three access points relate to the three areas of the reserve, each of which has its own history. =Baynes Wood= Baynes Wood (itself comprising Great Wood and Parklodge Gully) is at the south-eastern end of the reserve, and may have been part of Chamberhouse Park. It is shown as woodland on 16th century maps, and was probably coppiced until 1798 when the Tull family bought it. It remained in their family until 1939 when Baynes timber Co acquired it, and promptly felled a considerable proportion of the trees. Following natural regeneration, a further spate of felling occurred in 1981. A re-apraisal of its management at this point enabled the BBOWT to initially rent and then buy the wood, since which it has been managed as a nature reserve.Reading and District Natural History Society report No 37, 1985, p.14-19 =Bowdown Wood= Bowdown Wood is at the opposite end of the reserve, and the first that is known of this woodland is that it was bought by the Dorner family in 1920. They then sold it to the BBOWT in 1984. It is more heavily dissected than the Baynes woods, with a number of valleys cutting through it. Although there is little flowing water there are large areas of permanently waterlogged ground. =Old Bomb Site= Between these two woodlands is the rather more prosaically named Old Bomb Site, which was used by the military during and after World War 2, in conjunction with RAF Greenham Common. This too was acquired by BBOWT, and is now a mozaic of heathland, acid grassland, scrub and woodland. The former ammunition stores are still there, in a decayed state, and the rubble provides good habitats for reptiles. This section is also still criss-crossed by a network of concrete paths built for military purposes, but now providing all- weather paths and good access to the site for less mobile visitors.pdf link for Wildlife Trust Leaflet on Bowdown Woods Nature Reserve accessed 19/Oct/2011 West Berkshire Living Landscape The woods are within the area of the West Berkshire Living Landscape, an initiative headed by the Wildlife Trust to link up areas and 'islands' of rich wildlife to create landscape- scale interlinked habitats.West Berkshire Living Landscape page accessed 19/Oct/2011 In addition to Bowdown and Chamberhouse Woods SSSI, this includes Greenham Common SSSI, the River Kennet and Thatcham Reedbeds SSSI and the areas linking them together, forming a 27 square kilometre area 'for people and wildlife to thrive side by side'.

Career and research =Positions held= After completing his PhD, Stark held appointments as a research sociologist at the Survey Research Center and at the Center for the Study of Law and Society. After teaching as Professor of Sociology and of Comparative Religion at the University of Washington for 32 years, Stark moved to Baylor University in 2004, where he is co-director of the Institute for Studies of Religion. He is an advocate of the application of the rational choice theory in the sociology of religion, which he calls the theory of religious economy. = Stark‚ÄìBainbridge theory of religion = During the late 1970s and 1980s, Stark worked with William Sims Bainbridge on the Stark‚ÄìBainbridge theory of religion,Andr√© Nauta, \\"Stark, Rodney\\", Encyclopedia of Religion and Society, 1998. and co-wrote the books The Future of Religion (1985) and A Theory of Religion (1987) with Bainbridge. Nowadays their theory, which aims to explain religious involvement in terms of rewards and compensators, is seen as a precursor of the more explicit recourse to economic principles in the study of religion as later developed by Laurence Iannaccone and others.David Lehmann, \\"Rational Choice and the Sociology of Religion\\", in Bryan S. Turner (ed.), The New Blackwell Companion to the Sociology of Religion, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, pp. 181‚Äì200. =Criticism of secularization theories= Stark has been one of the most vocal critics of theories of secularization. In 1999, he published an article entitled ‚ÄúSecularization, R.I.P.‚ÄùStark, Rodney, ‚ÄúSecularization, R.I.P.‚Äù, Sociology of Religion, vol. 60, 1999, pp. 249‚Äì273. that became both famous and controversial.Gon√ßalves, Arnaldo M., ‚ÄúWhy Is Stark Wrong on His Criticism of the Secularization Theory?‚Äù, SSRN, January 29, 2016. He expanded his theory in subsequent works, claiming that statistical data does not support the theory of a decline of religion in modern societies. Although it is true that the forms and practices of religion change, the idea of a decline called ‚Äúsecularization,‚Äù Stark argued, derives from faulty quantitative analysis and ideological preconceptions. Zieli≈Ñska, Katarzyna, ‚ÄúConcepts of religion in debates on secularisation‚Äù, Approaching Religion,vol. 3, no. 1, 2013, pp. 25‚Äì35. = On the growth of Christianity = Stark has proposed in The Rise of Christianity that Christianity grew through gradual individual conversions via social networks of family, friends and colleagues. His main contribution, by comparing documented evidence of Christianity's spread in the Roman Empire with the history of the LDS church in the 19th and 20th centuries, was to illustrate that a sustained and continuous growth could lead to huge growth within 200 years. This use of exponential growth as a driver to explain the growth of the church without the need for mass conversions (deemed necessary by historians until then) is now widely accepted. Stark has suggested that Christianity grew because it treated women better than pagan religions. He also suggested that making Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire weakened the faithfulness of the Christian community by bringing in people who did not really believe or had a weaker belief. This is consistent with Stark's published observations of contemporary religious movements, where once- successful faith movements gradually decline in fervor due to the free rider problem. = Criticism of anti-Catholicism = While not a Roman Catholic himself, Stark believes that Anti-Catholicism is still a dominant force in the American media and the academia. Particularly in his book Bearing False Witness (2016), he has argued that an anti-Catholic prejudice has poisoned the historical debate on the Crusades, the Inquisition and the relations of Pope Pius XII with Nazism, creating an ‚Äúanti-Catholic history‚Äù that is at odds with contemporary academic research, yet is still taught in schools and promoted by mainline media.CORKERY, Ann, ‚ÄúA Baptist Scholar Debunks Anti-Catholic Historical Hogwash‚Äù, ‚Äò‚ÄôNational Review, July 25, 2016. = On the theory of evolution = In 2004 The American Enterprise, an online publication of the American Enterprise Institute, published an article by Stark, \\"Facts, Fable and Darwin,\\" critical of the stifling of debate on evolution. Stark criticized the \\"Darwinian Crusade\\" and their \\"tactic of claiming that the only choice is between Darwin and Bible literalism.\\" Though not a creationist himself, he believes that though \\"the theory of evolution is regarded as the invincible challenge to all religious claims, it is taken for granted among the leading biological scientists that the origin of species has yet to be explained.\\" He suggests that governments \\"lift the requirement that high school texts enshrine Darwin's failed attempt as an eternal truth.\\"Rodney Stark, \\"Fact, Fable, and Darwin\\", The American Enterprise, September 2004. Personal religious faith In their 1987 book A Theory of Religion, Stark and Bainbridge describe themselves as \\"personally incapable of religious faith\\".Lehmann, p. 183. While reluctant to discuss his own religious views, he stated in a 2004 interview that he was not a man of faith, but also not an atheist.Stark , JKNIRP, The National Institute for the Renewal of the Priesthood, 2004. In a 2007 interview, after accepting an appointment at Baylor University, Stark indicated that his self-understanding had changed and that he could now be described as an \\"independent Christian.\\" In this interview Stark recollects that he has \\"always been a ‚Äúcultural‚Äù Christian\\" understood by him as having \\"been strongly committed to Western Civilization.\\" Of his previous positions he wrote: \\"I was never an atheist, but I probably could have been best described as an agnostic.\\"\\"A Christmas conversation with Rodney Stark\\".

Also listed are their original NTV voice actors (1973), followed by their TV Asahi voice actors (1979~2005; 2005~). Part of the 22nd century characters are listed in The Doraemons. Note: In some translations of Doraemon, the names of these characters are different from the original names. Main characters Fujiko's friends say that every main character represents elementary school student archetypes Fujiko noticed in his own school days. Nobita appears in every episode of the anime, while Doraemon appears in most episodes, sometimes being substituted (for medical checkup or on leave) by his sister, Dorami. =Doraemon= : Yellow (born on 3 September 2112, Virgo) is the title character and main protagonist of the series. He is a turquoise cat-like robot created for Nobita from the future. But people often mistake him for a raccoon dog and he becomes angry as seen in many episodes. He is sent to the as blueprint, and is sent back in time by Sewashi (Nobita's Great-great-grandson) to aid Nobita, since Sewashi learned from his parents that Nobita suffered much in his life and wanted to help him. Doraemon possesses a 4-dimensional pocket from which he can acquire various kinds of futuristic tools, gadgets, and playthings from a future department store. He also has the tendency to panic during emergencies, characterized by him frantically trying to pull out a very much-needed tool from his pocket, only to produce a huge assortment of household items and unwanted gadgets. Still, Doraemon is very friendly and intelligent, not to mention long-suffering because of Nobita's antics. Since Sewashi sent Doraemon to the past, Doraemon has been living as the unofficial fourth member of Nobita's family and acts like a second son to Nobita's parents, since despite being a robot, he requires basic needs for a person, such as eating, and also sleeps in the closet of Nobita's bedroom. Doraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed. At first, he was predominantly blue, with a blue tail, a white stomach, and flesh-coloured hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail ‚Äî the appearance most identify him with today. In \\"The Doraemons\\" story arc (and the 2112: The Birth of Doraemon short film), it is revealed that Doraemon's original paint color was yellow. After getting his ears gnawed off by a robot mouse at the 22nd century Nobi's residence, he slipped into depression on top of a tower, where he erroneously drank a potion labeled \\"sadness\\". As he wept, the yellow color washed off and his voice changed due to the potion. As a result, he developed a morbid fear of mice despite being a robotic cat, and he is now suffering from musophobia. One can turn Doraemon off by pulling his balloon tail. Doraemon is considered a substandard product because many of his robotic features (i.e. radar whiskers and cat-calling bell) malfunctioned after production due to an accident in the factory while he was being built. Due to this malfunction, Doraemon did not do well at the robot's school and during the final presentation show, he performed badly and nobody wanted to hire him, until baby Sewashi pushed the button. His parents were a bit reluctant, but since Sewashi liked him, they hired Doraemon, and he took care of him until Sewashi himself sent him to the past to take care of Nobita. Despite this, Doraemon shows a lot of intelligence and common sense. Whenever he hangs out with his friend Mii-Chan (a cute street cat), he calls it 'important and busy work' as excuses for not doing work when Nobita or his mother ask him to do something when he will be going out with Mii. Doraemon's favourite food is (known as \\"fudgy pudgy pie\\" in the English version of the manga, \\"yummy buns\\" in the English, and \\"dora-cakes/bean jam buns\\" in other versions), a Japanese treat filled with red bean paste. While it might explain the origin of his name, it was revealed in one of the manga chapters that his name originates from the Japanese word for \\"stray cat\\", and the ending which is part of traditional Japanese names, as seen also in, for example, Ishikawa Goemon. Doraemon is also appeared in Perman series as Mitsuo's friend. =Nobita Nobi= (born on 7 August, Leo) is a fifth grader, the only child of his parents. He wears glasses, a red or yellow polo shirt with a white collar, and blue or black shorts. Nobita is usually foolish, uncoordinated, lazy, dimwitted, weak, frail, childish and bad at sports, and is often described as a 'pervert'. He dislikes books and possesses basic scientific knowledge, being unable to understand concepts such as the definition of an eclipse. He envies Dekisugi, who is good at everything and admired by Shizuka. He often takes any chance to get a nap and favors gadgets that give him extra time or do work for him, and is thus known as 'The Lazy King'. Whenever he possesses Doraemon's gadgets, he shows them off to Shizuka but not to Suneo and Gian. Nobita's typical day consists of arriving late to school, falling asleep during class, scoring zero (0%) (F's in the English dub) on his tests, getting scolded by his teacher, being teased by his classmates Gian and Suneo, falling in the curbside rain gutters, getting chased by dogs after mistakenly stepping on their tails, getting grounded by his mother for not completing his homework, and being bullied by all his friends except Shizuka who remembers Nobita's kind heart and cares for him. He is scared by almost everything, particularly ghosts, and is a cry-baby (a running gag in the show is Nobita crying and asking for Doraemon to bring out his gadgets, mostly at the beginning of the episode). He dislikes going on outdoor activities with his interest being afternoon naps and reading comics, usually right after school. In fact, these are probably his only true hobbies; for example, one story features Nobita falling asleep in three seconds just by closing his eyes, while in others he chooses sleep over important events, such as watching the first sunrise on New Year's Day. The only things stopping him from staying at home all the time, other than experimenting with Doraemon's gadgets, are Gian and Suneo coercing him into participate in baseball games, and being forced by Doraemon or his parents to do so. Even though Nobita has many flaws, he is kind-hearted, emotional, honest, occasionally hard-working (such as when he gets into a wager with his friends) and sometimes courageous (for example, when Shizuka is in danger). He has risked his life to help save others, or even entire civilizations in full-length stories. And despite being shown to be academically poor, the reason behind it is principally his laziness, and he has secured good marks when incited to do so in some episodes, proving his credentials. Nobita can be very serious and responsible at times, such as when he cares for pets. Though he is weak at most things, he does have some strengths. For example, he has excellent marksmanship which rivals (or even surpasses) Dora the Kid. He can also weave excellent string figures, and is a fairly good comic book critic, owing to the huge amount of time he spends reading them. Nobita is also very creative when it comes to utilizing Doraemon's gadgets. For example, in one episode, he finds a way to profitably use a gadget called the Broadcasting mirror for advertising, even when Doraemon himself couldn't think of any use for it. =Shizuka Minamoto= (born on 8 May, Taurus), nicknamed is a smart, kind and pretty girl. She is often represented by the colour pink, and is seen wearing a pink shirt and skirt. The word 'Shizuka („Åó„Åö„Åã)' means 'Quiet'. She is Nobita's best friend and he has a crush on her. She does not shun Nobita due to his failing grades, lazy disposition or constant failures. In fact, she often tries to encourage him to do better, though she usually fails to convince him. Shizuka likes to take a bath several times a day; however, a running gag in the series is that she is sometimes interrupted by sudden appearance of Nobita, Gian, or Suneo, usually due to misuse of Doraemon's gadgets like the Anywhere Door (Doko Demo Doa in Japanese). Shizuka's skirt is also frequently seen getting flipped, either by Nobita misusing Doraemon's gadgets, or by the wind. Scenes in which her underwear is seen, or she is seen bathing, have been removed from the dubbed versions, especially in India. Her true passions are sweet potatoes, which she would rather keep to herself out of the knowledge of others, and the violin, in which her playing is even more horrendous than Gian's singing. She is also known for taking piano lessons unwillingly due to her mother's wishes (as she loves violin more), which is sometimes a reason for declining to hang out with friends (but she plays piano better than violin). Shizuka is an animal lover and keeps two pets at home: a dog, who is saved from succumbing to illness by Nobita and Doraemon in one story; and a canary which runs away on multiple occasions and causing Shizuka and Nobita to run around the city chasing her down. Due to Nobita's heartiest effort and Doraemon's assistance, Shizuka marries Nobita in the future. At present, she does not have any particular crush (but Shizuka secretly loves Nobita very much). Sometimes she fancies some handsome idols on TV. Besides Nobita, Shizuka is also close to her classmate and popular student Dekisugi which makes Nobita jealous. Though they consider each other only as friends, Nobita often tries to prevent them from going together. =Takeshi \\"Gian\\" Goda= (born on 15 June, Gemini), usually known by the nickname , is a strong and quick-tempered local bully. He also frequently steals other children's stuff (especially Suneo's) under the pretext of \\"borrowing\\" them, unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his horrible singing voice, though he considers himself a great singer. To prove this, Gian sometimes \\"invites\\" others to attend his concerts, under the threat of beatings. His singing is so horrible that, once, Nobita and Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, his writings of the song lyrics in a board end up having the same effect as when they hear them. In some films, his singing is enhanced to become an effective weapon (as in 'Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas'). In some episodes when his voice is recorded and he hears it, he instantly denies it being his voice and threatens to beat up the person who sang his songs in a very bad way (which is an irony). Gian is also confident in cooking, but just like his singing, his hand-made food can be a nightmare for other people very easily. However, Gian does not hesitate to help his friends when they are in real trouble. Throughout the series, particularly the films, he is often the one who voices the most concern and refuses to look away when there is a problem, an opposite of Suneo's cowardice. While he is described by others as daunting and intimidating, he is very sensitive and prone to crying when something touching happens, and he actually values his friends highly, a feeling which his friends sometimes reciprocate. Gian also has a soft spot for his younger sister, Jaiko, and usually tries to prevent her from trouble, even if she can perfectly handle her situation. His catchphrase is =Suneo Honekawa= (born on 28 February, Pisces) is the fox- faced (inherited from his mother) rich child who loves to flaunt his material wealth before everyone, especially Nobita. A lot of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or pet which evokes Nobita's envy. He is often seen with Gian, teasing Nobita. He sometimes despises Nobita and often makes fun of him, most often resulting in Nobita getting into trouble. He also often pushes Nobita aside with silly excuses while he invites Gian and Shizuka to his parties or resorts. However, he is actually one of Nobita's closest friends, who would often ask for his and Doraemon's help. In the films, Suneo is often the one most reluctant to take part in Nobita and Doraemon's adventures, and he also tries to face as little trouble as possible and go home, unless others convince him, making him somewhat a coward. He has an extensive knowledge of science, and is a talented artist and designer, besides being extremely cunning. In some scenes, Suneo is seen as a narcissist who loves to stare at himself in the mirror while telling himself that he is the most handsome guy in the world. His habit of bragging often lands him into trouble. Suneo is also very self-conscious about his height, being the shortest kid in his class. He likes steak and melon. There are many reasons why Suneo chooses Shizuka and Gian, except Nobita. It is because he tries to win Shizuka's favour and not to get harmed by Gian. =Dorami= (born on 2 December 2114, Sagittarius) is Doraemon's younger sister. Like Doraemon before he developed a fear of mice, she is yellow-skinned and has ears that resemble a large red bow. She and Doraemon are siblings due to the fact that they shared half of the oil from a can. Dorami lives in the 22nd-century Tokyo with Sewashi. She sometimes visits Nobita with a time machine when Doraemon is \\"off-duty\\", to help Doraemon with something or to take care of Nobita when Doraemon has gone for his yearly health checkup. Dorami likes melonpan and is afraid of cockroaches like Nobita's mom. She is also shown to be a more advanced robot than Doraemon (Dorami is able to produce 10,000 horse power, in comparison to Doraemon's 129.3). Different from her malfunctioning brother, she is the smartest student during her school time, and has better skills in using gadgets. In a story, Nobita is intent on replacing Doraemon with Dorami due to her better skills; however, he quickly learns the fact that Dorami does not understand him as much as Doraemon does and will not tolerate his usual antics. Dorami also has her own spin-off manga. In the manga series The Doraemons, she is the love interest of Dora-the-Kid, Doraemon's friendly rival and the one most similar to him. Allegedly, she was originally pink, but turned yellow after drinking a potion labeled \\"Jealousy\\". =Mini-Doras= , Kim Seo-yeong (2016-2017, Korean) are one of the gadgets of Doraemon. They are mini-versions of Doraemon with different color variation such as red, green and yellow variations. They can think and feel for themselves, and communicate with Doraemon through the \\"Mini-Dora\\" language (consisting of words like Dorara and speaking with gibberish accent). They act as helpers for all sorts of tasks, such as repairing the internal mechanism of Doraemon. Nobi family = / Tammy Nobi = : : Young :: Tamako Nobi (born on 16 February, Aquarius) is Nobita's bespectacled, stay-at-home mother and one of the main protagonists in short stories, and the one Nobita inherits his appearance from. She can be very strict where she is often seen scolding Nobita for his actions, beating him, grounding him, or sending him out of the house (a typical Japanese household punishment used by parents). Several episodes involve Nobita trying to avoid his mother's scolding by using Doraemon's gadgets. Despite her disappointment with Nobita's lazy attitude and academic failures (even when her house is occasionally visited by Nobita's teacher for his progress in school), she is actually a good mother and cares about her son deeply. Her maiden last name is revealed to be . She has a tendency of stopping Nobita from going out to play and forcing him to study. However on cold weather days, she always urges Nobita to go out and play to Nobita's intense displeasure. Her anxiety about the high household expenses is a recurring feature. In a couple of episodes where Nobita sees her in the past, it is revealed that she was rebellious even as a girl. She has an extreme dislike of animals and would always reject requests for any pet Nobita wants; this becomes a plot point in some of the films and stories where Nobita has to take in stray animals secretly. However in one story, her initial dislike of a cat turns her into adoring it so much that she becomes depressed when the cat's owner wants it back. In Mother vs. Rich Mother battle, she eats the Rival-making steak by accident; making her rivals with Suneo's mother. During the onion-cutting scene where she and Suneo's mother battle for who makes the tastiest curry, her glasses help defend her eyes so that she will avoid crying from the onion's scent spreading into the eyes. Shizuka („Åó„Åö„Åã) is also a member of Nobi family because she married Nobita. = / Toby Nobi = : Adult: : Young: :: Nobisuke (born on 12 March, Pisces), is Nobita's father and laid- back salaryman. He appears an easy-going father, often seen arriving home from work to soothe Tamako's anger towards Nobita. He has trouble quitting smoking and is self-conscious about his inability to pass the driving test. He also has a poor memory, is a borderline alcoholic, and sometimes arrives home drunk from nightly business meetings. Nobisuke often goes to golf which most Japanese businessmen and employees play. He had many similar personality traits with Nobita when he was young like getting bad grades, being poor at athletics, and getting scolded by his father. He has an impressive talent for painting, but did not choose to be an artist due to many reasons. Nobisuke is fond of Nobita and probably does not rebuke him like Tamako does because most of Nobita's inabilities and weaknesses remind him of his own childhood faults. Though he would makes comments or conversations that affect Nobita considerably in one way or another. It was shown that he met Tamako on the day he had rejected an offer to be an artist from a wealthy gentleman, and feeling overjoyed, was running down the street at such speed that he barged straight into her, causing her to drop her ID card. This he latter returns and the acquaintance gradually turns into love and marriage. = / Chester Nobi = : :: Nobisuke's younger brother and an uncle of Nobita, with whom he is very friendly. He works overseas and only comes home during the Christmas-New Year holiday, which Nobita happily awaits every year since his uncle always gives him (and Doraemon) pocket money and presents on that time. He has a noticeably tanned skin due to his frequent stays in the tropics. In one chapter, he recounts on his many animal encounters, including an elephant which he thought had perished during World War II. The elephant is actually saved by Nobita and Doraemon due to a case of predestination paradox. = = : :: Nobirou's daughter and Nobita's younger cousin. She is fond of Nobita and would play with him whenever she visits his house. = = : :: Tamako's younger brother and Nobita's uncle. He is a timid car salesman, and this timidness prevented him from expressing his feelings to the woman he loves. Nobita and Doraemon, despite initially deteriorating matters, finally help him to propose to (and be accepted by) the lady. = = :Voiced by: Megumi Hayashibara :: Nobisuke's father and Nobita's paternal grandfather who died before Nobita's birth. He was very strict and very rude to Nobisuke since he valued physical strength and athleticism which Nobisuke lacked, though after all he loved him very much. He did not apparently favour Nobisuke's artistic prowess, but he really treasured the portrait his son had made of him, and for which Nobisuke got first prize in school. His grandson only saw him when he traveled to the past. Despite being harsh to Nobisuke, he enjoys indulging Nobita when Nobita travels to the past. = = : :: Nobisuke's mother and Nobita's paternal grandmother who is only referred to as by Nobita. She died when Nobita was in kindergarten before the main storyline. She is always seen as a kind woman, if a bit eccentric, and unlike her husband never scolded Nobisuke for his lack of interest in \\"masculine activities\\", such as getting in a fight. Nobita remembers her very fondly, with most of his better childhood memories being playing with her; many of his toys, including his old kendama, which becomes a plot point in one film, were given to him by his grandmother. When Nobita travels to the past, she always recognizes him as her grandson even if he has grown up. She appeared in a few episodes. She takes care of Nobita on his former days and in one of The Doraemons manga, she was proud to see Nobita grown up into a teenage boy. = / Soby Nobi = : :: Nobita's great-great- grandson, he is the one who sends Doraemon back to the past to look after Nobita. Sewashi first bought Doraemon in 2112 when Doraemon still had ears and his original factory paint. He sent him because his pocket money was not much due to the debts the family inherited from Nobita, and he also wanted to help out his troubled great-grandfather. He seems to have more common sense and is smarter than Nobita, but is just as reluctant when it comes to studying. Sewashi is also the owner of Doraemon's sister, Dorami. = = : :: Nobita and Shizuka's son, named after Nobita's father. Though being as stupid as his father, he is a strong child and a good athlete, and brave enough to bully Gian and Suneo's sons. The first time he met the present Nobita, he even beat up Nobita because he regarded him as an imposter. His real name is Nobita Nobi, Jr., but his parents often call him Nobisuke due to his grandfather's name. Minamoto family = = : :: Shizuka's mother. She is very kind, but can also be quite exigent on Shizuka sometimes. She wants Shizuka to take up piano lessons when the latter would rather want to practise violin. = = : :: Shizuka's father, a normal salaryman who often goes to movies with Shizuka. His best-known appearance in the series is when Nobita and Doraemon eavesdrop on him talking to Shizuka the night before Nobita and her wedding, in which he trusts that Nobita will be able to take care of Shizuka. So he accepts Nobita as his daughter's spouse. He is the only parent of Nobita's friends who is named. = / Sunny = : :: Shizuka's lovely pet canary. It is yellow in color and sings sweetly. Peeko (Pii-chan) escapes from the cage very often as a way of freedom. Rescuing Peeko is the plot of many episodes. Honekawa family = = : :: She sports curly hair and shares the fox-like face with her son and husband. She loves Suneo very much and spoils him rotten. She is generous to Suneo's friends, but just like her son, she likes to show off her jewellery or branded handbags and sometimes makes Nobita's mother jealous. In the episode \\"Mother Vs. Rich Mother Battle,\\" she became Tamako's rival after eating the Rival-Making steak and competes Tamako of who makes the tastiest curry. In the 30 years special, she is seen as just as odd, and mischievous as her son. When she is introduced in the \\"Saobody\\" special, she is seen as someone who is very sexually active, and enticed. She has a thriving relationship with Suneo's father. She strives to be a spoiling, enticing grandmother to young Nala. When Nala is outside with her, she often laughs throwing her head back. She then smiles a cunning smile, calling Nala her \\"best friend\\", much like her son. She and her husband love to travel, and have night eiichi. = = : :: A successful businessman. He has many relationships with business elites as a part of Suneo's showing off. He appears less frequently than his wife, mostly when going tours with family or inviting Suneo's friends to his party. In the 30 years special, he is said to be mischievous as well. = = : :: Suneo's younger brother who lives in New York City with his uncle (who is single and raised him like a son). He has a good personality and a great respect for his older brother, but only because of Suneo's arrogant brags and lies in their correspondence. He often whispers to Suneo about Hana. Regarding her as a sweet lovely girl. = / Stan = : :: Suneo's college age cousin. He is an expert in radio-controlled toys. He often takes Suneo and his friends on picnics and hikes. :: In the closed captioning of Vacuum Cleaner Super Car, his Japanese name appears after the transformation of a driving school. It might be an error.[Stan (offscreen):] \\"[Sunekichi] Cool! It looks a real racing circuit!\\" = = : :: Suneo's great grandmother uses old wives' tales to impart values and good habits to Suneo, much to his displeasure. = / Lizzie = : :: Suneo's pet cat. She is a persian cat often praised very much by Suneo's mother. Her face is also like the rest of Honekawa family. Goda family = = : :: She is the owner of a small but successful store \\"Goda Greengrocers\\" (\\"Goda's Goods\\" in the English anime) as well as the only character Gian is deathly afraid of. In the 1973 anime, Mrs. Goda was dead. In later anime projects, she is alive. Gian always tries to flee from her when she orders him to help in the matters of the store or do deliveries. Though being as strong as her son, she is a righteous person as she punishes her son whenever he bullies children as she doesn't want to let Gian hurt other children. Her harsh treatment towards Gian is driven by her love, and Gian too, though sometimes speaking ill of her, cares for his mother deeply. This is evident from the way Gian had painstakingly made a rice-cake, actually a gadget from Doraemon, which had healed his mother's health problem, despite being constantly mocked and annoyed during the process by Nobita and Suneo. Had he lost focus, the gadget would have lost effectiveness, but his love for his mother prevented him from losing concentration. = = : :: He mostly works outside to help his wife's store. Though being the parent who is the least recurring in Fujiko's story, he is known to be the strongest man in the town that he lives in. He is somewhat like Gian and would often flaunt his strength with others including Nobisuke Nobi who is just as weak as his son. He has mixed feelings for Gian where he would like and care him and occasionally would scold him for doing bad deeds. = = : :: is Gian's younger sister, and also the only child Gian treats well in the whole story, and Jaiko too loves her elder brother. In earlier stories, she had bad tempers when something did not go as she pleases, though she mellows down in later stories. Had Doraemon not intervened, she would have been Nobita's wife in the future which is why her first appearance is earlier than Suneo and Gian in the series. However, Doraemon succeeds on his mission and Nobita eventually marries Shizuka. Her name Jaiko is usually considered a nickname in the same vein as her brother; her given name is never revealed in the series. As an aspiring manga artist, Jaiko goes by her pen name , and sometimes submits her manga to publishing companies for prizes. She usually fails because her storytelling is still rough, although she has received much attention from editors. Sometimes when she almost decides to give up writing comic books after failing to get good ideas, Gian and his friends, after being requested and sometimes forced, cheer her up. Unlike Gian, she is kind, polite and good at studies. She and Moteo Mote are good friends. He appreciates her cartoons and encourages her to write more. = / Pork Chop = : :: Gian and Jaiko's cowardly pet dog, who was a little stray dog when he was adopted by the Godas. Muku tries to be as brave as Gian, who praises his strength and courage, but in many emergencies he just runs away and enrages Gian. Initially Gian tried to get rid of him, but after he saved Gian, he has warmed up to him and become really friendly. Jaiko loves Muku very much and takes him on walks regularly. Muku occasionally shows the bad habit of gathering things from the locality in his kennel, much to Gian's embarrassment and his mother's displeasure. = = : :: Gian's maternal uncle. He is a black belt in judo and uses this ability to help other people. He taught Gian to use his strength in helping the weak. He also began teaching his nephew judo. Other characters = = : Young: : Adult: :: is Nobita's classmate and friendly rival as he is a good friend of Shizuka's. He is very intelligent and has a photographic memory. Dekisugi is the perfect all-round student, consistently getting 100s in class (A+'s in English Dub) and also being highly capable in sports. His family is apparently wealthy, owning a house that is so large that one can lose one's way. His name literally means \\"brilliant over-achiever\\", and his last name is a pun on dekisugiru (Âá∫Êù•ÈÅé„Åé„Çã), which means \\"over achieving\\". Shizuka sometimes prefers the company of Dekisugi, who is more of her intellectual equal. Nobita often feels jealous and concocts bizarre schemes (helped by Doraemon's gadgets) to keep them apart or to win Shizuka's attention. However, Dekisugi never gets angry at Nobita and even willingly helps Nobita whenever he has philosophical or scientific questions. Dekisugi is polite, respectful, and will never argue with or fault anyone even in the most ridiculous of situations ‚Äì instead he will always say something positive to lighten the mood. In the future, it is shown that in spite of Shizuka's friendship with Dekisugi, she still marries Nobita while Dekisugi himself is wed to another woman. The Dekisugi family becomes a very close associate of the Nobi family with the families' children being friends with each other. = / Mr. S = : :: is a strict unnamed teacher at Nobita's school who often scolds Nobita for not completing his homework, arriving late at school, forgetting his homework, falling asleep during class, and getting zero marks on his tests. He sometimes tries to encourage Nobita through kindness to study and get good marks, and sometimes resorts to punishments that range from making Nobita stand in the hallway or clean the classroom alone after school. While Teacher is impressed by Dekisugi's progress and occasionally scolds Gian, Suneo tends to fool Teacher with conning lies or superstitions. Teacher often pays unexpected visits to the Nobi's in order to inform Tamako Nobi about Nobita's recent exam results and his academic position. Nobita's feelings towards him are varied ranging from fear to respect and admiration depending on the situation. Teacher's real name is unknown. In the NTV anime, his name is given as '. In the TV Asahi version, he was once named , whose family name happens to mean \\"teacher\\" but is read differently. In the English dub, he is called Mr S. = / Mr. Rumbleton = : :: Kaminari is an old man living next to the Open Plot where Nobita and his friends play. It is seen often that the baseballs and footballs are breaking the glass of Kaminari's window (a woman's window in early manga chapters) or destroying one of his favorite bonsai plants which angers Kaminari a lot. The children always try not to anger Kaminari and play carefully. Recovering the ball without getting shouted at is difficult. Gian and Suneo quite often break his glass and make Nobita the scapegoat to recover the ball. He also has a wife who rarely appears and a beautiful granddaughter that the boys are quite often infatuated with. = / Mimi = : :: A regular female cat from Nobita's timeline, who either hangs out or goes on dates with Doraemon. She to Doraemon is similar with Shizuka to Nobita, however, besides Noramyako, Doraemon love interests her but still often has new crush on other cats in the whole series. ::In the close captioning of Invasion of the Body Swappers, Mimi is spelled Meenie; it is not known if this is an error.[Doraemon:] \\"And I want my legs back! Meenie won't even look at me with these creepy long toothpick legs!\\" = / Sera Ivy = : :: Tsubasa Ito is a popstar and TV actress who is very popular. Suneo often gets her autograph and shows it off to his friends. Doraemon is apparently a huge fan of her since it is shown in one episode that he has pictures of her all over his closet. = = : :: An annoying female robot duck. She was removed from later versions of the manga and never appeared in the 1979 or 2005 anime series due to the fact that Fujiko Fujio heavily disliked her annoying personality, she hasn't made any other appearances since then. = = : :: A snobby and mean girl that rarely appears. = = : :: Along with Debuko, one of Shizuka's friends the 1973 anime. = = : :: Along with Jamako, one of Shizuka's friends the 1973 anime.

Harrison and Frederick Bristol in 1918 in New York City Charles William Harrison (September 11, 1878 - February 2, 1965) was an American tenor ballad singer. He recorded under the pseudonyms: Hugh Donovan, Billy Burton, Charles Hilton, and Norman Terrell. Biography He was born on September 11, 1878 in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States. Harrison studied singing in New York City with noted voice teacher Frederick Bristol and organist Leo Kofler. He began recording for the Columbia Phonograph Company, his first disc being the \\"Cujus animam\\" aria from Gioachino Rossini's Stabat Mater recorded on January 31, 1911 and issued on Columbia 12-inch disc A5275. He recorded an extensive operatic and concert song repertoire in English for Columbia, Victor, Edison (on both cylinder and disc), Emerson and other companies, but gradually shifted to making recordings of popular hits of the day: \\"Last Night Was the End of the World\\" (1913), \\"Peg O‚Äô My Heart\\" (1913), \\"Ireland Must Be Heaven for My Mother Came from There\\" (1916), and \\"I‚Äôm Always Chasing Rainbows\\" (1918). At the same time as his solo performances, he performed as a member of several quartets recording for Columbia. Among the quartets he sang with was the Columbia Stellar Quartet and the American Singers, the latter during the early electric era. Also on a few occasions, he sang with the Revelers, most notably on their recordings of \\"Honolulu Moon\\" and \\"Yankee Girl.\\" His distinct and riveting tenor caused Victor Records to advertise him as \\"a voice in a million.\\" His career slowed with the advent of electrical recording, and his later solo records were almost entirely for Edison. Charles Harrison was married to Beulah Gaylord Young, another pioneer recording artist. They performed together as members of the Eveready Mixed Quartet on The Eveready Hour. Beginning in 1930, Harrison performed on the Broadway stage in the plays This One Man, Precedent, The Sellout and One More Honeymoon. He lived in Summit, New Jersey, and later moved to nearby New Providence, where he spent his final years and even recorded an LP in 1954 at the age of 75 entitled, \\"Charles Harrison Sings Again.\\" Charles Harrison recorded mostly under his own name, but also used Billy Burton and other pseudonyms when recording for smaller labels. He died on February 2, 1965 in New Providence, New Jersey.

The show closed on January 31, 2016, to make way for Mickey and the Magician which began on July 2, 2016. Plot summary Guests are invited to watch a show adventure about Disney animated films. It opens with Mickey and Donald teaching a drawing course in a room. At its far end is a door leading to the Cinematheque, which is strictly forbidden, as Mickey instructs Donald. However, after Mickey's departure, Donald decides he can open the door a little, without Mickey even knowing. As he does so, a flash of light takes Donald into the film vault. He then encounters scenes from various films including Dumbo, The Jungle Book, Pinocchio (formerly), The Little Mermaid and The Lion King. At the end, Donald tells Mickey about his amazing journey through the films, but Mickey doesn't believe him until Baloo, King Louie, and Rafiki walk into the room. Trivia *Animagique puppeteers undertake intense training classes to co-ordinate and synchronise their movements in complete darkness. Before the opening of the park in 2002, they even followed classes of Ta√Ø Chi to perfect their perception of space. *Mickey and Sebastian are the only two characters speaking French in the show. Other characters Donald, Pink Elephants, Baloo, King Louie, Young Simba and Zazu are all speaking English in the show. *Several months after opening, the show briefly closed to allow for a reworking that included replacing an original Pinocchio scene, featuring Monstro the whale, but it was scrapped shortly as it was deemed too scary for children, so it was replaced by The Little Mermaid. *The puppets Young Simba, Young Nala and Zazu, are all reused from Magic Kingdom's former show The Legend of the Lion King.

Another possible definition of a scoring chance can be any shot that is taken by an attacking team on an odd man rush, such as a 2-on-1 or 3-on-2 break.

Overview  HRSA oversees the nation‚Äôs organ and tissue donation and transplantation systems, poison control and vaccine injury compensation programs, and a drug discount program for certain safety-net health care providers.  Key facts  *In FY 2008, HRSA provided $23 million to promote the donation of organs and tissues and improve national procurement, allocation and transplantation activities. Nearly 100,000 Americans are on organ transplant waiting lists, and about 28,000 transplant procedures are performed annually. On average, 77 patients undergo transplant surgeries each day, and 19 die for lack of donated organs. *Since 1988, more than 2,200 families and individuals thought to have been injured by certain vaccines have been awarded over $1.8 billion through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The program seeks to encourage immunizations by assuring those few patients who experience side effects that they will be compensated. *HRSA funds the improvement and stabilization of poison control centers across the United States, ensuring that the more than 2.4 million poison exposures reported each year to the nation‚Äôs poison control centers are treated over the phone with guidance from Poison Control Centers‚Äô trained health care professionals. *HRSA‚Äôs 340B Program lets health centers, HIV/AIDS clinics and operators of certain other federal safety-net programs buy outpatient drugs at significant discounts. *HRSA funds the improvement and stabilization of poison control centers across the United States, ensuring that the more than 2.4 million poison exposures reported each year to the nation's poison control centers are treated over the phone with guidance from Poison Control Centers‚Äô trained health care professionals.  History  The Healthcare Systems Bureau was formerly the Bureau of Health Resources Development, which was created at the end of the Public Health Service reorganizations of 1966‚Äì1973 by combining the Community Health Service and the Health Facilities Planning and Construction Service from the recently abolished Health Services and Mental Health Administration (HSMHA). It became the Office of Special Programs in 1997 and the Healthcare Systems Bureau in 2004.  Activities  = Transplantation = HRSA oversees the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients in addition to promoting national awareness of the critical need for organ and tissue donation. HRSA also provides staff and logistics support to the Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation, which makes recommendations to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on issues concerning organ donation and transplantation. Under the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program and National Cord Blood Inventory, HRSA helps make possible blood stem cell transplants for patients with life-threatening blood disorders who lack a related donor. Stem cells for transplant come from adult volunteer donors and umbilical cord blood units donated to public cord blood banks. The program recruits adult volunteer donors, helps member cord blood banks collect and list additional units, and supports research to improve the results of unrelated donor transplants. = Poison Control Program = HRSA awards grants to the nation‚Äôs 61 poison control centers and manages the national toll-free poison help line, 1-800-222-1222. = 340B Drug Pricing Program = 340B Drug Program is appliable to hospitals (mixed-use and outpatient clinics) and contract pharmacies. The 340B Program is often managed by software for maximizing the savings and for providing compliance. 340BSoftware.com is an example of such software. The Program is a federal program. The 340B Drug Pricing Program, administered by the Office of Pharmacy Affairs, resulted from enactment of Public Law 102-585, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, which is codified as Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. Section 340B limits the cost of covered outpatient drugs to more than 18,000 eligible entities including ten types of health care providers and programs funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and hospitals that provide care to high volumes of patients that are either indigent or located in remote areas. These hospitals include disproportionate share hospitals, children‚Äôs hospitals, sole community hospitals, rural referral centers, critical access hospitals, and cancer hospitals exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system.U.S. Government Accountability Office, Report to Committees: Drug Pricing (GAO-11-836), September 2011. As reported in the Department of Health and Human Services 2014 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees, the 340B program cuts drug costs for participants, saving them an estimated $6 billion in discounted prescription drugs.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Fiscal Year 2014 Justifications for Estimates for Appropriation Committees. These savings enable them to purchase the drugs for a price that is ‚Äúat least 23.1 percent below the average manufacturer price (AMP) for brand name drugs, 13 percent below AMP for generic drugs; and 17.1 percent below AMP for clotting and pediatric drugs‚Äù.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Fiscal Year 2014 Justifications for Estimates for Appropriation Committees, page 310. These savings enable participants to provide more direct health care services to underserved populations. In recent years the program has seen a 3-4% annual growth rate.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Fiscal Year 2014 Justifications for Estimates for Appropriation Committees. Pharmaceuticals purchased at 340B pricing account for 2% of drugs purchased in the U.S. annually.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Fiscal Year 2014 Justifications for Estimates for Appropriation Committees. = Hill-Burton Program = The Hill-Burton Program requires 200 obligated health care facilities to provide free or reduced cost health care to patients who are uninsured, unable to pay, and unqualified for Medicaid coverage. In exchange for such services, the program previously funded grants and loans for new construction and improvements to 6,800 facilities nationwide. But most of those locations have discharged their obligations and no longer are in the program. Since 1980, almost $6 billion in uncompensated Hill-Burton services have been provided. = Healthcare and other facilities = In FY 2008, HRSA monitored 940 projects worth $691 million for health care and health-related facilities to meet their design, construction and equipment needs. Congress designates each of the awardees on an individual basis. = Compensation programs =  National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)  Most people who get vaccines have no serious problems. However, vaccines, like any medicines, can cause serious problems ‚Äî such as severe allergic reactions ‚Äî on certain rare occasions. In those cases, the VICP provides compensation to people who are found to be injured by certain vaccines.  Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program  In the case of pandemic, epidemic, or other major security threat requiring a medical countermeasure, the CICP provides compensation for injured parties.

Portato is also known as articulated legato . Description Portato is a bowing technique for stringed instruments , in which successive notes are gently re- articulated while being joined under a single continuing bow stroke. It achieves a kind of pulsation or undulation, rather than separating the notes. It has been notated in various ways. One early 19th-century writer, Pierre Baillot (L‚Äôart du violon, Paris, 1834), gives two alternatives: a wavy line, and dots under a slur. Later in the century a third method became common: placing \\"legato\\" dashes (tenuto) under a slur . The notation with dots under slurs is ambiguous, because it is also used for very different bowings, including staccato and flying spiccato (; ). Currently, portato is sometimes indicated in words, by \\"mezzo-staccato\\" or \\"non-legato\\"; or can be shown by three graphic forms: * a slur that encompasses a phrase of staccato notes (the most common), or * a tenuto above a staccato mark (very often), or * a slur that encompasses a phrase of tenuto notes (less common) .

He himself used the spelling Kucharsky,See signature at Marie Antoinette, miniature by Kucharsky, 1790 but Kucharski is also often used. In the past, in France, the name has been given as Couaski. Early life Kucharsky was born in Warsaw. As a boy, he was a page to King Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus, the last elected ruler of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.Le peintre KUCHARSKY at museelouisxvii.com (accessed 28 December 2007) He trained first as an artist in Warsaw, in the studio of the famous painter Marcello Bacciarelli. With a bursary from King Stanis≈Çaw Augustus, he then travelled to Paris to work under Joseph-Marie Vien and Carle van Loo at the Acad√©mie Royale, from 1760 to 1769. Work The king of Poland wanted Kucharsky to train as a historical painter, but instead he became a portrait artist, thus losing the king's patronage. From 1776 to 1778, Kucharsky was in the service of the Princes de Cond√©. Kucharsky liked to paint half-length portraits in pastels or in oils, but he also worked in gouache and sometimes painted miniatures. His clients were mostly from the French and Polish aristocracy. The latter had increased in numbers in France as a result of the alliance between King Louis XV and Marie Leszczy≈Ñska. After the departure from the French court of √âlisabeth-Louise Vig√©e-Le Brun in 1789, Kucharsky became painter to Queen Marie-Antoinette. As well as painting her portrait and the royal children, he also painted Marie-Louise, princesse de Lamballe, the comte d'Artois, later King Charles X, the countess of Artois, and Catherine the Great of Russia. Kucharsky's best-known work today includes his portraits of the doomed French royal family, especially the future King Louis XVII. The final portrait, painted in 1793 of Marie Antoinette, was sold at auction by Piasa on 21 May 2003 and is attributed to Kucharsky.Portrait de Marie- Antoinette au temple at artnet.com (accessed 30 December 2007) When signing his work, the artist used the spelling \\"Kucharsky\\". Later years Throughout the years of the French Revolution, Kucharsky's allegiance remained with the ancien r√©gime. In retirement he lived near Paris at Sainte-P√©rine, living on a pension granted by Louis XVIII of France. He died in Paris.

It is located by the Kolope River, south of the confluence of the Limpopo and Shashe rivers and about to the NE of the Venetia Diamond Mine. The National Park borders Mapesu Private Game Reserve to the south. It abuts on the border with Botswana and Zimbabwe, and forms part of the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area. It was established in 1995 and covers an area of over . The park protects the historical site of Mapungubwe Hill, which was the capital of the Kingdom of Mapungubwe, as well as the wildlife and riverine forests along the Limpopo River. The Mapungubwe Hill was the site of a community dating back to the Iron Age. Evidences have shown that it was a prosperous community. Archaeologists also uncovered the famous golden rhino figurine from the site. It is one of the few places in Africa that has both meerkats and Nile crocodiles. Mapungubwe National Park is renowned for its scenic landscape. Unique sandstone formations, woodlands, riverine forest and baobab trees combine to give it a fascinating look. History The history of the Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape dates back 210 million years ago when one of the earliest plant-eating dinosaurs, Plateosauravus (Euskelosaurus), was known to have lived in the area. The Mapungubwe area became a focus of agricultural research in the 1920s through the efforts of the botanist Illtyd Buller Pole- Evans. Pole Evans was instrumental in the creation of the Botanical Survey Advisory Committee, which was tasked with coordinating botanical research throughout the Union of South Africa. One of the network of botanical and research stations set up by the Botanical Survey was situated in the Mapungubwe area. At the request of General Smuts, the government set aside a block of nine farms in this area as a preserve for wildlife and natural vegetation in 1918. A few years later this became known as the Dongola Botanical Reserve. Pole Evans set about expanding the Dongola Botanical Reserve. By the early 1940s, the reserve had grown to include 27 farms, including Greefswald, the property on which the Mapungubwe Hill is situated. Pole Evans lobbied to have the reserve proclaimed as a national park, with the support of Prime Minister Jan Smuts. In 1944, Minister of Lands Andrew Conroy proposed the formation of the Dongola Wild Life Sanctuary, which would include 124 farms, 86 of which were privately owned. This proposal was strongly opposed by the National Party, then the official opposition in parliament and the National Parks Board of Trustees. In one of the longest running debates in the history of the South African parliament, supporters argued that it was necessary to conserve the country's natural assets, that the land set aside for the proposed reserve was unsuitable for agricultural purposes and that the area had a rich archaeology which should be protected. Those opposed to the establishment of the reserve argued that it was unacceptable to alienate agricultural land for wildlife conservation, to expropriate private land or to evict people from land they had occupied for generations. The debate, which has become known as the \\"Battle of Dongola\\", resulted in the declaration of a much reduced area as the Dongola Wildlife Sanctuary, after members of the ruling United Party voted in favour of the proposal. The National Party won the elections in 1948, and the sanctuary was abolished in 1949. Expropriated farms were returned to their original farmers, farms owned by the state were allocated for resettlement and funds returned to donors. In 1967, another proposal to protect the area was initiated and the Vhembe Nature Reserve, comprising three farms, including Greefswald, was established as a Transvaal provincial reserve. In 1993, De Beers Consolidated Mines, which had established the Venetia Limpopo Nature Reserve on land that adjoins Greefswald, called for the area to be declared a national park. In 1995 the South African National Parks Board and the Limpopo provincial government signed an agreement committing themselves to the establishment of the new national park. The Vhembe Dongola National Park was proclaimed on 9 April 1998. The Vhembe Dongola National Park was renamed Mapungubwe National Park and opened officially on Heritage Day, 24 September 2004. In the 21st century, Mapungubwe has been embraced as a site of significance by South Africans and the international community. The Mapungubwe National Park was declared in 1998. The Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape (MCL) was declared as a National Heritage Site in 2001 and it was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2003. With the park's UNESCO World Heritage Status, a building has been constructed that houses a museum section with many of the artefacts uncovered in the park on display. Information on the park's history and biology is also available at the Interpretive Centre. Flora and fauna =Vegetation= The numerous habitat types have resulted in high species diversity. There are at least 24 Acacia species and 8 Commiphora species, amongst others. Other vegetation of the area is a typically short fairly dense growth of shrubby Mopane trees, generally associated with a number of other trees and shrubs and a somewhat sparse and tufted grassveld. The riparian fringe of the Limpopo is of prime importance from the point of view of conservation. It is a dense vegetation community with a closed canopy which occurs in the rich alluvial deposits along the river. The most striking trees in this community fever trees, ana trees, leadwoods, fig trees and acacias. Extensive patches of this vegetation have been cleared for cultivation elsewhere along the length of the Limpopo River. The Limpopo floodplain has allowed some trees to grow to massive sizes. Nyala berry trees and ana trees can get particularly big. There are also some very large baobabs in the park, with one specimen having a circumference of . =Birds= Pel's fishing owl 387 bird species have been recorded in Mapungubwe National Park and over 400 species occur in the region. There is a high density of Verreaux's (black) eagle in this craggy landscape and other raptors are also prominent. Particularly enticing is an abundance of cuckoo species in summer with up to eleven species being found, including the rarer common and thick-billed cuckoos. An interesting attraction of the park is the occurrence of species typical of the arid western regions of the country (e.g. southern pied babbler, crimson-breasted shrike and black-faced waxbill) occur alongside species associated with the moister Lowveld habitat of the Kruger National Park . The Limpopo Tree-top Boardwalk and hide is a magnificent facility allowing the visitor into the trees alongside the birds or looking down on those that forage on the ground and lower strata. Meyer's parrots, white-crested helmetshrikes, Meve's (longtailed) starlings and some flycatcher species will be seen. Both tropical and southern boubous occur. The yellow- bellied greenbul, Meve's (long-tailed) starling, black-backed puffback and tropical boubou can be seen, and southern pied babbler and Natal spurfowl (francolin) are very vocal as are orange-breasted and grey-headed bush-shrikes and grey-backed camaroptera (bleating warbler). Several species of owl including barn, African and white-faced scops, Verreaux's (giant) eagle, pearl-spotted and Pel's fishing owl occur in Mapungubwe National Park. Kori bustards are prominent while chestnut-backed sparrow-larks and wattled starlings are nomadic, but may be abundant. Temminck's coursers and ground hornbills may also be seen in this habitat, as will a number of swallows. The Limpopo Floodplain in flood is a paradise for aquatic birds. Grey crowned cranes, up to seven stork species and several wader, heron, crake and duck species will be seen in these wet times. There are many stands of Lala palms and collared palm thrushes have been recorded. Other specials that occur in Mapungubwe National Park include great white pelican, white-backed night heron, bat hawk, augur buzzard, African hobby, Dickinson's kestrel, green sandpiper, three-banded courser, blue-spotted wood dove, grey-headed parrot, Senegal coucal, pennant-winged nightjar, blue-cheeked bee-eater, broad-billed and racket-tailed roller, African golden oriole and olive-tree warbler. =Mammals= Most of the large African game species occur in Mapungubwe National Park. When the Limpopo River is not in flood, they roam freely across it to Botswana and Zimbabwe and back. Current species include; elephant, hippopotamus, white rhinoceros, lion, leopard, cheetah, Cape wild dog, spotted hyena, brown hyena, eland, blue wildebeest, kudu, zebra, bushbuck, waterbuck, impala, klipspringer, duiker, steenbok, red hartebeest, oryx, giraffe, warthog, bush pig, aardvark and baboon. There are numerous smaller game species, including badgers, civets, porcupine, caracal, vervet monkey, and a host of smaller species. The wildlife park is also known to be home to at least 17 species of bats. Fruit bats are attracted to the fig trees along the Limpopo River banks, including tree roosting Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bat and the cave dwelling Egyptian fruit bat. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with South Luangwa National Park.IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion Panthera leo in Eastern and Southern Africa. IUCN, Pretoria, South Africa. = Reptiles = Rock monitor lizard, water monitor lizard, giant plated lizard, rainbow skink, ground agama and speckled thick toed gecko have all been seen in Mapungubwe National Park. There are estimated to be at least thirty-two species of snake in the park, although only fifteen have thus far been confirmed. Some of these species include the southern African python, snouted cobra, black mamba, both horned and puff adders, and at least three species of whip or sand snakes. Nile crocodile occur in and along the Limpopo River. Threats The status of the park as part of the transfrontier conservation area is severely threatened by the planned exploitation of coal reserves in the immediate vicinity of the reserve. An open-cast coal mine and power plant are planned in the buffer zone of the national park, which threaten its natural and cultural value.. In addition, the large amount of water required for the mining activities will impact the ecology of a large part of the region.

Early years The original line-up included Nick Burbridge, Martin Pannett, Marcus Laffan and Tim O'Leary and spent most of the early years playing gigs. They only released one album, The Enemy Within. It was the live performances then for which the band were best known. With the Levellers The Levellers often cite McDermott's Two Hours as one of their early inspirations and during the 2000s the two bands produced three albums together, World Turned Upside Down, Claws and Wings, and Disorder.

The castle site was outside the western city gate, and defended on three sides by deep trenches. A branch of the River Nene provided a natural barrier on the western side. The castle had extensive grounds and a large keep. The gates were surrounded by bulwarks made of earth, used to mount artillery. The castle was \\"obliterated\\" by the arrival of a railway branch of what is now the West Coast Main Line in the 19th century, the station of which was built on the castle site and the construction of the original Northampton Castle railway station. All that remains of the castle today is the Postern Gate, near Northampton Railway Station. Northampton Castle bastion from Historical Memorials of Northampton by C. H. HartshorneHistorical Memorials of Northampton Charles Henry Hartshorne, 1848 Reprinted: General books 2012 A postern at Northampton Castle from Hartshorne History =Early period= The castle was built under the stewardship of Simon de Senlis, the first Earl of Northampton, in 1084. It took several years to complete, as there is no mention of it in the Domesday Book, the great survey of England completed in 1086. In the reign of Henry II, the castle was in the hands of the Crown. In the civil wars between King John and his barons, the latter used it as a stronghold. When the King prevailed, the castle was entrusted to Falkes de Breaut√©, whom the King admired for his courage during the war. In 1164, Thomas Becket was tried at the castle before a great council. Having escaped by dressing as a monk, Becket then fled to France. In 1264, in the wars between King Henry III and his nobles, the castle was owned by the confederate barons and governed by Simon de Montfort. When the King defeated the garrison, the castle again reverted to the Crown. It remained so until three years into King Edward III's reign, when Thomas Wake, who was then sheriff of Blisworth, claimed it belonged to the county under his jurisdiction. In 1452, thirty years into King Henry VI's reign, the castle was rented to Robert Caldecote for 20 years, at the annual rate of ¬£5. The rent of the castle included: By the late 17th century, it was in the hands of Robert Haselrig. =Victorian era= The development of railways in England during the Victorian period initially by-passed Northampton. The main line from London, Euston, now known as the West Coast Main Line passed about five miles south of the town. However, in 1879 a loop line via Northampton was constructed. In that year the castle and its foundations were demolished by the London and North Western Railway for the construction of Northampton Castle railway station. The only remains that survived were some earth banks beside St Andrew's Road and the re-positioned postern gate, \\"a minor archway\\". The station was rebuilt in 1963‚Äì64 with the suffix \\"Castle\\" to its name dropped as it had become the only remaining station in the town. Excavations in 1961 prior to the rebuilding revealed 12th century defences including a ditch 90 feet wide and 30 feet deep and a bank 80 feet wide and 20 feet high. =21st century= A volunteer group called the Friends of Northampton Castle (FONC) was established to publicise the castle and provide information about the history of the site and the castle itself. In July 2012, FONC commissioned a 3D reconstruction of the castle which was published on YouTube. Expansion of the town and the 2011 launch of a Northampton Waterside Enterprise Zone made the need to expand and re-develop and double the size of the railway station, possibly with the name restored to \\"Northampton Castle\\". Work began in 2013. The opportunity was taken to carry out further, more extensive, excavations in 2012‚Äì13 which uncovered various items of Anglo-Saxon origin. Among their number were a brooch, pottery fragments and an ironstone wall.Historical finds at site of new station Northampton Herald & Post 10 January 2012 Literary connections Northampton Castle is the location of the death of Prince Arthur, the young nephew to King John and claimant to the throne, in Shakespeare's King John, Act IV Scene III, in which he leaps to his death from the castle walls in an escape attempt. The fate of the real-life Prince Arthur remains mysterious. He was last recorded as a sixteen-year-old captive in Rouen Castle in April 1203, whereafter he was rumoured to have been killed on King John's orders. It may be thought more likely that he died in France rather than England. References Further reading *The Castle of Northampton by Rev. R. M.

Built 1876-77, it is a prominent regional example of Carpenter Gothic architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Since January 28, 2007, the Rev. Sue Poulin has been priest-in- charge.Our Staff at The Episcopal Church of Saint John the Baptist Architecture and history St. John's occupies a triangular lot on the north side of Sanbornville village, bounded by High Street, Wakefield Road (New Hampshire Route 153), and St. John Street. The church is located near the center of the parcel, and is oriented facing west toward High Street; to its south is the rectory, also facing High Street, and the parish hall is on the east side of the lot, oriented at an angle to the other two buildings in order to properly face Wakefield Street. The church is a handsome example of Gothic Revival architecture, designed by Charles C. Haight. It is one of the architect's earlier works, and is clearly based in part on a design for country churches published by Richard Upjohn in his 1852 book Rural Architecture, but with more elaborate flourishes. It has an asymmetrical cruciform plan with a tower projecting to the right of its street-facing facade. The rectory was added in 1881, and the parish hall in 1894; both are vernacular expressions of late Victorian architecture. The church was built in 1876-77, to fulfill the dying wish of Mrs. Josiah Low, a bequest that was seen through by her granddaughter, with additional funds donated by other members of the Low family. The church was consecrated on September 14, 1877, by the Rt. Rev. William Woodruff Niles, the third bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. Originally set on a much smaller lot, further gifts from the Low family made possible the acquisition of the full it now owns, as well as the construction of the rectory. The church was a mission of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire until it achieved parish status on June 14, 1961.

The strip is co-written by Horatio Weisfeld and Peter Koch. The first installment of the series appeared in the January 2002 issue of Heavy Metal Magazine. The most recent appeared in the September 2010 issue. Heavy Metal began running Joe In The Future as a print series in 2001 after the initial episode appeared as 3-minute internet flash web animation and Heavy Metal editor Howard Jorofsky suggested Weisfeld allow the magazine to run additional episodes as print stories. Weisfeld then followed with several additional Joe in the Future installments for Heavy Metal. The nearly simultaneous appearance of Joe in the Future as both web-animation and print episodes makes the series an early example of web-initiated Transmedia storytelling. In the series, Joe, spends most of his time seeking out cigarettes (which are hard to acquire in the future) and often comes into difficulty with a variety of humans, robots, mutants, etc., who seek to disrupt Joe‚Äôs cigarette centric agenda to suit their own needs. The Joe In The Future is narrated in a terse crime novel style but the stories tend to evolve from commonplace incident rather than good/bad guy type genre conventions. Joe is a tough rogue and his yarns tend to feature Goodfellas-type petty street tension that boils to a violent climax, but through it all the title character tends to eschew anger, malevolence and disrespect. In this regard, the strip is rather unusual among action & crime genre material. The first Joe in the Future story was developed by writers Horatio Weisfeld and Peter Koch as a short comic book story after Weisfeld, during the late 1980s, was served a cockroach in his food at a Chinese restaurant and imagined the same event playing out in a futuristic setting. That scenario was eventually appropriated by artist Arthur Suydam, a mutual friend of both Weisfeld and Koch, for an episode of Suydam's Cholly and Flytrap series in Marvel Comics Epic Magazine. After this, Weisfeld continued to develop more Joe in the Future material with Koch and, in the early 1990s, commissioned 3 pages of comic artwork from acclaimed Batman illustrator Trevor Von Eeden for what would become artwork featured in both first episode of Joe in the Future in Heavy Metal Magazine and a 3-minute animation that was made from scans of the comic page panels. Weisfeld then submitted the story to both Heavy Metal Magazine and Tundra publishing but it was rejected, and it would be 10 years before Joe in the Future was finally printed in Heavy Metal, after Weisfeld, having had success developing Penthouse Comix, and had become acquainted with Heavy Metal editor Howard Jurofsky. It was eventually printed in the Jan 2002 issue. The second Joe in the Future story then appeared in Heavy Metal in 2003. 2012 Inkpot Award winner Trevor Von Eeden has illustrated several Joe in the Future stories. Other artists have included George Freeman and Floyd Hughes.

Broadcast on 27 and 28 December 2007, the storyline is significant in the show's history as it involved a raid on the Sun Hill police station, which resulted in trauma for a number of officers. Synopsis The story begins with new Detective Sergeant Max Carter, at the start of his first day at Sun Hill CID. Detective Constable Terry Perkins receives information of a planned robbery from an informant, while Constables Benjamin Gayle and Sally Armstrong are called to a disturbance over unpaid taxi fares. Tiff and Paula, the females involved in the disturbance are later arrested and held in the custody suite. DC Perkins also makes arrests of the would-be robbers he had information about, but also finds his informant shot and bleeding to death who dies in DC Perkins arms. To alleviate the stress, DC Perkins drinks while on duty and ends up heavily intoxicated, being found by a fellow officer and unofficially placed in a cell to sober up by a fellow officer. Constables Tony Stamp, Ben Gayle and Sally Armstrong are in the process of formally releasing Tiff and Paula when two men rush into the front office taking Sally and Tony hostage. The two men threaten PC Stamp with death unless he shows them to the cells where Tiff and Paula are being held. Outside the station and unaware of events inside, Sergeant Callum Stone radios the number plate to be run through the Police National Computer, only to find that it was reported as stolen. CO19 armed officers who are walking into the station by coincidence clearly see PC Armstrong held at gunpoint, resulting in a CO19 officer shot. Upon learning their boyfriends have stormed into the station attempting to free them from police custody, they are both stunned. Jimmy Duncan, the would-be robber DC Perkins arrested, helps the hostage takers control the siege, with the reasoning that they are \\"amateurs\\". Upon learning of the siege, Inspector Gina Gold requisitions a pub as an observation and control point. Inside the station, PC Gayle realises that Tiff has swallowed a drug filled condom and it is leaking causing her to slowly overdose. With the help of experienced criminal, Jimmy Duncan, the hostage takers have moved the officers into the Integrated Borough Operations suite, the nerve centre of the station where CCTV can be observed of all the entry and exit points. The hostage takers also issue demands, stating they want a bus with a driver so they can escape with their hostages. While Tiff and Paula are in the toilet, Sally tried to convince them to persuade their boyfriends to end the siege. Meanwhile, Jimmy Duncan murders one of the hostage takers. DC Perkins wakes up in his cell and walks straight into Jimmy Duncan with Perkins managing to pass himself off as a criminal rather than police officer. To convince Jimmy, DC Perkins sets fire to the canteen, but unknown to Terry, Jimmy had seen his warrant card. As the fire takes hold, both hostage takers and hostages scramble through the front entrance. Terry and PC Will Fletcher pursue Jimmy Duncan, with Terry about to shoot him when DI Samantha Nixon arrives with armed officers.

This article attempts to list them. Radio-controlled vehicles =Cars (1/12 scale)= *The first radio-controlled car to be released by Tamiya was a Porsche 934 in 1976. Its body was based upon an existing 1/12 scale static kit that Tamiya had already been manufacturing, so the effect was that of a traditional static model kit with the added ability to be radio-controlled ‚Äì something Tamiya acknowledged, as all of their early kit boxes carried the wording \\"suitable for radio control\\". The Porsche 934 was a massive hit ‚Äì selling over 100,000 units in its first year. The potential market for easy to assemble electric radio-controlled model cars was clear and the 934 was soon followed by a kit of the Porsche 935. *Lamborghini Countach LP500S (CS), the eighth car to be released by Tamiya (58008). Although released previously (58005) this model is the first to use the Competition Special tag, meaning that it is a hopped-up (Hop-up meaning more powerful or souped-up) version. The early models came equipped with the more powerful RS540 unit, as opposed to the standard RS380S, and sponge/diplo tyres, which were later adopted by competition cars of that size as opposed to rubber. It also featured a thicker chassis with different cast metal steering.Tamiya Lamborghini Countach LP500S (CS), Vintage Tamiya Radio Control Cars through to Modern Tamiya R/C ‚Äì Lamborghini Countach LP500S (CS) *Can-Am Lola RM1, based on the T333 that Jacky Ickx used to win the reformatted Can-Am series in 1979. This was Tamiya's further foray into building competition cars, hence the RM (Racing Master) tag that appeared on the box, the first of seven cars. The car did feature a few groundbreaking innovations that became common in other RC cars, these were the introduction of the first hop-up RC motor the Mabuchi Black RS-540SD, fully adjustable flex/tweak chassis (including adjustable castor & ackerman, bulletproof ball raced sealed rear diff.), over-engineered sophisticated step-less MSC with microswitch and braking, to use the BEC radio gear and to come fully ball raced.Tamiya Can Am Lola, Vintage Tamiya Radio Control Cars through to Modern Tamiya R/C ‚Äì Can Am Lola It was the first Tamiya car to use a polycarbonate body shell rather than the heavier and fragile moulded ABS of the previous cars. This was soon followed by the release of the Datsun 280ZX RM Mk2, a model of the car driven by Paul Newman to win the SCCA CP title. A narrower redesigned version of the RM chassis with the same axle/drivetrain/steering components as the RM1, but minus the MSC, diff, bearings and RS-540SD Motor; all which can be fitted in as an option. *Tornado RM. Mk3, released two years after the first RM model, leading to an upsurge in the market for the 1/12 scale pan racers, which by then many companies including Associated, Schumacher, Delta, Kyosho, and ABC had become involved in the market. As a result, Tamiya redesigned the RM's pan chassis reducing its weight by leaving out some of the less-used items that were offered in the RM1. Other adjustments were that the RM3 could accept the 7.2V stick packs and an uprated adjustable mechanical speed controller, known as the SuperChamp MSC. The RM3's steering arrangement had returned to the simpler setup with an adjustable caster.Tamiya Tornado RM. MK. 03, Vintage Tamiya Radio Control Cars through to Modern Tamiya R/C ‚Äì Tornado RM. MK. 03 The body shape would become common with RC cars throughout the decade. Tamiya's further evolution with the RM5/6 (Porsche 956 and Toyota 84C) would be another all-new design featuring a stiffening top plate and a floating rear pod with a single spring.Tamiya Porsche 956, Vintage Tamiya Radio Control Cars through to Modern Tamiya R/C ‚Äì Porsche 956 *The Porsche 959, released in 1986 was a 1/12 scale radio- controlled replica of the car that won the 1986 Paris Dakar Rally and was one of the most complex and highly detailed R/C model kits ever made. It was soon followed by the Toyota Celica Gr.B, a replica of the Safari Rally winner, which shared the same chassis as the Porsche 959 but included several upgrades such as a third differential in the centre of the car and a much needed front anti-roll bar, making it an even more complex kit. =Cars (1/10 scale)= *Williams FW07 (CS), although not the first F1 car to be released, as well as being the second to use the CS (Competition Special) banner, further changes would be made with its release. As well as having the standard equipment found on all CS models the main chassis is single deck FRP rather than the single deck aluminium of early versions, the motor mount is a lighter pressed alloy instead of heavy cast alloy as well as front uprights of nylon instead of alloy and a rear motor pod of stamped metal plate instead of cast metal.http://www.tamiya101.com/model_comments.asp?id=20 tamiya101.com Examples can fetch almost US$1000.The SRB line of off-road buggies began in 1979 starting with the Rough Rider, than the Sand Scorcher, followed by the Ford Ranger. These vehicles featured a scaled down version of the Volkswagen Beetle chassis used on many desert racing buggies. The final SRB to come along in 1983 was the Super Champ. The Super Champ was unique from the other SRBs due to its use of a rear \\"mono -shock\\" design. Aside from the SRB line were the Hilux and Blazing Blazer 3 speed 4 wheel drives both released in 1982. The original Wild Willy kit was revised in 1985 to give it a slightly longer wheelbase leaving the earlier, shorter wheelbase version quite hard to find. Wild Willy 2 was released in 2000 utilizing a pre-assembled Wild Dagger gearbox and tires from Lunch Box, but otherwise a wholly new mechanical design. Wild Willy 2 retained the Jeep body with only a few minor differences, such as horizontal front grill slits instead of the vertical slits of the original. There has also been a metallic edition of Wild Willy 2.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58242wild/wild1/wild1.htm *The Subaru Brat was released in 1982. It was a two-wheel-drive off-road radio-controlled buggy that was both fast and much lighter than its predecessors.http://www.subarubrat.com/rcbrat.htm This model also marked a new balance between the use of metal and plastic components. The chassis of the Brat was used for the basis of the Frog, Black Foot, and Monster Beetle. *The Frog, released in 1983, was an improvement on the previous year's Brat release. It featured an updated differential, ball bearings, oil shocks, and a lighter polycarbonate body. The Frog was very popular and marked the beginning of Tamiya's use of animal themes to draw inspiration for its vehicle designs and colours ‚Äì an idea that proved extremely popular and which was continued through several kits. The Frog kit was also re-released in 2005, though with a few alterations such as more reliable dog bone type universal shafts and an Electronic Speed Controller.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58354frog/index.htm The Frog's lower price and weight (compared to the earlier Rough Rider), began the 1/10 scale offroad racing phenomenon. However, its role in racing was limited with the release the following year of the Team Associated RC10. *The Grasshopper, released in 1984, was a two-wheel-drive off-road radio-controlled buggy. It was very rugged and featured a simple construction and was Tamiya's most affordable buggy. It featured a bathtub chassis holding a simple rigid axle in the rear and single wishbone front suspensions in the front. Its 380-sized motor meant it was among Tamiya's slower models at the time, though its lighter ABS plastic bathtub chassis helped put its speed only a little behind that of the earlier, heavier Special Racing Buggies. It was also much more economical on batteries and overall it was the ideal off-roader for the first-time hobbyist which also made it very popular. The Grasshopper kit was re-released in 2005 with a few alterations.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58346grasshopper/index.htm *The Hornet, released in 1984, was a two-wheel-drive off-road radio-controlled buggy which was quite fast and rugged. It shared most components with the Grasshopper, though it was faster and lighter due to a polycarbonate (Lexan) body. It would go on to become one of the most popular R/C kits of all time and was re-released in December 2004 with a few alterations. There was also a sequel, the Super Hornet, which was released in 1994 and was still being manufactured exclusively for the Australian market until 2006, making it one of the longest-running Tamiya kits in history.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58336hornet/index.htm *The Thunder Shot, Released in 1987, was a four-wheel-drive buggy. The Thunder Shot was the first Tamiya Buggy to be released as a 'Complete Kit'. Only two of the First 100 were released as a complete kit. It included an ADSPEC Controller and Servo inside the box which had the 58067 model. This was bundled as model 57001. The Sonic Fighter was 57002. Both were introduced in the Tamiya yearly catalogue for the first time in the 1988 issue shown as complete kits. For the 1989 issue and every issue until they were no longer available in 1991 the Thunder Shot was always pictured and shown only in the 58067 form. The complete kit was only available for the first production run and was discontinued mid-1988. Generally, most collectors do not know of the Thunder Shot 'complete kit'. With only a couple left in the world that have not been built, it makes the unbuilt Thunder Shot 'complete kit' one of the most prized models to find for a collector. Especially seeing only two of the first 100 were ever released in this form with a much bigger box to house the 58067 and the ADSPEC controller and Servo.https://tamiyabase.com/?option=com_joodb&view;=article&joobase;=19&id;=18&Itemid;=1042 * The Hotshot, released in 1985, Tamiya's first four-wheel-drive off-road buggy. It broke new ground for Tamiya and also enthusiasts, and was the car to beat in 1/10-scale buggy racing when it was released. It featured four-wheel independent double-wishbone suspension, a unique mono-spring suspension that used only two springs for the entire four wheels. For its time, the car was light, rugged and upgradeable. In the years that followed parts of the Hotshot were evolved and reused in several other 4WD buggy models including the Hotshot 2 (which was identical aside from simpler direct rear suspension), the Boomerang, the Super Sabre and Tamiya's 10th Anniversary car, the Bigwig. In 2007 the Hotshot was re-released. An ESC is included instead of a mechanical speed controller and the body has a metal patch functioning as a heatsink to dissipate heat from the ESC, dog-bone shafts are simplified, Hexa bolt and Hexa cup universal for connecting front and rear gearboxes are discarded and a simpler dog-bone shaft is adapted. Because of ESC the original heatsinks on resistors for the mechanical speed controller are no longer necessary but are included as dummies as they are unique to the Hotshot. Other parts and designs are identical. Unfortunately, there remain some minor problems with Hotshot: bump steer, the front wishbones rubbing on the inside of the front wheels and the front spring's attachment point to the lower wishbones being weak.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58391hotshot/index.htm * The Bruiser 1/10-scale radio-controlled pickup truck, released in 1985, had a working three-speed transmission which could be shifted via radio control, a high-torque RS-750SH motor and an ultra-realistic Toyota Hilux body with a sleeper cab and interior detail. The steel frame, leaf suspension, front, and rear axle and steering were patterned after their full-sized counterparts. This complex model has since become one of the most collectibles of all Tamiya R/C cars. It featured a mechanically shiftable 3-speed transmission, using a 3rd radio channel. It would run in 4x4 mode in the lowest gear only. No other RC car or truck of the time offered shiftable mechanical transmission making it highly realistic. * The original Blackfoot monster truck kit and its variations, first released in 1986, was credited with much of the hobby's growth. The Blackfoot line included the original Blackfoot, Super Blackfoot, and King Blackfoot, all sharing the same ORV spaceframe chassis first used in Frog but featuring some improvements. The Blackfoot Extreme used the chassis from the Wild Dagger. The Blackfoot was a Ford F-150 despite its inspiration being drawn from the real Bigfoot monster truck which was a Ford F-250. The Monster Beetle, now a very collectible model, was nearly identical to the Blackfoot with the addition of gold wheels, oil-filled shocks and of course the Volkswagen Beetle bodyshell. * Vanessa's Lunchbox, actually a 1/12-scale kit due to its monster truck design and short wheelbase, was released in 1987. It made use of the strong Grasshopper/Hornet gearbox and had an exceptionally detailed hard body shell of a Dodge van, heavily inspired by the real monster truck Rollin' Thunder. It was a \\"fun\\" vehicle, having poor stability and performing long wheelies, and in many respects was therefore similar to real monster trucks of the (then) future. This also made it one of the more popular models and it was re-released in 2005 with only minor modifications. A metallic gold edition followed in 2007.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58347lunchbox/index.htm * Midnight Pumpkin is a sister truck to the Lunchbox that used the same chassis, gearbox, suspension, and tyres. It was also based on a real monster truck, Frankenstein, although the model was mostly black instead of the yellow worn by the real truck. In early 2006, a metallic chrome edition was released.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58365pumpkin/index.htm * The Clod Buster 1/10-scale radio-controlled monster truck was released in 1987 as the first Tamiya R/C monster truck with two drive motors, four-wheel drive, and four-wheel steering. Each of the front and rear axles were identical, and the motor is attached to the axle itself, making it a very simple design. This simple design allowed the axles to be used in modified vehicles. The Clod Buster spawned an aftermarket industry of its own that catered to those who wished to modify their models to \\"crawlers\\", specialized vehicles designed to climb steep and rugged surfaces. The Clod Buster has remained popular since its introduction and produced the Super Clod Buster. The Clod Buster was also released with a detailed semi-truck body, as the Bullhead. The Clod Buster still has a large aftermarket following with many companies designing parts for rock crawling as well as trailer pulling and racing. The main reason for its continued use is its ultra-strong gearboxes. * The Avante, released in 1988. This was a car specifically designed to return Tamiya to the forefront of R/C racing. Its unique design featured an FRP chassis, aluminium components everywhere and almost limitless adjustments. Unfortunately, it was somewhat over-engineered ‚Äì The car was too heavy, too fragile, dynamically inept, and uncompetitive. However, it is still a highly desirable model to a Tamiya collector because of the unique and uncompromising engineering that went into it. * The Egress is the follow-up to the Avante, with material that was advanced for the time. Unlike the Avante, it has simplified suspension and a longer wheelbase arrangement that was seen in Vanquish/Avante2001.The avante drivetrain is carried forward except with ball diffs F/R and one-way bearing in the middle. Like the Avante it was a no expense is spared car, it even came with Platinum hi-cap dampers, a full set of blue-rubber-sealed bearings, graphite chassis plates and towers, alloy hardware and titanium screws. * The Astute was Tamiya's first attempt to build a serious 2WD competition car. The car came equipped with everything that was needed to make the car competitive including ball diff, ball-raced gearbox, oil-filled dampers at each corner, front anti-roll bar and all adjustable suspension geometry. The unusual step of installing metal bushes in all suspension pivot points was taken, which reduces the amount of slop in the suspension due to flexing and slows down the rate of wear in these joints. Although fully adjustable this did add extra weight and complexity and it may be for these reasons that it was never very widely used on the racing scene. Jamie Booth did win the European championship in 1991 with a modified and simplified Astute with parts from Tamiya Madcap. Some of his modifications were later found on the Super Astute which addressed many of the faults of its predecessor.Vintage Tamiya Radio Control Cars through to Modern Tamiya R/C ‚Äì Showroom PageVintage Tamiya Radio Control Cars through to Modern Tamiya R/C ‚Äì Super Astute101 Vintage Tamiya r/c models for the radio controlled car collector *The Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo was a TA-01 chassis kit (packaged with an R32 GT-R body) released in 1991. The TA-01 chassis was derived from the Manta Ray buggy with shorter arms, narrower wheels and radial tires. This kit wasn't the first TA-01 kit (which was the Toyota Celica GT-Four Rally), nor was the TA-01 the first chassis to be designed to be fitted with a touring car body (as there had been body kits that were designed to fit into buggies). Due to its popularity, this Skyline GT-R kit was credited for creating the touring car craze during the early 1990sTamiya Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo, Vintage Tamiya Radio Control Cars through to Modern Tamiya R/C ‚Äì Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo as well as the chassis introducing the one-make low-cost racing known as the Tamiya Racing Championship.RC Car History *The TR-15T was one of the first gas-powered stadium trucks to be released on the market. Unfortunately, the TR-15T was not a commercial success and was discontinued quickly. Nowadays the car is one of the more collectible RC models commanding over $450 in a mint boxed unopened condition. *The Juggernaut was an attempt to create a true monster truck, bigger than any previously attempted in the R/C world. It featured 4√ó4 and four-wheel steering with a tire diameter of 6.5 inches (16.5 cm) and weighing one pound (0.45 kg) each. It remains as one of the biggest and failures in Tamiya's history. It featured two rigid axles but, unlike Clod Buster, two motors were located in the central gearbox in tandem. From the central gearbox two universal shafts connected to the front and rear axles. Its massive weight of 4.5 kg, combined with low gear ratios necessary to provide enough torque to move the monster, would simply destroy the bevel gears in the axle in one run. Tamiya quickly revised many parts: The bevel gears in the axle received reinforcements of more bearings and lower gear ratios. Released in 1999 Juggernaut would have received a prominent feature in the 2000 Tamiya Catalog signaling that Tamiya was back in monster trucks after the 13 years since Clod Buster. Due to its catastrophic failure Juggernaut is not featured in any of the yearly catalogs at all. Instead, the revised and re-colored Juggernaut 2 appears in the 2001 catalog along with the Mammoth, a Juggernaut 2 based Mammoth Dump truck. Juggernaut 2 and Mammoth both retained the complex link suspension and leaf springs that did not allow adequate articulation, giving them a very bouncy ride. *The TXT-1 (Tamiya Extreme Truck) 1/10 scale radio control monster truck was released in 2002. The axles and gears are almost entirely identical to Juggernaut 2, with slightly bigger diameter universal shafts. With TXT-1 Tamiya engineers shifted attention from simply building a massive monster truck to a very capable rock crawler. This truck, which is still in production, was designed as a factory response to aftermarket Clodbuster upgrades. Four-wheel drive and cantilever multi-link suspension allow for the axle articulation featured in third party kits such as the Clodzilla series. The new truck dispensed with the unreliable four-wheel steering of Juggernaut 1 and 2's single under-powered servo sat in the center of the vehicle. Instead, the TXT would mount one servo to steer the front wheels only. As an option, the rear axle can also mount a servo allowing all 4 wheels to steer. Tamiya engineers attended USHRA monster truck events in order to improve the scale appearance of the TXT and duplicate full-size suspension designs. Having fixed all the Juggernaut's suspension problems and with improved chassis and steering it remains one of the most capable crawlers.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58280txt_1/txt_1.htm *The TRF414 series radio-controlled cars was holder of the 2002‚Äì04 IFMAR ISTC 1/10-scale electric touring car world champion title. The TRF414 was created in response to Tamiya's customer demands for a more adjustable and efficient touring car than the TA03. It was the first Tamiya touring car to depart from the previous gear-driven layouts used in the TA01/02 and TA03, instead employing two unequal-length belts to transmit the power to all four wheels with only one geared step. The TRF414M2 was a popular touring car due to its low cost relative to other cars in its class. *The TRF415 holder of the 2004‚Äì06 IFMAR ISTC 1/10-scale radio-controlled electric touring car world champion title. * The TA01/TA02 chassis series from the early-mid-1990s were sold with various body shells. The TA01 was based on Tamiya's Manta Ray buggy and was one of the first kits on the market to be sold with a realistic body coupled with a capable, easy-handling 4WD chassis. Some of these body shells are among the most realistic and detailed lexan bodies ever made by any manufacturer. Models worthy of note are the E30 BMW M3, W201 Mercedes 190E 2.5‚Äì16 Evolution-II, Ford Escort RS Cosworth and the Lancia Delta Integrale. Tamiya re-released the bodies recently, either sold separately or bundled with a TT-01 kit. *The TL-01/TL-01LA/TL-01B/TL-01RA chassis, released from the mid-'90s to the late '90s, was an innovative shaft-driven 4WD touring chassis with a narrow three-piece vertically sandwiched chassis design. Its characteristics include high durability and low cost, making it an excellent starting car for beginners. Like the TA01/TA02 it was released with many different rally, touring and sports car bodies and incorporated various minor modifications throughout its production run. Tamiya released the TL-01 with modified with long arms and buggy size wheels to as the TL-01B marketed as the Baja Champ and later Baja King buggies. The TL-01 remains one of the more popular Tamiya chassis today. * The TLT-1 is a small truck of about 1/15 scale. It is a scaled-down version of TXT-1. Light weight and TXT-1 style suspension system makes it a very capable little climber. It has quickly become widely known as one of the most versatile RC cars for projects for scale rock crawling, a hobby that is starting to make itself noticed by the general RC market. Like the Clod Buster, its axles are highly desirable.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/47201rockbuster/index.htm *Nitro Thunder is a 4√ó4 buggy powered by a .15 glow engine. It utilizes an off-road racing buggy chassis called NDF-01. Just as TNX has shown promise in racing circuits the NDF-01 is a smaller 1/10 sized off-road racer. Use of a resin tub chassis, instead of aluminum, and a frontal impact control system that absorbs shocks from a collision indicate that Nitro Thunder is built with young racers in mind. Adjustability of the suspension, rear exhaust and full ball bearings are features often found in models for experienced racers. Just as Kyosho offers scaled-down 1/10 buggy of their 1/8 buggies for inexperienced racers Nitro Thunder is Tamiya's entry into the 1/10 buggy market.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/43514nitro/index.htm Nitro Blaster is an identical buggy with different exterior.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/43521blaster/index.htm *The Ford F-350 High Lift, released in 2006, is a modernized version of the vintage three-speed trucks, such as the Bruiser and Mountaineer. A three-speed gearbox from the tractor trailer truck series mounts on steel chassis rails, with leaf springs and grease friction dampers supporting it on modified TLT axles. The truck is finished with a detailed hard body version of the Ford F-350, very similar to the earlier Juggernaut's body. It is a very capable crawler in its own right and a sister truck, with a Bruiser (Toyota Hilux) body was released in Dec 200, with a scale surf board as an accessory.http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58372ford_f350/index.htm *The TA05, released in spring 2005, is the replacement for the TRF414-derived TA04 line of touring cars. The chassis is a clean-sheet design featuring a twin- belt drivetrain utilizing two equal-length belts, a center-mounted motor and a low layshaft, resulting in a nearly 50/50 front‚Äìback weight distribution. The car is very popular with touring car racers due to its ease of set-up and its relatively low-maintenance drivetrain. Tamiya marketed the TA05 with various sports and racing car bodies and Tamiya also released the TA05-IFS (Inboard Front Suspension) along with the limited-edition TA05MS (Maezumi Satoshi), and the hopped-up TA05R (containing the most popular TA05 upgrades) in spring 2007. The IFS features an inboard front suspension with pushrod-activated laydown shocks (as opposed to standup shocks attached directly to the suspension arm), which is a first for a 1/10 scale electric mainstream touring car. The chassis can be bought with various low-slung bodies such as the Vemac RD350 body in Ebbro Team Nova's livery (who participated in the GT300 class in the 2007 JGTC), the GT500 Lexus SC430 (in various liveries), and the 2007 Raybrig NSX. = Tamtech = *Tamtech, released in 1986, is a series of smaller radio controlled cars which can be quickly assembled and driven, powered by a 7.2v battery. The first two cars released were the Porsche 962 followed shortly by the Lancia LC2. Seven 1/24 cars have been released with the other five being: BMW GTP, Ford Mustang Probe, Ferrari Testarossa, Porsche 961 and Lamborghini Countach 5000QV. Tamiya turned next to 1/14 F1 cars releasing only three: Ferrari 643, Lotus 102B and McLaren MP4/6. Finally one 1/18 monster truck, Max Climber, was made before the Tamtech line was dropped in favor of the QD ready to run cars. In 1988 Tamiya released a scale model of the Porsche 962 using the Tamtech body, however accurate, many model builders and enthusiasts of the Group C/IMSA GTP racer cited the rear bulk of the engine hatch is bigger than that of the full-sized counterpart. Much of the car's lack of real success was because the popularity of the large sized counterpart meant that there were very little demand for small-scale RC cars. The Tamtech cars would later influence other RC car manufacturers including Kyosho to build miniature RC cars, such as their own highly successful Mini-Z series and RadioShack's popular XMODS.Mini RC Cars - Micro Gas, Electric Powered Buggies, Trucks ‚Äì rccartips.com = RC Gliders = *Tamiya offers a couple of Radio Controlled gliders with wingspans around 6 ft. (2 metres). Peak Spirit has a foldable propeller that can be deployed when necessary. Alt Stream is an unpowered RC glider. = Quick Drive = The QD (Quick Drive) Series are 1:14 scale pre-built and simplified versions of Tamiya's 1/10 scale RC cars and trucks. This series was introduced in 1988 with the Thunder Shot QD aimed at bringing the joys of RC racing to children. The models were pre- assembled and supplied ready-to-run with radio gear, batteries and charger all included and featuring a two-speed gearbox. The range included versions of the Midnight Pumpkin, Manta Ray and Monster Beetle. = Solar powered cars = Tamiya, as well as building solar powered educational models, also built the first solar powered radio controlled car called the Solar Eagle SRC-6000. = Trucks and trailers (1/14 scale) = Tamiya produces 1/14 scale radio controlled trucks using ABS body shells. The trucks 540-size electric motor/3-speed transmission-combination is powerful enough to tow an adult behind the truck on a skateboard. Available in the current truck range are the following rigs: * King Hauler (also available in a pre-painted black edition) * Globeliner * Mercedes-Benz 1838LS * Mercedes-Benz 1850L (distribution truck) * Volvo FH12 Globetrotter 420 * Ford AeroMax (also available in a limited chrome edition) * Knight Hauler (also available in a limited chrome edition) * Scania R-series R 470 Highline (also available in a chrome edition and a pre- painted orange edition) * Scania R-series R 620 Highline * MAN TGX 18.540 XLX (also available in a pre-painted red edition) * MAN TGX 26.540 XLX * Mercedes- Benz Actros 1851 GigaSpace * Freightliner Cascadia Evolution * Grand Hauler The truck range also includes some 2 axle trailers \\"North American style\\": * Flatbed trailer (the basic flat trailer) * Box trailer (closed cargo trailer) * Tank trailer (liquid transport) * Pole trailer (wood/tree transport) Tamiya also offers 3 axle \\"Euro type\\" semi-trailers in their regular line-up. * European Type 3 Axle Reefer Semi Trailer * European Type 3 Axle 40 ft Intermodal container Semi-Trailer (with authentic \\"Maersk\\" container graphics) In addition, sound and lighting options are available for the trucks and semi- trailers both from Tamiya and aftermarket manufacturers. Tamiya's original light- and soundkit is the \\"MFU\\", a plug-and-play module specifically designed for their line of trucks but unfortunately this unit is very old, inaccurate and clumsy compared to those available from aftermarket manufacturers such as the Servonaut brand from German Tematik. Aftermarket manufacturers also offer a complete range of various conversion kits, including hydraulic accessories, new cabs, cab alterations, add-on details, new lights of all kinds, sound as mentioned above, and all kinds of tailored accessories from which the user can change his truck into either a truck he's seen streetside or the truck of his dreams. All around the world different clubs form to make \\"dioramas\\" that suits the 1/14-scale which they use as social gathering points and to challenge and admire other user's rigs and driving skills, and these clubs are rapidly expanding all the way from Asia through Europe to America with members of all ages. = Tanks (1/16 scale) = Tamiya's radio controlled tanks have options such as sound, light and optional parts to depict different variants. * M4 Sherman 105 mm * Leopard 1A4 * Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard * German Tiger II, Production Turret * German Tiger II ‚Äì Porsche Turret * Tiger I Early Production * M26 Pershing T26E3 * Leopard 2A6 * German Panther tank G * Jagdpanther The Leopard A4 and Flakpanzer Gepard are no longer produced; updated versions of the others have some technical and cosmetic innovations over the original models. Also the non-multi function models of the Tigers and Sherman are not made any more. The latest models (Full Option Kits) have full sound function, fire simulation (barrel moves when fired), the latest Full Option Tank (Leopard 2A6) has an upgrade part available, a barrel stabiliser which keeps the cannon level even with the tank moving. Also there is a battle function unit for sale, so you can actually fight a tank battle with another Tamiya battle function equipped 1/16 tank. These tanks utilize standard RC modules such as receivers, transmitters and servos that are same as those used in RC cars, trucks, boats, airplanes and helicopters. =Yachts (1/20 scale)= Tamiya produced a series of 1/20 scale which are highly realistic. These include: * Yamaha Round the World * Yamaha 40EX * 36 Class R/C Racing Yacht Innovator Track racing cars *The Mini 4WD and Dangun-Racer series are small (1/32 scale) single-motor (130-size) free-operating electric models designed to operate using two AA-sized batteries and run on a special deeply channeled track. Static-display scale models Tamiya held an arguable lead in the static plastic model market for many years and competed with other classic brands like Revell and Airfix, but recently Chinese makers such as Dragon (DML) and Trumpeter are offering fierce competition. =Military Vehicles (1/35)= The oldest category in Tamiya's export line has been the \\"Military Miniatures\\" series of 1:35 scale figures and vehicles. The series has focused on World War II military subjects, though a growing minority of kits in this line come from later periods. The collection of German vehicles is especially strong. The products are characterized by striking full colour paintings on the boxtops. Tamiya moulds are generally quite clean and almost no flash is found on their products. It was Tamiya themselves that established the use of 1/35 scale for military models. The scale was the result of the design of their first tank kit, the motorized Panther tank, being designed just large enough to contain the motor assembly and battery pack. In addition to vehicles themselves the category includes soldiers, weapons sets and scenery items (e.g., brick walls, signs, barricades) for use in dioramas. In the 1990s Dragon (DML) kits used to be generally inferior to Tamiya. Dragon's quality has improved and they have elected to compete in the high quality end of the market offering photo etched parts, aluminum barrels, individual track links, and upwards of 500 parts. Another Chinese maker, Trumpeter is also competing from lower end of the market. Tamiya's kits use vinyl tracks but Tamiya's recent inclusion of two kinds of tracks (vinyl and molded plastic) suggest that Tamiya is following the trend set by other manufacturers. As Trumpeter's quality improves, Tamiya's static military lines are being pressured from both the high end and the low end. Tamiya has found a niche market of 1/48 scale military miniatures, designed as a smaller alternative to the larger 1/35 kits. As the average Japanese house is smaller than those amongst other nations, smaller kits that can be neatly put into smaller kit boxes after assembly and stored away are proven to be more popular by necessity. Utilizing the specifications of their 1/35 kits, many parts in 1/48 scale kits are simply scaled-down versions of their 1/35 counterpart, with a notable exception of tracks being molded in plastic in 1/48, instead of somewhat less detailed vinyl tracks often seen in 1/35 kits. Early kits from this series featured metallic chassis, which served to add weight to the models of this smaller scale. Tamiya has put out an average of 1 new kit a month since the launch of the series as a way of blocking entry into the 1/48 scale market for Chinese makers. As of 2015, over 80 models are available from Tamiya in 1/48 scale, representing mainly the popular World War II tanks and vehicles. HobbyBoss, another Chinese maker, offers 1/48 tanks with full interior details for about the same price. In the traditional 1/35 scale military miniature market Tamiya is offering innovations such as suspensions made to articulate using real springs. However these offerings are not substantial or unique enough to give Tamiya the clear dominance it once had in the static miniature market. More over many Chinese model makers offer numerous outstanding kits every year which pressures Tamiya's static 1/35 line. Because of their visibility as a leader Tamiya can highlight obscure vehicles that no other makers are willing to build. The Sturmtiger 38 cm, for example, was an obscure vehicle and only a handful of the massive mortar tanks were built in real life but Tamiya still introduced it to the market. Although numerous and powerful the Char B was not a very glamorous tank and no other major maker was willing to invest in it. In this role of supporting more obscure models Tamiya manages a wide-ranging product line and so continues to lead the market. =Aircraft= Their line of static model aircraft, primarily in 1/48 scale, are widely considered to be state-of-the-art. The 1990s release of the Spitfire, for example, had great ease of construction and attention to detail with the new molds having very fine raised details. Many of the same aircraft have been repeated in 1/72 scale to a similar standard, with a few subjects only available in this scale. Within Japan the 1/72 scale line includes a large number of re-badged Italeri kits, which are priced significantly lower than Tamiya originals. Tamiya is also one of the few manufacturers of 1/100 scale aircraft. Originally called the 'Minijet Series, consisting of jet fighters plus a B-52, it was terminated in the 1980s but revived in 2004 and renamed the Combat Jet Series. Tamiya used to produce a few 1/32 scale kits. In aircraft models Tamiya offers a few clear skinned kits showing interior parts of aircraft. A few motorized kits are available also which feature spinning props. Some kits even include sound effect modules. Tamiya's aircraft kits often include metal weights that prevent the aircraft from sitting on their tails. Compared to other kits such as Hasegawa, where the builder has to glue in bearings or fishing line weights, Tamiya's kits are convenient. Some kits produced recently can be made with detachable wingtips and landing gears. They also come in a box that can be turned into a raised box that could safely house the finished model after its completion. These gimmicks and often cleverly designed simpler construction help Tamiya stay on top of the miniature aircraft market. As with many other Japanese model makers dealing with WWII weapons Tamiya also prefers to focus on Japanese weapons first, due to the considerable size of the Japanese domestic market: The 1/48 scale P-47 Thunderbolt, one of the most famous WWII fighters, has been produced only recently, while the Hellcat, an American naval fighter, is yet to be produced. The Japanese Zero fighter was the first to be produced in 1/48 scale and the first prop fighter added to the larger 1/32 scale in 2006 is once again the Japanese Zero. In 2009, Tamiya introduced its 1:32 scale Supermarine Spitfire Mk. IXc,http://tamiya.com/english/products/60319spitfire_mkixc/index.htm and North American Aviation P-51D Mustang http://tamiya.com/english/products/60322mustang/index.htm model kits. These were soon accompanied by the Spitfire Mk. VIII and XVI variants,http://tamiya.com/english/products/60320spitfire_mk8/index.htm#78026http://tamiya.com/english/products/60321spitfire_mkxvle/index.htm and a further P-51K variant in the same scale.http://tamiya.com/english/products/60323mustang_pacific/index.htm Tamiya designed the models with great attention to detail, and went so far as to include a complete scale models of the fighter's Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 engine. Innovative features of the models include the need to build and mount the scale Merlin to allow the fitment of magnet-held detachable engine cover panels; The option post-construction of displaying the model with retracted or extended undercarriage; and the inclusion of an incredibly fine and very well detailed cockpit. Reviews of the Spitfire and Mustang found little to fault with the kits. Model building reviewers have praised the kit of the Spitfires in particular for their fidelity of form, and near-completeness of execution.http://modelingmadness.com/review/allies/cleaver/gb/tmct9c.htm The model's complexity and detail even gave rise to publications devoted explicitly to their construction and finishing.http://www.hyperscale.com/2016/reviews/books/howtobuildspitfire3rdeditionbookreviewbf_1.htm In 2014, Tamiya followed the single engined fighters with the 1:32 scale DeHavilland Mosquito FB.IV.http://tamiya.com/english/products/60326/index.htm This also makes of the Merlin Engine model included in the earlier single engined fighters, as well as an equally detailed interior. It met with similar critical acclaim to that of the Spitfire and P-51D models, and also gave rise to book publication specific to its completion by modellers. =Automobiles= They produce many model car kits including road cars, sports racing cars, World Rally Championship cars, and Formula One racing cars. Usually these are 1/24 scale although the Formula One kits are 1/20 scale. A few street, racing, and F1 kits are also produced in 1/12 scale including the Ferrari 641/2, McLaren Honda MP4/6, and Williams Renault FW14B. The cars in the 1:20 Grand Prix Collection in order of manufacture are: *Tyrrell P34 Six Wheeler - 20001 *McLaren M23 - 20002 *Porsche 928 - 20003 *Team Lotus J.P.S.Mk.III - 20004 *Martini Porsche 935 Turbo - 20005 *Wolf WR-1 Ford - 20006 *Brabham BT46 Alfa Romeo - 20007 *Porsche 935 Turbo - 20008 *Toyota Celica LB Turbo Gr.5 - 20009 *Ferrari F312T3 - 20010 *Racing Pit Team - 20011 *Ligier JS11 Ford - 20012 *Fiat 131 Abarth Rally - 20013 *Williams FW-07 - 20014 *Fiat 131 Monte-Carlo Winner - 20015 *Porsche 928S - 20016 *Brabham BT50 BMW Turbo - 20017 *Renault RE-30B Turbo - 20018 *Williams FW-11 Honda - 20019 *Lotus Honda 99T - 20020 *Benetton Ford B188 - 20021 *McLaren MP4/4 - 20022 *Ferrari F189 Early Version - 20023 *Ferrari F189 Portuguese G.P. - 20024 *Williams FW13B - 20025 *McLaren MP4/5B - 20026 *Driver & Tech.

Full versions offer full hulls whereas waterline versions have flat bottoms, representing only the portion seen above the waterline giving the impression that the ship is floating when placed on a surface, which is more convenient in creating dioramas. The majority of the kits in the 1/700 waterline series are WWII Imperial Japanese Navy ships but there are also kits of WWII ships from other countries such as Germany, Britain, and the United States. The 1/700 waterline series battleship U.S.S. Missouri is 386.5 mm (15.2 inches) long1/700 U.S. Navy Battleship BB-63 Missouri with 1/350 battleships twice as long. Other 1/350 ships include the Yamato, Musashi, Bismarck, Tirpitz, USS New Jersey, USS Enterprise, HMS Prince of Wales, and more recent additions mainly on WW2 Japanese warships such as the Tone, Mogami, Mikuma, Yukikaze, and I-400 submarine. In addition the series has a few modern vessels such as the vehicle transport ship Shimokita with a transparent deck to allow viewing of the loaded hovercrafts, tanks and trucks inside.1/700 Shimokita Tamiya Racing Factory Tamiya and their racing team, Tamiya Racing Factory (TRF), have evolved into one of the most successful racing teams on the electric scene of worldwide R/C racing over the last few years. They are most famous for their work in the field of 1/10 scale electric touring car racing. In 1999, at the request of many Tamiya enthusiasts, Tamiya started work on a car made purely for racing to replace their aging, gear-driven TA03R-TRF and TA03F David Jun Edition cars. The car that resulted was the TRF414X (built in very small numbers), which evolved into the TRF414M, and then to the more popular TRF414M2 (and the budget-oriented TA04 series), all employing the then-novel twin-belt drivetrain layout, with the center layshaft mounted above the motor. The TRF team's reputation shot up after the 3rd IFMAR ISTC world championships in Mogale City, South Africa, in 2002. The Thai driver Surikarn Chaidajsuriya shocked the world by winning the world championships driving a modified Tamiya TRF414M. The car he used was eventually released to the public as the TRF414M-World Championship Replica, of which only 1500 were built making it one of the more desirable Tamiya kits from the last 5 years. Since 2002 the TRF division has continuously been growing with an expanded team in Japan and worldwide. In late 2002 Tamiya released their third shaft driven car called TB Evolution III (or TB Evo3) which won the YamaYama Cup in Japan two months later, with Satoshi Maezumi at the wheel. On the European scene the Dane Steen Graversen, along with Surikarn Chaidajsuriya and team manager Kiyokazu Suzuki, managed to join the A-main of the big LRP Masters race in Germany during April 2003. Surikarn then won both the 23T stock and the Modified classes in the Thailand International Touring Car championships (TITC) using an updated TB Evo3. Surikarn's Evo3 was eventually released to the public as the limited- edition TB Evo3 Surikarn Edition (SE) to commemorate the victory. It features red anodized aluminum components, new upper arm mounts, titanium turnbuckles and screws, delrin differential halves, a thicker 3 mm carbon chassis, and a new one-way carbon gear brace. The TB Evo3 SE was eventually replaced with the TB Evo4 in the first half of 2004. The Evo4 addressed the Evo3 owner's complaints about their car's bevel gear durability by incorporating a three- piece center shaft design, doing away with the Evo3's single-piece center shaft. The Evo4 was also equipped with Tamiya's lightweight reversible suspension set, incorporating smaller wheel bearings, stiffer material and reversible longer suspension arms which allows more cornering speed and more precise adjustment of the car's suspension characteristics. The same year Tamiya discovered a new young star, a boy named Marc Rheinard from Germany. Rheinard debuted at the indoor race DHI Cup of 2004 with Tamiya's new belt driven car (designed in conjunction with Tech Racing) the TRF415. He and Steen Graversen finished 2nd and 3rd, proving the capability of this newly designed chassis. Two months later Rheinard won the LRP Masters world's best drivers. Things looked good for the upcoming 4th World Championships in Florida, USA. Few believed that Rheinard would actually win the world championships at the age of 17, but he did. Tamiya took their new and improved version of TRF415, the TRF415MS which stands for Maezumi Satoshi, one of the car's designers and a Tamiya factory driver. The new car had improved handling characteristics on asphalt through the adoption of a thinner chassis and the Evo4's lightweight reversible suspension. Rheinard took pole position and won two of the three A-mains. The other Tamiya driver in the top ten was former world champion Surikarn, driving the TB Evo4, who finished 9th. After the 2004 World Championship Tamiya released the upgrade kit for the 415 containing the direct center pulley (as opposed to the center one-way included in the standard 415 and 415MS kits) and narrowed suspension mounts, further improving the 415 handling and acceleration. In early 2005 Tamiya released an updated version of the TB Evo4, called the TB Evo4MS. The Evo4MS was equipped with one-piece aluminium bulkheads (as opposed to the Evo4's 4-piece bulkhead), aluminium center brace and one-piece center shaft input cups (as opposed to plastic ones in the Evo4). In July 2005 Tamiya further updated the TRF415MS by releasing the TRF415MSX. They released both as a conversion kit (for older 415s) and as a complete kit. The design featured a three-piece bulkhead for easy maintenance, a lowered and shortened upper deck that runs under the belt, and the removal of the middle decks ‚Äî all of which contributed to a lower center of gravity and an increased \\"tweak\\" resistance. Marc won the World's Warm-Up in April 2006 with a revised version of the MSX sporting a new set of lowered rear bulkheads, shock towers, and steering mechanism. Unfortunately he only placed 4th overall in the 5th IFMAR ISTC World Championships held in August 2006 in Collegno, Italy, but his car was eventually released to the public as the limited-edition, asphalt-racing TRF415MSX Marc Rheinard Edition (MRE) in August 2006. It incorporated new alternated (having more widely spaced teeth) pulleys, a new lightweight delrin solid front axle, new internal drive ratios (through the adoption of the new pulleys), and the new steering mechanism. In July 2006 Tamiya released the TB Evolution 5, their next-generation gear- driven touring car, replacing the Evo4 MS. The Evo5 did away with the Evo4's front main shaft input cup, using a CV joint instead (but retaining a rear input cup), and also incorporates the new short arms for the lightweight suspension, which further increased the cornering speed and helped sharpen the car's turn-in. It was also equipped with a new, more precise steering mechanism (seen also in the TRF415MSX MRE), and a lowered top deck. In November 2006 Tamiya ceased the production of the MRE and released the updated TRF415MSXX. This car returned to the standard front one-way differential (unlike the solid axle included in the MRE) and came with new thinner upper and lower decks (altering the chassis flex characteristics), and a new aluminum air scoop to help cool the motor. Supplies and Tools Tamiya manufactures acrylic and enamel-based modelling paints, sprays and painting pens. Tamiya manufactures supplies such as putty, solvent, and modelling tools. They also provide upkeep equipment for their RC models, such as grease for the working gear boxes, work tables, airbrush stands and turn tables. Tamiya's paints, like all their products, are recognised as superior quality. Tamiya released a line of \\"weathering\\" kits which allow the user to easily and quickly give their models the impression they have been damaged, have rusted or have been through a long service life.Tamiya Online Seller General- purpose simple-model construction sets Tamiya also offers an extensive line of \\"sturdy plastic\\" basic construction sets (as one division of the GeniuSeries) for building very simple battery-powered \\"working\\" models, such as a mobile claw-lifter, bulldozer, fork lift, crawler-type vehicles with multiple tank-treads, and toy \\"robots\\" -- all usually operated by an equally simple wired remote-control. (There is at least one high-end model with radio- control however.Robot Construction Set - 3ch Radio Control - Includes 4-channel transmitter and receiver) While some of these model \\"kits\\" can be used alone or in combination to create other things as desired, the product line also features many small general-purpose sets of parts like various plates and beams, wheels and axles, pulleys, chain drives, various remote- controls, and link-style tank treads with sprockets, as well as several types of motors (some waterproofWaterproof gearbox and motor) and gearboxes (some with multiple speed/torque configurations)Gearbox with multiple speed- configurations In addition, some models also feature special parts like cams and flywheelsA model with both cam and flywheel. Though the appearance of most of the parts themselves is somewhat similar to Lego Technic, the build process and end result is much more like Erector Set since parts are actually fastened together with bolts through an array of available mounting holes (or in some cases with preassigned screws or glue) rather than merely snap-fit; and finished models remain very skeletal, having no outer shell or hull. Although kit-instructions even show steps at the level of gearbox and controller assembly, on at least some models some structural and/or non-structural parts are actually made of pre-drilled wood, and may need to be glued togetherAssembling gearbox and controller but gluing wooden parts; for example the wooden main base-plate of the #70108 Tracked Vehicle Chassis KitColor pictures appearing to show base-plate has woodgrainInstructions, Page 5: Japanese caption for chassis plate seems to add \\"(wooden)\\" The wired remote- control is generally at most 2+1 \\"channels\\" and controls 2 independent motors for driving (thus permitting standard 8-direction movement: F, FL, FR, B, BL, BR, CW, CCW) plus 1 motor for operating a feature such as the claw-arm of the mobile claw-lifter (though claw-grip is alas mechanically rigged to arm position.) Overall, Tamiya models should be somewhat sturdier than equivalent Erector Set models due to their thicker parts, and both should be sturdier than Lego Technic due to their physical fastenings rather than simple snap- fit, but both Erector Set and Lego Technic are much more flexible thanks to their complete lack of single-purpose part-joining points, self-tapping screws, and the need to glue parts. Other In the 1980s Tamiya introduced a Programmable logic controller for their moving models. It used the TMS1100 4-bit Microcontroller.Tamiya microcontroller developed by TI.

It was soon followed by the removal from the air of the people Berlusconi had referred to: journalists Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro, and comedian Daniele Luttazzi.  Statement  = English translation =  Aftermath  After this statement, the then-new management of RAI cancelled Biagi's, Santoro's and Luttazzi's respective shows, officially because \\"they were no longer competitive\\" (though the figures portrayed very good results). Biagi and Santoro were allowed to work with RAI after Berlusconi's House of Freedoms was defeated in the 2006 Italian general election, but Daniele Luttazzi is still banned from RAI. He went back on television briefly when the La7 network hired him in 2007. = Aftermath for Enzo Biagi = Enzo Biagi began a controversy with the RAI, and initially his show, Il fatto (The Fact) was moved to a late time, then moved to the channel Rai Tre and in the end cancelled. Feeling himself mocked by the RAI, he decided not to renegotiate his contract with the network. The contract expired on December 31, 2002. Biagi continued to criticize Berlusconi in Italy's leading newspaper, Il Corriere della Sera, and was defended by the direction of the newspaper in an argument with Berlusconi. from Republica, May 21, 2006 He reappeared on television on May 26, 2005, when he was interviewed by Fabio Fazio for Che tempo che fa of Rai Tre. He returned to Fazio's program twice. He was invited to the show Rockpolitic along with Luttazzi and Santoro for an episode about freedom of press, but he and Luttazzi declined to appear, because the show was on Rai1, whose director approved of \\"Editto Bulgaro\\". On April 22, 2007 he returned to TV with a program called RT - Rotocalco Televisivo (Television Magazine), but after seven episodes he could not continue due to his worsening health. He died ten days afterwards, on November 6, 2007, in Milan, at the age of 87. = Aftermath for Michele Santoro = Forza Italia, Berlusconi's party, sued RAI because of Santoro's show on six separate counts, which led to Santoro's dismissal. Santoro sued RAI for unfair dismissal, and won the case in 2005, with a compensation of ‚Ç¨1,400,000 and the reintegration in the same time range in TV with the program Anno Zero., (IT) Condanna della RAI per licenziamento Santoro, from \\"Il Corriere della Sera\\" = Aftermath for Daniele Luttazzi = Luttazzi's show Satyricon was suspended in December 2002. Satyricon had high shares, with audience peaks of 7.5 million.Daniele Luttazzi Smemorati di sinistra, il manifesto 16 September 2009 Officially, the suspension of Luttazzi's show, as well as of Biagi's, were motivated by the necessity of RAI to counter the competition (its main competitor being Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset). Moreover, Luttazzi's show had already generated controversy at least on two separate occasions: in parodying David Letterman, he sniffed actress Anna Falchi's panties after she'd taken them off and given them to him; in a later show, he simulated coprophagia (actually eating chocolate). Such episodes were later used among the official motivations for the suspension of the show. On the other hand, Luttazzi claims the real reason was his interview of journalist Marco Travaglio, aired before the official start of the 2001 general elections campaign (an Italian law forbids to discuss political themes ‚Äì outside political debates and ads ‚Äì after the campaign has started). In this interview, Travaglio talked about his book L'odore dei soldi (\\"The smell of money\\"), in which he questioned the obscure origin of Berlusconi's wealth at the beginning of his career, and the alleged liaisons of him and one of his closest aides (Marcello Dell'Utri) with the Mafia. (Dell'Utri is currently serving a seven-year prison term: he has been found guilty of complicity in conspiracy with the Mafia.) Following the interview, in fact, Luttazzi and Travaglio were sued separately by Berlusconi, his party Forza Italia, the enterprises Fininvest and Mediaset (directly linked to Berlusconi). The two were accused of having damaged Berlusconi's image during the campaign as well as the image of the above-mentioned enterprises. Both Luttazzi and Travaglio were later ruled not guilty (according to the judges, all they had told in the interview was based on true facts and documents, and the interview took place before the official beginning of the campaign). A later edition of L'odore dei soldi triumphantly read on the cover \\"the authors released [from any accusation], Berlusconi ruled to pay for legal expenses\\". Luttazzi is still banned from RAI. He went back on TV in 2007, when the network La7 hosted some episodes of his new show, Decameron, until its abrupt cancellation in December. The official motivation was a crude joke addressed to journalist Giuliano Ferrara, a well-known supporter of Berlusconi and former Minister for the Relationship [of the government] with the Parliament. Ferrara hosted his own show on La7, Otto e Mezzo (\\"Half past Eight\\", after the time at which the show usually aired), and the network claimed that Luttazzi, by offending him with the above-mentioned joke, had gone too far. Luttazzi claimed the alleged offence to Ferrara was a scapegoat, as the opening monologue in the next episode of his show, already taped, was focusing on the pope, Luttazzi hinting that the network wanted to prevent that episode from being aired. 2012: Luttazzi wins his legal battle against La7. La7 shall pay Luttazzi 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros.

Of the three small pyramid complexes built around that of the chief pyramid of Pepi II, Neith's is the largest. Neith's pyramid may have been the first one constructed among the queen's pyramids associated with Pepi II. Neith's pyramid complex included a small temple, a satellite pyramid and a fleet of sixteen wooden boats buried between the main and satellite pyramid. The entrance to the enclosure was flanked by two inscribed obelisks. Neith's burial chamber and was inscribed with Pyramid Texts. This is the second known occurrence of these texts in a queen's pyramid, the first being those of Ankhenespepy II. The burial chamber contained a red granite sarcophagus (empty) and a canopic chest.M.

She arrived on the literary scene in 1981 as an illustrator for Atheneum, Putnam, and other publishing houses. Over the course of the last three decades, she has been a prolific illustrator and has written and illustrated several well-received books of her own. Biography Primavera was born in West Long Branch, New Jersey. As a young girl, her brother, whom she admired greatly as an artist, taught her to draw a tree and a simple cartoon. She began copying cartoons she found in comic books, drawing on anything she could find, including her school books, her desks, and even getting in trouble for drawing on her clothing. Her interest in art grew more serious during the summer after she turned 11, when she contracted rheumatic fever and was confined to bed for the entire summer. During the enforced physical inactivity, she used the time to refine her drawing ability by working through several \\"learn-to-draw\\" books. Her childhood goal was to become an Olympic rider, and after she recovered from her illness and was no longer bedridden, she was rekindled her love for horseback riding. During her childhood, she became an admirer of the works of great artists, particularly that of Michelangelo, as her parents had large replicas of his paintings that she particularly enjoyed. She specifically credits the period when she was ill for motivating her to develop her artistic skills in a serious way. She also enjoyed the work of Howard Pyle, an artist she discovered on a trip to the college art museum. After a visit to an art museum during college, she set aside her dream of becoming an Olympian to focus full-time on becoming an artist. Primavera lived for a time in Red Bank, New Jersey, but she currently resides in New York City. She is not married. Career While Primavera displayed an interest in art from a very young age, she has said in Talking With Artists, \\"I can't say I ever really dreamed I'd grow up to be an artist.\\" Instead, she had focused from a young age on becoming an Olympic horseback rider. During college, she turned her artistic talents to fashion illustration, but she realized quickly that beginning a career in this field was very difficult.. After college, she gave up this pursuit, and decided to become an artist. Her first published work appeared in 1981, with the release of The Mermaid's Cape and The Snug Little House, which she illustrated. Her first work as an author, Basil and Maggie, was published in 1983. Primavera has stated that she gets her best ideas while taking showers. She wrote the book Auntie Claus in 1999, after one such \\"shower session.\\" According to The New York Times, her illustrations in that book \\"brim with fantastic energy\\" and, in fact, were of such quality that dioramas based upon the illustrations appeared in the window of the flagship Saks Fifth Avenue stores in Manhattan.. In 2005, Primavera was chosen to create the art for the White House's Holiday Program. Her first novel-length work, The Secret Order of the Gumm Street Girls, was released in 2006, and in recent years, she has been very prolific, releasing two books in the Fred and Anthony series in 2007, with two more set to be released in 2008. She is also working on another book about the Gumm Street Girls.

Relations in the post-apartheid era are quite strong as the ruling parties in both states, the African National Congress in South Africa and the MPLA in Angola, fought together during the Angolan Civil War and South African Border War. They fought against UNITA rebels, based in Angola, and the apartheid-era government in South Africa which supported them. Nelson Mandela mediated between the MPLA and UNITA during the final years of the Angolan Civil War. Although South Africa was preponderant in terms of relative capabilities during the late twentieth century, the recent growth of Angola has led to a more balanced relation.Schenoni, Luis (2017) \\"Subsystemic Unipolarities?\\"in Strategic Analysis, 41(1): 74-86 1970s The South African government informed rebel leaders Jonas Savimbi and Holden Roberto in early November 1975 that the South African Defence Force (SADF) would soon end operations in Angola despite the coalition's failure to capture Luanda and therefore secure international recognition at independence. Savimbi, desperate to avoid the withdrawal of the largest, friendly, military force in Angola, asked General Constand Viljoen to arrange a meeting for him with South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Savimbi's ally since October 1974. On the night of November 10, the night before independence, Savimbi secretly flew to Pretoria, South Africa and the meeting took place. In a remarkable reversal of policy, Vorster not only agreed to keep troops through November but promised to withdraw the SADF troops only after the OAU meeting on December 9. The Soviets, well aware of South African activity in southern Angola, flew Cuban soldiers into Luanda the week before independence. While Cuban officers led the mission and provided the bulk of the troop force, 60 Soviet officers in the Congo joined the Cubans on November 12. The Soviet leadership expressly forbid the Cubans from intervening in Angola's civil war, focusing the mission on containing South Africa. In 1975 and 1976 most foreign forces, with the exception of Cuba, withdrew. The last elements of the Portuguese military withdrew in 1975 and the South African military withdrew in February 1976. On the other hand, Cuba's troop force in Angola increased from 5,500 in December 1975 to 11,000 in February 1976. FNLA forces were crushed by Operation Carlota, a joint Cuban-Angolan attack on Huambo on January 30, 1976.Angola Reds on Outskirts of Pro-Western capital city, January 30, 1976. The Argus, page 10, via NewspaperArchive.com. By mid-November, the Huambo government had gained control over southern Angola and began pushing north.Porter, Bruce D. The USSR in Third World Conflicts: Soviet Arms and Diplomacy in Local Wars, , 1986. Page 149. On July 5, 1979, Angolan President Agostinho Neto issued a decree requiring all citizens to serve in the military for three years upon turning the age of eighteen. The government gave a report to the UN estimating $293 million in property damage from South African attacks between 1976 and 1979, asking for compensation on August 3, 1979. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Cabinda, a Cabindan separatist rebel group, attacked a Cuban base near Tshiowa on August 11.Kalley (1999). Page 12. 1980s SWAPO's and South Africa's operations (1978-1980) In the 1980s, fighting spread outward from southeastern Angola, where most of the fighting had taken place in the 1970s, as the National Congolese Army (ANC) and SWAPO increased their activity. The South African government responded by sending troops back into Angola, intervening in the war from 1981 to 1987, prompting the Soviet Union to deliver massive amounts of military aid from 1981 to 1986. In 1981, newly elected United States President Ronald Reagan's U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Chester Crocker, developed a linkage policy, tying Namibian independence to Cuban withdrawal and peace in Angola. The South African military attacked insurgents in Cunene Province on May 12, 1980. The Angolan Ministry of Defense accused the South African government of wounding and killing civilians. Nine days later, the SADF attacked again, this time in Cuando-Cubango, and the MPLA threatened to respond militarily. The SADF launched a full-scale invasion of Angola through Cunene and Cuando-Cubango on June 7, destroying SWAPO's operational command headquarters on June 13, in what Prime Minister Botha described as a \\"shock attack\\". The Angolan government arrested 120 Angolans who were planning to set off explosives in Luanda, on June 24, foiling a plot purportedly orchestrated by the South African government. Three days later, the United Nations Security Council convened at the behest of Angola's ambassador to the UN, E. de Figuerido, and condemned South Africa's incursions into Angola. President Mobutu of Zaire also sided with the MPLA. The Angolan government recorded 529 instances in which South African forces violated Angola's territorial sovereignty between January and June 1980. Cuba increased its 35,000-strong troop force in Angola from 35,000 in 1982 to 40,000 in 1985. South African forces tried to capture Lubango, capital of Hu√≠la province, in Operation Askari in December 1983. =Democratic International= On June 2, 1985, American conservative activists held the Democratic International, a largely symbolic meeting of anti-Communist militants, at UNITA's headquarters in Jamba, Angola. Primarily funded by Rite Aid founder Lewis Lehrman and organized by anti-Communist activists Jack Abramoff and Jack Wheeler, participants included Savimbi, Adolfo Calero, leader of the Nicaraguan Contras, Pa Kao Her, Hmong Laotian rebel leader, U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, South African security forces, Abdurrahim Wardak, Afghan Mujahideen leader, Jack Wheeler, American conservative policy advocate, and many others. While the Reagan administration, though unwilling to publicly support the meeting, privately expressed approval. The governments of Israel and South Africa supported the idea, but both respective countries were deemed inadvisable for hosting the conference. The United States House of Representatives voted 236 to 185 to repeal the Clark Amendment on July 11, 1985. The Angolan government began attacking UNITA later that month from Luena towards Cazombo along the Benguela Railway, taking Cazombo on September 18. The government tried unsuccessfully to take UNITA's supply depot in Mavinga from Menongue. While the attack failed, very different interpretations of the attack emerged. UNITA claimed Portuguese-speaking Soviet officers led government troops while the government said UNITA relied on South African paratroopers to defeat the government. The South African government admitted to fighting in the area, but said its troops fought SWAPO militants. UNITA forces attacked Camabatela in Cuanza Norte province on February 8, 1986. ANGOP alleged UNITA massacred civilians in Damba in U√≠ge Province later that month, on February 26. The South African government agreed to Crocker's terms in principle on March 8. Savimbi proposed a truce regarding the Benguela railway on March 26, saying MPLA trains could pass through as long as an international inspection group monitored trains to prevent their use for counter-insurgency activity. The government did not respond. The Angolan and American governments began negotiating in June 1987.Kalley (1999). Page 36. =Cuito Cuanavale and New York City= Cuando Cubango province UNITA and South African forces attacked the MPLA's base at Cuito Cuanavale in Cuando Cubango province from January 13 to March 23, 1988, in the second largest battle in the history of Africa,George (2005). Page 1. after the Battle of El Alamein, the largest in sub-Saharan Africa since World War II.Alao (1994). Pages 33-34. Cuito Cuanavale's importance came not from its size or its wealth but its location. Capturing the city would open the path for the Cubans and MPLA to UNITA's headquarters at Jamba. UNITA and South Africa retreated after a 15-hour battle on March 23. The Cuban government joined negotiations on January 28, 1988, and all three parties held a round of negotiations on March 9. The South African government, joined negotiations on May 3 due to the military stalemate at Cuito Cuanavale and the parties met in June and August in New York City and Geneva. All parties agreed to a ceasefire on August 8. Representatives from the governments of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa signed the Tripartite Accord, granting independence to Namibia and ending the direct involvement of foreign troops in the civil war, in New York City, United States on December 22, 1988. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 626 later that day, creating the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, a UN peacekeeping force. UNAVEM troops began arriving in Angola in January 1989. On August 23, 1989, Angolan President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos complained that the U.S. and South African governments continued to fund UNITA, warning such activity endangered the already fragile ceasefire. The next day Savimbi announced UNITA would no longer abide by the ceasefire, citing Kaunda's insistence that Savimbi leave the country and UNITA disband. The government responded to Savimbi's statement by moving troops from Cuito Cuanavale, under government control, to UNITA-occupied Mavinga. The ceasefire broke down with dos Santos and the U.S. government blaming each other for the resumption in armed conflict.Kalley (1999). Page 46. =Red Scorpion= Anti- communist activist Jack Abramoff wrote and co-produced the film Red Scorpion with his brother Robert in 1989. Dolph Lundgren played Nikolai, a Soviet agent sent to assassinate an African revolutionary in a country modeled on Angola. The film has a strongly anti-Communist message, and goes to great lengths to depict the sadism and violence of the Soviets, including a scene in which chemical weapons are used. The South African government financed the film through the International Freedom Foundation, a front-group chaired by Abramoff, as part of its efforts to undermine international sympathy for the African National Congress. 1990s Political changes abroad and military victories at home allowed the government to transition from a nominally communist state to a nominally democratic one. Namibia's declaration of independence, internationally recognized on April 1, eliminated the southwestern front of combat as South African forces withdrew to the east. Then, in a series of stunning victories, UNITA regained control over Caxito, Huambo, M'banza Kongo, Ndalatando, and U√≠ge, provincial capitals it had not held since 1976, and moved against Kuito, Luena, and Malange. Although the U.S. and South African governments had stopped aiding UNITA, supplies continued to come from Mobutu in Zaire.Hodges (2004). Pages 15-16. UNITA tried to wrest control of Cabinda from the MPLA in January 1993. Edward DeJarnette, Head of the U.S. Liaison Office in Angola for the Clinton Administration, warned Savimbi that, if UNITA hindered or halted Cabinda's production, the U.S. would end its support for UNITA. On January 9, UNITA began a 55-day-long battle over Huambo, the War of the Cities. Hundreds of thousands fled and 10,000 were killed before UNITA gained control on March 7. The government engaged in an ethnic cleansing of Bakongo, and, to a lesser extent Ovimbundu, in multiple cities, most notably Luanda, on January 22 in the Bloody Friday massacre. UNITA and government representatives met five days later in Ethiopia, but negotiations failed to restore the peace. The United Nations Security Council sanctioned UNITA through Resolution 864 on September 15, 1993, prohibiting the sale of weapons or fuel to UNITA. Perhaps the clearest shift in U.S. foreign policy emerged when President Clinton issued Executive Order 12865 on September 23, labeling UNITA a \\"continuing threat to the foreign policy objectives of the U.S.\\". By August 1993, UNITA had gained control over 70% of Angola, but the government's military successes in 1994 forced UNITA to sue for peace. By November 1994, the government had taken control of 60% of the country. Savimbi called the situation UNITA's \\"deepest crisis\\" since its creation.Rothchild (1997). Pages 137-138. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on November 15, 1994, to boost support symbolically for the Lusaka Protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both said they would be willing to meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come. Savimbi met with South African President Nelson Mandela in May. Shortly after, on June 18, the MPLA offered Savimbi the position of Vice President under dos Santos with another Vice President chosen from the MPLA. Savimbi told Mandela he felt ready to \\"serve in any capacity which will aid my nation,\\" but he did not accept the proposal until August 12. By 1998, the UN had identified the role of conflict diamonds in the financing of UNITA's ongoing war, and passed a number of resolutions imposing sanctions with the object of targeting this illicit trade; United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1173, 1176, 1237 and 1295 followed. 2000s In 2009, South African President Jacob Zuma led a delegation of 11 cabinet ministers to Angola. It was the new President's first official State Visit and was seen by experts as very important to the strengthening of relations between the two countries.Zuma Set for First Official State Visit Voice of America, 18 August 2009 In 2016, trade between Angola and South Africa was worth US$1.83 billion. South African exports to Angola amounted to US$562.9 million and Angolan exports to South Africa amounted to US$1.27 billion.https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/ZAF/Year/LTST/TradeFlow/Export/Partner/by- country/Product/Total References External links *South African Embassy Angola South Africa Category:Bilateral relations of South Africa ","title":"Angola‚ÄìSouth Africa relations"},{"id":"14911676","text":"The CANT 6 was a flying boat designed for Italian military service in 1925.

As such, it was also referred to as Starlight Park Stadium. The 15,000-seat edifice was used for circuses, boxing, political rallies, opera, and midget auto racing. The Coliseum hosted the defunct Eastern Hockey League's Bronx Tigers franchise for two seasons, 1933‚Äì34, and 1937‚Äì38. In late 1939, it was the home of the New York Giants of the short-lived National Professional Indoor Baseball League. The United States Army controlled the building from 1942 through 1946, after which it was used by New York City Transit Authority buses as the Coliseum Depot.

These compounds were first described by John WallaceJohn Wallace, Professor, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Calgary and colleagues. CINODs are compounds generated by the fusion of an existing NSAID with a nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety by chemical means, usually by ester linkage. CINODs retain the anti-inflammatory efficacy of NSAIDs via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) while arguably improving upon gastric and vascular safety, most likely via vasorelaxation, inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and inhibition of caspases, all known effects of NO. The first CINODs were developed in the 1990s, and as yet none have been approved for use by the general public. The importance of developing such drugs was increased when COX-2-specific NSAIDs rofecoxib (Vioxx) and lumiracoxib (Prexige) were removed from major pharmaceutical markets in the mid-2000s due to vascular safety concerns. In addition, traditional NSAIDs increase blood pressure and interfere with the actions of antihypertensive drugs. Several CINODs are currently being tested in clinical trials, the most advanced of which are being conducted by the French pharmaceutical company NicOx, whose flagship compound naproxcinod (NO-naproxen, nitronaproxen) is in phase III trials for the treatment of osteoarthritis.HCT 3012 - COX-Inhibiting Nitric Oxide-Donator (CINOD) for Relief of Pain and Inflammation Naproxcinod is a fusion of naproxen and a NO-donating group.

There are some Bible verses that abusers use to justify discipline of their wives. Abuse within marriage Christian groups and authorities generally condemn domestic violence as inconsistent with the general Christian duty to love others and to the scriptural relationship between husband and wife.Tracy, Steven. \\"Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse\\". Christianity Today (February 2003). (Accessed January 3, 2015) =Relationship between husband and wife= According to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, \\"Men who abuse often use Ephesians 5:22, taken out of context, to justify their behavior, but the passage (v. 21-33) refers to the mutual submission of husband and wife out of love for Christ. Husbands should love their wives as they love their own body, as Christ loves the Church.\\" Some Christian theologians, such as the Rev. Marie Fortune and Mary Pellauer, have raised the question of a close connection between patriarchal Christianity and domestic violence and abuse.Kroeger, Catherine Clark Kroeger; Beck, James Beck (ed). (1996). Women, Abuse and the Bible. Grand Rapids: Baker. Steven Tracy, author of \\"Patriarchy and Domestic Violence\\" writes: \\"While patriarchy may not be the overarching cause of all abuse, it is an enormously significant factor, because in traditional patriarchy males have a disproportionate share of power... So while patriarchy is not the sole explanation for violence against women, we would expect that male headship would be distorted by insecure, unhealthy men to justify their domination and abuse of women.\\"Tracy, Steven. (2007). Patriarchy and Domestic Violence: Challenging Common Misconceptions. Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society. 50(3):580-583. Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between religion and domestic violence.Wilcox, William Bradford. Soft Patriarchs, New Men: How Christianity Shapes Fathers and Husbands. University of Chicago Press (2004), p181-82. . According to Dutton, no single factor explanation for wife assault was sufficient to explain the available data. A study by Dutton and Browning in the same year found that misogyny is correlated with only a minority of abusive male partners. Campbell's study in 1992 found no evidence of greater violence towards women in more patriarchal cultures. Pearson's study in 1997 observed \\"Studies of male batterers have failed to confirm that these men are more conservative or sexist about marriage than nonviolent men\\".Correy, ‚ÄòThe Role Of Patriarchy In Domestic Violence‚Äô (2002). In Responding to Domestic Abuse, a report issued by the Church of England in 2006, suggests that patriarchy should be replaced rather than reinterpreted: \\"Following the pattern of Christ means that patterns of domination and submission are being transformed in the mutuality of love, faithful care and sharing of burdens. 'Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ'(Ephesians 5.21). Although strong patriarchal tendencies have persisted in Christianity, the example of Christ carries the seeds of their displacement by a more symmetrical and respectful model of male‚Äìfemale relations.\\"The Archbishops' Council. \\"Responding to Domestic Abuse: Guidelines for those with pastoral responsibilities\\" . Church House Publishing (2006), p19. . =Bible= Bible verses are often used to justify domestic abuse, such as those that refer to male superiority and female submission. Others counter that the use of violence is a misinterpreted view of the male role. For instance, Eve (Genesis 2-3), is seen by some Christians to be disobedient to patriarchal God and man, and to many a generalized symbol of womanhood that must be submissive and subject to discipline, while others disagree with this interpretation.Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook. New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 92-3. . =Christian domestic discipline= A subculture known as Christian domestic discipline (CDD) promotes spanking of wives by their husbands as a form of punishment. While its advocates rely on Biblical interpretations to support the practice, advocates for victims of domestic violence describe CDD as a form of abuse and controlling behavior. Others describe the practice as a simple sexual fetish and an outlet for sadomasochistic desires. Christian conservative radio host Bryan Fischer said to the Huffington Post that it was a \\"horrifying trendbizarre, twisted, unbiblical and un-Christian\\". =Responses to abuse= There are a variety of responses by Christian leaders to how victims should handle abuse: * Marjorie Proctor-Smith in \\"Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook\\" states that domestic physical, psychological or sexual violence is a sin. It victimizes family members dependent on a man and violates trust needed for healthy, equitable and cooperative relationships. She finds that domestic violence is symptom of sexism, a social sin.Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook. New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 428-9. . * The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said in 2002, \\"As pastors of the Catholic Church in the United States, we state as clearly and strongly as we can that violence against women, inside or outside the home, is never justified.\\"\\"When I Call for Help: A Pastoral Response to Domestic Violence Against Women\\". United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (November 12, 2002). . * The Church of England's report, Responding to Domestic Abuse advises that Christian pastors and counselors should not advise victims to make forgiving the perpetrator the top priority \\"when the welfare and safety of the person being abused are at stake.\\" * Significant numbers of Christian pastors ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to \\"trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it\\" and would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.Alsdurf, James and Alsdurf, Phyllis, Battered into Submission, Wipf and Stock, 1998, as cited in Tracy, Steven, \\"Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse\\", Christianity Today, February 2003, accessed January 24, 2007 One mid-1980s survey of 5,700 pastors found that 26 percent of pastors ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to \\"trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it\\" and that 71 percent of pastors would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.Grady, J. Lee \\"Control Freaks, and the Women Who Love Them\\". New Man magazine (Jan/Feb 2001). A contributing factor to the disparity of responses to abuse is lack of training; many Christian seminaries had not educated future church leaders about how to manage violence against women. Once pastors began receiving training, and announced their participation in domestic violence educational programs, they immediately began receiving visits from women church members who had been subject to violence. The first Theological Education and Domestic Violence Conference, sponsored by the Center for the Prevention of Sexual and Domestic Violence, was held in 1985 to identify topics that should be covered in seminaries. First, church leaders will encounter sexual and domestic violence and they need to know what community resources are available. Secondly, they need to focus on ending the violence, rather than on keeping families together.Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook. New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 10. . The American religious news-magazine Christianity Today has published articles lamenting U.S. churches for possibly making domestic abuse worse \\"not in incidence, but in response\\" due to inadequate understandings. In December 2017, academic W. Bradford Wilcox wrote for the publication, \\"Domestic violence is still present in church-going homes... some local churches, clergy, and counselors fail to address abuse head-on for fear of breaking up a marriage.\\" He also argued, \\"Others steer clear of addressing the topic from the pulpit or in adult education for fear of broaching an uncomfortable subject. This silence around domestic violence has to end.\\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2017/december-web-only/evangelicals- domestic-violence-christian-men-domestic-abuse.html Research into incidences of domestic violence In the 1970s, when multiple programs were initiated to train church leaders about domestic violence, the response \\"But no one ever comes to me with this problem\\" often came up to frustrate efforts. Church leaders frequently believed that if no one reached out for assistance within their congregations that there was no problem for them to deal with; however, women often withheld discussing their problems over concern that it would not be handled appropriately. When women increasingly became pastors over the 20th century, many of them found that much of their time became devoted to handling domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women; \\"crisis intervention\\" became a vital topic for them.Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook. New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 9, 428. . In terms of regions of the United States, research has speculated that local societies with a general culture of violence and low socio-economic status, which may also be at least nominally religious, are more likely to produce abusive men. The role of working-class Scots-Irish American culture in areas such as Appalachia is cited. Differing viewpoints between husband and wife may be an aggravating factor in terms of abuse, particularly when women hold beliefs in contrast to more ideologically hardline men.

It was used by the United States Army Air Corps as an executive transport. Development The Condor II was a 1933 two-bay biplane of mixed construction with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by two Wright Cyclone radial engines. The first aircraft was flown on 30 January 1933 and a production batch of 21 aircraft was then built. The production aircraft were fitted out as 12-passenger luxury night sleeper transports. They entered service with Eastern Air Transport and American Airways, forerunners of Eastern Air Lines and American Airlines on regular night services for the next three years. The June 15, 1934 American Airlines system timetable marketed its Condors as being \\"The World's First Complete Sleeper-Planes\\" with these 12-passenger aircraft being equipped with sleeper berths and also being capable of cruising at 190 miles per hour.http://www.timetableimages.com, June 1, 1934 American Airlines system timetable.

Two modified T-32s were bought by the United States Army Air Corps (designated YC-30) for use as executive transports. One Condor was converted with extra fuel tanks and used by the 1939‚Äì1941 United States Antarctic Service Expedition, and, unique for a Condor, had a fixed undercarriage to allow use on floats or skis. Some aircraft were later modified to AT-32 standard with variable-pitch propellers and improved engine nacelles. The AT-32D variant could be converted from sleeper configuration to daytime use with 15 seats. Four T-32s operating in the United Kingdom were pressed into service with the Royal Air Force at the outbreak of World War II. Eight bomber variants (BT-32) were built with manually operated machine gun turrets in the nose and above the rear fuselage. All these aircraft were exported. A military cargo version (CT-32) was also built for Argentina. It had a large loading door on the starboard side of the fuselage.

There are a number of other small villages in the area, with occupancies ranging from 3-50 families. Kuchi nomads migrate through the area with their families and herds of goats, sheep, and camels. The dominant tribes include the Suleiman Khel, Sultan Khel, and Jalalzai, and a considerable number of sub-tribes. The sub-governor/district leader is Habibullah, and the police chief is named Eid Gul, though Eid Gul was subsequently sighted in Doa China district. The local shura can attract over 100 elders if the event is big enough. Otherwise, the shura normally attracts about 30 elders. The area has several routes through it from Wazakhwa and Nawa to HWY 1 and they are often used for drug trafficking and movement of insurgents. The language spoken here is primarily Pashtu. Most people are uneducated, though there are several elders who are educated and are the local peoples' representatives to the district chief. Much of the terrain is very desolate, and the roads are unimproved. Access time by a motorcar or motorbike traveling the roads to HWY 1 can range from 1‚Äì4 hours, with much jolting. The summertime sees much dust and little rain, though in the winter Dila gets a considerable amount of snow, leading to melting and mud in the late winter or early spring. However, this all dries up by the end of April through early May, when it becomes hot during the day. Mosquitoes and flies are prevalent. The northern region of Dila has some foothills which are greener than the lowlands, though the vegetation remains scrub. The local river is seasonal, and consequently the locals desire a bridge to go across it in the wet season. Local fauna includes dogs, tortoises, goats, sheep, camels, chickens, and snakes. Construction is all Afghan mud-wall building. The town is organically built up, meaning that there is no road grid but rather a winding of trails and roads that goes through the town. Water is supplied by local wells, several being installed by reconstruction teams, but many being hand-dug for families as well. The primary method of subsistence is farming, although there are one or two small bazaars in the district. The bazaar is supplied by merchants going to Sharana or to some of the smaller bazaars on HWY 1 near Moqor to the north. In the spring, after the rainy season and melting season, the river floods, and the farmers pump the river dry to irrigate their farm beds. Karezes are prevalent in the northern part of Dila due to lack of proximity to any above-ground water source. Dila itself has a main store. Several families around Dila do general contracting for building or earthworks. The Afghans also herd for a living, using the herds as a measure of wealth as well as subsistence. Health care here is nonexistent; there is a doctor in town, but his credentials are unknown. Locals will typically go to him or to one of the towns on Highway 1 for care. Education here is nearly nonexistent. There are a few private \\"schools\\" in which an educated adult will educate a few children, but there is no organized government effort at schooling as of 2007. There is no central electric system here, though some villagers have private generators they run to power the mosque speakers and some private residences.

These dwellings are called Kasski (). 'Soorgul Kaskai' is located in the west of Zerok and belongs to the Schawzi tribe. The people are united and lesson to their elder. Generosity and hospitality are the other characteristics that are found in Zerok society. framelessZerok's mountainsalt=219x219px Education Zerok is known for its interest in modern education. Zerok also has a high number of graduates. The level of education and the percentage of educated people is not higher to compare to other districts such as Urgun. There is only one higher school in the whole district. The teachers teach in the school are not professional nor highly qualified. Students are gathered in gardens for learning. The school has its own building but is nearby a US base. Students and teachers left their school building because of a possible Taliban mortar missile. Economy The economy of Zerok is mainly based on mountains and cultivation. Zerok's mountains contain pine fruit which is comparatively expensive dry fruit. The area of Zerok's mountains is large and enough part is received by each family. When the pine crop is ripe, the elders prepare to divide it according to the number of male persons. In this area, mountains belong to common people not to the government. Each year the pine crops are divided among people. Each person receives a dadai, a certain area or a certain amount of pine trees. This is calculated according to male persons. Women are not calculated for achieving any dadai. Once divided, people go to mountains group by group for harvesting or collecting the pine fruit. It takes 15‚Äì30 days to collect the fruit. During this time people live in tents. After harvesting, the cones of pine trees are then put in sunlight in order to prepare for releasing the seeds (fruit). The fruit is then put in sacks and sold in markets. Other crops such as wheat, beans, maize, peas and vegetables such as spinach, carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes are also grown. Other sources for the economy outside of agriculture are truck driving, trade and cattle keeping. Green pine tree carrying cones Maize crop in Zerok District Village life The life of the people is very simple. People wake up early in the morning and usually at least one person per family go to mountains to bring wood for burning and oak branches for cattle. Zerok's tall mountains are covered with trees and birds. In winter, the mountains are completely covered by snow. Homes are made of mud and stone and due to lack of land, they are built in two and three stories. The villagers sit on the way (piles of small stones) (Ÿà⁄ì€ç) near shops and have green tea with sweets in their free time. They wear traditional clothes, waist-coats, turbans (ŸÑŸàŸÜ⁄´€ç) and boots. Wedding and marriage ceremonies are also performed according to tradition. Women sing songs, while men dance with local Attan (). Traditions As the people living here belong to Loya Paktia, very old traditions are still alive in this society. We can mention the following for examples:\\"Interview script of Sahib Gul, 02.11.2013\\", Ziruk District Wedding ŸàÿßÿØŸá: According to the local elder Sahib Gul, the ceremony performed in weddings is of very old traditions. A boy and girl are not allowed to have any type of relations before the wedding. Neither boys nor girls are allowed to perform any kind of action for their engagement. The engagement decision is in their parent's hands. Usually, the mother of a boy goes any home to ask for the relation of any girl to her son. Once the girl engaged to a boy after sometime marriage ceremony is performed. On the day of marriage, women sing songs while men perform their local Attan. Guns are also fired into the air at some weddings. The bride is decorated by her girlfriends in her home. After her decoration, she is woken up by her brother-in-law usually. The dowry is loaded in trucks and brought to the bridegroom's home along with the people singing on the way. The bridegroom is decorated with confetti and well suited as well. As in European and other countries, there is no honeymoon in Zerok and in all Zadran tribe. Once the bride has reached the bridegroom's home, women sing songs and the men dance to drum with the local Attan. The people () are served food (dinner or lunch). A rose in Ziruk morning Akhtar or Eid ÿßÿÆÿ™ÿ±: As in other Pashtun tribes, people in Ziruk also celebrate Akhtar or Eid () with great preparations. Children are mostly involved in this regard. There are two Eids in a year; Eidul Adha () and Eidul Fitar (). Children make early preparations for celebrating Akhtar. They collect wood, used tires etc. () for burning fire on the Akhtar night. Women and children decorate hands with henna (). They collect money from neighbors on the Akhtar night. In the morning (on the first day of Akhtar) they collect sweets () and money from their relatives. Adults pray the Akhtar prayer on the first day of Akhtar. People walk home to eat lunch.

Funeral ceremony ÿØ ÿ¨ŸÜÿßÿ≤€ê ŸÖÿ±ÿßÿ≥ŸÖ: The people are very supportive during death ceremonies. If someone dies, the owner announces the death to the villagers through the mosques' loudspeakers. For three days the owner of the dead is not allowed to cook anything in their home. Dinner, lunch and breakfast are given by neighbours. The government does not support. The relatives of the dead are noticed and as soon as they reach and see their dead relative, start to cry. The dead are buried after the deceased is seen by almost all of their relatives and friends. After the burial, a suitable amount of money is divided among people as the charity for the dead. Pagara Ÿæ⁄´⁄ìŸá €åÿß ÿßÿ¥ÿ±: When someone needs to do any hard task and he or she can not do it alone or want to do it in short time, or if there is a public work such as constructing a mosque, road, water canal etc. then people are collected in a group shape called Pagara (). With the help of Pagara, a very hard task is completed in a short time. Narkh ŸÜÿ±ÿÆ: Narkh is the local law made by the elders of the whole Zadran region. When there is a dispute between two persons or tribes then the issue or dispute is solved according to Narkh. If the Narkhchyan (The people who solve issues and know about Narkh) blame someone or any side, they have two options- to accept or reject. In case of acceptance, the issue is solved while in case of rejection the opponents find other Narkhchyan and want to challenge the former Narkhchi. Narkhchi ŸÜÿ±ÿÆ Ÿà€åŸàŸÜ⁄©€å: The people who know more about Narkh and can solve issues. An amount of money called Bedona is given to them. The plural for Narkhchi is Narkhchyan. Bedona ÿ®ÿØŸàŸÜÿß: The amount of money given to Narkhchi is called Bedona. Amount of Bedona is selected by Narkhchyan. Nanawathy ŸÜŸÜŸàÿ™Ÿä: If any conflict occurs between two persons or tribes e.g. one person or tribe kill anybody from another, then a ram or bull is brought and slaughtered by the murderer to the murdered relatives' home for rehabilitation. If it is accepted by the relatives of the murdered then the dispute is peacefully solved otherwise Badi is caused between them. Badi ÿ®ÿØŸä: Badi is the enmity between two opponents. Chigha ⁄Ü€åÿ∫Ÿá: When something dangerous or illegal has happened to one of the villagers, e.g. other villagers have beaten or killed someone. In such cases, the people collectively come out of their homes and try to catch the criminals. Chigha is formed in extreme emergency situations. Shrines The people of Zerok are religious. They accept those as saints who seem sinless in the society. They believe saints are close to Allah and when they pray, Allah accepts it soon. When such people die, their graves are made as tombs and people go there and alongside pray to Allah when they want something special. They believe Allah accepts the demands of those better who begin shrines. There are many shrines in Zerok but the famous one is Kari shrine (). Folklore The people of Zerok have interesting beliefs, music, oral poetry, jokes and stories. =Beliefs= Eye blinking: Eye blinking is supposed as remembering of someones by others. When someone's eye start to blink he/she says someone remembers me. People think they are praised somewhere. Crow's caw: When a crow caws on the top of someone's home or on a tree near the home, they think someone has come home. The caw is believed as a message of any guest coming. Sport and hobby There are different plays played by residents according to season. The most famous hobbies are volleyball, football, cricket, hunting, wrestling (), Andai (), marbles (), and checkers (). Those who do not play pass their time in tea shops.

It is sometimes described as an allergy, although it is not a true histamine-releasing allergic reaction like some other forms of urticaria. The condition typically results from contact with water of any type, temperature or additive. Signs and symptoms The main symptom of aquagenic urticaria is the development of physical hives, which may or may not itch. Itching after contact with water, without the development of physical hives, is known as Aquagenic pruritus. Aquadynia is a condition in which pain occurs after contact with water. The hives associated with aquagenic urticaria are typically small (approximately 1‚Äì3 mm), red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges. It most commonly develops on the neck, upper trunk and arms, although it can occur anywhere on the body. Once the water source is removed, the rash generally fades within 30 to 60 minutes. Water in all forms, such as tap or sea water, swimming pool water, sweat, tears, and saliva can induce the lesions. Cause The cause of aquagenic urticaria is not fully understood; however, several mechanisms have been proposed. Interaction between water and a component in or on the skin or sebum has been suggested. This theory suggests that a substance is formed by this interaction, the absorption of which causes perifollicular mast cell degranulation with release of histamine. Diagnosis Diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria begins with a clinical history and water challenge test. The water challenge test consists of application of a 35 ¬∞C water compress to the upper body for 30 minutes. Water of any temperature can provoke aquagenic urticaria; however, keeping the compress at a similar temperature to that of the human body (37 ¬∞C) avoids confusion with cold urticaria or cholinergic urticaria. In addition, a forearm or hand can be immersed in water of varying temperatures to determine whether temperature is a factor in the patient's condition. Aquagenic urticaria differs from aquagenic pruritus, in which contact with water evokes intense itching without visible hives or rash. Once known as a separate, rare disease, aquagenic urticaria is now considered a subtype of general urticaria. The first case was reported by Walter B Shelley et al. in 1964. The condition is more common in women than men, and typically presents for the first time during puberty. Genetics may play a part, and the condition may be related to other sensitivities such as lactose intolerance. Prevention Desensitization does not seem to work for aquagenic urticaria; a patient will continue to react to water no matter how gradually or frequently it is introduced. Topical application of antihistamines like 1% diphenhydramine before water exposure is reported to reduce the hives. Oil in water emulsion creams, or petrolatum, applied as barrier agents prior to a shower or bath may control symptoms. Therapeutic effectiveness of various classes of drugs differs from case to case. Treatment There is currently no treatment that will permanently cure the condition. Avoidance of water is recommended as a first line of defense, and most treatments are palliative in nature rather than curative. * Oral or topical antihistamine * Topical corticosteroids: specifically stanozolol. * Phototherapy * Barrier cream  See also  * Aquagenic pruritus * Aquadynia * Cholinergic urticaria * Solar urticaria * List of cutaneous conditions  References   External links  Category:Urticaria and angioedema Category:Rare diseases Category:Allergology ","title":"Aquagenic urticaria"},{"id":"14912533","text":"David Robert Phillips (born October 8, 1943) is a retired umpire, first with the American League from 1971-1999, then with both leagues from 2001-2002.Dave Phillips Retrosheet.org.

He umpired many postseason games, including four World Series. Pulli wore uniform number 14 during his career. Umpiring career During his career, Pulli officiated in four World Series (1978, 1983, 1990 as crew chief, and 1995), six National League Championship Series (1975, 1979, 1986, 1991, 1993, and 1997), four National League Division Series (1981, 1995, 1996 and 1998), and two All-Star games (1977, and 1988 as crew chief). He also was the first base umpire in the April 8, 1974, game in which Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's home run record. In 1989, Pulli and fellow umpire Rich Garcia were placed on probation by baseball commissioner Fay Vincent, when Vincent learned that they had placed bets on non-baseball sporting events with an illegal bookmaker. Don Zimmer, who at the time was the manager of the Chicago Cubs, was also placed on probation by Vincent for the same offense.Weber, Bruce (2009) As They See ‚ÄòEm: a Fan‚Äôs Travel in the Land of Umpires. New York: Simon and Schuster, page 28 Pulli was also one of 22 umpires who participated in the 1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation, orchestrated by the association‚Äôs executive director, Richie Phillips. In response to the resignation, Major League Baseball hired replacement umpires.‚ÄùFrank Pulli, 78 ‚Äì Baseball umpire was the first to use instant replay‚Äù The Washington Post, September 1, 2013, page C8 Subsequently, Pulli was one of 13 umpires who was not rehired by the league. Instead, he was allowed to retire and was later hired back as an umpire supervisor. =Notable events= 1978 World Series Pulli was involved in a controversial play in Game 4 of the 1978 World Series. In the 6th inning, New York Yankees outfielder Lou Piniella hit a low line drive to shortstop. Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Bill Russell dropped the ball momentarily (not ruled a catch by second base umpire Joe Brinkman), then flipped it to second baseman Davey Lopes, but Lopes' throw to first caromed off the leg of Reggie Jackson, standing in the baseline between first and second, and went behind first base. Thurman Munson scored (in part due to Steve Garvey stopping to argue before chasing the ball down) to make it a 3‚Äì2 game, but Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda immediately argued that Jackson should have been called out for interference. Pulli (umpiring at first base) maintained that Jackson did not \\"intentionally\\" interfere with the throw (despite Jackson ever-so-slightly shifting his leg to cause the ball to hit it) and the play stood. The Yankees went on to win Game 4, 4‚Äì3 in 10 innings, then the series in Game 6. In his autobiography, Jackson described his involvement in the play as a \\"sacrifice thigh.\\" 1979 NLCS Pulli was involved in another controversial call during Game 2 of the 1979 National League Championship Series. In the top of the fifth inning, Phil Garner of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit a hard line drive that Cincinnati Reds right fielder Dave Collins appeared to catch. However, Pulli ruled that Collins had trapped the ball, a call that proved significant when Garner scored later that inning and gave the Pirates the lead. The Pirates won the game, 3‚Äì2 in ten innings, and eventually the series. Early use of instant replay Pulli was the first umpire to use instant replay during a major league game, albeit not in accordance with league rules. On May 31, 1999, the Florida Marlins were hosting the St. Louis Cardinals when Pulli, the crew chief of that game's umpires, used instant replay to review a home run call. The Marlins' Cliff Floyd hit a ball to the top of the left field scoreboard, near the yellow line that separated in-play from out-of-play. The hit was originally ruled a double by another umpire, then changed to a home run after the umpires conferred, the reverted to being a double after Pulli watched a reply via a television camera's monitor. The Cardinals won the game, 5‚Äì2. National League president Len Coleman subsequently stated that Pulli had erred in using instant replay. The use of instant replay in Major League Baseball would not be adopted until 2008. =Use of QuesTec= After his retirement, Pulli‚Äôs experience as an umpire was instrumental in baseball‚Äôs use of the QuesTec, an advanced technology that allowed baseball to observe and grade the home plate umpire‚Äôs ability to call balls and strikes. Many umpires, including Ted Barrett, believed that the use of the technology dramatically changed the way umpires judged the strike zone and that he, and others, adjusted their calls to the technology. In Bruce Weber‚Äôs 2009 book on umpiring, Barrett claimed that Pulli would call him after games and encourage him to shrink his strike zone after watching Barrett call pitches several inches off the plate as strikes.Weber, pages 32, 198-199, 251 Personal life Pulli was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, and died in Palm Harbor, Florida, on August 28, 2013, due to complications from Parkinson's disease.

A house or lodge has been recorded at the site since the time of Odo de Bayeux in 1080, however the present building, exhibiting a number of later styles, principally dates from the 18th century. Earlier residents of the site may have included Iron Age settlers since excavations of earthworks on the estate in 1825 and 1880 revealed evidence of possible Belgic fortifications. History According to Edward Hasted, the 18th-century historian of Kent, the manor then known as Sahersted formed part of the estate of Odo de Bayeux at the time of his fall from grace in 1080. It is not known what type of structure existed on the site at that time however the building is within ancient woodland and may have been a mediaeval lodge. The manor of Sharsted was recorded in 1174 as a subsidiary manor within the Hundred of Teynham and held directly from the Archbishop of Canterbury. During the reign of Edward I the manor was in the possession of John de Sharsted and then Sir Simon de Sharsted. A Simon de Sharsted is also noted as having been imprisoned in the Tower of London.Calendar of the Close Rolls Preserved in the Public Record Office England Sovereign (1272‚Äì1307: Edward I), Prepared under the supervision of H. C. Maxwell Lyte. Text by W. H. Stevenson, vol. 1‚Äì5. (1904) Robert de Sharsted is recorded in the Kent Hundred Rolls of 1275 as a sheriff of the Lathe of Faversham, and an early tomb in the Sharsted Chapel in the church at Doddington) bears the name of 'Richard de Sharsted' dating his death to 1287. Robert de Sharsted died in 1320 leaving only a daughter as an heir. The property transferred then to John de Bourne of Down Court, Doddington - whose father was Sheriff under Edward III. According to some sources, Sharsted was at that time occupied by Robert de Nottingham. It is speculated that John de Bourne was one of the knights known to have held Leeds Castle against Edward II in 1314 and, as a result, his lands were forfeited to the Crown. They were restored by Edward III in 1327 with the exception of Sharsted Court. The widow of Robert de Nottingham (who died in 1374 and is presumed to have been allowed to keep Sharsted until his death) was left a section of the house. During the reign of Henry VI, Bartholomew de Bourne inherited Sharsted Court, which continued in the Bourne family for the next two hundred years. According to Hasted, early in the 17th century James Bourne conveyed the estate to Abraham Delaune, the son of Gideon Delaune, a Huguenot Apothecary in the service of King James I's wife, Ann of Denmark, and founding benefactor of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. Abraham's grandson, Colonel William Delaune (afterwards MP for Kent from 1715 to 1722) transformed Sharsted in 1711 adding the brick front and the gazebo at the end of the raised terrace. Since Colonel Delaune had no children of his own, Sharsted passed to his nephew, Gideon Thornicroft, in 1739. Just three years later Thornicroft died, leaving the property to his mother. Again, just two years later, she bequeathed the estate on her death to her two unmarried daughters, Dorcas and Elizabeth. On 1759 Dorcas left Sharsted to the great-grandson of Sir William Delaune, Alured Pincke. The property subsequently passed to Alured's wife; in 1839, Mary Pincke bequeathed Sharsted to her great-nephew, Captain Edmund Faunce, who is noted in Bernard Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain as Edmund Faunce of Sharsted. In 1864, his son Chapman Faunce added 'Delaune' to his surname and changed the spelling to Faunce-De- Laune. It is Chapman Faunce-De-Laune who is believed to have begun the yew topiary that still exists today. During the late 19th century tobacco was grown on the property, which was also depicted in prints in the Illustrated London News. By the early 20th century, Sharsted Court was recorded in the Sittingbourne, Milton and District Directory of 1908 as being \\"a typical English park of some 250 acres\\". By 1949 however the property was empty. Alured Faunce De Laune died around that time leaving the property to a son in South Africa who declined it due to the expense of maintaining the property from afar.Mowle PC A Genealogical History of Pioneer Families of Australia. Faunce. Sydney Angus and Robertson 1948 The Ratzer family bought it during the 1950s, but, in common with a number of large country estates which became expensive to maintain, the house was at risk of being demolished. However, in 1966 the Court came into the possession of Canon Wade and his son Anthony Wade whose family included Virginia Wade, Wimbledon tennis champion in 1977. As of 2007, the house remains in the hands of the Wade and Shepley families who have undertaken extensive restoration of the house and gardens. The house was also licensed for civil weddings in Kent and provided occasional conference facilities. Sharsted Court no longer hold these functions and the last of the weddings took place in 2008. Architecture =Main house= North-east elevation The main house is built around a two-storey medi√¶val hall house possibly dating to the 14th century. This rectangular hall was heated by an open fireplace and features an arched roof with extensive oak beams and rafters. The south-west of the property is timber-framed and is believed to date also to the mid-14th century and possibly to have been used as a 'dowager wing' of the main hall by the widow of Robert de Nottingham. In 1711 a brick front was added to the main hall house, and two wings with tiled roofs, wooden cornice work and large dormers. The grand centre section of the building includes imitation battlements and a working belfry (believed to have been used previously to call workers on the estate). The pedimented entrance porch includes a coat-of-arms. During the 19th century an additional three-storey Victorian wing was built, squaring off the existing buildings and creating a central courtyard. However this imposing structure was demolished in 1967 for aesthetic reasons; a conservatory was appended to the remaining Victorian east wing in 1987. Driveway viewed from the main houseThe house includes a so- called \\"drunken\\" staircase (on account of its unorthodox angles), which is reputedly \\"the 13th stairway to be constructed in the house, leading to the 79th room\\". In common with a number of old manor houses in England, the house also contains a \\"secret\\" passageway via a cleverly marked panel in the wainscoting of the 'Tapestry Dressing-room': \\"which communicates by a very narrow and steep flight of steps in the thickness of the wall with 'the Red Bedroom'.\\" Allan Fea, Secret Chambers and Hiding-places: Historic, Romantic, & Legendary Stories & Traditions About Hiding-Holes, Secret Chambers, etc. (1901) It has been speculated by the current owners that this was installed and used by one of the previous male owners to travel secretly between bed chambers for romantic liaisons. A number of additional cottage buildings and ancillary structures (such as former stables) exist on the site and incorporate similar styles to the main house. The property is Grade I listed. =Garden and features= Gated entrance to topiary garden A feature of the house today is its grand approach. After climbing a short hill from the village of Newnham, a tree-lined avenue leads to a pair of heavy wrought iron gates designed in 1882 and supported by brick gate posts. A brick 18th century gazebo (or possibly a faux gatehouse) watches over the entrance together with two stone bulls. A gravel stone driveway leads to the main, house flanked on the south by a walled terrace from the gazebo. A sunken pond and ancient trees feature in the grounds Clipped yews line the driveway and are featured in the main gardens, which are surrounded by flint and brick walls; a small maze-like topiary display section is enclosed by a low wall and principally entered through wrought iron gates guarded by stone gryphons. Side entrances to the topiary section include an extravagant archway in the south-west wall. The garden is extensively planted with roses and traditional bedding flowers. Resting places, stepped terraces and ornate recesses are incorporated into the brick garden walls. A flint and brick circular summer house with a pointed tile roof sits in the far north corner and a raised terrace leads to a heavy wooden door in the far north wall. The north and west sides of the garden are bordered by woodland (part of Sharsted Wood) and a number of ancient trees are preserved within the grounds themselves. A small sunken pond also exists to the north of the house. Notes External links *Historical images of Sharsted Court. Retrieved December 28, 2007. .

The Germans immediately requisitioned a large area around Skydebanevej, and mid August the same year a seaplane base had been established, however without many of the fixed facilities needed at a fully operational base in wartime. Construction works continued throughout the war building bunkers, field fortifications, barbed wire fences and air defense sites. Spread out over the large area were the many facilities that are part of a wartime air base: Quartering barracks, office buildings, infirmary, workshops and ammunition depots. One air defence battery was set up to protect the base, including three 20 mm AA machine cannon commandeered by the Germans from the Danish army in April 1940 after the first British air raids against one of the other two German air bases in the Aalborg area the night between 20. and 21. of April 1940. The hangar at the seaplane is a standard German Junkershalle. Build winter 1940‚Äì41. Thus Seefliegerhorst Aalborg was a well equipped major air base for seaplanes with the task to secure the northern waters around Denmark and southern Norway against allied ships through sea reconnaissance and Anti-submarine warfare. On the 5th of May 1940 two Arado Ar 196A-3 seaplanes from Seefliegerhorst Aalborg managed to force the British minelayer submarine \\"Seal\\" to surrender in Kattegat. The submarine had successfully completed laying a 50-mine mine barrier west of the Swedish island Vinga, but was subsequently damaged by a German sea mine. The crew managed to surface the damaged submarine. The submarine was initially tugged to Frederikshavn and later to Kiel, where it was used to train German submariners and in the German propaganda. Furthermore, the seaplanes from Aalborg conducted minelaying operations in harbors in northern Britain and raids against convoys at Scotland. Concurrently with these operations the seaplanes were used in sea rescue operations in Danish waters. It all contributed to maintaining connection to the German forces in Norway. In addition to the ordinary crew of 1500 persons at Seefliegerhorst Aalborg several training formations were stationed there for shorter or longer periods during the war. In 1943 a school for training seaplane pilots was established in Aalborg. On the 27th of May 1944 the so- called Bordkommando for the German battleship Tirpitz was established. That was a training unit for the air crews to be stationed on board the Tirpitz, and launched by catapult to conduct reconnaissance flights for the battleship. When the unit was committed to battle on board the Tirpitz the crews had only flown a few operational flights from Aalborg. Post war From the beginning of 1945 German refugees started to pour into Denmark during the Evacuation of East Prussia, when the Soviet forces conquered that part of Germany. Refugee camps were established in many places in Denmark to house these refugees. At the end of the war a refugee camp was established in the facilities of Seefliegerhorst Aalborg, where additional barracks were erected. The hangar was used as a rendezvous for the refugees. The refugee camp was closed in 1947. From 1950 until 2001 the hangar was used as a depot for the Danish Civil Defence forces. In 2001 a group of volunteers took over the hangar to establish the Aalborg Defence and Garrison Museum to be opened on the 22nd of June 2002 as a private foundation.
