Rohrer II (December 15, 1909 – September 23, 1989) was an American businessman and Republican Party politician. He was the founder and chairman of the First Peoples Bank of New Jersey, the first bank in South Jersey to attain $1 billion in deposits. He served as the first Mayor of Haddon Township, New Jersey from 1951 to 1987, for 36 years. Biography =Personal life= He was born in December 15, 1909 in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He married Floretta Tulk in 1942; the couple had four daughters, Wilma Abrams, Linda Rohrer, Carol Moss and Eileen Rohrer. The marriage ended in divorce. Roher married Mimi in 1982, the couple had an adopted son, William G. Rohrer 3d. In 1984 his wife went to trial on charges of murdering the couple's adopted 2-year-old son. The trial ended with a hung jury. In the 1980s his businesses suffered financial losses and his political popularity waned. =Business career= His first jobs were working in his father's grocery store and at the small car dealership his father started in Pottsville, Pennsylvania in the late 1920s. In 1929 Roher's father moved the car dealership, the Rohrer Chevrolet Agency, to Camden, New Jersey to take advantage of an economic boom in South Jersey. He became owner of the dealership after his father's death in 1935, making his fortune by growing it into one of the largest in the nation by 1947. In 1955, Rohrer bought a small bank in South Jersey that held $2.9 million in deposits. He renamed it First Peoples Bank and under his ownership, it became one of the largest in the area. By 1970 it had more than $100 million in deposits; by the early 1980s, it had become the first billion-dollar bank in South Jersey. =Political career= Rohrer served as a Township Committeeman from 1947 to 1951, and as Mayor of Haddon Township, New Jersey from 1951 to 1987. He was a commissioner on the Delaware River Port Authority. He was also a member of the Camden County Ethics Committee. In the 1950s, Rohrer ran two close races for the New Jersey State Senate, losing twice to Democrat Joseph W. Cowgill. In 1955, Rohrer ran for an open State Senate seat when Bruce A. Wallace retired. In a close race, Cowgill defeated Rohrer by 290 votes, 54,683 (50.02%) to 54,393 (49.76%). Rohrer again faced Cowgill when he sought re-election in 1959; this time, Cowgill won by 4,092 votes, 61,656 (51.72%) to 57,564 (48.28%). Rohrer owned a Chevrolet dealership in Camden and several other businesses, and operated several banks. The Rohrer Charitable Foundation has contributed over $12 million to Rowan University, where the College of Business was named the William G. Rohrer College of Business. In ill health, Rohrer was defeated as Mayor of Haddon Township, New Jersey in 1987. He died on September 23, 1989. Legacy In his will, Rohrer left millions of dollars to charity, including funds designated for donations to William G. Rohrer Memorial Library, the Little League, Bancroft School for the handicapped in Haddonfield, Camden County Leukemia Society, Camden County Planned Parenthood Association, American Diabetes Association, Arthritis Foundation, Masonic Charities of New Jersey, and also funds for a new wing at the Masonic Home in Burlington Township, to Camden's Cooper Hospital Foundation, the Bible Presbyterian Church of Collingswood, Grace Baptist Church of Westmont, the Calvary Baptist Church of West Collingswood, the Emmanuel United Methodist Church of Oaklyn, and Rhoades Temple United Methodist Church of Haddon Township.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built by Brisbane City Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The Brisbane City Council built the concrete shelter at Raymond Park (east) as an air raid shelter in 1942. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War II following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The population of Brisbane swelled dramatically. As it was the major city in Queensland, and the most northerly major population centre in Australia, military planning headquarters were set up in Brisbane, as were a number of important maintenance, communication, and supply facilities. General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, was based in the AMP building at the corner of Queen Street and Edward Street in Brisbane, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, used the recently constructed University of Queensland buildings at St Lucia. Brisbane was obviously a strategic target for bombing, and rapid action had to be taken to protect the population in the event of air raids. The demand on materials, services and labour was enormous and military projects took precedence in their allocation. Heavy Anti-Aircraft batteries were built at Victoria Park, Hendra, Pinkenba, Fort Lytton, Hemmant and Balmoral, and coastal artillery batteries were established on Bribie and Moreton Islands. Before the war, Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing industries. To help overcome these problems, some buildings were prefabricated and standard designs for many structures were used. Designs took into account the scarcity of skilled labour and of some materials. The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost £56,596. Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code-compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non-reusable standard pillboxes. F.G. Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that if the emergency for their use does not arise ...(unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance. He added that I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war. Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at 13.5\\", and 12\\" for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least four inches of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park; two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as \\"bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built-referred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\" and only one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. The blast walls of the air raid shelter at Raymond Park (East) were removed according to plan after World War Two, although evidence of the location of the walls is still visible. The shelter roof and piers have been painted.  Description  Roof of structure in 2015 The Raymond Park (East) air raid shelter is a rectangular concrete structure comprising a heavy floor slab and a flat roof supported by four concrete piers. The second, lower part of the floor slab is also visible. The piers and the roof of the shelter are painted green. There is evidence of the two entrances on the southern side of the Soffit. The shelter stands towards the Wellington Road end of Raymond Park to the east of the playing fields.  Heritage listing  Raymond Park (East) Air Raid Shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Raymond Park (east) air raid shelter is important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelter located in Raymond Park (east) is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, rectangular shape, and its siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelter. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Raymond Park (east) air raid shelter, now used as a shade shelter, demonstrates the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention. The shelter is a durable example of innovative design and use of concrete technology during World War Two. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The air raid shelter is important as an example of the wartime work of the City Architect's Office and particularly the work of City Architect F.G. Costello.

According to \\"The Key to the City of Houston\\"Love, Mrs. W.J. \\"Suburbs of Houston\\", The Key to the City of Houston, Houston, December 1908, 210-211. Hyde Park was intended to be a high-end neighborhood, but deed restrictions regulated improvement prices to ensure that the area remained attainable to more than only the wealthiest citizens. Additionally, the restrictions set a minimum lot size, limited business development, and regulated the placement of barns and outhouses. The longest continually operating water feature in Houston, the Dolphin Fountain, is located in Hyde Park. The fountain was installed in Lamar Park, a small neighborhood park, in 1946 and still runs today.

Biography His parents were Edgar and Amy Worthington. His early education was at Rugby School, before he went up to gain a First in Zoology at Gonville and Cauis College at Cambridge. After university, his work alternated between Britain and Africa. He took part in an African lakes expedition in 192731; and in an African research expedition 193437, for which he was awarded the Mungo Park Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. He was secretary to and first full-time director of the Freshwater Biological Association 193746. He returned to Africa in the late 1940s as science and development advisor. He was deputy scientific director for the Nature Conservancy 195765, and scientific director of the International Biological Programme (IBP) 196474. His interests included water biology and international nature conservation, including the environmental impacts of drainage and irrigation. He was appointed CBE in 1977. In 1930, Worthington married Stella Johnson, who had been a member of the earlier expeditions he had undertaken and who shared many of his interests. In 1933, they jointly published the book Inland Waters of Africa. They had three daughters, all of whom followed their parents' scientific inclinations. Stella Worthington died in 1978. Two years later, he married Harriet Stockton. He died on 14 December 2001.

Colpidium colpoda is also frequently found inhabiting wastewater treatment plants. This species is used as an indicator of water quality and waste treatment plant performance. History and physical characteristics Colpidium colpoda illustration by Alfred Kahl The first record of Colpidium colpoda was in 1829 by Mathaeo Losana, who placed it in the genus Paramaecia. It was more thoroughly described by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in his two volume publication Die Infusionsthierchen als vollkommene Organismen (which roughly translates to “The Infusoria as Perfect Organisms”) in 1838. The species was described in detail by Ganner and Foissner in 1989. C. colpoda is considered an intermediate sized ciliate, typically between 50 and 150 μm long. The cell is roughly oval or kidney-shaped in profile, with a distinct concavity on the anterior of the oral side. Cilia are arranged in 50-63 longitudinal rows. At the center of the cell is a large, ovoid macronucleus and a small spherical micronucleus. A single contractile vacuole is located slightly posterior to the middle of the body, near the right side. Like many ciliates, it is a heterotrophic bacterivore that ingests bacteria through an oral groove. C. colpoda reproduces asexually every 4–6 hours, with variation in division rates arising from environmental conditions and the identity of the available bacterial food source. Phylogeny In general, it is believed that ciliates form a monophyletic group that diverged from other eukaryotes early in evolutionary history, following the evolution of heterokaryotic genetic systems but prior to the evolution of multicellularity and some organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Colpidium falls within the ciliate taxonomic order Hymenostomatida, which also includes the well-studied Tetrahymena and Glaucoma genera. Previous work suggests that Colpidium seems to be more closely related to Glaucoma than to Tetrahymena. However, more recent analyses have found the opposite – that Colpidium is, in fact, more closely related to Tetrahymena than to Glaucoma. Genetics Although a complete genome is not available for Colpidium colpoda, partial sequences have been published for the small subunit 18S rRNA gene and the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene and complete sequences for the telomerase RNA gene and the 5.8S rRNA gene. Within the same taxonomic family as C. colpoda is the microbial model organism Tetrahymena thermophila. There is a large body of scientific literature on the T. thermophila genome as a representative of the Alveolates, a major evolutionary branch of eukaryotes that includes all ciliates, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans. Like many ciliates, T. thermophila has a surprisingly complex genome that consists of a germline micronucleus and a somatic macronucleus that function and replicate independently of one another. In 2006, the full genome of the T. thermophila macronucleus was sequenced Ecology Because Colpidium colpoda feeds on bacteria, this species is typically found in heavily polluted freshwater habitats. For this reason, presence of C. colpoda is often seen as an indicator of poor water quality. C. colpoda and its congeners are also commonly used in laboratory microcosm experiments. Colpidium colpoda can be used to accelerate the rate of degradation of crude oil during bioremediation, although the exact mechanism behind this relationship is unclear. Speculation points toward secretion of mucus that acts as an emulsifier, mechanical action of cilia contributing to emulsification and reduction of competition between bacteria that contribute to hydrocarbon degradation and those that do not through grazing, amongst other possibilities.

Plot =Opening sequence= The Spell of Shattered Sight appears in the forest. =Event chronology= The Land Without Magic flashback with the Snow Queen in Boston takes place in 1982, immediately after \\"Smash the Mirror\\" and before \\"Best Laid Plans\\" and the Land Without Magic flashback where Emma moves into Ingrid's home takes place in 1999, the year after \\"Breaking Glass\\" and two years before \\"Tallahassee\\" and \\"There's No Place Like Home\\" (this story also takes place in the same year as \\"Lily\\"). The scene with Ingrid and Emma at the funfair takes place about six months after they began living together,\\"Family Business\\", establishes they spent six months as mother and daughter. between August 26 and September 1. Ingrid and her foster daughter visit a funfair together and the flashbacks where Ingrid tries to make Emma explore her magic powers take place a week later. The flashback where the Snow Queen arrives in Storybrooke takes place in 2001, the same year as \\"Tallahassee\\", \\"There's No Place Like Home\\", \\"The Heart of the Truest Believer\\", and \\"Save Henry\\" and several years before \\"Firebird\\". The Storybrooke flashback with Ingrid and Emma takes place in November 2011, between \\"The Price of Gold\\" (Emma is wearing her blue leather jacket, which arrives with the rest of her things in this episode), and \\"That Still Small Voice\\", where Emma becomes deputy sheriff (Emma is about to call Sheriff Graham to have him arrest Ingrid; if she was already a deputy, she would have the power to arrest Ingrid herself). The present day Storybrooke events take place after \\"Fall\\". =In the Characters' Past= Ingrid arrives in Boston in 1982. She finds a psychic shop; a Fortune Teller named Madame Faustina and tries to receive her fortune, only to learn that the \\"seer\\" is a charlatan. Enraged, Ingrid attempts to freeze her, but then discovers that she has no magic. She leaves, vowing to wait as long as it takes to find Emma Swan. In Richfield, Minnesota in 1999, Emma has just become one of Ingrid's foster children. Though Ingrid intervenes when one of her charges steals Emma's camera, Emma attempts to leave when the bully still demands the device. Ingrid encourages Emma to stay by telling her that her bully is afraid of spiders. The two bond in the short time and Ingrid files to adopt Emma. When a carnival claw machine sparks, Ingrid believes it proof of Emma's magical talent and attempts to test it by throwing the both of them in front of an oncoming car. However, this only has the effect of breaking their bond as Emma runs away. In 2001, Ingrid travels to Maine, where she unravels the prophecy scroll and finds herself in Storybrooke. In November 2011, when Emma wanders into Any Given Sundae, she recognizes its proprietor Sarah Fisher as Ingrid. Ingrid attempts to convince her of Henry's claims about magic were true, only to be met with denial and anger. Ingrid then removes all memories of herself from Emma into a memory stone, explaining why Emma doesn't remember her. =In Storybrooke= As everyone in Storybrooke begin to attack each other, fighting and riots break out across the town. At the sheriff's station Elsa, Emma, and Anna try to come up with a plan to stop Ingrid while at the same time deal with keeping Mary Margaret and David from each other's throats by separating them in different jail cells. As they leave Neal with Anna, Emma and Elsa confront Ingrid at \\"Any Given Sundae\\" where their powers cannot work on her due to the ribbons on them. This gives Emma an idea: to go the Vault and face Regina, who was sealed inside for her own safety. Meanwhile, the protection spell is causing Regina to believe that Emma trapped her inside, and as she sees herself in the mirror Regina changes her clothes to those she used to wear as the Evil Queen. When Emma and Elsa arrive and unseal the Vault, Regina uses her pyrokinetic powers against them and they shield themselves with the ribbons on their wrists; the ribbons free Emma and Elsa, and Emma uses her powers to stall Regina from going after them. Regina, believing that Emma went to the Sheriff's station, shows up there, only to set up a battle between her and Mary Margaret. Regina then makes Anna and Kristoff disappear, and they end up on the beachfront. As Kristoff argues with Anna, she trips her leg on a bottle. Anna picks up the bottle and hits Kristoff on his head knocking him out, allowing the letter that was inside the bottle to fall into Anna's hands. Anna then reads the letter and she races off to the Snow Queen's lair. At her lair, Ingrid proceeds to the next part of her plan where she restores the good memories of Emma and Elsa to them while stating that they do not have it in them to kill her. Anna then arrives with the letter (written by her mother) that revealed the truth of Ingrid and Helga being Elsa and Anna's maternal aunts, while stating that Arendelle deserved to know all about Ingrid and Helga. Ingrid then begins to attack Anna by choking her to death and manages to knock her down. Upon reading the note, a tearful and repentant Ingrid sees that Anna is right as she touches the memory stone which shows her memories of her sisters and begins to regret her actions. Ingrid then undoes the Spell of Shattered Sight by sacrificing her own life. Before she dies, Ingrid states that Emma has found her family and returns the lost memories of Emma and Elsa to them now that she has her own younger sisters' love. Ingrid then disappears to the afterlife where she is happy to join her beloved little sisters, Helga and Gerda, there. Meanwhile, Hook comes to see Gold about the chaos going on around Storybrooke, and Gold says that as long as he has his heart, he is immune to the curse. As Gold prepares to pack up and leave town, he tells Hook to grab Henry and meet him and Belle at the town line, since he will not use his magic to bring Henry to him. When he reached New York City, Gold would make sure they would never remember any what happened in Storybrooke but explain that the town was destroyed. Hook heads to the Mayor's office to see Henry and tells him to come with him. Henry, affected by the curse, calls Hook a dirty pirate and says he did not like him before and likes him less now that he's with his mother, Emma, and asks him to leave. Hook uses the potion that Gold gave him to break the spell and he heads in, but Henry has spread marbles all around and Hook goes down, allowing Henry to flee for his safety. Hook chases him but is confronted by Will, who initiates a fist-fight. Hook knocks out Will, but the delay allows Henry to escape. Thanks to Ingrid, the spell of shattered sight is finally broken; the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen's plan failed, he tells Hook it's his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma and the rest of Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she'll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have nothing to fear from him – but says he can't make that promise for the rest of the world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.

Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a great review: \\"After moving slowly for the last couple of episodes, the Snow Queen's reign ended tonight.

It was designed by Arthur Robson and built in 1927. It is also known as East Brisbane Picture Theatre, Elite Cinema, and Classic Cinema. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 July 2001.  History  The site of the Triumph Cinema, East Brisbane, has been associated with film exhibition since 1921. The building itself dates to 1927, with minor modifications probably . The site was earlier part of a much larger parcel of land purchased from the Crown in 1855 by Joseph Darragh of Brisbane. Darragh held the land, unsubdivided, for nearly 30 years, and it was the eventual subdivision of this property into residential allotments (mostly 16 perches) in the mid-1880s, which established East Brisbane as a dormitory suburb. Prior to this, East Brisbane was semi-rural in character, with a few isolated families scattered through the bush, and a number of elite estates (such as Mowbray's and Heath's) along the riverbank. In June 1885 Mrs Annie Elizabeth Cocks gained title to subdivisions 112 and 113 of eastern allotment 128, parish of South Brisbane, county of Stanley (32 perches - later the site of the picture theatre). Mrs Cocks owned this land for over 20 years. About 1906 she sold it to Brisbane real estate agent George Henry Blocksidge, who in 1907 transferred the property to Henry William Robinson, who established a fuel depot there. On 1 July 1921 the property was transferred from Robinson to Frederick Carl Christian Olsen, who established an open-air picture show on the site that year. A sewerage detail plan dated 1919 shows a picture theatre, partly roofed, occupying the whole of the site. The date may be misleading. It is not unusual for alterations to be made to original detail plans, and in this instance, the theatre as shown on the site is more likely to date to between 1921 and 1927. Oral history reveals that the facade of this theatre was timber, and that about one-third of the seating area was roofed in flat galvanised iron, which on rainy days could be manually extended over about half the seating. The Olsens reputedly were very proud of this technological feat. Around the perimeter of the site were fences of flat iron. Frederick Olsen died in January 1926. The Stanley Street East property passed to his widow, Maria Gustava Olsen, a year later, and then to Vigo Gustav Olsen (her son) in June 1927. Around the same time Vigo Olsen raised a mortgage on the property from Ernest Adolph Burmester, which is likely to have financed the construction of a new picture theatre to cost £2,000, for which Vigo Olsen already had permission from the Brisbane City Council to erect. Olsen, who lived nearby at Didsbury Street, East Brisbane, had let the contract to construct the theatre to Corinda contractor and architect Arthur Robson. It is highly likely Robson also prepared the design. He had worked for the Workers' Dwellings Board in Townsville as an inspector and as an architect in Rockhampton in the early 1920s. From 1923 he was resident in Corinda and practised as an architect and builder in Brisbane and other centres throughout Queensland. Robson both constructed and/or designed picture theatres throughout Queensland in the 1920s, including the Indooroopilly Picture Theatre (later the El Dorado), and the Paragon Theatre at Childers. By August 1928, he had erected 23 picture theatres in Queensland. The picture theatre at Stanley Street East is listed as the Triumph in 1927 licensing records, but there is some suggestion that the place was known initially as the East Brisbane Picture Theatre. It is possible that the name was changed when the new picture theatre was built in 1927, and this is the name which still appears in relief on the facade of the building. Vigo Olsen died in August 1929, and the property passed to his widow, Ida Elizabeth Olsen, in April 1931. Around this time Mrs Olsen raised a further mortgage on the property from EA Burmester, possibly to purchase sound equipment for the theatre. Sound movies were introduced in 1927 with Warner Brothers' production of The Jazz Singer, and over the next few years motion picture exhibitors either converted their theatres to sound or went out of business, as demand for the \\"talkies\\" swept the world. In mid-1934 title to the property was transferred to accountant Albert Frederick Stoddart of East Brisbane, and Alma Jones, wife of Sylvester Stephen Jones of Mount Gravatt, as tenants in common. The Jones were related to the Olsens. Gordon Jones took over the management of the Triumph in 1934, when he was only 17 years old. In 1943, AF Stoddart transferred his interest in the property to Gordon, who managed the theatre until , exhibiting (from at least 1938, and likely earlier) as the Triumph Theatre Company. A 1940 photograph of the theatre shows a facade remarkably similar to that which survives today. The foyer was reached via concrete steps from the street, but had not yet been enclosed with glass doors. Folding iron gates still secured the foyer, and these were at the front of the building, on the footpath. The interior of the foyer was lined with fibrous sheeting and dark-stained timber cover-strips; there was a centrally located ticket-box at the back of the foyer; and doors to the auditorium were located either side of the ticket box. The terrazzo flooring in the present entrance is likely to date to 1927. In the 1930s, there were approximately 200 picture theatres operating in Queensland, of which about 25% were located in Brisbane. This was the period when most Brisbane suburbs had at least one picture theatre, if not more, and encouraged local allegiances. Theatre staff - owners, management and other employees (such as projectionists, organ or piano players, ticket sellers and ushers) - generally lived in the district, and the theatre offered a local community focus and sense of local identity. Competition for audiences was strong. The Triumph's closest contemporary competitors were the Broadway at the Woolloongabba Fiveways; the Mowbray Park Picture Theatre on Shafston Road; the Alhambra at Stones Corner; the Roxy (Gaiety) at Coorparoo; and the Norman Park Picture Theatre near the Norman Park railway station. Of these, only the Triumph survives. Following the introduction of television to Brisbane in the late 1950s, Brisbane cinema audiences declined rapidly. Suburban cinemas struggled to continue screening films and in the 1960s and 1970s many closed, the buildings converted into alternative uses or the sites redeveloped. By the 1980s, only a handful of single-screen interwar suburban cinemas survived in Brisbane. In 1960-61 the Triumph had a seating capacity of 800, suggesting that some seating refurbishment had occurred since 1938, when the theatre seated 950. By January 1970 the property had been acquired by Roy Arthur Chesterman and Merle Audrey Chesterman, and was transferred in February 1970 to Eric Dare, who owned the place for over three decades. The changes in ownership correspond with a transformation of the theatre. By 1970 the Triumph had been renamed the Capri East Brisbane and was operated by the Capri Theatre Company, which screened mostly R-rated sex films. In 1971 the capacity of the theatre was listed as 510, indicating that seating and/or possibly foyer refurbishment had taken place. The cinema is believed to have closed for a short period in the 1980s, but by 1988 had re-opened as the Classic Cinema, an art-house screening alternative and revival films, and the venue for film festivals and the annual Brisbane screening of Australian Film, Television and Radio School productions. The theatre functioned as an art-house until closed in mid-2000. In 2014 the building was being used as a martial arts studio, with a yoga studio on the upper floor.  Description  The former Triumph Cinema occupies a site at the southeast corner of Stanley Street East and Withington Street, East Brisbane. The facade fronts Stanley Street East, which is a major arterial road. The surrounding streets are mostly residential, but there is a small commercial node either side of Stanley Street East, where the cinema is located. Diagonally opposite, on the northeast corner of Stanley Street East and Didsbury Street, is the East Brisbane Hotel, erected in 1889. The theatre is built to the street alignments and occupies the whole of the site. The front facade is two storeys in height, of rendered brick, and decorative, with strong streetscape presence. In an extraordinarily eclectic metaphorical mix typical of 1920s picture theatre architecture, the facade combines a mix of \\"Classical\\" and \\"Mediterranean\\" decorative and design elements. There are five bays, not of equal width, defined by pilasters, at the top of which are decorative concrete urns. A balustraded concrete pediment unites the two bays either side of the central bay. This middle bay is wider and taller, with a high pediment with the name TRIUMPH in rendered block lettering. Below the theatre name is a cantilevered tiled window hood above a bank of five-paned casement windows with opaque, green and amber Arctic glass. Behind these windows is the original bio-box. In the bays either side are pairs of similar casement windows, with similar window hoods above. At street level there is a centrally placed wide, low-arched entrance, defined by half pillars on each side, with concrete steps leading to what was formerly a semi- open foyer. This has been partly enclosed with later timber-framed glass doors, recessed from the arch entrance. To either side of this arched entrance is a billboard case, and in the end bays are small \\"porthole\\" windows with a square leadlight panel in each, now enclosed with timber lattice. As was typical of suburban picture theatre construction of this period, the masonry facade returns along the sides only one narrow bay in depth. What the elegant facade was intended to obscure is that the main part of the structure, housing the auditorium, is a large, timber-framed space with a steep, gabled, galvanised iron roof. The side walls of the auditorium are clad externally with later cement sheeting. At the rear (southern) end of the main building the gable is in-filled with weatherboards and there is a lower, hipped roof extension over the stage area. The main change to the building is that the foyer has been expanded and pushed back into the auditorium, s. This space has a low, false ceiling of acoustic tiles, and the floor, which was formerly raked and part of the auditorium, has been raised and levelled. A ticket box and candy-bar are located on the western side of the foyer, and there are toilets on the eastern side. The auditorium is accessed from doorways at either side of the rear wall of the foyer. Above the renovated foyer is the projection booth, which is the original bio-box, accessed from steep, narrow timber stairs behind the ticket box on the western side, and near the men's toilets on the eastern side. The auditorium remains remarkably intact and retains much of its early decorative finishes. It is a large space, with the roof supported by unboxed laminated timber arches, and has an early lattice ceiling with hessian or canvas backing which follows the curve of the arches. There are three decorative light panels in the centre of this ceiling. There is a raked timber floor, sloped more steeply at the northern end of the building. The side walls are lined internally with vertically-jointed tongue and groove timber boards to dado height, and above this have early plasterboard panels with decorative \\"classical\\" mouldings between the timber arches. There is a small stage the southern end of the auditorium, with a proscenium arch in plasterwork with \\"classical\\" motifs. On either side of the stage, angled to direct focus to the rear wall, are large, early plasterboard panels with decorative \\"classical\\" mouldings. The rear wall is constructed of galvanised iron sheeting, on which is painted an early \\"screen\\". A later cinema screen which once filled the proscenium arch has been removed. There are two early sound horns which hang above the stage. There is off-stage space either side of the stage, which suggests that it may have been used for performance purposes as well.  Heritage listing  Triumph Cinema was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 July 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Classic Cinema, East Brisbane, constructed in 1927 as the Triumph Theatre, a suburban family cinema, is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history. The site has been associated with film exhibition - arguably the most significant form of 20th century popular culture/entertainment - since 1921, and until its closure in mid 2000, was amongst the longest operating of Queensland's picture theatres. The place is important in illustrating the nature of Queensland film exhibition, in particular the contribution of family-owned enterprises to this industry. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Classic Cinema is a rare, substantially intact, surviving 1920s Queensland picture theatre, and one of only three substantially intact, single-auditorium, interwar picture theatres remaining in Brisbane (the others being the Dawn (1928) at Chermside and the Gaythorne (1938–39) at Gaythorne). Of these, the Classic is the earliest and most ornate. In particular it retains a remarkably intact and highly decorative 1927 facade of \\"classic\\" picture theatre design now rare in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is, and always was, a very fine example of the 1920s suburban 'picture palace': a large auditorium built to a modest budget, with a more glamorous street facade to attract patrons, and remains important in illustrating the principal characteristics of this class of building and of this genre of picture theatre design. These characteristics include: an imposing facade incorporating an eclectic mix of \\"Classical\\" and \\"Mediterranean\\" decorative and design elements, in substantial materials, in a deliberate attempt to impress and create streetscape and townscape presence; a large, gable-roofed, single-span auditorium supported by laminated timber arches; a central arched entrance; a bio-box located above the entrance; early lattice ceiling to the auditorium interior; a raked timber floor; decorative plasterboard panelling along the auditorium walls; a decorative proscenium arch; a small performance stage with decorative plasterboard panels either side; and a \\"screen\\" painted onto the sheet metal rear wall. The aesthetic hierarchy of materials and details established between facade and main structure is particularly illustrative of this type of building. The place is important also in illustrating the principal characteristics of the work of Brisbane architect/builder Arthur Robson, who specialised in theatre construction and erected and/or designed dozens of suburban and regional theatres in Queensland in the interwar period. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has aesthetic value engendered by the well-proportioned decorative facade, the building's imposing presence in a suburban landscape; and the imposing space of the large arched auditorium with its decorative wall finishes, proscenium arch and lattice ceiling. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has been identified with the townscape and social character of East Brisbane since the 1920s; in the past has generated a strong sense of community focus, being a venue for local social activity and popular culture since 1921; and for well over a decade in recent years was associated with Brisbane's art-house movie circuit, being well-known to thousands of Queensland \\"film-buffs\\", and the venue for film festivals and screenings of film-school productions.

Unlike the Type 38 rifle bolt action, the crudely designed dust cover was not connected to the bolt action, and had to be manually moved before and after firing. However, the modified design was unable to overcome the shortcomings of the Type 30, and it was superseded by the Type 38 rifle. The dust cover design, slightly modified, was also used on the Type 46 rifles and Type 47 carbines made for Siam that was also made at the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal around the same time.Allan; White; Zielinkski. p. 66 Variants Type Hiroki Sub-caliber Training Device The Type Hiroki Sub-caliber Training Device was system designed to be temporarily fastened to a cannon barrel. The device was used to train Imperial Japanese Navy gun crews in basic cannon fire control operation. The device was formed around a stripped down Type 35 action made for this specific purpose. The Type 35 action is like the standard Type 35 rifles, including the stamped Imperial Chrysanthemum, except it's lacking a serial number stamped on the action itself and is lacking the manually actuated dust cover.Allan; White; Zielinkski. p. 70 Some of these rifles, stripped from the rest of its device, may have been made into some of the \\"02/45\\" rifles.Allan; White; Zielinkski. p. 80-82 02/45 rifle Little is known about these rifles, including its official designation, if it ever had one at all.

Pre-production Type 35 models, barreled actions from Hiroki Sub-caliber Training Devices, and uncompleted rifles that were left in storage were mated with Type 99 long rifle training rifle stocks and parts to make functional rifles for the ever-desperate Japanese war effort.

Her major research interests have been directed towards understanding the pathogenesis of brain injury resulting from fetal hypoxia, infection, alcohol exposure, growth restriction and prematurity.  Early life and education  Sandra Rees was born in Melbourne in 1942, and moved to Sydney in 1952 as her father, an Army officer, was appointed to the School of Military Engineering at Casula. Sandra earned a Bachelor of Science with Honours in 1963 and Master of Science in 1965, both from the University of Sydney. During this time she studied the structure and function of the visual system in the Department of Physiology, chaired by Professor Peter Bishop. In 1965 Sandra received a Lady Leitch Scholarship for overseas study, and relocated to London to complete a Master of Philosophy at University College in 1968. Sandra then returned to Melbourne to complete her Doctor of Philosophy at Monash University in 1977. Under the supervision of Dr Brian Cragg, Sandra learned to perform electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of the normal and abnormal brain. It was from this work that Sandra became particularly interested in brain development, and during her career she investigated the normal development of the somatosensory system and environmental factors that adversely affect the structural and functional development of the brain, such as hypoxia, infection, alcohol exposure and prematurity. In collaboration with neonatologists and obstetricians she devised clinically relevant animal models. She was also involved in trialing neuroprotective agents to ameliorate injury in the developing brain. For her contribution to the field of neurobiology and neurosciences, Sandra was awarded a Doctor of Science from the University of Melbourne in 2011.  Work  In 1984, Sandra joined the Department of Physiology at Monash University where she carried out research until 1992. Sandra then moved her laboratory to the University of Melbourne where she was promoted to Associate Professor in 1999, and Professor in 2007. Sandra's expertise in teaching spans participation in a wide range of undergraduate courses and postgraduate research supervision. Prior to her appointment at the University of Melbourne she lectured and demonstrated in the department of physiology at the University of Sydney, University College, London University and Monash University in neurophysiology, neuroanatomy and brain development. At the University of Melbourne from 1992 - 2009 Sandra taught undergraduate courses in neuroscience, histology, developmental neuroscience and cell biology and carried a full teaching load with convening responsibilities. Sandra has had extensive experience on committees at the university, faculty and departmental levels, serving on academic boards, equity and staff development committees and various selection committees for student and career interruption scholarships, as well as leadership programs for women. Sandra has been actively involved in mentoring young scientists, and has participated in women's mentoring programs, leadership courses and has given invited presentations to talk about women in research.

The school has two other street frontages: Vulture Street and Stanley Street. It was designed by Department of Public Works and built from 1899 to 1939. It is also known as Brisbane East State School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 November 1994.  History  East Brisbane State School, circa 1890 East Brisbane State School, (officially Brisbane East State School until September 1994), was one of the first large brick state schools in Brisbane. The original portion of the school was erected in 1899, with extensions added in 1900, 1938 and 1939. The single-storeyed timber Infants' School was erected in 1910-11. These buildings did not replace an earlier school on the site, but were erected to cater for a rapidly escalating East Brisbane/Woolloongabba population. East Brisbane's first suburban boom was in the mid-1880s, when the larger estates, such as Mowbraytown (1884), were subdivided, but at that time no provision was made for a state school, and East Brisbane children attended state schools at South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point and Dutton Park. The Brisbane's electric tramway reached Woolloongabba/East Brisbane in 1897, and in 1901 an extension through East Brisbane to Norman Park was constructed. The provision of this cheap, efficient form of public transport encouraged working-class families to the East Brisbane area on an unprecedented scale. The Department of Public Instruction, when recognising in 1897 the need for the establishment of a primary school in East Brisbane, underestimated the rate of population growth in the area and potential school enrolment. When the first school contract was let in 1899, it was for a brick building to cost and to accommodate 350 pupils; the school opened on 10 July 1899 with approximately 800 students, and by the end of the year, 1008 children were enrolled. By mid-1901, the school had been extended with the addition of two classrooms and a central entrance with bell turret, at a cost of . The school could then accommodate officially 730 pupils in four large and three small classrooms. East Brisbane State School was the first of several large brick schools constructed in Queensland around the turn of the century, in response to the population explosion which accompanied the post-Depression recovery. Norman Park State School was opened on 9 July 1900, and New Farm State School was completed in time for the start of the 1901 school year. They were designed for the Department of Public Instruction by the Government Architect's Office in the Department of Public Works, and reflected a new era of Queensland prosperity. Alfred Barton Brady was employed with the Queensland Government as Government Architect from 1892-1922. Brady claimed that he always advised on arrangement, style and materials, but it appears that his Senior Assistant, Thomas Pye supervised much of the detailed design. During the 30 years they worked together in the Department, Brady and Pye assembled a talented group of architects and draftsmen who were considered the equal of any in Australia, including from 1893 to 1903 John Smith Murdoch, who was to become Commonwealth Director- General of Works in 1927. From the office of the Government Architect there developed a tradition of fine government buildings, including many post offices, customs houses and court houses throughout the State. The Department of Public Instruction had handled school design and construction between 1879 and 1893, following which responsibility was returned to the Government Architect's office. Two of the most significant early 20th century schools designed by the Government Architect's office are Wooloowin State School (1914) and Windsor State School (1915-16), both of which were considered model schools when erected. Enrolments at East Brisbane State School continued to rise during the first decade of the 20th century. A large playshed was erected during the 1907-08 financial year, and in 1910-11 a separate, single-storeyed timber Infants' School was constructed at a cost of approximately . This building measured , and comprised two classrooms with dual desks and \\"kindergarten equipment\\", the latter being considered modern and progressive at the time. In 1910, the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company gave to the school the bell of the SS Melbourne. This still hangs in the bell turret. From the 1910s to the 1930s, East Brisbane grew gradually as a residential suburb. By the late 1930s, the need for increased accommodation at Brisbane East State School became acute. During the 1937-38 financial year, the Department of Public Works undertook additions costing . This comprised the extension of the northern and southern wings of the building and the remodelling of the existing portions of these wings. In the following year, a further worth of additions was authorised; this consisted of an extra storey erected over the central block, and alterations to the lower level of this block. The extensions were completed in 1939. The changing character of Brisbane's inner suburbs away from family homes has resulted in falling enrolments. In 2013 there were 197 children enrolled with 19 teachers (12 full-time equivalent). Many of the children have English as a second language.  Description  Tower and bell turret, 2015 The East Brisbane State School is a brick building with a two-storeyed central section and two projecting single-storeyed wings flanking an entrance court. The roof is of corrugated iron. The entrance to the building is marked by a tower with a bell Turret and the name of the school in decorative lettering, over a flight of stairs to an arched porch. Originally the central block was single-storeyed and in 1939 the upper floor was added. The projecting single-storeyed wings have also been extended. Some of the verandahs have been enclosed. The walls are of polychrome brickwork. Internally the walls are rendered to a height of above the floor, beyond that height the brickwork being kalsomined. In the 1899 section, the roof members are of light wrought iron, with ceilings of diagonal pine boarding. The under part of the school is open for play grounds and is asphalted. The rooms are well lighted from high gable windows; outlet ventilation from panels in the ceilings is conducted through iron tubing and Boyle's ventilators.  Heritage listing  East Brisbane State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 November 1994 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. East Brisbane State School survives as evidence of the rapid growth of East Brisbane and Woolloongabba which accompanied the expansion of public transport in Brisbane around the turn of the 19th century. Both the population boom and the substantial brick buildings at East Brisbane State School are illustrative of the late 1890s/early 1900s economic high on which Queensland entered the 20th century. East Brisbane State School is significant as one of the first large State Schools in Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The use of brick and restrained detailing is typical for government buildings of the period. The building displays characteristics of the style through its simple massing, contrasting materials and central tower. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. East Brisbane State School is significant as an outstanding example of a school building designed by the office of the Queensland Government Architect, which at the time was the equal of any architectural office in Australia.

Career  = Des chiffres et des lettres = In September 1974, Renard participated at age 19 on the game show Des chiffres et des lettres. He was noticed for his facility with mental calculation and by his shy attitude, hiding behind long hair and thin mustache, which he kept, as well as his anxious attitude, continuously moving on his chair. After twelve victories in a row, he earned 6,000 francs. In March 1975, the producer, Armand Jammot, hired him to join the team as a presenter, replacing Fabien Buhler. He was known as \\"Monsieur Calcul\\". Renard explained his hiring by the fact that \\"the game was at that time presented by Patrice Laffont who was 35. 'Monsieur Dictionnaire' was Max Favalelli, who was much older, 70. And I was the youngest, so it created a sort of balance\\".

Shortly before her marriage to Erickson on January 24, 1887, Peterson purchased a log cabin from a local pioneer named Ja Hu Stafford and filed for a 160-acre homestead. They would have three children: Lillian (born 1888), Louis (born 1891) and Hildegard (born 1895). The log cabin was located fourteen miles southeast of Fort Bowie in Bonita Canyon, a gorge in the Chiricahua Mountains. Erickson moved into the cabin first; his wife and newborn daughter, Lillian, joined him in the latter half of 1888. One of Erickson's first projects was to build a small fort to protect the homestead against Apache raids. The fort was a one-room building with thick stone walls, just a few yards from the cabin. It was never used; apart from a scare in 1890, when the Apache warrior Massai stole a horse from the Ericksons' neighbor, Stafford, there were no encounters with hostile Indians in Bonita Canyon. The fort was later incorporated into the main ranch house as a cellar. The Ericksons had trouble raising crops and needed money to improve the ranch, so Erickson went to Bisbee to find work as a carpenter, leaving his family alone for months at a time. It wasn't until July 1903, when Erickson became the first park ranger for the new Chiricahua National Forest, that he was able to move back to the ranch. He spent about half of each year working from home and the rest at various ranger stations or the district headquarters in Paradise, on the other side of the Chiricahua Mountains. Between 1899 and 1915, Erickson and his family built a two-and-a-half-story ranch house with adobe and board-and-batten walls to replace their original log cabin. Two years after the house was completed, in 1917, the Forest Service transferred him to Flagstaff, in northern Arizona. At that time, Erickson and his wife moved out leaving their daughters in charge of the ranch. Their daughters Hildegard and Lillian soon made major improvements by adding additional land and buildings to their holdings. In 1917, Hildegard, began boarding guests at the ranch on weekends and Lillian soon gave up teaching to help with the business. After Hildegard married in 1920, Lillian continued to run the operation as a guest ranch called the Faraway Ranch. Lillian Erickson Riggs and her husband Edward Murray Riggs (1885-1950), who she married in 1923, managed the Faraway Ranch guest operations into the mid-1960s, with Lillian managing the ranch until her death in 1977. Erickson remained in Flagstaff with his wife until his retirement in 1927, at which point they moved back to Faraway Ranch. They lived there for the rest of their lives, helping to improve the property and manage their daughter's guest ranch business. Erickson died in 1937 at age 78, followed by Emma who died Dec. 12, 1950 at the age of 96. Both were buried in Erickson Pioneer Cemetery not far from their home. Their former ranch house survives and is now the centerpiece of the Faraway Ranch Historic District in the Chiricahua National Monument.

Early life and background Capell was born on 24 October 1857 in London, the son of Lt.-Col. Arthur de Vere Capell, Viscount Malden, and Emma Martha Meux. Upon the death of his grandfather, Arthur Capell, 6th Earl of Essex, on 11 September 1892, George Capell succeeded to the titles of 7th Viscount Malden, 7th Earl of Essex and 8th Baron Capell of Hadham. Career Cassiobury House as it appeared during the 7th Earl's tenure Lord Essex held a number of military posts, including the rank of officer in the Grenadier Guards, Aide-de-Camp to HM King Edward VII, and Colonel in the Territorial Forces. He was appointed a major in the Hertfordshire Yeomanry on 23 November 1893. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in South Africa in late 1899, he volunteered for active service and was seconded to the Imperial Yeomanry, where on 14 February 1900 he was appointed Second in Command of the 12th Battalion. He left Southampton in the SS Mexican in February 1900, and arrived in Cape Town the following month, serving in South Africa until 1901. On 19 December 1908, Capell was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Hertfordshire. He later held the offices of Vice-Lord-Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Hertfordshire. Lord Essex's predecessors had invested considerably in rebuilding and decorating the family seat, Cassiobury House at Watford, to a luxurious standard. Both the 6th Earl and his uncle, George Capel-Coningsby, 5th Earl of Essex, were enthusiastic patrons of the arts, and had built up a large fine art collection at Cassiobury. After the death of the 6th Earl, it became apparent that the Capell family fortunes had diminished, and as the new Earl, George Capell was faced with some financial difficulty. In 1893, Christie's held an auction of some of the valuable paintings, books, porcelain and furniture from the Earl of Essex's collection at Cassiobury. George's second marriage to the daughter of a wealthy American industrialist the following year also helped to offset financial problems, and it was Adele's money that supported the estate in the early years of the 20th century and allowed the Earl to continue to host lavish parties. Cassiobury House enjoyed a high society profile at this time; in 1902 the Earl and Countess of Essex received the young Winston Churchill and King Edward VII at Cassiobury. In 1910, the house was presented in a flattering feature in Country Life magazine. Nevertheless, upkeep of Cassiobury was becoming increasingly expensive and in 1909 the family were forced to raise additional funds through the sale of of parkland to Watford Borough Council for housing. Cassiobury was let furnished while the family moved back to London. Personal life Portrait of his second wife, by John Singer Sargent, 1906. Lord Essex married twice. His first wife, Ellenor Harriet Maria Hartford, whom he married in 1882, died only three years later in 1885. Ellenor was the eldest daughter of William Henry Harford of Oldtown House in Almondsbury. Their only child, Algernon, was born in 1884. In 1893, Lord Essex married again, this time to the American heiress and socialite Adele Grant, daughter of the New York railway magnate David Beach Grant of the Grant Locomotive Works. The wedding at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 14 December 1893, was noted in The New York Times as a grand social event, presided over by Archdeacon Farrar, and accompanied by Sir Arthur Sullivan on the organ. Together, the couple had two daughters: * Lady Iris Mary Athenais de Vere Capell (1895–1977) * Lady Joan Rachel de Vere Capell (1899–1979), who married The 1st Viscount Ingleby. Lord Essex was run over by a taxi in September 1916. He died aged 58 on 25 September at Stanley House in Newmarket, Suffolk. His titles passed to his son from his first marriage, Algernon Capell. The death of The 7th Earl of Essex set in motion events that were to bring about the demise of Cassiobury House and change the town of Watford. Death duties, a form of taxation introduced in 1894 by the Liberal Government, had placed an increasing financial burden on aristocracy and landed gentry, and was responsible for the breaking up of many large estates across Britain.Robinson, p.28 Lord Essex's widow, Adele, was presented with a substantial tax bill. After six years, she decided to sell Cassiobury House, and a large sale of the contents was held over a period of ten days in June 1922 \\"by direction of the Right Honourable Adèle, Countess Dowager of Essex\\". The fine art collection was split up and sold to private collectors and museums around the world, and a number of significant works of art and interior fittings are now on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, United States. Adele did not, however, find a buyer for Cassiobury House; in July 1922 she died of a heart attack in her bath, and the house remained unoccupied for a further five years. Finally, it was sold for its materials and demolished in 1927. The former site of the house was acquired by property developers for suburban housing — now the residential area of Cassiobury — and the remainder of the estate was acquired by Watford Borough Council and is now in use as Cassiobury Park.

It is the causative agent of bacterial coldwater disease (CWD) and was first isolated in 1948 during a die-off in the salmonid Oncorhychus kisutch.Starliper, C. E. (2011). Bacterial coldwater disease of fishes caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum. Journal of Advanced Research, 2(2), 97-108. Characteristics Flavobacterium psychrophilum is a gram-negative bacteria ranging in size of 0.75-1.0 µm wide by 3-5 µm long. It is found in cold, fresh waters with an optimal growth temperature below 16C.Hesami, S., Metcalf, D. S., Lumsden, J. S., & MacInnes, J. I. (2011). Identification of Cold-Temperature-Regulated Genes in Flavobacterium psychrophilum . Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 77(5), 1593–1600. doi:10.1128/AEM.01717-10 When grown on Cytophaga Agar, F. psychrophilum produces bright yellow colonies with thin spreading margins not greater than 3mm in diameter. Motility is achieved by gliding, movement that does not involve the use of pili or flagella. The bacterium is positive for gelatin hydrolysis, albumin digestion, tributyrin digestion, tributyrin hydrolysis, E.coli cell autolysis, and casein hydrolysis. On its fish host, the pathogen can be found on external and internal sites such as skin/mucus, gills, brain, ascites, lesions, mucus, kidney, spleen, and reproductive excretions of spawning adults.Barnes, M. E., & Brown, M. L. (2011). A review of Flavobacterium psychrophilum biology, clinical signs, and bacterial cold water disease prevention and treatment. Open Fish Science Journal, 4, 40-48. Colonization is evident by faint, white areas on the host.  Metabolism  Flavobacterium psychrophilum has a strictly aerobic metabolism, but is unable to use carbohydrates as a source of carbon and energy. Instead, it relies on peptides for carbon and energy. Secreted proteases result in a mixture of amino acids and oligopeptides that comprise the main source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy.Duchaud, E., Boussaha, M., Loux, V., Bernardet, J. F., Michel, C., Kerouault, B., ... & Benmansour, A. (2007). Complete genome sequence of the fish pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum. Nature biotechnology, 25(7), 763-769. Peptidases degrade imported peptides to amino acids, which are then processed by amino acids catabolic pathways. The degradation of lipids to fatty acids is achieved by a phospholipase and by three enzymes of the esterase-lipase-thioesterase family. Beta-oxidation of fatty acids is performed by a long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase, three fatty acid dehydrogenases, a crotonase and three thiolases. Most of the degradation products of host proteins and lipids by the F. psychrophilum are available as citric acid cycle precursors. Phylogeny Because of its yellow pigmentation, Flavobacterium psychrophilum was originally believed to be a myxobacterium. However, its inability to produce fruiting bodies or degrade complex polysaccharides considered this classification inappropriate and was then suggested to belong within the genus Flexibacter. The low G+C composition of the DNA of F. psychrophilum was inconsistent with the high G+C content of Flexibacter species.Cipriano, R. C., & Holt, R. A. (2005). Flavobacterium psychrophilum, cause of bacterial cold-water disease and rainbow trout fry syndrome. US Department of the Interior, US Geological Survey, National Fish Health Research Laboratory. Its DNA G+C demonstrated that it was more closely associated with those of Flavobacterium species. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that F. psychrophilum, F.columnare, and F. maritimus were closely related and probably shared a common descent. Genome The genome of Flavobacterium psychrophilum consists of a circular chromosome of 2,861,988 bp, which is predicted to contain 2,432 protein-coding genes. Compared to environmental members of the family, it has a small genome probably related to its restricted ecological niche. The genome encodes 13 assumed secreted proteases that are involved in virulence and destruction of the host's tissues. Also, the genome encodes for bacterial hemolysins that cooperate with proteases for tissue destruction and thiol-activated cytolysins like proteins that are responsible for host tissue damage. The genome of the organism encodes for an extensive aerobic respiratory chain. Genome analysis revealed that sugar kinase and phosphotransferase systems used by bacteria for specific carbohydrate uptake are absent. However, genes encoding for enzymes for the glycolytic pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway are present in its genome. These two pathways are therefore involved in precursor metabolites. Gene FP1110 and FP1111 encode for cyanophycinase and cyanophycin synthetase may serve as a storage compound for carbon, nitrogen, and energy and allowing the organism to survive in low-nutrient conditions. Bacterial Coldwater Disease (BCWD) Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the causative agent of Bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD). Affected fish first display a whitish discoloration along the exterior side of the adipose fin then eventually progresses to invest the entire caudal peduncle.4 Infection can occur horizontally, between fish via waterborne and contact exposure, and vertically, because its association with early life stages of the fish. F. psychrophilum is able to resist lysozyme concentration greater than those that occur within salmoid eggs, making vertical transmission possible. Treatment for BCWD is possible in early stages. Bath treatments with either water- soluble oxytetracyline or quaternary ammonium compounds are recommended, but such treatments are ineffective once the erosion of the peduncle and caudal fin become evident. In Europe, treatment has been successful with the use of oxytetracyline, amoxicillin, and florfenicol with little antibiotic resistance forming in the bacteria. Currently, there are no commercially licensed vaccines available for use against this pathogen.

So all studies must use naturally occurring groups with genetic similarities and difference, thus the amount of data is limited. However, Genetics play some role in the development of PTSD. Approximately 30% of the variance in PTSD is caused from genetics alone. For twin pairs exposed to combat in Vietnam, having a monozygotic (identical) twin with PTSD was associated with an increased risk of the co-twin's having PTSD compared to twins that were dizygotic (non- identical twins). Research and potential influences Genetics play some role in the development of PTSD. Approximately 30% of the variance in PTSD is caused from genetics alone. For twin pairs exposed to combat in Vietnam, having a monozygotic (identical) twin with PTSD was associated with an increased risk of the co-twin's having PTSD compared to twins that were dizygotic (non-identical twins). There is also evidence that those with a genetically smaller hippocampus are more likely to develop PTSD following a traumatic event. Research has also found that PTSD shares many genetic influences common to other psychiatric disorders. Panic and generalized anxiety disorders and PTSD share 60% of the same genetic variance. Alcohol, nicotine, and drug dependence share greater than 40% genetic similarities. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. A recent study reported significant interactions between three polymorphisms in the GABA alpha-2 receptor gene and the severity of childhood trauma in predicting PTSD in adults. A study found those with a specific genotype for G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2), a protein that decreases G protein- coupled receptor signaling, and high environmental stress exposure as adults and a diagnosis of lifetime PTSD. This was particularly prevalent in adults with prior trauma exposure and low social support. Recently, it has been found that several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) interact with childhood trauma to predict severity of adult PTSD. These findings suggest that individuals with these SNPs who are abused as children are more susceptible to PTSD as adults. This is particularly interesting given that FKBP5 SNPs have previously been associated with peritraumatic dissociation in medically injured children (that is, dissociation at the time of the birth trauma), which has itself been shown to be predictive of PTSD. Furthermore, FKBP5 may be less expressed in those with current PTSD. Another recent study found a single SNP in a putative estrogen response element on ADCYAP1R1 (encodes pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor or PAC1) to predict PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in females. Incidentally, this SNP is also associated with fear discrimination. The study suggests that perturbations in the PACAP-PAC1 pathway are involved in abnormal stress responses underlying PTSD. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that requires an environmental event that individuals may have varied responses to so gene-environment studies tend to be the most indicative of their effect on the probability of PTSD then studies of the main effect of the gene. Recent studies have demonstrated the interaction between PFBP5 and childhood environment to predict the severity of PTSD. Polymorphisms in FKBP5 have been associated with peritraumatic dissociation in mentally ill children. A study of highly traumatized African-American subjects from inner city primary-care clinics indicated 4 polymorphisms of the FKBP5 gene, each of these functional. The interaction between the polymorphisms and the severity of childhood abuse predicts the severity of the adult PTSD symptoms. A more recent study of the African-American population indicated that the TT genotype of the FKBP5 gene is associated with the highest risk of PTSD among those having experienced childhood adversity, however those with this genotype that experienced no childhood adversity had the lowest risk of PTSD. In addition alcohol dependence interacts with the FKBP5 polymorphisms and childhood adversity to increase the risk of PTSD in these populations. Emergency room expression of the FKPB5 mRNA following trauma was shown to indicate a later development of PTSD. Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) is an enzyme that catalyzes the extraneuronal breakdown of catecholamines. The gene that codes for COMT has a functional polymorphism in which a valine has been replaced with a methionine at codon 158. This polymorphism has lower enzyme activity and has been tied to slower breakdown of the catecholamines. A study, of Rwandan Genocide survivors, indicated that carriers of the Val allel demonstrated the expected response relationship between the higher number of lifetime traumatic events and a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD. However, those with homozygotes for the Met/Met genotype demonstrated a high risk of lifetime PTSD independent of the number of traumatic experiences. Those with Met/Met genotype also demonstrated a reduced extinction of conditioned fear responses with may account for the high risk for PTSD experienced by this genotype. Many genes impact the limbic-frontal neurocircuitry as a result of its complexity. The main effect of the D2A1 allele of the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) has a strong association with the diagnosis of PTSD. The D2A1 allele has also shown a significant association to PTSD in those having engaged in harmful drinking. In addition a polymorphism in the dopamine transporter SLC6A3 gene has a significant association with chronic PTSD. A polymorphism of the serotonin receptor 2A gene has been associated with PTSD in Korean women. The short allele of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) has been shown to be less efficient then the long allele and is associated with the amygdala response for extinction of fear conditioning. However, the short allele is associated with a decreased risk of PTSD in a low risk environment but a high risk of PTSD in a high risk environment. The s/s genotype demonstrated a high risk for development of PTSD even in response to a small number of traumatic events, but those with the l allele demonstrate increasing rates of PTSD with increasing traumatic experiences. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) offer an opportunity to identify novel risk variants for PTSD that will in turn inform our understanding of the etiology of the disorder. Early results indicate the feasibility and potential power of GWAS to identify biomarkers for anxiety-related behaviors that suggest a future of PTSD. These studies will lead to the discovery of novel loci for the susceptibility and symptomatology of anxiety disorders including PTSD.  Epigenetics  Gene and environment studies alone fail to explain the importance the developmental stressor timing exposure to the phenotypic changes associated with PTSD. Epigenetic modification is the environmentally induced change in DNA that alters the function rather than the structure of the gene. The biological mechanism of epigenetic modification typically involves the methylation of cytosine within a gene that produces decreased transcription of that segment of DNA. The neuroendocrine alteration seen in animal models parallel those of PTSD in which low basal cortisol and enhanced suppression of cortisol in response to synthetic glucocorticoid becomes hereditary. Lower levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA have been demonstrated in the hippocampus of suicide victims with histories of childhood abuse. It has not been possible to monitor the state of methylation over time, however the interpretation is early developmental methylation changes are long-lasting and enduring. It is hypothesized that epigenetic-mediated changes in the HPA axis could be associated with an increased vulnerability to PTSD following traumatic events. These findings support the mechanism in which early life trauma strongly validates as a risk factor for PTSD development in adulthood by recalibrating the set point and stress-responsivity of the HPA axis. Studies have reported an increased risk for PTSD and low cortisol levels in the offspring of female holocaust survivors with PTSD. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be relevant to the intrauterine environment. Mothers with PTSD produced infants with lower salivary cortisol levels only if the traumatic exposure occurred during the third trimester of gestation. These changes occur via transmission of hormonal responses to the fetus leading to a reprogramming of the glucocorticoid responsivity in the offspring.  Evolutionary psychology  Evolutionary psychology views different types of fears and reactions caused by fears as adaptations that may have been useful in the ancestral environment in order to avoid or cope with various threats. In general, mammals display several defensive behaviors roughly dependent on how close the threat is: avoidance, vigilant immobility, withdrawal, aggressive defense, appeasement, and finally complete frozen immobility (the last possibly to confuse a predator's attack reflex or to simulate a dead and contaminated body). PTSD may correspond to and be caused by overactivation of such fear circuits. Thus, PTSD avoidance behaviors may correspond to mammal avoidance of and withdrawal from threats. Heightened memory of past threats may increase avoidance of similar situations in the future as well as be a prerequisite for analyzing the past threat and develop better defensive behaviors if the threat should recur. PTSD hyperarousal may correspond to vigilant immobility and aggressive defense. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (and phenomena such as the Stockholm syndrome) may in part correspond to the appeasement stage and possibly the frozen immobility stage. There may be evolutionary explanations for differences in resilience to traumatic events. Thus, PTSD is rare following traumatic fire that may be explained by events such as forest fires' long being part of the evolutionary history of mammals. On the other hand, PTSD is much more common following modern warfare, which may be explained by modern warfare's being a new development and very unlike the quick inter-group raids that are argued to have characterized the paleolithic.

Its elevation is above sea level. The ridge is a forested ridge, with at least two types of forest and two systems of vernal pools. It is a very long and unbroken ridge with two water gaps: one carved by Catawissa Creek and one carved by Nescopeck Creek. This later gap was exploited as a transportation corridor with the construction of the Lehigh & Susquehanna Turnpike between the respective frontier communities at Lausanne Landing and Nescopeck (opposite bank from Shickshinny, PA on the Susquehanna River) in 1805 connecting the newly developing Wyoming Valley with Philadelphia and the Delaware River valley; cutting off over 100 miles between Philadelphia and Wilkes-Barre. Today's Route PA 93 derives from this historic pack mule road. Rock formations in the ridge include the Lower Helderberg Formation, the Onondaga Formation, the Spechty Kopf Formation, the Trimmers Rock Formation, and the Mauch Chunk Formation. In the most recent ice age, it was affected by glaciation. Native Americans historically settled in the vicinity of Nescopeck Mountain. It was visited by Europeans as early as 1755. The ridge's name most likely means \\"dirty waters\\" or \\"black waters\\". Two Pennsylvania State Game Lands and one state park are situated partially on it. The ridge spans numerous townships in Columbia County and Luzerne County. Geography Nescopeck Mountain and Pennsylvania Route 339 from the north in Mifflin Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania The elevation of Nescopeck Mountain is above sea level, making it the highest ridge in Columbia County. Townships that Nescopeck Mountain occupies include Beaver Township, Mifflin Township, and Main Township in Columbia County. The ridge extends into several townships in Luzerne County, including Nescopeck Township , and reaches at least as far east as Nescopeck State Park. Nescopeck Mountain is an unbroken ridge, being described as \\"regular and almost unbroken\\" in Thomas Francis Gordon's 1832 book A Gazetteer of the State of Pennsylvania. John Gosse Freeze's 1888 book A History of Columbia County, Pennsylvania: From the Earliest Times described the ridge as \\"beautiful and regular in its formation\\". It stretches from near the Susquehanna River almost to the Lehigh River and has a length of nearly . It is considerably steeper and higher on its northern side, at least in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Berwick. The ridge is too rocky for agriculture, with large boulders being abundant on it. Nescopeck Mountain is part of a long chain of continuously forested mountains and ridges that stretches from Moosic Mountain to the Susquehanna River. It is considered to be an extension of Catawissa Mountain. The ridge is similar in height to mountains in the vicinity of the Wyoming Valley. The ridge has a topographic prominence of up to approximately in places and up to at the Nescopeck Creek water gap. However, it is only high near its western end at Mainville. Interstate 80 crosses through the water gap carved by Nescopeck Creek in Nescopeck Mountain. The Susquehanna River Lowlands are in the vicinity of the ridge. Large groups of small kettle holes are found along the base of the ridge. Nescopeck Mountain occupies the United States Geological Survey quadrangles of Shumans, Nuremberg, Berwick, Sybertsville, Freeland, and White Haven. Streams and valleys Catawissa Creek just upstream of where it cuts between Catawissa Mountain and Nescopeck Mountain A creek known as Nescopeck Creek is in the vicinity of Nescopeck Mountain. Additionally, Black Creek, a major tributary of Nescopeck Creek, empties into the larger creek at the base of the ridge. The ridge is north of the creek for a portion of its length. There is a valley known as the Nescopeck Valley which is between Nescopeck Mountain and Buck Mountain. Nescopeck Creek flows through this valley. The valley is long and wide. Some streams on the ridge are part of the Lehigh River watershed. A stream known as Scotch Run flows through a valley with Nescopeck Mountain on its northern edge. Nescopeck Mountain forms a water gap with Catawissa Mountain. Catawissa Creek cuts through this water gap. There is also a water gap carved by Nescopeck Creek through Nescopeck Mountain. Both of these water gaps are relatively narrow. The mountain serves as part of the dividing line between the Susquehanna River and the Lehigh River watersheds. For some distance, the ridge runs parallel to the Susquehanna River at a distance of . Geology Illustration of the geology of Nescopeck Mountain at Catawissa Creek 1883 Nescopeck Mountain is mainly formed by hard, upturned conglomerates belonging to the Pocono Formation. There are a total of three rock formations on Nescopeck Mountain in the Berwick Quadrangle, which is in Columbia County and Luzerne County. From north to south, these rock formations are the Trimmers Rock Formation (from the Devonian Period), the Spechty Kopf Formation (from the Devonian Period and the Mississippian Period), and the Onondaga Formation (from the Devonian Period). All three of these formations occur in bands that are at an angle relative to the surface. The Spechty Kopf Formation occurs at the peak of the ridge and extends to a depth of approximately below sea level. The Onondaga Formation runs from near the ridge's peak to below sea level. The Trimmers Rock Formation runs from the middle elevations of the ridge to more than below sea level. Additionally, the Mauch Chunk Formation is found on the ridge. The summit of the ridge consists of hard Pocono Formation rock. A plain of the Catskill Formation occurs to the north of the ridge. There are coal basins to the south of Nescopeck Mountain. During an ice age, glaciers pressed against Nescopeck Mountain and eventually moved over it, carrying gravel from the Susquehanna River. The ridge was near the southern edge of the most recent period of glaciation. History and etymology Nescopeck Mountain was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1190986. The ridge is also known as Nescopec Mountain. This variant name appears in Israel C. White's 1883 book The geology of the North Branch Susquehanna River Region in the six counties of Wyoming, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Columbia, Montour and Northumberland. Nescopeck Mountain is most likely named for a Native American village called Nescopeck. The word nescopeck itself is a corruption of neskchoppeck, which may mean \\"dirty waters\\" or \\"black waters\\". Historically, there was a Native American village in the vicinity of Nescopeck Mountain, where the borough of Nescopeck is in modern times. Additionally, the Forks Indians arrived at the ridge in 1740 after being evicted from their lands in the Lehigh Valley. As early as 1755, a pair of Moravian missionaries, Christian Seidel and Henry Frey, descended the ridge while visiting Native Americans. In 1838, a man named Mr. Butler requested permission of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to construct a tunnel or through cut through Nescopeck Mountain for the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Glen Summit Springs Hotel operated on top of Nescopeck Mountain. It was constructed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. During its most active use, it attracted visitors from the Wyoming Valley and from the East Coast of the United States. The Lehigh Valley Railroad historically passed over the ridge. In the late 1800s, the ridge was prospected for coal. The top of Nescopeck Mountain was devoid of trees by the middle of the 1800s. Logging has been done on the ridge in the early 2000s and plans have been made to construct communication towers on the ridge. Local produce is sometimes traded over Nescopeck Mountain. The mountain is almost completely undeveloped. A gypsy moth infestation began on Nescopeck Mountain in the summer of 2014, causing hundreds of trees to be defoliated. The Bureau of Forestry expects to begin spraying the area in May 2015 and June 2015. Biology Nescopeck Mountain, a forested ridge Nescopeck Mountain is one of several mountains in Columbia County to contain undisturbed oak/mixed hardwood forests. This forest is also an Appalachian Oak Forest. Specific tree species on the ridge in Columbia County include red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black birch, American chestnut, pitch pine, red maple, and serviceberry. Other plants on the ridge include black huckleberry, lowbush blueberry, mountain laurel, sheep's laurel, bracken fern, wild sarsaparilla, and Virginia creeper. An ephemeral/fluctuating pool natural community known as the Edgewood Vernal Pools is located on and near Nescopeck Mountain. It consists of dozens of vernal pools created by glaciation. Numerous amphibian species breed in the pools and hardwood trees and hemlock are present on the southern edge of the pool system. A globally rare species of invertebrate was observed in the pools in 1990. Another system of vernal pools known as the Briggsville Vernal Pools are found north of the ridge. The Nescopeck Mountain Barrens are a ridgetop dwarf-tree forest natural community. The barrens consist of scrub oaks, hairgrass, pitch pines, little bluestems, and blueberries. Recreation A portion of the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58 is on Nescopeck Mountain. Additionally, the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 187 contain the Nescopeck Mountain Barrens. The ridge is on the northern border of the 3550-acre Nescopeck State Park. Historically, there were trails leading up to the top of Nescopeck Mountain. There is high visibility from the top of the ridge and the town of Bloomsburg can be seen. The water gap where Catawissa Creek flows between Nescopeck Mountain and Catawissa Mountain was described as \\"attractive\\" by I. W. Hartman in 1912. The water gap where Nescopeck Creek flows through Nescopeck Mountain is described as \\"impressive\\" in Jeff Mitchell's book Paddling Pennsylvania.

M-Theory was later applied to other areas, such as speech recognition. On certain image recognition tasks, algorithms based on a specific instantiation of M-Theory, HMAX, achieved human-level performance.Serre T., Oliva A., Poggio T. (2007) A feedforward architecture accounts for rapid categorization. PNAS, vol. 104, no. 15, pp. 6424-6429 The core principle of M-Theory is extracting representations invariant to various transformations of images (translation, scale, 2D and 3D rotation and others). In contrast with other approaches using invariant representations, in M-Theory they are not hardcoded into the algorithms, but learned. M-Theory also shares some principles with Compressed Sensing. The theory proposes multilayered hierarchical learning architecture, similar to that of visual cortex. Intuition =Invariant representations= A great challenge in visual recognition tasks is that the same object can be seen in a variety of conditions. It can be seen from different distances, different viewpoints, under different lighting, partially occluded, etc. In addition, for particular classes objects, such as faces, highly complex specific transformations may be relevant, such as changing facial expressions. For learning to recognize images, it is greatly beneficial to factor out these variations. It results in much simpler classification problem and, consequently, in great reduction of sample complexity of the model. A simple computational experiment illustrates this idea. Two instances of a classifier were trained to distinguish images of planes from those of cars. For training and testing of the first instance, images with arbitrary viewpoints were used. Another instance received only images seen from a particular viewpoint, which was equivalent to training and testing the system on invariant representation of the images. One can see that the second classifier performed quite well even after receiving a single example from each category, while performance of the first classifier was close to random guess even after seeing 20 examples. Invariant representations has been incorporated into several learning architectures, such as neocognitrons. Most of these architectures, however, provided invariance through custom-designed features or properties of architecture itself. While it helps to take into account some sorts of transformations, such as translations, it is very nontrivial to accommodate for other sorts of transformations, such as 3D rotations and changing facial expressions. M-Theory provides a framework of how such transformations can be learned. In addition to higher flexibility, this theory also suggests how human brain may have similar capabilities. =Templates= Another core idea of M-Theory is close in spirit to ideas from the field of compressed sensing. An implication from Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma says that a particular number of images can be embedded into a low-dimensional feature space with the same distances between images by using random projections. This result suggests that dot product between the observed image and some other image stored in memory, called template, can be used as a feature helping to distinguish the image from other images. The template need not to be anyhow related to the image, it could be chosen randomly. =Combining templates and invariant representations= The two ideas outlined in previous sections can be brought together to construct a framework for learning invariant representations. The key observation is how dot product between image I and a template t behaves when image is transformed (by such transformations as translations, rotations, scales, etc.). If transformation g is a member of a unitary group of transformations, then the following holds: \\\\langle gI,t \\\\rangle = \\\\langle I,g^{-1}t \\\\rangle (1) In other words, the dot product of transformed image and a template is equal to the dot product of original image and inversely transformed template. For instance, for image rotated by 90 degrees, the inversely transformed template would be rotated by -90 degrees. Consider the set of dot products of an image I to all possible transformations of template: \\\\lbrace \\\\langle I,g^\\\\prime t\\\\rangle  g^\\\\prime \\\\in G \\\\rbrace. If one applies a transformation g to I, the set would become \\\\lbrace \\\\langle gI,g^\\\\prime t\\\\rangle  g^\\\\prime \\\\in G\\\\rbrace. But because of the property (1), this is equal to \\\\lbrace \\\\langle I,g^{-1}g^\\\\prime t\\\\rangle  g^\\\\prime \\\\in G\\\\rbrace. The set \\\\lbrace g^{-1}g^\\\\prime  g^\\\\prime \\\\in G \\\\rbrace is equal to just the set of all elements in G. To see this, note that every g^{-1}g^\\\\prime is in G due to the closure property of groups, and for every g^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} in G there exist its prototype g^\\\\prime such as g^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} = g^{-1}g^\\\\prime (namely, g^\\\\prime = gg^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}). Thus, \\\\lbrace \\\\langle I,g^{-1}g^\\\\prime t\\\\rangle  g^\\\\prime \\\\in G\\\\rbrace = \\\\lbrace\\\\langle I,g^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}t\\\\rangle  g^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} \\\\in G \\\\rbrace. One can see that the set of dot products remains the same despite that a transformation was applied to the image! This set by itself may serve as a (very cumbersome) invariant representation of an image. More practical representations can be derived from it. In the introductory section, it was claimed that M-Theory allows to learn invariant representations. This is because templates and their transformed versions can be learned from visual experience - by exposing the system to sequences of transformations of objects. It is plausible that similar visual experiences occur in early period of human life, for instance when infants twiddle toys in their hands. Because templates may be totally unrelated to images that the system later will try to classify, memories of these visual experiences may serve as a basis for recognizing many different kinds of objects in later life. However, as it is shown later, for some kinds of transformations, specific templates are needed. Theoretical aspects =From orbits to distribution measures = To implement the ideas described in previous sections, one need to know how to derive a computationally efficient invariant representation of an image. Such unique representation for each image can be characterized as it appears by a set of one-dimensional probability distributions (empirical distributions of the dot-products between image and a set of templates stored during unsupervised learning). These probability distributions in their turn can be described by either histograms or a set of statistical moments of it, as it will be shown below. Orbit O_I is a set of images gI generated from a single image I under the action of the group G, \\\\forall g \\\\in G. In other words, images of an object and of its transformations correspond to an orbit O_I. If two orbits have a point in common they are identical everywhere,F Anselmi, JZ Leibo, L Rosasco, J Mutch, A Tacchetti, T Poggio (2014) Unsupervised learning of invariant representations in hierarchical architectures arXiv preprint arXiv:1311.4158 i.e. an orbit is an invariant and unique representation of an image. So, two images are called equivalent when they belong to the same orbit: I \\\\sim I^\\\\prime if \\\\exists g \\\\in G such that I^\\\\prime = gI. Conversely, two orbits are different if none of the images in one orbit coincide with any image in the other.H. Schulz-Mirbach. Constructing invariant features by averaging techniques. In Pattern Recognition, 1994. Vol. 2 - Conference B: Computer Vision amp; Image Processing., Proceedings of the 12th IAPR International. Conference on, volume 2, pages 387 –390 vol.2, 1994. A natural question arises: how can one compare two orbits? There are several possible approaches. One of them employs the fact that intuitively two empirical orbits are the same irrespective of the ordering of their points. Thus, one can consider a probability distribution P_I induced by the group's action on images I (gI can be seen as a realization of a random variable). This probability distribution P_I can be almost uniquely characterized by K one-dimensional probability distributions P_{\\\\langle I ,t^k \\\\rangle} induced by the (one-dimensional) results of projections \\\\langle I,t^k\\\\rangle, where t^k, k = 1,...,K are a set of templates (randomly chosen images) (based on the Cramer-Wold theorem H. Cramer and H. Wold. Some theorems on distribution functions. J. London Math. Soc., 4:290–294, 1936. and concentration of measures). Consider n images X_n \\\\in X. Let K \\\\geq \\\\frac{2}{c\\\\epsilon^2} \\\\log \\\\frac{n}{\\\\delta} , where c is a universal constant. Then d(P_I,P_I^\\\\prime)-dK(P_I,P_I^\\\\prime) \\\\leq \\\\epsilon, with probability 1 - \\\\delta^2, for all I, I^\\\\prime \\\\in X_n. This result (informally) says that an approximately invariant and unique representation of an image I can be obtained from the estimates of K 1-D probability distributions P_{\\\\langle I,t^k \\\\rangle} for k = 1,...,K. The number K of projections needed to discriminate n orbits, induced by n images, up to precision \\\\epsilon (and with confidence 1 - \\\\delta^2) is K \\\\geq \\\\frac{2}{c\\\\epsilon^2} \\\\log \\\\frac{n}{\\\\delta}, where c is a universal constant. To classify an image, the following \\"recipe\\" can be used: # Memorize a set of images/objects called templates; # Memorize observed transformations for each template; # Compute dot products of its transformations with image; # Compute histogram of the resulting values, called signature of the image; # Compare the obtained histogram with signatures stored in memory. Estimates of such one-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) P_{\\\\langle I ,t^k \\\\rangle} can be written in terms of histograms as \\\\mu^k_n(I) = 1/\\\\leftG\\\\right \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\leftG\\\\right} \\\\eta_n(\\\\langle I, g_i t^k \\\\rangle) , where \\\\eta_n, n = 1, ... , N is a set of nonlinear functions. These 1-D probability distributions can be characterized with N-bin histograms or set of statistical moments. For example, HMAX represents an architecture in which pooling is done with a max operation. =Non-compact groups of transformations= In the \\"recipe\\" for image classification, groups of transformations are approximated with finite number of transformations. Such approximation is possible only when the group is compact. Such groups as all translations and all scalings of the image are not compact, as they allow arbitrarily big transformations. However, they are locally compact. For locally compact groups, invariance is achievable within certain range of transformations. Assume that G_0 is a subset of transformations from G for which the transformed patterns exist in memory. For an image I and template t_k, assume that \\\\langle I,g^{-1}t_k\\\\rangle is equal to zero everywhere except some subset of G_0. This subset is called support of \\\\langle I,g^{-1}t_k\\\\rangle and denoted as supp(\\\\langle I, g^{-1}t_k\\\\rangle). It can be proven that if for a transformation g^\\\\prime, support set will also lie within g^\\\\prime G_0, then signature of I is invariant with respect to g^\\\\prime. This theorem determines the range of transformations for which invariance is guaranteed to hold. One can see that the smaller is supp(\\\\langle I, g^{-1}t_k\\\\rangle), the larger is the range of transformations for which invariance is guaranteed to hold. It means that for a group that is only locally compact, not all templates would work equally well anymore. Preferable templates are those with a reasonably small supp(\\\\langle gI, t_k\\\\rangle) for a generic image. This property is called localization: templates are sensitive only to images within a small range of transformations. Note that although minimizing supp(\\\\langle gI, t_k\\\\rangle) is not absolutely necessary for the system to work, it improves approximation of invariance. Requiring localization simultaneously for translation and scale yields a very specific kind of templates: Gabor functions. The desirability of custom templates for non-compact group is in conflict with the principle of learning invariant representations. However, for certain kinds of regularly encountered image transformations, templates might be the result of evolutionary adaptations. Neurobiological data suggests that there is Gabor-like tuning in the first layer of visual cortex.F. Anselmi, J.Z. Leibo, L. Rosasco, J. Mutch, A. Tacchetti, T. Poggio (2013) Magic Materials: a theory of deep hierarchical architectures for learning sensory representations. CBCL paper, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA The optimality of Gabor templates for translations and scales is a possible explanation of this phenomenon. =Non- group transformations= Many interesting transformations of images do not form groups. For instance, transformations of images associated with 3D rotation of corresponding 3D object do not form a group, because it is impossible to define an inverse transformation (two objects may looks the same from one angle but different from another angle). However, approximate invariance is still achievable even for non-group transformations, if localization condition for templates holds and transformation can be locally linearized. As it was said in the previous section, for specific case of translations and scaling, localization condition can be satisfied by use of generic Gabor templates. However, for general case (non-group) transformation, localization condition can be satisfied only for specific class of objects. More specifically, in order to satisfy the condition, templates must be similar to the objects one would like to recognize. For instance, if one would like to build a system to recognize 3D rotated faces, one need to use other 3D rotated faces as templates. This may explain the existence of such specialized modules in the brain as one responsible for face recognition. Even with custom templates, a noise-like encoding of images and templates is necessary for localization. It can be naturally achieved if the non-group transformation is processed on any layer other than the first in hierarchical recognition architecture. =Hierarchical architectures= The previous section suggests one motivation for hierarchical image recognition architectures. However, they have other benefits as well. Firstly, hierarchical architectures best accomplish the goal of ‘parsing’ a complex visual scene with many objects consisting of many parts, whose relative position may greatly vary. In this case, different elements of the system must react to different objects and parts. In hierarchical architectures, representations of parts at different levels of embedding hierarchy can be stored at different layers of hierarchy. Secondly, hierarchical architectures which have invariant representations for parts of objects may facilitate learning of complex compositional concepts. This facilitation may happen through reusing of learned representations of parts that were constructed before in process of learning of other concepts. As a result, sample complexity of learning compositional concepts may be greatly reduced. Finally, hierarchical architectures have better tolerance to clutter. Clutter problem arises when the target object is in front of a non- uniform background, which functions as a distractor for the visual task. Hierarchical architecture provides signatures for parts of target objects, which do not include parts of background and are not affected by background variations.Liao Q., Leibo J., Mroueh Y., Poggio T. (2014) Can a biologically- plausible hierarchy effectively replace face detection, alignment, and recognition pipelines? CBMM Memo No. 003, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA In hierarchical architectures, one layer is not necessarily invariant to all transformations that are handled by the hierarchy as a whole. Some transformations may pass through that layer to upper layers, as in the case of non-group transformations described in the previous section. For other transformations, an element of the layer may produce invariant representations only within small range of transformations. For instance, elements of the lower layers in hierarchy have small visual field and thus can handle only a small range of translation. For such transformations, the layer should provide covariant rather than invariant, signatures. The property of covariance can be written as distr(\\\\langle \\\\mu_l(gI),\\\\mu_l(t)\\\\rangle) = distr(\\\\langle \\\\mu_l(I),\\\\mu_l(g^{-1}t)\\\\rangle), where l is a layer, \\\\mu_l(I) is the signature of image on that layer, and distr stands for \\"distribution of values of the expression for all g \\\\in G\\". Relation to biology M-theory is based on a quantitative theory of the ventral stream of visual cortex.M. Riesenhuber and T. Poggio Hierarchical Models of Object Recognition in Cortex (1999) Nature Neuroscience, vol. 2, no. 11, pp. 1019-1025, 1999.T. Serre, M. Kouh, C. Cadieu, U. Knoblich, G. Kreiman, and T. Poggio (2005) A Theory of Object Recognition: Computations and Circuits in the Feedforward Path of the Ventral Stream in Primate Visual Cortex AI Memo 2005-036/CBCL Memo 259, Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, Cambridge. Understanding how visual cortex works in object recognition is still a challenging task for neuroscience. Humans and primates are able to memorize and recognize objects after seeing just couple of examples unlike any state-of-the art machine vision systems that usually require a lot of data in order to recognize objects. Prior to the use of visual neuroscience in computer vision has been limited to early vision for deriving stereo algorithms (e.g.,D.H. Hubel and T.N. Wiesel (1962) Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat’s visual cortex The Journal of Physiology 160.) and to justify the use of DoG (derivative-of-Gaussian) filters and more recently of Gabor filters.D. Gabor (1946) Theory of Communication J. IEE, vol. 93, pp. 429-459.J.P. Jones and L.A. Palmer (1987) An Evaluation of the Two-Dimensional Gabor Filter Model of Simple Receptive Fields in Cat Striate Cortex J. Neurophysiol., vol. 58, pp. 1233-1258. No real attention has been given to biologically plausible features of higher complexity. While mainstream computer vision has always been inspired and challenged by human vision, it seems to have never advanced past the very first stages of processing in the simple cells in V1 and V2. Although some of the systems inspired - to various degrees - by neuroscience, have been tested on at least some natural images, neurobiological models of object recognition in cortex have not yet been extended to deal with real- world image databases.Thomas Serre, Lior Wolf, Stanley Bileschi, Maximilian Riesenhuber, and Tomaso Poggio (2007) Robust Object Recognition with Cortex- Like Mechanisms IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, VOL. 29, NO. 3 M-theory learning framework employs a novel hypothesis about the main computational function of the ventral stream: the representation of new objects/images in terms of a signature, which is invariant to transformations learned during visual experience. This allows recognition from very few labeled examples - in the limit, just one. Neuroscience suggests that natural functionals for a neuron to compute is a high-dimensional dot product between an \\"image patch\\" and another image patch (called template) which is stored in terms of synaptic weights (synapses per neuron). The standard computational model of a neuron is based on a dot product and a threshold. Another important feature of the visual cortex is that it consists of simple and complex cells. This idea was originally proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. M-theory employs this idea. Simple cells compute dot products of an image and transformations of templates \\\\langle I,g_it^k\\\\rangle for i = 1,...,G (G is a number of simple cells). Complex cells are responsible for pooling and computing empirical histograms or statistical moments of it. The following formula for constructing histogram can be computed by neurons: \\\\frac{1}{G}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{G}\\\\sigma(\\\\langle I,g_it^k\\\\rangle+n\\\\Delta), where \\\\sigma is a smooth version of step function, \\\\Delta is the width of a histogram bin, and n is the number of the bin. Applications =Applications to computer vision= In Qianli Liao, Joel Z Leibo, Youssef Mroueh, Tomaso Poggio (2014) Can a biologically-plausible hierarchy effectively replace face detection, alignment, and recognition pipelines? CBMM Memo No. 003Qianli Liao, Joel Z Leibo, and Tomaso Poggio (2014) Learning invariant representations and applications to face verification NIPS 2014 authors applied M-theory to unconstrained face recognition in natural photographs. Unlike the DAR (detection, alignment, and recognition) method, which handles clutter by detecting objects and cropping closely around them so that very little background remains, this approach accomplishes detection and alignment implicitly by storing transformations of training images (templates) rather than explicitly detecting and aligning or cropping faces at test time. This system is built according to the principles of a recent theory of invariance in hierarchical networks and can evade the clutter problem generally problematic for feedforward systems. The resulting end-to-end system achieves a drastic improvement in the state of the art on this end-to-end task, reaching the same level of performance as the best systems operating on aligned, closely cropped images (no outside training data). It also performs well on two newer datasets, similar to LFW, but more difficult: significantly jittered (misaligned) version of LFW and SUFR-W (for example, the model's accuracy in the LFW \\"unaligned & no outside data used\\" category is 87.55±1.41% compared to state-of-the-art APEM (adaptive probabilistic elastic matching): 81.70±1.78%). The theory was also applied to a range of recognition tasks: from invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems on publicly available data sets (CalTech5, CalTech101, MIT-CBCL) and complex (street) scene understanding tasks that requires the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture- based objects (on StreetScenes data set). The approach performs really well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and was shown to outperform several more complex state-of-the-art systems constellation models, the hierarchical SVM-based face-detection system. A key element in the approach is a new set of scale and position-tolerant feature detectors, which are biologically plausible and agree quantitatively with the tuning properties of cells along the ventral stream of visual cortex. These features are adaptive to the training set, though we also show that a universal feature set, learned from a set of natural images unrelated to any categorization task, likewise achieves good performance. =Applications to speech recognition= This theory can also be extended for the speech recognition domain. As an example, inGeorgios Evangelopoulos, Stephen Voinea, Chiyuan Zhang, Lorenzo Rosasco, Tomaso Poggio (2014) Learning An Invariant Speech Representation CBMM Memo No. 022 an extension of a theory for unsupervised learning of invariant visual representations to the auditory domain and empirically evaluated its validity for voiced speech sound classification was proposed. Authors empirically demonstrated that a single- layer, phone-level representation, extracted from base speech features, improves segment classification accuracy and decreases the number of training examples in comparison with standard spectral and cepstral features for an acoustic classification task on TIMIT dataset.https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1 References Category:Machine learning Category:Computer vision Category:Speech recognition ","title":"M-Theory (learning framework)"},{"id":"44632035","text":"Micle is a Romanian-language surname.

According to the artist, the designer Jesse Kanda asked \\"if I had a girl's name when I was a kid, I told him that I have this image in my head when I listen to a song of mine that I really love or that I feel happy with. I move really slowly in a very effeminate way [and] close my eyes and I see this naked being who exists in front of an audience. Everyone is simultaneously attracted to it and repulsed\\". Upon reflection she felt that \\"Those were all projections of my psyche; of how I viewed my own sexuality and how I engaged with people through the lens of sensuality. Xen is an 'it'. I lean towards calling Xen 'her' in response to the fact that society historically leans towards men having more power. Me calling Xen 'her' is an equalisation of that.\\" This is reflected in the video for the song \\"Thievery\\".

Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia nylanderi is classified in the subgenus Cylindricaria in which it is distinguished from related species by the thallus divided into numerous narrow tubular rugose branches, by the abundant fertile pycnidia,Pycnidium (pycnidia plural) is a small flash-shaped structure (200–300 µm wide near the base) that produces conidia, which escape through an opening (ostiole) at the top and function in reproduction, asexually or sexually and by lichen substances of zeorin and (-)-16-hydroxykaurane, occasionally with unknowns. The species is similar to V. corrugata which lacks (-)-16-hydroxykaurane. Vermilacinia leopardina, which has the same lichen substances, differs in its shiny cortex and sterile pycnidia that appear as irregularly shaped black spots and regularly shaped transverse bands. Pycnidia in Vermilacinia nylanderi are not always conspicuous, especially in the field, because they are often immersed in the cortex. They are nevertheless evident by the bump- like elevated areas along the cortical surface. Their abundance is conspicuous when the thallus is sectioned and examined under a dissecting microscope. Pycnidia in V. nylanderi are abundantly fertile as seen by conidia (conidium singular), which “are specialized, non-motile fungal spores,” that appear to function as re-establishing the lichen with an “appropriate photobiont,” a form of asexual reproduction,Bungartz, F. 2002.

Vermilacinia howei, which is similar to V. leopardina in the irregular black banding on thallus branches, occurs further away from the coast on the Vizcaíno Peninsula.

The genus Vermilacinia is distinguished from Niebla by the absence of chondroid strands in the medulla,Chondroid strands in the genus Niebla appear as tiny threads or cords running lengthwise in the medulla, interconnected diagonally or crosswise by other freely branched solitary hyphal cells. There are usually many such cords in the Niebla medulla. The medulla of Vermilacinia subgenus Cylindricaria has long flexible hyphal cells united at frequent intervals into knots. They are referred to as fascicles of hyphal cells. There are many such fascicles in a single medulla. It appears that when a thallus takes in moisture, the hyphal cells bend outwards, and as they dry they come together. Medulla hyphae in a herbarium specimen may lose elasticity over time, and all the fascicles may appear as a single cord and by the major lichen substance predominantly of terpenes.

It was built from 1853 onwards. It is also known as Eskgrove Cottage and Grey Eagles. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This single-storeyed stone residence was erected in 1853 for former Sydney bank manager Archibald Hepburn Hutchinson, on land he had acquired from surveyor James Charles Burnett earlier the same year. Burnett had alienated Eastern Suburban Allotments 51-53, a property of just over fronting the Brisbane River near Norman Creek, between November 1851 and December 1852. Whether Burnett resided on this land is not clear. Hutchinson acquired title to all three allotments in February 1853, for the sum of . It is likely that a report in The Moreton Bay Courier of 18 June 1853, mentioning the construction for Mr Hutchinson of a stone building for a dwelling house, on the bank of the river below Kangaroo Point, refers to the construction of Eskgrove. By the mid-1850s there were only three river estates along the south bank of the Brisbane River from Shafston Reach to Norman Creek: Shafston House (commenced in 1851 as Ravenscott for Rev. Robert Creyke and completed in 1852 for Henry Stuart Russell); the Rev. Thomas Mowbray's Riversdale (probably constructed - now the site of Mowbray Park) and Eskgrove. All three houses were of stone construction. Hutchinson died at Eskgrove in 1854, following which his wife and children appear to have returned to Sydney. Their Brisbane house was retained as a rental property. Eskgrove was a middle-class residence with fine river views, and was occupied by a number of persons prominent in the development of early Queensland, including squatters William Kent Jr (1857–58) and Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior (1858-59), Governor Bowen's private secretary Abram Moriarty (1859–60), Lieutenant George Poynter Heath, RN, Portmaster of Queensland (-) and Robert Kerr Acheson by 1868. The Brisbane Courier of 26 September 1868 described the property as pleasantly situated on the bank of the river, containing six rooms, with kitchen and two servants' rooms, stables and outhouses attached, standing in a well grassed thirteen acre paddock and has a kitchen garden. By 1876 William David Nisbet, Chief Engineer Harbours and Rivers, had taken up residence. However, it appears that the place still retained a close association with the Hutchinson family, for when Catherine Isabella Hutchinson (Archibald's daughter) married squatter Andrew Bowman in March 1877, her normal place of residence was given as Eskgrove, Brisbane. In 1880 Nisbet purchased the house and the whole of the Eskgrove estate from the Hutchinson family for . Title was transferred to Brisbane businessmen NJ Howes and AS Leslie in 1885, at which time the estate was subdivided and Thomas Scanlan, a Woolloongabba publican and later Mayor of South Brisbane, purchased the house and about of land. An 1885 plan of the Eskgrove Estate, shows that the house comprised a square core with one large rear wing, with a shed and stables located between the house and Lytton Road. Following Scanlan's death in December 1892, Eskgrove again became a rental property. As part of the realisation of Scanlan's estate, Eskgrove was offered for sale early in 1895, at which time the property comprised a stone house with a timber wing and timber outbuildings on (this included a river frontage, as Laidlaw Parade did not yet extend between Scanlan and Eskgrove streets), plus another with a long frontage to the Brisbane River and to Lytton Road. By 1902 Laidlaw Parade had been extended between Scanlan and Eskgrove streets, and Eskgrove house and land (still the 1885 subdivisions) was offered at auction as the Scanlan Estate. At this time the earlier rear timber wing appears to have been replaced and the shed and stables had been removed, but a cottage, not shown on the 1885 estate map and associated with the house, was located on the river side of Laidlaw Parade, to the west of the main residence. Eskgrove remained a rental property, despite transfers of title in 1905 and 1910, until the Joseph Walter Tritton family, who owned the property from 1910 to 1966, made it their family home about 1920. In later years the house apparently was used as flats and then a nursing home called Grey Eagles. During these years the building was variously extended and modified. Since 1975 the house has been occupied as a private residence, and renamed Eskgrove. In 2010, Eskgrove was sold for $1,000,000 and again in 2012 for $1,070,000.  Description  This is an 1850s low-set, single-storeyed sandstone house which originally consisted of a square stone core with a projecting front room and a rear service wing. The house has a steep sloping broken-back corrugated iron roof topped by a pyramidal chimney ventilator. External walls are painted pebble dash render over the original sandstone, with plain margins along the base line, wall edges and around the doors. There is a verandah on three sides of the core and a pavilion on the rear eastern side. The front and western verandahs are supported by precast aluminium doric columns. Pairs of French doors on either side of the projecting vestibule have wooden shutters. Brick walls divide the interior into four rooms. The two front rooms share a back-to-back fireplace. French doors provide assess between rooms and onto the verandah. The rear wing also has a broken-back roof and is built of stone with a timber pediment back and front. In 1985 this wing comprised three bedrooms. Various rear extensions in asbestos sheeting and weatherboards include bathrooms, extended verandah and laundry. Many mature trees provide ample shade for this pre-separation colonial dwelling which remains substantially intact in form.  Heritage listing  Eskgrove was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Eskgrove, constructed in 1853, is significant historically as a rare surviving Brisbane pre-separation residence, closely associated with the earliest riverine development of the eastern suburbs. Associated with a number of persons significant in the early development of Queensland, the place contributes to our understanding of residential and social hierarchies in early Brisbane, and of the role of the Brisbane River within this structure.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Eskgrove is significant as important evidence of 1850s stone construction techniques in Queensland, and of the early adaptation of Georgian design to Brisbane lifestyle and climate. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place is valued by the community for its early association with the development of East Brisbane, and as one of the earliest surviving residences in Brisbane.

Her work is an example of folk art, outsider art, and visionary art. Early life Annie Miller was born in Buxton, on Cape Hatteras, and was raised in a Methodist family of 13 children and 14 foster children. Annie briefly attended college in Blackstone, Virginia, before marrying John Hooper and moving to Stumpy Point. John worked as a fisherman, while Annie taught Sunday school, played organ, and wrote poetry. The couple had one child, Edgar. John and Edgar served in World War II, and during their absence Annie suffered the first in a series of depressions. After the war, the Hoopers moved to Buxton and opened a motel. Sculptures Annie Hooper began sculpting upon returning from a prolonged mental health treatment in Raleigh. Her first sculpture, Moses on Mount Nebo looking over the River Jordan into the Promised Land of Canaan, was created from driftwood, putty, and house paint. Later figures (which she referred to as “symbols”) incorporated cement and shells, and were accompanied by descriptive placards. During the forty years she was active as an artist, Hooper created nearly 5,000 sculptures, which she arranged throughout her home in tableaus representing an estimated 300 Biblical scenes. Hooper did not sell any of her work, preferring to lead visitors on tours in which she used the figures to act out religious stories. Legacy Following Hooper’s death, preservation of her work was overseen by folklorist Roger Manley, with financial assistance from The Jargon Society. It is now housed in the permanent collection of North Carolina State University’s Gregg Museum of Art and Design. A solo exhibition of Hooper’s work, titled A Blessing from the Source, was held in 1988.

It was designed by James Cowlishaw built from 1864 to 1930s circa. It is also known as Hanworth Home for the Aged and The Hospice. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 December 1997.  History  Hanworth, a substantial, brick, single-storeyed residence near Norman Creek at East Brisbane, was erected in 1864-65 for Lieutenant George Poynter Heath, RN, Portmaster of Queensland and member of the Marine Board, and his family. It was designed by early Brisbane architect James Cowlishaw. Hanworth originally stood on just over , first alienated by a Sydney land speculator in 1851. The land fronted the main road to Lytton, had a substantial frontage to Norman Creek, and from the highest point near the Lytton Road, possessed excellent views of the Humbug Reach of the Brisbane River, overlooking New Farm. In July 1863 Heath purchased this land for . It was close to a number of fine residences already established along Humbug Reach, including Eskgrove (occupied by the Heaths from at least May 1861), Riversdale (Mowbray Park – Mowbray Park War Memorial) and Shafston House upstream, and Bulimba House further downstream. GP Heath (1830-1921) was born at Hanworth in Norfolk, England, second son of Rev. Charles Heath and Mary Annole Poynter. Educated at Cheltenham College, he joined the navy as a cadet in 1845. In 1846-53 he served in (under Owen Stanley till 1850) and in the Fantome and the Calliope on the Australian station. On his return to England he worked at the Admiralty drawing charts of areas surveyed by the Rattlesnake. Late in 1859 he applied for the government post of marine surveyor in the new colony of Queensland and was appointed. On 23 February 1860, before sailing for Queensland, he married Elizabeth Jane Innes. They arrived in Brisbane in late August 1860, and Heath immediately took up his appointment with the Department of the Surveyor-General. The early 1860s were formative years for the new colony. One of the first actions of the colonial government was to establish a Select Committee on Government Departments (1860), which recommended that a Portmaster be appointed to take overall charge of the Harbour Master's Department, and the appointment of GP Heath as Portmaster of Queensland, a position he held for nearly 30 years, was made in January 1862. During his long tenure, Heath was responsible for supervising the opening of 13 new ports (including Townsville and Cairns), establishing 33 lighthouses, 6 lightships and 150 small lights, and marking of the inner route through the Barrier Reef. In 1862, the colonial government also established the Marine Board of Queensland, comprising the Portmaster of the colony and four other members. From 1869, when he retired from the Royal Navy as a Commander, until his Queensland retirement in 1890, GP Heath was Chairman of the Marine Board. He was also active in Anglican work, serving as chairman of various committees in Synod from 1876 to 1889. For many years he held a commission of the peace. He is memorialised in East Brisbane in Heath and Hanworth Streets and Heath Park. Work on the construction of Hanworth had been commenced by 16 July 1864. The Heaths were prominent members of Brisbane society, and the architect they chose to design their new home was equally well-known and successful. James Cowlishaw practised architecture in Brisbane from 1860 until , when he retired to devote his attention to his many other business interests, including ownership of The Telegraph newspaper. In the early 1860s he established himself as Brisbane's first successful architect in private practice, and at the time Hanworth was under construction, Cowlishaw had a dozen other major projects underway, including Oakwal,the fine stone residence commissioned by Queensland's then Chief Justice, Sir James Cockle. The Heaths were still resident at Eskgrove in November 1864 when their third child was born, but had left by August 1865 and certainly had occupied Hanworth by the time twin sons were born in July 1866. It is likely they moved into Hanworth in the first half of 1865. Hanworth was the Heath family's home for nearly 25 years. They moved amongst Brisbane's highest society, and entertained frequently; at the reception held at Hanworth on the marriage of their daughter Cecelia Georgina in 1886, guests included the Governor and Lady Musgrave, the Premier and Mrs Samuel Griffith, Treasurer James Robert Dickson, Mr Justice and Mrs Harding, several high-ranking government officials and officers of visiting ships. On 30 June 1890, Commander Heath retired from the position of Portmaster of Queensland. Although the family returned to England soon afterwards, Hanworth remained in Heath's (and later his daughters') possession, and by 1891 was leased by Brisbane bank manager, (later stock and share broker), Alexander Henry Hudson and his family. The Hudsons resided at Hanworth for about 22 years, and were still in occupation when the property was advertised for sale in October 1909. At this time the house was described as a Substantial Brick Structure, containing 8 rooms and all offices, with of land, having long frontage to the main Lytton road and Norman Creek. (Brisbane Courier 2/10/1909:9:1) The property did not sell, however, and in early 1912, after the Hudsons had moved to Kangaroo Point, was put up for auction as the Hanworth Estate, subdivided into 57 residential allotments. A number of the vacant allotments sold at this time, but the house remained unoccupied until acquired by Mrs Mary Marguerite Wienholt, who obtained title in July 1913. The grounds had been reduced to just over , and did not include the former tennis court. Mrs Wienholt was a member of the Brisbane branch of the Theosophical Society, established in New York in 1875 with the aims of universal brotherhood and the study of comparative religion, philosophy and science. At Hanworth in 1913, Mrs Wienholt established, in memory of her mother, a home for elderly, impoverished gentlewomen, and renamed the place The Hospice. Mrs Wienholt took a strong personal interest in the running of the home until handing over the place in mid-1927 to the Brisbane Theosophical Society. Front view of Hanworth, 1930 A description of the house in 1930 suggested that the conversion to a hospice and nursing home in the early 20th century did not substantially alter the 1860s core. Most of the rooms in the long brick front wing remained intact, although one of the large bedrooms had been partitioned into two. A hallway ran from the front entrance (facing north/northeast) to the rear verandah. To the left were the bedrooms (some with marble mantelpieces); to the right was the drawing room, and beyond that a large bow- windowed dining room, with doors opening onto side and rear verandahs. The drawing and dining rooms had back-to-back fireplaces, with marble mantelpieces. Side wings ran back from each end of the front section, creating a small U-shaped courtyard in which a grove of mandarine trees had been established. The east wing contained an attic room with gabled windows, which was accessed via a small lobby and staircase at the southern end of the wing. The grounds contained a number of mature pine trees of different varieties, and roses and creeping plants climbed the ornamental iron verandah posts. The principal alterations appear to have been the construction, by 1918, of a timber wing off the west wing at the rear of the house – probably associated with the hospice conversion and possibly occupying the site of a former kitchen wing – and an inter-war two-storeyed brick addition at the south end of the east wing. The Theosophical Society continued to operate the home according to Mrs Wienholt's wishes, for nearly 70 years. It was sold in 1995 to the Anglican Church, which renamed it the Hanworth Home for the Aged and continued to accommodate only women. Marisa and Philip Vecchio purchased Hanworth in 2012 in memory of Marisa's mother Romana Preston who died from ovarian cancer. They commenced extensive renovations in preparation for the house's 150th anniversary, but a fire extensively damaged the property in March 2013. However, the Vecchio family persisted with the restoration and completed it in time for the anniversary. Their efforts were recognised by receiving the John Herbert Memorial Award (the highest award) from the National Trust of Australia in August 2014.  Description  Driveway and building in 2015 Hanworth is a single-storeyed 1860s masonry residence with timber and masonry extensions, standing on a rise above Lytton Road. A drive leads from the Lytton Road to the main entrance, which faces north. There is a garden between Lytton Road and the building, which includes a lawn area and a number of pine trees. The original section of Hanworth is a single-storeyed, U-shaped, unpainted redbrick building, with characteristics demonstrating a Georgian influence. The principal elevation faces north with a broad verandah running around the northern, eastern and western perimeter of the building. The original building is only one room in depth. The hipped roof and separate verandah roof are sheeted with corrugated iron. At each end of the roof is a moulded brick chimney. It is substantially intact with most of its original glazing, joinery and hardware. The verandah has a timber floor and elegant cast-iron grille columns supporting the concave roof. The underside of the verandah roof is lined with tongue and groove boards. A timber hand rail and modern wrought iron balustrade run between the columns. The main doorway is in the centre of the northern facade with three sets of French doors to the east and two sets of French doors and a bay window to the west. All the French doors have external shutters. From the northern verandah the large two- panelled front door leads to the entry hall which runs through to a rear door. The open verandah that ran around the internal section of the U has been enclosed. The drawing room opens from the right of the entry hall. It has a fine white marble fireplace surround and an internal door that leads to the dining room. The dining room has a large bay window and a black marble fireplace surround. The drawing and dining rooms contain pieces of furniture, sideboards, chairs and tables which probably date from the period of the conversion of Hanworth into a home for gentlewomen. The dining room forms the north-west corner of the building. Behind it is the western wing containing the kitchen and a timber bedroom section. The kitchen is in the 1860s building, although this is probably not the original kitchen as there is no evidence of a chimney. The gabled timber section of the wing probably dates from the conversion to institutional use and contains 7 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Internally the walls are tongue and groove and the casement windows have diamond patterned glazing bars. A besser block laundry is at the end of this wing. To the left of the entry hall three bedrooms open onto the northern verandah; two of the bedrooms have been created by subdividing one of the original bedrooms. The eastern wing contains three bedrooms and an office. A staircase leads to an attic above the 1860s building. The attic addition has three dormer windows and although not part of the original design probably dates from the Heath's occupation of the house. At the rear of the eastern wing is a two-storeyed, inter-war masonry addition which contains bedrooms and bathrooms.  Heritage listing  Hanworth Home for the Aged was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 December 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Hanworth, erected in 1864-65, is important in illustrating the early development of East Brisbane, and remains one of the suburb's earliest surviving houses. Like nearby Eskgrove, Mowbray Park, and Shafston House, Hanworth, with its former frontage to Norman Creek and views of the Brisbane River, remains important surviving evidence of the fine riverine estates which lined the Humbug Reach of the Brisbane River in the mid-19th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Hanworth, erected in 1864-65, is important in illustrating the early development of East Brisbane, and remains one of the suburb's earliest surviving houses. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. It also has potential to reveal further information about 1860s building techniques in Brisbane, and about the work of early Brisbane architect James Cowlishaw. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The grounds have been reduced considerably, but the house survives as one of the most intact 1860s residences in Brisbane, and is an excellent example of its type. The simple U-shaped building with its hipped roof, concave verandah, cast-iron columns and red brick, retains the elegant symmetry and proportion of a Georgian-influence design. Internally the planning and proportions of the rooms are still evident and a substantial amount of original fabric remains, particularly joinery, which includes doors, windows, shutters, architraves and skirtings. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The earliest section of Hanworth is important in exhibiting a number of aesthetic and architectural features. Its picturesque siting on a rise allowed for views up and down the Brisbane River and along Norman Creek. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place is important for its long and close association with George Poynter Heath, the first Portmaster of Queensland, who, during his long tenure of office (1862 to 1890), oversaw the establishment of many of Queensland's principal ports, and made the Queensland coast safer for navigation with the erection of an extensive network of lighthouses, lightships, small lights and markers. The place is significant also for its long association with the work of Mary Marguerite Wienholt and the Brisbane Theosophical Society in aged care for women.

Her grandfather in 1929 established National Shoes in Dallas, the oldest family-owned business in the city. Four generations of her family worked there prior to its closure in the 1990s. She was formerly employed by the North Central Texas Council of Governments, Dallas Area Rapid Transit, and the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce. In the March 4, 2014 Republican primary for House District 102, Koop led the incumbent Stefani Carter, an African American, by 163 votes. She received 3,646 votes (34.7 percent) to Carter's 3,483 (33.2 percent). Two other candidates held another critical 32 percent of the ballots cast. One of the two eliminated candidates, Samuel Brown, endorsed Koop over Carter, who had first announced her candidacy for the Texas Railroad Commission but then decided to run for a third term in the House. Brown claimed that Carter told him her primary interest in running again was to collect a state pension which she could receive after two more terms in the state House, a contention Carter dismissed out of hand. In her runoff election campaign, Koop challenged Carter on the \\"trust\\" issue. Carter was originally seen as more conservative than Koop, whom she tried to cast as a Moderate Republican, who as a city council member until she was term-limited in 2013 had voted to place numerous bond issues on the ballot. Carter claimed that Koop had supported on the council $500 million in increased taxes. Koop nevertheless sought with considerable success to depict herself as more conservative politically than Carter. She stressed her support for border security and opposition to illegal immigration. On May 27, Koop unseated Carter, 5,072 (59.8 percent) to 3,405 (40.2 percent). In addition to border security, Koop outlined her key campaign issues as minimizing the impact upon Texas of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010 by U.S. President Barack H. Obama, protecting the water supply of the greater Dallas area, and strengthening local schools. Koop vowed as a legislator to \\"fight every program and tax that hurts small businesses so we can grow our economy and create jobs.\\" Koop carried the endorsement of the Dallas Morning News, former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert, Tarrant County Judge Glen Whitley, Richardson Mayor Laura Maczka, and the Richardson Firefighters Association. In the general election held on November 4, 2014, Koop claimed the House seat by defeating the Republican- turned-Democrat, George M.

The series is written by Holly Black and Cassandra Clare and is their first collaboration. The series was acquired by Scholastic in April 2012. The first book, The Iron Trial, was published on September 9, 2014, and hit third on the New York Times Middle Grade Bestseller List. The series is set in an underground school where mages train apprentices to control the elements. The books are illustrated by Scott Fischer. The last book, The Golden Tower, was published on September 11, 2018.  The Iron Trial  The protagonist of the series is twelve-year-old Callum Hunt, or Call, who was raised by his father and former mage - Alastair Hunt. Alastair rejected the world of magic after the death of his wife Sarah at the Cold Massacre during the Third Mage War. 'The Enemy of Death', Constantine Madden, was responsible for her death. In the first book 'The Iron Trial', Call participates in a series of tests to see whether he has sufficient magic to attend training at the Magisterium. At the Magisterium apprentices are trained to be mages using the four elements of fire, air, water, and earth. Alastair instructs Call to fail the tests by whatever means necessary. Callum, without effort, fails the tests, scoring even lower than those who do not even possess magical ability. But Master Rufus, a master at the Magisterium, sees that Call has power, but lacks control. Master Rufus decides to take him on as an apprentice. He also selects Tamara Rajavi and Aaron Stewart - the top-ranked students. During the book, after doing countless seemingly pointless and boring exercises, the three apprentices become friends after a frigid start and Call starts to decide to stay on at the Magisterium after his Iron year to receive more tutelage and go against his father's wishes. After an exercise in the caverns Call, Tamara, and Aaron are confronted by a fire Devoured who tells them their fates. 'One will die, one will fail, another is already dead.' Call at dinner mentions this to the other students, one of whom, Drew, says the prophecy is complete babble. When Call walks out of the Cafeteria, Drew asks for a moment to talk to him and says that it wasn't a good idea to tell everyone about the prophecy, but Call gets confused about what Drew means. At this Drew realizes something important and that night runs away leaving a note behind. When his note is found Call and the other apprentices and Masters go to look for him. After finding him Call, Aaron, Tamara, a bronze year student Alex Strike, and Drew are confronted by a pack of chaos-ridden wolves. Chaos is the fifth element and only Makars can wield it. When confronted Aaron ends up saving their lives by sending the wolves to the void using chaos magic and in doing so reveals himself to be a Makar, astonishing everyone. On the way back to the Magisterium, Jasper DeWinter, someone whom Call dislikes and vice versa, tells everyone the story of Constantine Madden the chaos mage, and why he started the third mage war. While Jasper is telling this story Call finds a chaos- ridden wolf pup in the snow and decides to take the wolf, later named Havoc, into the Magisterium with him without telling anyone. Later afterward, an incident where Call foolishly decides to participate in an activity that he could not accomplish because of his bad leg that was smashed when he was a baby, Aaron is kidnapped by the Enemy's minions when taking Havoc for a walk. As neither Tamara nor Call wanted to leave Aaron they decided to save him without telling anyone. Walking in the forest outside the mission gate and the magisterium they come to a bowling alley where they find Aaron tied up and being dangled on top of a chaos elemental by their classmate Drew who works for the Enemy. Tamara releases Aaron and Call tries to leave too, but Drew stops him by releasing the chaos elemental, which kills Drew after he calls the elemental a coward. Chased into another room, Call is confronted by the Enemy of Death who, while being briefly angry about his son Drew's death, takes off his mask and tells Call that Call is Constantine Madden, The Enemy of Death and that he is Master Joseph who taught Constantine/Call. Callum and Master Joseph have a conversation where Joseph explains that during the Cold Massacre Constantine had been mortally wounded and was dying, so he placed his soul into the body of a baby. That baby was Callum. Call also finds out that his father suspects he is The Enemy of Death as during the massacre after Constantine's soul had entered Call's body, Call's mother had written the words, 'Kill the Child' on the ice where she lay almost dead. Alastair had also sent a letter to Master Rufus earlier that year asking him to bind Callum's magic, sending Master Rufus a wristband that later turned out to be Constantine's. Then, Tamara and Aaron accidentally broke the roof with the bowling alley sign. Master Joseph disappeared and Call was rescued. Later, Call was back at the Infirmary after passing out. There he has a conversation with Master Rufus about what happened in the bowling alley. Call doesn't tell him though, about Master Joseph and their conversation. After that, Master Rufus gives him permission to contact his father. When Call is out of the Infirmary, he and his friends pass through the First Gate.  The Copper Gauntlet In the second book 'The Copper Gauntlet', Call finds that his father may be trying to destroy both him and Havoc and runs away from home to go back to the magical world. When he leaves his house he notices a design of what appears to be a copper gauntlet. He meets up with his friends Aaron and Tamara at Tamara's house. There, he meets Alex Strike, the boyfriend of Tamara's sister, Kimiya. Call finds out from Tamara's parents that his dad used to be an exceptional metal mage. They go back to the Magisterium when they find out that an attack was made on a dangerous weapon called the Alkahest. They research the Alkahest and discover that it's the copper gauntlet that Call's dad, Alastair was researching. The Alkahest is a weapon that can only harm a Makar and can be used to rip out the Makar's soul. Call predicts that his dad faked an attack on the Alkahest so that they'd move the Alkahest to a more secure vault made of metal. He concludes that Alastair wants to use the Alkahest on Call to destroy Constantine's soul and potentially kill Call. He tells Tamara about his dad potentially trying to steal the Alkahest. Tamara misunderstands Call's concerns and thinks that Alastair wants to use the Alkahest to kill Aaron. She tells Master Rufus this and later, it is confirmed that the Alkahest is missing. Alex Strike tells Call that the mages will not hesitate to kill his dad to protect the Makar, Aaron, so Call decides to set out to find and warn his dad. Tamara and Aaron agree to go with him, and because Jasper catches them, they force Jasper to come along with them. They stop at a junkyard where they think Calls father may have been and they find letters from Master Joseph, to his father that describe his location using coordinate points. That night, they wake up to find a metal elemental named, Automotones. Automotones was controlled by the school, and after defeating it they decide that they can not return to the Magisterium. They are found by the Masters on the highway, and the Masters use air elementals to take control of their car and carry them away. Call and the others escape the car and hide out and rest in a cave, made by Aaron. The next day they are surrounded by Chaos-ridden. Instead of killing them, the Chaos- ridden kneel in front of Call and Call is forced to explain his identity to everyone there. They are escorted by the army to the coordinate points which turns out to be a tomb. In the tomb, it is revealed that Constantine's body is still intact and that Joseph plans to transfer the soul from Call's body to Constantine's body. His plans are quickly foiled though, as Alastair quickly steals the Alkahest and destroys Constantine Madden's body, therefore foiling the plan to transfer the souls. Because of Constantine's death, Call receives the chaos magic in Constantine's body and becomes a Makar. They quickly escape, and bring along Constantine's head as proof they killed the \\"Enemy\\", but his soul was still living inside Call. When they get back, they are praised as heroes, but a shocking fact is revealed. Nobody from the Assembly sent the elementals.  The Bronze Key  In the third book 'The Bronze Key', the action starts shortly after the ending of the second as Call, Aaron and Tamara are beginning their third or bronze year at the Magisterium. The book picks up the story with a death among the students and a spy on the loose threatening Call. The group is invited to a party in their honor, where two tragic incidents occur. First, Call is almost killed by a falling chandelier when he is invited to a room by Celia with a note, but it is not as it seems. A few minutes later, he sees Jennifer, the person who delivered the note, dead in the water. This throws the party into chaos, and everybody starts to evacuate. Call's dad takes the children to the Magisterium, where he believes they will be safe. Tamara and Aaron both believe that the spy, who they think tried to kill Call, is from the Magisterium, so they both keep an eye on Call 24/7. But that night, when Call comes to bed he is attacked by an elemental and almost killed if Aaron didn't step in and send the elemental to the void using his Makar or chaos powers. They started to investigate themselves and wanted to go down to the prison where they held the elementals. But to do that, they would have to break into Anastasia Tarquin's room, Alex's stepmother. Upon entering Anastasia's room, they discover that the key they look for is hidden inside a voice-activated safe. After multiple faulty attempts, Call comes to a realization and enunciates the word that opens the safe: Jericho. Jericho is the name of Constantine's twin brother, killed in an accident while they were students. Constantine was driven to find a method of \\"curing death\\" because of the loss of his brother. After retrieving the key, the trio enter it in the elemental gate, and as the gates disappear, they rush inside with a purpose. No information is retrieved from the elementals. Master Rufus surprises them by announcing that Alma, the leader of the Order of Disorder, will be teaching Aaron and Call. Aaron and Call make a deal with Alma to help her free the Chaos-ridden animals if she helps them communicate with the first victim, Jennifer. Later, Callum and Aaron help free the Chaos- ridden, assisted by Anastasia Tarquin and Alex Strike. Call passes out in a truck. When he wakes up, Aaron goes with him to visit Alma. Alma teaches them how to communicate with the dead. Callum interrogates Jennifer and finds out that she was killed by a \\"boy she liked\\" and Jennifer starts screaming for Kimiya to stay away. While trying to figure out more information, Callum accidentally raises her from the dead and Alma becomes suspicious of him. Call runs back to the hospital to find out that Tamara has left. They head back to their rooms when Alex rushes through the gates and alerts them that Tamara was kidnapped by the spy, and Havoc ran off into the woods surrounding the Magisterium. After running with Alex for a while, Call asks Alex to take off his hoodie. Upon seeing two blue stripes up his sleeve, (which Call recognizes from a photograph of Constantine and Master Joseph) Call realizes that Alex is indeed the spy in the Magisterium, working for the Enemy of Death. Alex drags the pair to his hideout in the woods and extracts the Chaos from Aaron's body using the Alkahest, killing him in the process. After subduing Call and Tamara, Alex escapes with wounds inflicted by Havoc. The masters arrive, and in Call's desperation rant about how he didn't do it, he mentions that he is the Enemy of Death, and the Masters \\"clap him in chains\\" He is taken to the Panopticon, the prison, and as the book ends, Anastasia Tarquin is at Call's cell door, telling him she shall free him, and that he is her \\"son\\" as she was Constantine's mother.  The Silver Mask  The fourth book starts in The Panopticon, where Call stands in the last half of the year. Jasper is visiting him, but Tamara and Anastasia Tarquin help Call to go off The Prison at the same time. Master Joseph then forces Call to bring Aaron back from the dead, but he ends up being a skewed and different version of Aaron. Jasper and Tamara escape the clutches of Master Joseph and alert the Magisterium as to the whereabouts of Call. Preparing for war,  The Golden Tower  The fifth, and final book, Callum Hunt is triumphant and heartbroken and has just about had enough. He is ready to complete his training, but the evil Callum has faced has not given up just yet. Reception The first book in the series, The Iron Trial, was well received. Kirkus Reviews praised the setting and \\"refreshingly nuanced\\" characters, and a Publishers Weekly starred review predicted that the \\"string of ominous revelations\\" would leave readers wanting more. Though Kirkus noted that the similarities to Harry Potter can be distracting, a reviewer at The Daily Telegraph wrote that the book \\"moves deftly into the gap\\" left by the JK Rowling series. In 2012, Constantin Film acquired the production rights. Black and Clare will adapt the script themselves, and serve as executive producers. Constantin is one of the production companies behind another adaptation of Clare's, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones as well as the production company for its TV adaptation Shadowhunters on Freeform.

The company's first show, A Thought About Raya, began as Bos and Thureen's senior thesis at Vassar College, where they met. Focusing on intensive research, the group has since added a variety of designers to its roster and has produced eight shows since its founding. History Hannah Bos of Evanston, Illinois, and Paul Thureen who was raised near East Grand Forks, Minnesota, met at Vassar College and first performed in a play together during their sophomore year. The pair dated during college and ended their relationship in what Bos described as a \\"terrible breakup\\". They studied abroad together (at the National Theater Institute and in Russia) and cowrote their senior thesis, a play called A Thought About Raya before graduating in 2000. The company's third member, Oliver Butler, \\"didn't go to Vassar, but [...] wish[ed] [he] did\\", according to Butler himself. While Butler, a University of Connecticut graduate, was involved at a battle of the bands at the college in 1998, he didn't meet Bos and Thureen until 2003 when he attended a reading of A Thought About Raya at the Drama Book Shop in New York City. He approached Bos and Thureen immediately after the presentation and declared that he wanted to work with them, an idea about which the pair was initially hesitant. During a two-month trial period, Butler challenged Bos and Thureen's established group dynamic by requiring them to articulate to him their ideas which the pair ultimately found to be useful to their process. The company proper came into being in 2004 and is based in Brooklyn, New York City. They have worked with designers such as set designer Laura Jellinek, costume designer Sydney Maresca, lighting designer Mike Riggs, and sound designers Ben Truppin-Brown and M.L. Dogg. Process and style The Debate Society is a devised theater company. Their name came as a product of their process which is research intensive; Bos described it as \\"a nerdy way of working\\". Bos, Butler, and Thureen begin the process of play-creation by fleshing out a world in which each story takes place. They then find some element of that world that excites them and attempt to theatricalize that element. Their theatermaking process includes acting exercises, listmaking, and intensive research. Experimental theater director John Collins described the aesthetic of the company's works as having \\"filmic ambition\\".

He presided over the Special Commission for Legislative Studies and served on a myriad of commissions, largely related to budgets and finance. He also presented initiatives supporting the legalization of marijuana. In 2014, he wrote a book, Progressive Perspectives: Ideas for a Progressive Fiscal Reform. On 21 February 2015, Llerenas resigned from the PRD, believing that a candidacy for federal deputy under the PRD banner would not be competitive and criticizing the party for not taking into account the political tenure or relationships of potential candidates. Instead, he ran as a candidate for Morena; the PRD promptly claimed that Llerenas was offering food vouchers for votes during a ban on electoral activities. Llerenas won the June 2015 election for the eighth district; much like in the LXI Legislature, he serves on mostly financial commissions, including Budget and Public Accounts, Committee for the Center for the Study of Public Finances, Economy, and Finances and Public Credit.

They were built by R A Lister and Company of Dursley, Gloucestershire, well known for their range of small stationary engines.  Description  Engine compartment of a Rail-Truck The Auto-Truck was one of several monowheel tractors to appear in the 1920s and '30s, with the availability of small, reliable petrol engines, as developed for motorcycles and the stationary engines for which Lister were already known. These were tricycle vehicles, with the single leading wheel used for both drive and steering. Their simple construction carried most of the mechanism on this wheel as a single unit, the chassis with the trailing wheels being little more than a trailer for balance. Simplicity was a key feature. The engines were single-cylinder and air-cooled. Ignition was by magneto, rather than requiring a battery and electrical system. One of these designs was produced in the 1920s by George Grist of the Auto Mower Co., Norton St Philip, Somerset. The engine was a JAP 600 cc four-stroke air-cooled sidevalve, a typical small engine of the time. The Auto Mower Co. were Lister agents and when Lister heard of this 'Auto-Truck' they bought one for use in their own factory. It was used to carry heavy engine castings from the foundry to the machine shop. Lister customers saw them and there was such interest in wanting to buy them that Lister negotiated with Auto Mower to build them under licence. Although Lister were already well known for their small petrol stationary engines, these were heavy cast-iron engines with water hopper cooling and unsuitable for vehicle use. Lister remained with the JAP engine for the Auto-Truck. The Auto-Truck was designed for use in factories or other places with smooth surfaces of concrete or tarmac. This allowed the use of small solid-tyred wheels with only simple suspension, making the vehicle simple, cheap and lightweight. They had little ability on soft surfaces though and could even topple over if driven carelessly across slopes. Their design was a compromise between the top-heavy nature of the tall engine grouping above its wheel and a well thought-out chassis for stability. The bearing between them was a large diameter ring roller bearing, mounted at the lowest part of the chassis. This gave rigidity and stability, even after long wear. A ring of rolled channel girder was attached to the engine group and rollers on the chassis carried the load upon this. On early Auto-Trucks this bearing is set very low, in line with the chassis members, and is covered by thin steel plates. The front panel of the engine cover is distinctive with large ventilation holes and a Lister signature cut through it. Strangely this panel is made of thick cast iron, providing substantial weight high on the engine and only adding to its top heaviness. To improve visibility of moving vehicles in noisy factories, this panel was often painted white, the rest of the vehicle being Lister's usual brunswick green. The driver was seated on a Brooks bicycle saddle, which in recognition of the lack of vehicle suspension, was carried on the end of a cantilevered bar that acted as a leaf spring. A wide handlebar on the engine group was used for steering. A squeeze bar the width of this handlebar engaged the clutch. Controls included a hand throttle, a gear lever with two forward and one reverse gears, and a large handbrake lever. The engine unit rotated freely for a full 360° rotation. When used in reverse, the Auto-Truck could either be driven from the saddle, looking backwards over the driver's shoulder; or they could dismount, swivel the engine unit around and control it as a pedestrian-controlled truck from behind. Under the engine cover were two equal diameter tanks, a fuel tank for petrol and a shorter oil tank. Engine and chain-drive lubrication used a total-loss oil system, controlled by a small pump and needle valve.  Variations  Later, 1964, diesel-engined Auto-Truck with long chassis and road wheels Variations of the basic Auto- Truck were soon produced. These included lifting platform bodies with a hydraulic pump and a long hand lever alongside the driver's saddle. They were used either for moving heavy loads around factories, to avoid lifting, or else as a pallet truck which could be moved under a wooden platform before lifting it off the floor to move it. Tipping hoppers were also made, although owing to the limitations of the small wheels, these were not intended for gardens or construction sites, as has often been claimed, but were mostly for collecting waste materials around factories. Another variation shortened the body and the truck was used for towing trailers. Road performance of the Auto-Truck was improved by fitting larger rear wheels with pneumatic tyres. Several tyre and suspension spring options remained in production throughout its history. An early development even offered the Auto-Truck as a lightweight tractor for use on roads, sold to local councils and the like for street cleaning. Many Auto- Trucks were registered for road use and carried a number plate, but none are known to have had lighting or other road equipment fitted.  Later vehicles  Many detail changes were made over the years, and a major change from JAP petrol engines to Lister's own diesel engines. The bearing ring was moved above the chassis members and no longer enclosed. This gave better access for greasing and adjusting the rollers. Late vehicles had diesel engines, the Lister single cylinder LD1 or twin cylinder LD2 engines of 3.5 or 7 bhp @ 1800 rpm. The LD engines were already shrouded around their flywheel, cooling fan and the cylinder head fins and so there was no longer any need for the distinctive Auto-Truck engine cover or front plate. These late machines also used leaf spring front suspension, where the bearing ring was supported on the engine group by a pair of leaf springs. This gave much better isolation between front wheel bumps and the chassis, but the high unsprung weight, a drawback for all monowheel tractors, meant that they were still not high speed or effective road vehicles. By the mid 1950s, all production was diesel engined. In 1965 the Hawker Siddeley Group bought Lister and in 1968 the electrical equipment company Crompton Parkinson too. Soon after this, Crompton produced a battery-powered electric version of the Auto-Truck. Different battery capacities, using 24V or 36V batteries of the same size cells, were offered according to the demands of the working day. In 1973 all Auto-Truck production was transferred to the Crompton works at Tredegar. The old Auto- Truck shop at Dursley became the apprentice training school. There appears to have been some overlap though, with chassis production continuing in Dursley until 1975 when production ceased. The design was sold to DP (David Proctor) Engineering of Aldridge, later becoming MWM Powertrucks and finally DPR Engineering at Cannock. Production finally ended completely in the 1990s.  Rail-Trucks  Amberly Chalk Pits museum From 1928, the Auto-Truck mechanism was also used to make a small narrow gauge locomotive or 'Rail-Truck'. Motor Rail had provided a large number of its robust and reliable \\"Simplex\\" locomotives for service in World War I and Lister were keen to gain a share of their post-war market. With suitable gearing, even a small engine could pull a usefully heavy load on rails, although with limited speed. The \\"Rail-Truck\\" locomotives that Lister produced were some of the lightest locomotives available and so were particularly suitable for use on poorly laid or temporary tracks. They were used for construction sites, waterworks, peat cutting, small quarries and clay or gravel pits. Several hundred had been built by 1940, an exceptionally large production run for British narrow gauge locomotives. The same engine and cover was used, with chain drives to the axles from a Lister-built gearbox with two speeds in each direction, for a top speed of 6 mph. The driver sat sideways on a fixed pressed-steel tractor seat, being able to face in either direction. Their controls were a screw handbrake on a prominent cast-iron pillar in front of them (moved rearwards on diesels), a long gear lever and a foot-operated clutch. The throttle was operated by a pedal using the driver's right foot. The original model 'R' Rail-Truck was fitted with the same 600 cc JAP engine of 4–6 bhp as the Auto-Truck. A later 'RT' model was fitted with a 980 cc v-twin engine of 9.8 bhp, later, 1, 2 & 3 cylinder Lister diesel 'LD series' engines were fitted from new without engine bonnets, and with the brakewheel moved to the driver's right hand side. In urban situations the locomotives could be stored under cover at night. In remote and nomadic locations, such as peat bogs, there was no shelter and so the locomotives were also available with a fitted roof. This was a simple wooden canopy on four poles at the corners, with canvas dodgers or side- screens that could be rolled up. This canopy also provided some weather protection for the driver. From 1928 up to 1956, around 350 Rail-Trucks were built. Production continued into the early 1970s, although Lister's records were later destroyed by the 1983 fire. The oldest known surviving Rail-Truck, No 873 of 1928, is preserved in a Dutch museum. Around 90 Rail-Trucks survive in total. = Typical dimensions = { class=wikitable - ! style=\\"text- align: left;\\"  Gauge  2 ft - ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\" Length  - ! style=\\"text-align: right;\\"  over frame  6 ft 6 in - ! style=\\"text-align: right;\\"  over buffers  7 ft 6 in - ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Width  3 ft 1 in - ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Height  3 ft 9 in - ! style=\\"text- align: left;\\"  Wheelbase  2 ft 6 in - ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Wheel diameter  12 in - ! style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Minimum curve radius  20 ft }  Preservation  A vast number of Lister engines have been preserved, including many Auto-Trucks.

Wise considers 17th-century Dutch still lifes to be the \\"early modern equivalent of rap music.\\" Wise's sculpture work also includes Quit Playing Games with my Nips, a sculpture of dice covered in pierced nipples made of latex, as well as Star of Larry David, a Star of David constructed from oil painted urethane casts of bacon. =Bread Bags= In 2013, Wise began a collection of sculptures featuring different kinds of bread adorned with designer labels modeled after various It bags. The sculptures were made out of urethane and oil paint and finished with a designer label or charm along with straps to make it look like a functional bag or purse. The collection began with a play on the Louis Vuitton \\"baguettes,\\" in which Wise created a bread mold of a baguette out of urethane and then painted it with oil paints to resemble a real loaf of bread. She then drilled into the sculpture to add straps and a Louis Vuitton charm. The collection also includes a Prada backpack made of a sculpted, braided challah loaf titled Ain't No Challah Back Girl, and another piece with a sculpted bagel with cream cheese completed with a Chanel chain and charm called Bagel No. 5. In an interview with Lucky Magazine, Wise stated that the idea for the collection stems from the notion that: \\"Bread is a symbol of status and wealth (think 'the breadwinner' or the use of the term 'dough') and these 'it' bags connoted status in the early 2000s...\\" Wise goes on to explain: \\"I wanted to show the parallels between the idolatry for luxury items in fashion with the equivalent importance of the commodity in the art world.\\" In October 2014, Wise lent Bagel No. 5 to actress India Menuez to wear to the Chanel No. 5 film launch event. The \\"bag\\" was believed to be a real Chanel purse by onlookers and various news outlets. Soon after, it was revealed that Wise had created the sculpture as part of her 2013 collection. During her interview with Lucky Magazine, Wise comments on the fashion industry's reaction to her sculpture: \\"Part of me dislikes it because I want to be clear that these are art objects and not fashion pieces, but on the other hand I think it's pretty funny that I was able to prank the fashion world and obtain that kind of viewership.\\" The sculpture was later sold as part of the art auction at the RxArt's 14th annual benefit party.

They were among the first examples of Chinese fiction and deal with the existence of the supernatural, rebirth and reincarnation, gods, ghosts, and spirits. Robert Ford Campany sees the genre loosely characterized in its early examples by relatively brief form, often only a list of narrations or description, written in non-rhyming classical prose with a \\"clear and primary\\" focus on things which are anomalous, with a Buddhist or Taoist moral. Campany, however, does not see the stories as \\"fiction,\\" since the literati authors believed that their accounts were factual. Lydia Sing-Chen Chiang suggests that one function of the stories in this genre was to provide a \\"context by which the unknown may be ascribed names and meanings and therefore become 'known,' controlled, and used.\\" History and examples The term zhiguai is an allusion to a passage in the inner chapters of the Zhuangzi. The early 4th century anthology Soushen Ji edited by Gan Bao is the most prominent early source, and contains the earliest versions of a number of Chinese folk legends. Many are of Indian origins and were used for spreading Buddhist concepts, such as reincarnation. Another of the richest early collections is Youming lu, edited by Liu Yiqing (, 403-444), who also compiled A New Account of the Tales of the World. In the Tang dynasty, distinction between the zhiguai and chuanqi (strange stories) became increasingly blurred, and there is disagreement over the boundary between the two. Many stories of both types were preserved in the 10th century anthology, Taiping guangji. By the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the collections of zhiguai and chuanqi materials had been widely reprinted and supplemented by contemporary works. Judith Zeitlin suggests that the accounts of the strange \\"inevitably began to lose their sense of novelty and to seem stereotype....\\" and such writers as Pu Songling therefore needed to renew the category of \\"strange.\\" His anomalous collection of short pieces, Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, left unfinished at his death in 1715, which amalgamated zhiguai features with other styles. In the 21st century zhiguai stories continue to appear in print and on screen.

History The church, initially dedicated to the Virgin of the Carmine, was built in 1319, as an annex to a Carmelite Order monastery. However, the church we see today was rebuilt in 1649–1658 under the designs of Cristoforo Malagola. When the nearby church of San Biagio, which was located at what is now the Palazzo Montecuccoli degli Erri, was demolished in 1768, the two parishes were united, and renamed San Biagio del or nel Carmine. This church is mainly known now as San Biagio. The choir and cupola of the church were decorated by the late Baroque master Mattia Preti with a fresco of God in Glory surrounded by the Saints. In the center ceiling of the sacristy are frescoes with Elias and the flaming chariot with quadratura by Agostino Mitelli and figures by Angelo Colonna. In the 14th-century cloister is a chapel with a fresco of Madonna and Child by Tommaso da Modena.Comune of Modena Tourism site. Interior To the right of the entrance is the funereal monument of Countess Anna Maria Seghizzi (died 1821), designed and sculpted by Giuseppe Pisani. On the first arch is painting by Luigi Manzini depicting Saints Lucia, Agatha, and Apollonia. In the third arch is a painting attributed to either Dosso Dossi or Giovanni Gherardo delle Catene, depicting St Albert fighting a female demon (1530). The pulpit and its marble reliefs were completed in the 14th and 15th-centuries. The fourth altar has 17th-century Crucifix by Gregorio Rossi. The fifth arch has a canvas by Paolo Beroaldi depicting the patron saints of Modena: St Geminiano in center, flanked by St Omobono and St Contardo. The organ located to the left of the altar was built by Antonio Colonna in 1625 and refurbished in 1772 by Antonio Traeri. In 1936, a modern organ was placed within the same frame. On the right tribune is a 16th-century painting attributed to Raffaele Rinaldi depicts Jesus and the Samaritan Woman. The frescoes in the choir depict an Angelic concert, painted by Mattia Preti. A canvas depicting The Trinity and Annunciation (1596) were painted by Giovanni Battista Codebò. The canvas on the arch near the confessional depicts St John of the Cross by Francesco Vellani. The second chapel is dedicated to the Madonna of the Carmine. The altarpiece is attributed by some to Preti, others claim it is from prior centuries. The third arch has a canvas depicting St Teresa genuflecting before St Joseph and Child Jesus, attributed to either Cignaroli or Cignani. The canvas was moved here from the suppressed church of Santa Teresa delle Carmelitane Scalze. The fifth arch has a painting by Beroaldi depicting Saints Michael and Anthony Abbot below God the Father.

This episode marked the return of the villainess Maleficent, as well as the introductions of Cruella de Vil and Ursula the Sea Witch. In this episode, Mr. Gold tries to kill Hook, but Belle stops him; Regina says goodbye to Robin Hood; and Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff go back to Arendelle. In the end, Mr. Gold talks Ursula into joining his cause. In flashbacks, Rumpelstiltskin saves Belle from Maleficent, Ursula, and Cruella De Vil. Plot =Opening Sequence= A magical door opens and starts sucking all the snow into the portal. =In The Characters' Past= In the Enchanted Forest, Belle opens up a cabinet when Rumplestiltskin surprises her, having returned early from Camelot. He claims to have been testing her to see what she would do with him gone. He then presents Belle with a glove that can detect the weakness in a person. He says for most people weakness is who they love and that will point him in the right direction, thus the use of the glove. Later on Belle is serving tea to Rumplestiltskin while explaining why he collects items, only to send Belle out to wash and dry his laundry. Belle then spots a dalmatian puppy and follows it, only to be kidnapped by a figure in a fur cloak. As Rumplestiltskin searches for Belle in the forest a raven drops a sand dollar from the sky, and it opens up a hologram of Belle, who she says he has to bring the gauntlet from Camelot to trade for her or else she will be killed. Rumplestiltskin, having seen the raven, is aware of who sent him the message. When he reaches the caverns by the ocean, Rumplestiltskin brings the gauntlet to the meeting point. Belle runs up to him but she's all tied up, and Maleficent appears, demanding the gauntlet. Rumplestiltskin uses his magic and chokes her, but she's brought along company: Ursula (who wraps her tentacles around Belle), and Cruella De Vil. Rumplestiltskin threatens them all and Cruella tells Ursula to crush Belle's heart. As Ursula tightens her tentacles, Rumplestiltskin throws the gauntlet to Cruella then lets Maleficent go. The women say they've lived too long in a world where the heroes always win and the gauntlet will change that. They leave Belle and disappear. When Belle asks why he did it, Rumplestilskin refuses to admit he cares about her but says he's the only one allowed to crush her heart. Later, Rumplestilskin takes back the gauntlet from the Queen of Darkness, saying it was a ransom not a deal. Cruella says it won't do him any good since villains will never get a happy ending and invites him to join the women, but Rumplestiltskin says he will win and will win alone. =In Storybrooke= With Ingrid now dead, Elsa brings down the ice barrier, but Emma Swan knows that the spell is still in effect as she touches the barrier that is along the town limits. Anna then tells Elsa that they really need to leave Storybrooke: she tells her sister that Arendelle was taken over by Hans and his 12 brothers, so they ask Emma to help find a portal. When Hook informs Gold of this, Gold (using Hook's heart to see how Hook feels by partially crushing it) tells Hook that he knows Anna will interfere because of what she did to him back in the Enchanted Forest, so he wants Hook to keep Anna from finding out. Gold then says that as soon as he and Belle leave for New York City, he will kill Hook when the evening comes. Gold then goes to the back of his shop (where Belle had been sleeping) to wake up Belle to tell her that he plans to surprise with a trip to New York City, which was followed by bringing Hook with him to the mansion, where he tells Hook that the place actually belonged to The Sorcerer. With help from the magic enchanting broom, they see the portal materialize. Moments later, Hook returns to tell Emma about the portal, but in actuality, Gold is using Hook's heart to feed the lines to Hook so he can make Emma believe his story, giving Emma suspicious vibes about Hook, even after seeing his hand shaking. Back at the shop, Belle is packing up for the trip when Henry arrives to help his grandmother. When Belle tells Henry to find another suitcase, he sees one and pulls it from the top of the cabinet and ends up dropping it. Among the items falling includes the gauntlet, which bring back memories for Belle. At the same time, Emma, Mary Margaret and David arrive to the mansion to make sure Anna, Elsa, and Kristoff make it back to Arendelle through the portal door. As they thank the three, especially Emma, Anna tells the three that she wanted to thank Hook and Gold, only to have David mentioned that Gold was once Rumplestiltskin, and Anna tells them that she knows of him from their past encounter; Emma discovers that Gold had been using everyone and he has not changed. As they race to the clock tower, Gold has Hook watch him put his plan into action by placing the hat into position and it is released. When Emma and Mary Margaret arrive to stop him, Gold freezes them and then attempts to crush Hook's heart, only to discover he can not crush it: Belle has the real dagger and the gauntlet glove. She uses the items to force Gold to give Hook's heart back to him and unfreeze Emma and Mary Margaret. Belle then orders Gold to send them to the town limits, where she demands Gold to explain his actions as to why he chose power over love, even if meant sacrificing one thing so they can be together. Gold tried to apologize, but Belle refuses to believe him and that he will never change, and uses the dagger to banish Gold from Storybrooke. As Gold is forced out of the town, his leg injury returns and he crumples to the ground, crying out for Belle, whom he can no longer see. Belle cries over what she did to him. In between the events, Regina and Robin were able to wake Marian up from her ice curse, and later on thanked Regina for saving her even though she was aware that Robin still has feelings for her and vice versa; Regina tells Marian that she wants Robin to be happy for Roland's sake. However, as Regina tells Robin that he needs to be with Marian, the spell quickly resurfaced to freeze her heart. Regina tells Robin that in order for Marian to live, she must cross the town line and enter our world (and along with it, will no longer be able to return to Storybrooke), meaning the spell would not be able to harm her, but at the same time she tells Robin that both him and Roland have to accompany her. A reluctant Robin eventually gives in. As he, along with Marian and Roland, leaves Storybrooke, Robin gives Regina a final kiss before he leaves with his family to start their new life and identities. Also watching this was Gold, who tells Regina about the fairy tale book and that he doesn't know who was the author, but wishes her the best in finding her happy ending. Later that evening, Emma places Hook's heart back in and they embrace and kiss, then she joins Regina for a drink at Granny's. Henry arrives to tells the two that he found a secret place in the Lakeside mansion. Henry pulls a wall sconces on a wall rotation and the wall opens to reveal a secret library that contains with full of blank potential storybooks, all with a cover similar to the fairytale books. With this revelation, Emma joins Henry and Regina in tracking down the author. =In Arendelle= Now that Elsa and Anna are back in Arendelle, Elsa, who has reclaimed the kingdom from Hans, is ready to help Anna prepare for her wedding to Kristoff. As Anna put on her gloves, she shows Elsa a painting of their mother and aunts that she found hidden away in the East Wing of the castle. Elsa walks Anna down the aisle, finally happy and together. =Outside Storybrooke= Six weeks later in New York City, Gold pays a visit to an aquarium, where he has a meeting with a fish feeder, who is revealed to be Ursula. He tells her that he wants to get his happy ending, but the \\"heroes\\" stand in his way. He then tells Ursula to get ready and plans to pick up two more individuals to plot their scheme. He tells her that he realized that the villains will always lose, and that the only way to win is to change the game. It also turns out that Gold has someone in mind to help change the outcome; when Ursula asks who this is, Gold tells her that he's known as \\"the Author\\". Reception Upon airing, the episode hit series low ratings, with 5.69 million American viewers watching and attaining an 18-49 rating/share of 1.7/5. The show placed fourth in its timeslot and sixth for the night. Including DVR viewership, the episode was watched by a total of 8.45 million viewers and attained an 18-49 rating of 2.9. The episode received positive reviews from critics, with most noting the finishing to the Frozen story, and the acting of the central characters. Hilary Busis of Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review: \\"As Homer Simpson once said: \\"Oh, I see! Then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package!\\" That's about where tonight's midseason finale—which may as well have been titled \\"Falling Action\\"—leaves us. \\"Heroes and Villains\\" isn't quite as definitively conclusive as last year's midseason finale—an hour that would have functioned perfectly well as a full series wrap-up—but it did have the whiff of a hand firmly closing a storybook called The One With the Frozen Tie-In. Which isn't to say that we'll never see the Arendelle gals again.\\"\\"Once Upon a Time recap: 'Heroes & Villains'\\" from Entertainment Weekly (December 14, 2014) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a great review: \\"Tonight's Once proved yet again that the show is at its strongest when it's propelled by its primary cast instead of the current 'theme.' Regina, Rumple, and Belle all had beautiful scenes that were well performed, and it was a nice twist to see Belle stand up for herself and go to the extreme of banishing Rumple. That alone makes for an interesting back half of the season; let's keep our fingers crossed and hope the Queens of Darkness don't screw things up.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode an 8.8 rating out of 10.

The house was begun in 1833 in the Greek Revival style, making it one of the oldest houses in Springfield. (The Elijah Iles House, also in Springfield, was built in 1832.) Additions in 1836 and 1843, and a major rebuild/expansion in 1857, created the Italianate house preserved today. The house's Italianate features include bracketed cornices and a cupola with a skylight. Lawyer Benjamin S. Edwards, son of Illinois governor Ninian Edwards, owned the house. While he lived there, the house became an important political center for Springfield, as Edwards hosted rallies and gatherings for Illinois politicians. Abraham Lincoln gave a speech from one of the house's second- story windows, and Stephen A. Douglas hosted a rally on the property. The house also hosted guests who came to Springfield for Lincoln's funeral. Several of the Lincoln family's possessions are now held in the Edwards house. Edwards' daughter donated the house to the Springfield Art Association in 1913; it has since served the association as a museum, school, and meeting house. It also features the association's M. G. Nelson Family Gallery that hosts about 12 exhibitions per year, an art library and an art studio for classes. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1969.

Fingers shows and sells the work primarily of New Zealand jewellers, but also of international jewellers, mostly from Australia and Europe. Established in 1974, Fingers is the longest running institution of its type in New Zealand, and one of the longest running contemporary jewellery spaces in the world. It began when jeweller Alan Preston, after a stint as a Guest Artist at Brown's Mill Market, New Zealand’s first craft co-operative, approached jewellers Ruth Baird, Roy Mason, Margaret Philips and Michael Ayling to open a jewellery shop on Auckland's Lorne Street. The name 'Fingers' was chosen because all the jewellers were at the time making rings. The aim of the cooperative in setting Fingers up was to 'sell directly to the public, to exchange techniques and ideas, and to provide a focal point for creative jewellery in New Zealand.' Each member of the cooperative spent one day of the week minding the shop, and the rest working independently on their jewellery. In its early years Fingers had a strong focus on silversmithing and the group also set up a silversmithing school called Lapis Lazuli. Important early exhibitions included 'Guaranteed Trash' (1978), which responded to the punk aesthetic, the Bone show (1981), where 24 jewellers contributed pieces made from bone, and 'Paua Dreams' (1981) featuring the six Fingers members and eight invited jewellers, with the aim of elevating paua shell back up from its use in mass- produced souvenirs for the tourist trade. Much of the work in the Bone exhibition was lost in a robbery on 29 April 1981. By the mid 1980s New Zealand galleries and museums were starting to buy pieces of jewellery from Fingers. A 1984 article in the New Zealand Listener Jacqueline Amoamo notes > \\"In a review of 'Paua Dreams' I suggested it was time that museums and art > galleries started collections of New Zealand craft jewellery. Someone at the > Auckland Museum must have taken the hint because within a few minutes of the > opening of the latest Fingers exhibition 'Souvenirs' a representative had > bought a delicate paua necklace-and-earrings set by Ruth Baird and a > spectacular silver pendant inlaid with paua and enamel by guest exhibitor > Elena Gee - at $600 the most expensive piece on show. The Dowse Art Museum > in Lower Hutt is one public gallery that does have a permanent collection of > jewellery, including work by Fingers people and Auckland stone carver John > Edgar.\\" Fingers moved to its current premises on Kitchener Street in 1987, opposite the Auckland Art Gallery. New freestanding glass-sided cabinets and a counter designed by Humphrey Ikin suggested ‘an expanded ambition as a gallery rather than a shop‘. In a move to reassure jewellers and customers that it remained committed to accessibly-priced jewellery, Fingers staged the group exhibition '$100 Under' in 1988. In 1991 craft commentator Helen Schamroth wrote \\"If there is one underlying common philosophy of the work at Fingers it is an original, innovative approach to design solutions, a contemporary response to customer interests, and meeting their aesthetic and emotional needs.\\" Fingers celebrated its 40th anniversary in November 2014 with an exhibition at Objectspace gallery in Auckland and a book by Damian Skinner and Finn McCahon- Jones. Three of the original five founders - Alan Preston, Ruth Baird and Roy Mason - are still members.

The strike was led by members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or the \\"Wobblies\\") which bottled up shipping in the harbor. One of the largest staged protests during the strike was led by author Upton Sinclair on a small plot of land called Liberty Hill where he was arrested for reciting the First Amendment. It was eventually crushed by a combination of injunctions, mass arrests and vigilantism by both the police force and the Ku Klux Klan. There would not be another waterfront strike of this magnitude until the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike.  Background  Labor relations in the Pacific coast maritime industry had been in almost constant turmoil since the turn of the century. The traditional craft unions of seaman and longshoremen, plagued by bureaucratic squabbles, the hostility of the Los Angeles Times, powerful employers’ groups such as the Merchants’ and Manufacturers Association were not able to change the culture of open shops in Los Angeles.Zanger, Martin. “Politics of Confrontation: Upton Sinclair and the Launching of the ACLU in Southern California.” Pacific Historical Review 38, no. 4 (November 1969): 383–406. One of the most effective weapons used by open shops to combat radical forces was “decausualization,” which relied heavily on the use of company-controlled hiring halls to weed out as many union sympathizers as possible from working in the docks. Even with all the preventative measures put in place, members of the IWW were able to still infiltrate a vast amount of the docks on the West Coast under the guise of other organizations used as a front.Perry, Louis B., and Richard S. Perry. A History of the Los Angeles Labor Movement, 1911-1941. University of California Press, 1963. Pg. 159 Although the IWW was able to gain access to the docks, they were not having too much success on the waterfronts of California until the start of World War I. The build-up leading to American involvement meant higher than normal output in all the ports, and a shortage of labor. In May 1916, the International Longshoremen’s Association began a dockworker’s strike for an increase in wages in Seattle, Washington. The dockworkers in San Pedro, totally about 1,600, came out on strike at the same time.Laslett, John H. M. Sunshine Was Never Enough: Los Angeles Workers, 1880–2010. University of California Press, 2012 The strike was quickly put down when the shop owners hired a special Los Angeles Police Department unit to work in the protections of strikebreakers to maintain an opened shop. In October 1919, the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce let it known of their intention to fully restore completely open shop conditions through the entire harbor, a decision that was supported by all the shops and companies in the area, sparking yet another small strike that was broken up quickly. The local unions were not strong enough to resist San Pedro in becoming a complete open shop city and most of the local union leaders gave up the fight, but the IWW members who were there in town did not.Stimson, Grace Heilman. Rise of the Labor Movement in Los Angeles. 1st edition. University of California, 1955. Pg. 181 Concerned with dwindling numbers in California the IWW’s general executive board in Chicago requested all remaining Wobblies on the West Coast to head down to San Pedro to help contest the open shop on the docks and the constitutional limits of California’s criminal syndicalism law.Perry, Louis B., and Richard S. Perry. A History of the Los Angeles Labor Movement, 1911-1941. University of California Press, 1963. Pg. 163 The Industrial Workers of the World quickly sprung into action, and disrupted the Local No. 31-18.Stimson, Grace Heilman. Rise of the Labor Movement in Los Angeles. 1st edition. University of California, 1955. Pg. 183 The actions did not do much in the attempt to displease the employers, but once the American Federation of Labor (AFL) was eliminated, the left-wingers became persona non grata. Efforts to keep Wobblies from dock employment were not successful. Although there were large amounts of IWW members under the new California criminal syndicalism law, there was still high levels of unrest on the San Pedro docks. There was a series of mini strikes in the early months of 1923 that kept several ships from sailing on time.Stimson, Grace Heilman. Rise of the Labor Movement in Los Angeles. 1st edition. University of California, 1955. Pg. 181  The Strike  Liberty Hill, circa April or May 1923. Right background shows Terminal Island and then Southwestern Shipyard (forerunner to Bethlehem). The speaker on platform at left has been identified by Bob Bigelow as fellow worker F.W.Yelovich. The strike began on April 25, 1923, shortly after the Los Angeles County Grand Jury held hearings on violations of the criminal syndicalism act.Stimson, Grace Heilman. Rise of the Labor Movement in Los Angeles. 1st edition. University of California, 1955. Pg. 183 The San Pedro Local No. 510 called a strike and effectively tied up the port for several days. The walkout was national in scope, with its pivotal points in New York and Los Angeles; it brought out 5,000 men on the east coast and probably 1,500 locally, with estimates at San Pedro ranging as high as 3,000. It had little effect at other Western ports, however, though a number of Pacific Coast lumberjacks and oil workers participated and the independent Federation of Marine Transport Workers joined with the Wobblies. Members of the Sailors Union of the Pacific refused to support the strike, not only because it was IWW-inspired, but also because they were already \\"working the oracle\\" or, in other words, conducting a slowdown with some success. The strike itself was a peculiar combination of an ordinary economic walkout and a political maneuver. In its nationwide aspects, it sought to secure the release of political prisoners, particularly those accused of sedition against the federal government or held under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act.Stimson, Grace Heilman. Rise of the Labor Movement in Los Angeles. 1st edition. University of California, 1955. Pg. 184 The walkout tied up about ninety ships in the Port of Los Angeles. Police quickly started to round up known IWW agitators, thus depleting the ranks of strike leaders and permitting some ships to get under way. Twelve vessels in the offshore trade, manned by seamen sympathetic to the IWW, suffered the longest delays. The thirty-seven lumber schooners in port were largely manned by non-unionists or members of the Sailors Union. Nevertheless, the cargoes of a number of them had to be discharged in rotation at the piers by the ships' officers because of the shortage of dockhands.Perry, Louis B., and Richard S. Perry. A History of the Los Angeles Labor Movement, 1911-1941. University of California Press, 1963. Pg. 167 Then the Wobblies through their newspaper the Industrial Worker made the call for a citywide strike on May 1, 1923 (the historic May Day of international socialism). They called the announcement to “free the class prisoners”Laslett, John H. M. Sunshine Was Never Enough: Los Angeles Workers, 1880–2010. University of California Press, 2012. Pg. 80 which is the IWW term for those who had been convicted and jailed under the criminal syndicalism act. On the same day, IWW leaders persuaded approximately 450 of 2,200 men to strike at refinery construction jobs two miles north of the harbor, and it seemed likely that the dispute would spread beyond the water front. Employers therefore decided to take immediate action both to prevent this and to move ships more rapidly. Negotiations with the longshoremen, however, foundered on their demand for their own hiring hall and the abandonment of the Sea Service Bureau, or \\"Fink Hall,\\" controlled by the stevedoring and shipping firms. Some 1,200 longshoremen voted to remain out until the employers met this basic request.Perry, Louis B., and Richard S. Perry. A History of the Los Angeles Labor Movement, 1911-1941. University of California Press, 1963. Pg. 169 About 140 extra patrolmen and 20 detectives were dispatched to the docks by the Los Angeles Police Department to maintain order in the event of a showdown.Perry, Louis B., and Richard S. Perry. A History of the Los Angeles Labor Movement, 1911-1941. University of California Press, 1963. Pg. 167 On May 5 more than 100 strikebreakers arrived and were immediately put to work. Two hundred more were scheduled to begin employment on May 8 and an additional 750 were due a few days later. By May 10, 1,500 longshoremen were at work, of whom 350 were imported strikebreakers. The extra police force was increased to 250, largely because of a fire on May 5 which had obviously been the work of an arsonist. As the strike entered its fourth week, the police cracked down even harder on the Wobblies. The Los Angeles headquarters of the KKK handed out a pamphlet to local citizens to get more supports and help the police force break up the strike. Members of the Ku Klux Klan, with or without their hoods regularly came to the San Pedro docks to be a force of intimidation. The latter began to look on the dispute as a free-speech fight and continued to hold meetings near the water front at a point known as Liberty Hill, a privately owned parcel of land used with the permission of the owner. Local sympathizers and members of the American Civil Liberties Union joined the IWW leaders in seeking to maintain rights of free speech. They included such prominent Los Angeles and Pasadena figures as Upton Sinclair.Stimson, Grace Heilman. Rise of the Labor Movement in Los Angeles. 1st edition. University of California, 1955. Pg. 184 San Pedro Court House where IWW strikers were jailed during the 1923 maritime strike. Jailings inspired Upton Sinclair to write his play, \\"The Singing Jailbirds.\\" The building was demolished in the late 1920s. In the early evening of May 15, 1923, Upton Sinclair stood before a crowd on Liberty Hill in San Pedro. He chose to honor the hill’s namesake by using words to test the boundary between liberty and sedition. He spoke, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech . . .” Before Sinclair could finish reciting the First Amendment, he and three others were arrested. The arresting officer was recorded to have said, “We’ll have none of that Constitution stuff.”UFCW324. “Uppity Sinclair and the Battle of Liberty Hill.” United Food and Commercial Workers. https://ufcw324.org/uppity-sinclair-and- the-battle-of-liberty-hill/. Three days later, seventy-one alleged IWW members were arrested and jailed. So effective was police action against strike leaders that the Shipowners' Association declared the walkout over on May 18, when eighty-five vessels were loaded or unloaded by 2,800 longshoremen for the busiest day in port history. Fifty policemen were immediately returned to Los Angeles for regular duty, and 500 strikebreakers were given permanent employment. Although the strike was losing ground, IWW leaders did not give up. Many of their members were in jail and others had left town to look for jobs elsewhere. The efficiency of longshore operations was improving each day. Strikers who were not proven Wobblies were returning to work through the open- shop Sea Service Bureau. But still the walkout continued. On May 21, 3,000 posters announcing a meeting at Liberty Hall in San Pedro on the evening of May 23 were distributed in the harbor area. The meeting was to be addressed by Upton Sinclair and a number of other speakers under the auspices of the American Civil Liberties Union. The meeting drew 5,000 people, but there were no fireworks, as police were present to ensure that it was peaceful. The next day a general meeting of 600 longshoremen, most of whom were not Wobblies, voted to \\"transfer\\" the dispute back to the job, and the walkout was officially ended.Stimson, Grace Heilman. Rise of the Labor Movement in Los Angeles. 1st edition. University of California, 1955. Pg. 187  Aftermath  The 1923 San Pedro Maritime strike was the biggest challenge to the dominance of the open shop philosophy that controlled Los Angeles until the 1930s. It was defeated without too much of a struggle because of the strength the shop owners, use of the Los Angeles Police Department, KKK, and others as enforcers to try and break the strike. Another factor which helped defeat the strike was the high amount of strikebreakers who were brought into the city from all other parts of the state, which helped keep the docks open enough to allow commercial business to take place. The open shop would remain the ideology that ran Los Angeles for another 15 years. *The Liberty Hill site was designated a California Historic Landmark (No. 1021) on March 3, 1997. californiahistoricallandmarks.com, 1021, Liberty Hill site References  External links  * http://www.iww.org/history/campaigns/sanpedro/images * https://web.archive.org/web/20121105120759/http://www.laokay.com/The-Politics- of-San-Pedro-in-Los-Angeles-California.htm * http://www.randomlengthsnews.com/bucket-of-blood/ * http://www.iww.org/history/campaigns/sanpedro * https://ufcw324.org/uppity- sinclair-and-the-battle-of-liberty-hill/ Images courtesy of California Historian, a publication of the Conference of California Historical Societies, Vol. 44, #3, Spring 1998, University of Pacific, Stockton, California, and under direct consent of the Industrial Worker's of the World.

From left: Ned Locke, Bob Trendler, Bob Bell, Ray Rayner and Don Sandburg Robert Trendler (May 11, 1912 – July 18, 2011) was an American bandleader, songwriter, and musical director of the WGN Orchestra from 1956 till 1975. Trendler was known in Chicago as Mr. Bob the bandleader of Bozo's Big Top Band, on Bozo's Circus, a television program for children home from school for lunch. Robert Trendler Sr. was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on May 11, 1912, the only child of John & Kathryn Trendler, both European immigrants. Trendler's early life was centered on music and broadcasting. He began playing the piano at age 6, and spent many childhood hours in radio stations, as his mother was the music director of Cincinnati's WLW.. When his mother, an opera soprano, toured Europe, the young boy was accomplished enough to accompany her on the piano. At age 21, Trendler went to work for the station as an accompanist and music arranger. Trendler's music arranging took him to New York City, where he worked with George Gershwin, Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington. Working with people like Eddie Duchin taught him about jazz. A job playing the piano at the Century of Progress exposition brought him to Chicago; a short time after arriving in the city, Trendler went to work for WGN Radio. By 1941, Trendler had become the director of the WGN Dance Band and was also the WGN Choral Director. Trendler also did occasional work with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; he was named director of the WGN Orchestra in 1956. While Trendler worked on seven WGN radio programs at one time, he became well-known to many in the Chicago area when, as \\"Mr. Bob\\", he led a 13 piece band on the weekday Bozo's Circus children's television program at WGN-TV. He was remembered as a willing participant in the show's jokes and clowning skits; Trendler never minded a pie in the face any more than those doing the clowning. He met his wife, Annette, at Chicago's La Salle Hotel; she was a member of a vocal trio, The Three Graces. The group was performing with Rudy Vallée at the time. Trendler and his wife raised their two sons in Lake Forest, Illinois in a home surrounded by flowers and Trendler's 1.5 acre vegetable garden. His interests away from the job included photography, a large model railroad outfit and cycling. He gave up his speedboat racing hobby after his sons were born. Trendler retired from WGN in 1975; upon Trendler's retirement, the 13 piece band he had led was reduced to a band with only three members. He and his wife Annette retired to Florida. Upon relocating to Florida, Trendler was an active member of the Sarasota Broadcasting Club. In 2010, Trendler had a perfect attendance record for the club's meetings. Robert Trendler died of natural causes on July 18, 2011 in Ellenton, Florida at the age of 99. His wife Annette died in 2002.

It was founded in 2014 by a group of conservative political operatives. The site's stated goal is to \\"cut through the talking points and the smoke and mirrors ...

After starting his show Life, Liberty & Levin on Fox News Channel, Levin stepped away from his editor-in-chief position at Conservative Review. In October 2016, Conservative Review announced the launch of CRTV, an online television network, with shows by Mark Levin, Michelle Malkin, Steven Crowder, Mark Steyn, Gavin McInnes, Steve Deace, and Matt Kibbe.

Score and profiles Conservative Review assigns each federal officeholder a grade based on their \\"Liberty Score\\", which is a grade based on the top 50 votes that that officeholder has taken in the duration of a rolling 6-year window, rather than just the last election-cycle. According to Conservative Review, the rolling six-year window is \\"a more accurate picture of a lawmaker’s performance than traditional one- or two-year scoring methods. Scores are determined by points earned divided by potential points. Voting with the conservative position earns one point; voting against the conservative position earns nothing. Missed votes are not included in a member’s score.\\" Targeting of foreign policy officials After Donald Trump took office, the Conservative Review was one of a number of conservative media outlets that engaged in a campaign to single out career government employees that they saw as being a part of a \\"deep state\\", or \\"so-called Obama holdovers\\". The Conservative Review accused Anne Patterson, former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, of having \\"fully embraced the policies of President Obama that aligned with radical Islamic actors and alienated Israel.\\" It said that one State Department official was \\"leftist\\", citing as evidence retweets by the official of articles critical of Trump, but ignoring retweeted articles friendly to Trump. Many of the articles targeting foreign policy officials were written by Jordan Schachtel, who had previously written for the far-right website Breitbart News. In March 2017, the Conservative Review targeted an Iran expert at the State Department named Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, who was involved in crafting the Iran nuclear agreement. One article of this agreement, which had suggested that she was a traitorous stooge surreptitiously working on behalf of the Iranian regime, was then forwarded by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to an aide of then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, with Gingrich writing, \\"I thought you should be aware of this.\\" Internal emails show that White House staff then proceeded to look into how to fire Nowrouzzadeh, who was hired by the George W. Bush administration, worked nearly a decade in national security, and won awards from the Departments of Defense and State, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the F.B.I, emailed her supervisor where she explained that the article was \\"filled with misinformation\\". Nowrouzzadeh noted that she was hired by the Bush administration and that \\"I’ve adapted my work to the policy priorities of every administration I have worked for.\\" While serving under Secretary of State John Kerry, she often advocated a harsher position vis-a-vis Iran than he did. A Trump administration deputy, Edward Lacey, dismissed her email, saying she was among \\"Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump’s foreign policy agenda.\\" Following the publication of the Conservative Review article, Nowrouzzadeh received death threats. Nowrouzzadeh asked the State Department to publish a rebuttal to the article, but her request was rejected. In April 2017, the State Department reassigned her to the \\"bureaucratic equivalent of Siberia\\". Nowrouzzadeh alleged unlawful discrimination, and the State Department later settled with her.

It was built from 1904 to 1974. It is also known as East Brisbane War Memorial and Riversdale. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  In 1903–04, the South Brisbane City Council acquired the riverfront property known as Mowbray's Paddock, alienated by Rev. Thomas Mowbray in the 1850s, for public park purposes. The new reserve was named officially as Mowbray Park in September 1904. Rev. Thomas Mowbray had arrived in Moreton Bay in 1847, and although he was never inducted into a charge during his twenty years at Moreton Bay, he was instrumental in establishing the Presbyterian Church in Brisbane in the 1850s. In December 1850, he purchased approximately of land along the southern bank of the Brisbane River at what was then referred to as Kangaroo Point, downstream from Rev. Robert Creyke's purchase, Ravenscott (later Shafston House), overlooking New Farm. Title was transferred to him in November 1851. In the 1850s, Mowbray built his family home, Riversdale, on this site. Thomas Mowbray died in 1867, but the family retained the property until its sale to the South Brisbane City Council in 1904. In a report presented to the full Council on 14 December 1903, the advantages of the site for a public park were enumerated: \\"Mowbray's property is in every way suitable for a public Park or garden having suitable soil, and undulating land reaching to the water's edge, and in addition it will also provide the necessary accommodation for bowling greens, Tennis Courts, and Croquet lawns. The property has a North Easterly aspect, and has an extended view of two reaches of the river, is above flood level, and is situated on the East Brisbane Tramway route. There is no public park or reserve in this locality, and no other piece of land in the neighbourhood so suitable for this purpose.\\" Lengthy negotiations between the Council and James Anderson Mowbray, Thomas's son, were undertaken in 1903, with the result that Mowbray offered portions 48–50, parish of South Brisbane, to the Council for , and assisted in its purchase with a mortgage. The property, which consisted of the present park as well as the adjacent lands between the park and what is now Park Avenue (this included the present bowling club, croquet club, former scout lease and former tennis courts site), was transferred to the South Brisbane City Council in January 1905. The land was acquired by the City Council at the same time as a site at Highgate Hill, and the initiative for these purchases has been attributed to the Mayor of South Brisbane in 1903, Alderman George Blocksidge, who promoted the expansion of public gardens and parks in the rapidly developing municipality. In 1904, entrance gates to Mowbray's Paddock were erected, and the old house on the site (Riversdale) was sold for removal for . In the same year, the East Brisbane Bowling Club was formed, and the South Brisbane City Council agreed to lease to the club the southwest corner of the reserve, fronting Lytton Road. In 1906, the Council agreed to lease parts of the western end of Mowbray Park to the East Brisbane Croquet Club and to the East Brisbane Tennis Club. Constant erosion along the riverbank at Mowbray Park prompted the Council to consider construction of a stone retaining wall. At the Council's request, the Engineer for Harbours and Rivers prepared a plan for a random stone wall early in 1904, but this was not implemented immediately. In 1906, the Council proposed that a swimming bath should be included in the construction, and in 1907 a landing stage as well. The Queensland Government agreed to assist in the financing, but construction was delayed while the Council enquired as to the most favourable terms under which this work could be carried out. Finally in August 1907, the Council instructed the Queensland Government to proceed with the retaining wall (not including baths or jetty), and construction had commenced by mid-February 1908. Late in 1909, the South Brisbane City Council called tenders for the construction of a kiosk and attached cottage in Mowbray Park. On 31 January 1910, the Council accepted the tender of contractor J Finn, with a price of , and the kiosk was ready for occupation by 10 May 1910. In August 1910, a public meeting was held at Woolloongabba to urge the construction of a bandstand in Mowbray Park, and a guarantee of toward cost of construction was promised by those who attended. The South Brisbane City Council agreed to subsidise a bandstand to cost approximately , provided the Citizens Committee prepared plans and estimates. These were submitted in September 1910, and the Council called tenders in October. The contract was let to W Reed, with a price of , and the new bandstand was opened officially on 8 February 1911. The need for a landing stage or jetty at Mowbray park was reconsidered in late 1910, and expressions of interest were called from ferry/tug boat companies. The jetty appears to have been constructed by the Council early in 1911. In the second half of 1914, the South Brisbane City Council set aside part of Mowbray Park as a children's playground, but whether this facility was ever developed is not clear from Council records. The playground is not indicated on the 1922 South Brisbane City Council Sewerage Detail Plan of the area, nor on a 1949 contour survey of the park. In 1916–17, the earliest First World War Memorial in Brisbane, an honour roll and statue honouring all soldiers, sailors and nurses who had enlisted for active service from the 8C (East Brisbane and Kangaroo Point) Training Area, was erected at Mowbray Park by local residents. A public subscription was raised by the East Brisbane Cadet Committee, and the tender of from W Batstone & Sons, monumental masons of Annerley Road, was accepted in March 1916. The \\"digger\\" statue, a rare Queensland representation of an Australian Light Horseman, was carved by Alfred Batstone. The foundation stone was laid on 4 November 1916, on the brow of the hill near Lytton Road, with views of both the Shafston and Humbug reaches of the Brisbane River, and the memorial was unveiled by Lady Goold- Adams, wife of Queensland Governor Hamilton Goold-Adams, on 11 August 1917. It was flanked by two cannons, reputedly part of Thursday Island's 19th century defences, and was surrounded by a garden in the shape of a cross. Additional honour rolls were added during and after the war. A metal railing fence around the memorial had been constructed by 1925, but this was replaced with stone kerbing in 1929, with stone recycled from the old Normal School in Adelaide Street, which was being demolished to make way for Brisbane's Anzac Square. The question of providing swimming baths at Mowbray Park was raised with the South Brisbane City Council several times during the 1910s, both by public committees and individual aldermen, but little was achieved until the end of the decade. Throughout 1918, Alderman RE Burton agitated for the establishment of a bathing enclosure at Mowbray Park; the matter was referred to the Council's finance committee, and the motion to erect a swimming enclosure on the Brisbane River at Mowbray Park was finally adopted on 20 January 1919. Plans were prepared by the City Engineer by March, and the enclosure was completed in late 1919/early 1920. A Mowbray Park Swimming Club was established even before the baths were opened, and the baths proved popular for summer carnivals and general recreation. When the kiosk lease came up for renewal in 1920, the Council decided to seek a married couple as lessees, with the wife to take the lease of the refreshment kiosk and residence, and the husband to be appointed as caretaker to the swimming baths and park. The first lease under this arrangement was taken up in October 1920. Once the caretaker was appointed, the Council arranged for the proper management of the baths: separate bathing hours for males and females were prescribed, the land side of the baths was enclosed with wire fencing, and admission prices were established. Changing rooms had been constructed by mid-1922. With the establishment of Greater Brisbane in August 1925, control and ownership of Mowbray Park was transferred to the new Greater Brisbane City Council. The park was a popular venue for sailing regattas in the 1920s and 1930s. In April 1936 the Church of England Grammar School applied to the Brisbane City Council for permission to erect a boat house on the river bank at Mowbray Park, near Laidlaw Parade, for use by the school's rowing club. With the application was submitted a plan for a hardwood structure with tiled roof, in dimension long by wide and high. The application was approved, and the school was granted a lease over the boat house site. The building, which is still owned by the school, was extended at a later date, and is now known as the Elder Hunter Boat House. It remains one of the oldest surviving rowing boat houses along the Brisbane River. Mowbray Park is understood to have been the site of a \\"tent city\\" for homeless families in the early 1930s, during the Great Depression. In mid-1945, the Brisbane City Council was preparing a final design and layout for Mowbray Park. A 1949 contour plan of the park indicates that much of its mid-20th century layout has been retained. In 1974 the First World War Memorial was moved to its present position to allow for extensions to the East Brisbane Bowling Club. About 1976, the 1910 kiosk/caretaker's cottage was demolished. The bandstand may have been demolished at this time also. The swimming enclosure was removed at an earlier period, but the stone retaining walls and steps associated with the baths remain, and have been included in this entry in the Heritage Register. The section of Mowbray Park formerly occupied by the tennis courts and scouts' den, (which have been removed), together with the bowls club and croquet club leases, has not been included in the entry in the Heritage Register. In 1996, Brisbane City Council introduced the CityCat catamaran ferries that operated along the Brisbane River. One of the ferry wharves was established beside Mowbray Park and is known as the Mowbray Park ferry wharf. During Stage 1 (2018-2020) of the Wynnum Road corridor upgradehttps://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and- transport/roads-infrastructure-and-bikeways/road-and-intersection- projects/east-brisbane-wynnum-road-corridor-upgrade-stage-1, 11 trees along Lytton Rd were relocated, a further 10 removed and several palm and fig trees were relocated within the Park or to other parkshttps://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/southeast/road-works-move-in-to- heritage-listed-mowbray-park/news-story/357edcd72c473255c27bb06a4cc89684 to make way for the widened road. Up-lighting was installed under feature trees and the war memorial and free Wi-Fi provided.  Description  Mowbray Park comprises of treed paths and lawns on a site which slopes gently down to the edge of the Brisbane River from Lytton Road. Remains of former swimming baths are situated in the north-western corner of the park, and a boat house is located in the north-eastern corner. The park also contains a finely crafted First World War Memorial. The site contains a range of mature plantings and is traversed by a number of paths which meet in the centre of the park. These include: a central Palm-lined path which leads from Lytton Rd to the river; another Palm-lined path which crosses the south-eastern sector of the park; a diagonal path across the north-west sector which passes a remnant stand of eucalypts including Moreton Bay Ash, Grey Iron Bark and Forest Red Gum; a riverside path lined with a range of ornamental trees including Bauhinias and Jacarandas and a row of Palms; and a higher, parallel path which is lined with Fig trees. In addition the park contains other clusters of mature trees, some of which appear to have lined paths which no longer exist. These include: clusters of large Figs in the south-east and south western corners of the park; a grove of Eucalypts and Pines in the south-eastern sector, and a grove of large Fig trees in the north-eastern sector. The former swimming baths comprise two porphyry retaining walls which are cut into the river's edge and form a shallow C shape. The lower retaining wall along the water's edge is approximately long, and has two sets of porphyry steps which lead directly into the water. The upper wall retains the escarpment, and is approximately long. Timber pylons where boats are now moored define the boundary of the baths. The boat house is a large, modestly detailed, single-storeyed timber shed with a gabled terracotta tiled roof and a skillion to the rear. It is clad with chamferboard and vertically-jointed timber, and has exposed framing internally. The roof is supported on a chiaroscuro of timber rafters with names and dates painted on them. A timber boat ramp is associated with the shed. The War Memorial is located to the east on the central path at the Lytton Rd end of the park. It comprises a statue on a tall pedestal flanked by two cannons. The statue is a life-size Helidon sandstone rendition of an Australian Light Horseman, with a rifle pointing upwards. The pedestal is painted sandstone, and has four large marble plaques attached with five hundred and twenty names inscribed in lead. The Melbourne granite base has four steps, and has four scroll-shaped marble plaques inscribed with an additional one hundred and ninety-six names, and three smaller plaques which commemorate the laying of the foundation stone and the unveiling. The pedestal is set centrally in a concrete base and kerbing. The cannons are also set into the base; they comprise rifled muzzle loader steel cannons, which bear the Royal monogram of Queen Victoria. Both cannons have inscribed marble plaques. A tall flagpole is located immediately to the south-east of the memorial.  Heritage listing  Mowbray Park and East Brisbane War Memorial were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Mowbray Park is significant for its close association with the development of East Brisbane, both in its early connection with the Mowbray family and their substantial land holdings in the suburb, and as an initiative of the former South Brisbane City Council in preserving urban public open space during a population and housing boom. In a broader context, the stone retaining wall and steps are an important illustration of the evolution of recreational activity along the Brisbane River. Mowbray Park, like Newstead Park, survives as important evidence of the riverine estates which lined much of the Brisbane River in the mid-19th century. The memorial has cultural heritage significance as evidence of a widespread social movement expressing Australian patriotism and nationalism of the period, and belongs to a class of commemorative structures erected as a record of the local impact of a major historical event and intended to endure. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Mowbray Park, like Newstead Park, survives as important evidence of the riverine estates which lined much of the Brisbane River in the mid-19th century. Adjacent properties such as Shafston and Eskgrove, and Bulimba further downstream, did not survive the 19th century. Mowbray Park is one of comparatively few inner Brisbane parks which provides substantial open space with river views. The East Brisbane War Memorial in Mowbray Park is significant for its aesthetic quality and craftsmanship, the rarity of the Australian Light Horseman statue in a Queensland war memorial, and as evidence of the work of established monumental masons W Batstone & Sons.

Side effects of trengestone include headache, fatigue, and breast tenderness among others. Trengestone is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It is not androgenic or estrogenic. Trengestone was introduced for medical use in 1974. It is no longer available. Medical uses Trengestone was used in the treatment of menstrual disorders. It has also been used to induce ovulation, with about a 50% success rate on average. Side effects Side effects of trengestone include headache, fatigue, and breast tenderness among others. It is not androgenic and does not cause masculinization. Pharmacology 20α-Dihydrotrengestone, the main active form of trengestone. =Pharmacodynamics= Trengestone is a progestogen, or an agonist of the progesterone receptor. It is an atypical progestogen similarly to dydrogesterone. For instance, unlike other progestogens, trengestone and dydrogesterone do not increase body temperature (i.e., have no hyperthermic effect). In addition, whereas other progestogens are antigonadotropic and inhibit ovulation, dydrogesterone is neither antigonadotropic nor progonadotropic and does not affect ovulation, and trengestone appears to be progonadotropic and can be used to induce ovulation. Similarly to dydrogesterone and progesterone, trengestone has no androgenic or estrogenic activity. =Pharmacokinetics= Trengestone appears to be a prodrug of 20α-dihydrotrengestone (20α-DHTG), as it is largely transformed into this major metabolite upon oral administration. 20α-DHTG has potent progestogenic activity, with peak levels of this metabolite occurring at 2 to 4 hours following administration of trengestone and with a biological half-life of 8 to 14 hours. Trengestone is excreted 41 to 46% in urine and up to 30% unchanged in feces, suggesting that a significant portion of the medication is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of trengestone have been reviewed. Chemistry Trengestone, also known as 1,6-didehydro-6-chlororetroprogesterone or as 6-chloro-9β,10α-pregna-1,4,6-triene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone and retroprogesterone. Retroprogesterone derivatives like trengestone are analogues of progesterone in which the hydrogen atom at the 9th carbon has been switched from the α-position (below the plane) to the β-position (above the plane) and the methyl group at the 10th carbon has been switched from the β-position to the α-position. This results in a \\"bent\\" configuration in which the plane of rings A and B is orientated at a 60° angle below the rings C and D. Analogues of trengestone include dydrogesterone (6-dehydroretroprogesterone) and Ro 6-3129 (16α-ethylthio-6-dehydroretroprogesterone). History Trengestone was synthesized in 1964 and was introduced for medical use by Roche in 1974. Society and culture =Generic names= Trengestone is the generic name of the drug and its . It is also known by its former developmental code name Ro 4-8347. =Brand names= Trengestone was marketed under the brand names Reteroid, Retroid, and Retrone. =Availability= Trengestone is no longer marketed and hence is no longer available in any country.

It commenced in 1981 in Australia as the ABN, and after a series of rebrandings and added services, has since 2006 been available through Libraries Australia (the successor to the ABN). In mid-2019, Libraries Australia partnered with Trove, and as of June 2020 is set to be co-branded with Trove. ANBD is Australia's largest single bibliographic resource, containing bibliographic records of published and unpublished sources that form part of an Australian collection, as well as catalogue records of items from the US Library of Congress and other institutions. It includes holdings data, name and subject authority records. It supplies records to Libraries Australia in various supported formats, in order to provide enriched data and support copy cataloguing, thus streamlining services for all libraries in Australia. It is a subscription-based service, via Libraries Australia, for librarians, used for reference, collection development, cataloguing and inter- library loans. It thus also serves as a kind of enhanced union catalogue. History The National Library of Australia (NLA) began investigating the potential for a national shared cataloguing network in the 1970s. The idea behind the network was that, instead of every library in Australia separately cataloguing every item in their collection, an item would be catalogued just once and stored on a single database. Librarians in other libraries could then copy the record, thus bringing about huge savings in efficiency and money. In August 1978, following a feasibility study, the NLA announced a pilot project. The Australian Bibliographic Network (ABN) commenced operations on 2 November 1981, with six participating libraries, which all contributed cataloguing records. During those pre-Internet days, library catalogues were on cards or microfiche, so the use of the digital dabase was seen as revolutionary. The database was known as the Australian National Bibliographic Database (ANBD), while the library network was the Australian Bibliographic Network. The ABN may be seen as the forerunner to Libraries Australia. The National Library established an advisory body, the ABN Network Committee (now Libraries Australia Advisory Committee, or LAAC) to advise the Library on the operation and development of the service. Various state library systems joined the network within the next few years, such as State Library Victoria in 1982, and the first ABN conference was held in Melbourne in 1983. The ABN system was as a multi-sector network, including university, state, public and special libraries. Development of ABN Services to school libraries were provided under a separate national service, the Schools Catalogue Information Service (SCIS), first developed in 1984 as ASCIS. =National standards= Training for the network, and the subject catalogue of the network underwent a range of changes in the 1980s. The ABN Standards Committee met for the first time on 14 May 1981. The issues dealt with in the first four meetings included: * minimum level of detail in contributed records * allowable and mandatory changes to bibliographic and authority records * priorities for authority control * detailed examination of AACR2 rule interpretations * standards for geographic names * extension of Library of Congress Subject Headings to allow additional 'approved' subject headings * use of MeSH and \\"Participant\\" subject headings * the subject heading for Aboriginal Australians * policy on duplicate records * the hierarchy for \\"bumping\\" (record replacement) among different sources * standards for a \\"high level record\\" that would be immune from bumping * extension of the Input/Edit system to cater for music, maps and manuscripts Once standards were established, a range of guidelines and publications ensued – this particular publication preceded implementation, and continues to date... =Inter-library loans= In 1990, the ABN created an inter-library lending service. =Rebranding= In 1999, the National Library moved to a new system, called Kinetica, which conformed to the standard international z39.50 protocol, enabling it to interact with other automated library systems. Full text PDF The software allowed users to interact with a graphical interface for the first time, rather than a text-based one, and by this time there were over 1000 member libraries and almost 30 million items were available on the ANDB. After a two-year project to redevelop Kinetica, the software used for searching and cataloguing was replaced, and a new administration system was created in November 2005. The new service was branded Libraries Australia, consisting of four components: Search, Cataloguing, Administration and Document Delivery. The more user-friendly search facility for ANBD then provided access to over 42 million items held by around 800 libraries around Australia, as well as about 1.2 million images held by PictureAustralia and many international library catalogues. In addition, the Chinese, Korean and Japanese Database (CJK) merged with Libraries Australia, and in the following year, a free search became publicly available. =International cooperation= In 2006, the National Library entered into an agreement with the National Library of New Zealand, allowing inter-library loans between the two countries. In 2007, Libraries Australia signed an agreement with international library cooperative OCLC, which meant that data added to the ANDB was included in WorldCat, the largest online public access catalogue OPAC) in the world. Trove, and recent changes In 2008–9, Libraries Australia free and subscription services were separated, and the free public search was replaced by Trove. In 2013, it adopted a new cataloguing standard, RDA Resource Description and Access. In 2014, it redeveloped the search facility, and the following year, ANBD reached a million RDA records. Current services and organisation The ANBD is the largest single bibliographic source in Australia. It contains millions of entries for books, journals and items in formats other than text, such as films, sound recordings, photographs, braille and audiobooks, music scores, computer files and digital material. It includes catalogue records from Australian and other libraries; Australian records are accompanied by location of the item. , its entries cover 50 million holdings, including those in over 1,200 Australian libraries. Contributing libraries include Apart from the ANBD, Libraries Australia's subscription service also provides access to a number of databases from other major institutions, such as the British Library Catalogue, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Research Libraries UK, Informit, Library of Congress Catalogue, National Film and Sound Archive, WorldCat, the Powerhouse Museum, Te Puna (the New Zealand National Bibliographic Database), National Museum of Australia and the University of Hong Kong. It also includes the Libraries Australia name and subject authorities added to the ANBD by the National Library and other contributing libraries. From July 2019, Libraries Australia became a partner within Trove Collaborative Services, continuing all services as before and with a rollout of new services. From June 2020, co-branding with Trove will become effective.

The film released worldwide on 12 February 2016 on Valentine's Day weekend. Upon release, the film received mixed to negative reviews. Plot The story begins just before New Year is about to set in. Akash works for a private firm in Mumbai and leads a monotonous life. When he learns that his grandfather's health has worsened, he leaves the city to visit his native town, Tanakpur. There, he negotiates a deal to sell his grandfather's studio. While visiting the studio for one last time, he is driven into nostalgia, and the story is sent in a flashback. Six-year-old Akash lives with his parents and grandfather (Rishi Kapoor), who is a photographer. Akash's grandfather predicts that Akash (Pulkit Samrat) will fall in love with a girl who lives 500 steps away from their studio and that they will be in love forever but won't be able to live together. Akash takes 500 steps and finds a girl older than him, disappointing him. Meanwhile, when he gets to high-school, he falls for Shruti (Yami Gautam). But he left her without informing just because he had to continue his higher studies in Mumbai. When Shruti learns this, she is shattered. She couldn't accept his selfishness after a long-term, affectionate relationship. Back in the present, He tries to find Shruti but fails. When he learns that his boss (Manoj Joshi) has fired him, he rushes back and is asked to secure a big contract for his company if he wants to save his job. He travels to Canada to meet Mrs. Pablo, their company investor's wife who is now broken-up with her husband. He attends a yoga camp, where he becomes friends with Mrs. Pablo and learns that her real name is Akansha (Urvashi Rautela). Akash also meets Shruti there, who behaves like a happy-go-lucky and doesn't recognize Akash. Akash pretends to be in love with Akansha to secure the contract, but he and Shruti fall in love with each other again during completing a task in the camp. They sleep together and revive their lost love. It is also revealed that Akansha is none other than the tall girl that Akash met in his childhood. Akash is again left heartbroken when Shruti leaves at the end of the camp, saying that they can't be together. Akash realizes Shruti still loves him and embarks on a journey to find the truth behind her rejection with the help of Akansha. He learns that she left him because she is suffering from a rare heart disease; she will die if her heart isn't transplanted soon. She requests him to live with her, all the life they would have if they were given a chance. In just a few days, they experience the life of being newly married, being a wedded couples and growing old. By the time they finish experiencing those days, they have a sweet and emotional conversation, and now Akash has to leave for his job purpose. A few months later, Shruti moves out of the hospital, healthy and cured-they found a donor and the transplant was done. In order to be with Akash, she moves to the city to find him and is left shocked when his phone is switched off and she can't contact him. Hopelessly, she wanders around until she finds a voice note left by Akash, then further goes in search for him. In the end, when she passes nearby her own house, her heart begins to beat faster. That's when she realizes that Akash was the one who gave his heart to her for the transplant, because Akash's heart always beat faster when he passed through Shruti's house as he loved her a lot. Thus, Shruti realizes that Akash is dead and cries a lot in the memory of Akash. Then she goes on to open the studio of Akash's grandfather and hangs the wood where \\"Aakash loves Shruti\\" was written by both of them during their childhood. The film ends with a snap of Akash's grandfather, taken by Shruti, in their studio.

He was the Superior from 30 September 1776 until his death. He was formerly the Vicar Apostolic of Siam in Thailand from 8 December 1755. After his death the Karnatic Mission was headed by Bishop Nicolas Champenois. Early life He was born at Sully-sur-Loire in the Diocese of Orléans, France on 1 September 1713. He joined the Paris Foreign Missions Society and was sent to Siam, Thailand in 1741. In Siam Mission He worked first in a place called Mergui. In 1749 he apposed the erection of a stone in front of his Church. The stone is claimed to have contained abusive language towards Catholicism and for that reason it was called scandal stone. After two months of fighting, the Governor relented. From 1742 to 1750, he worked as the provicar of the Tenasserim. He came back to Bangkok on 22 January 1755 and was appointed titula bishop of Thabraca and Coadjutor of Siam. Since his predecessor Jean de Lolière-Puycontat died before consecrating him, Brigot went to Manila to receive his episcopal consecration on 24 August 1757 from Bishop Juan de La Fuente Yepes. Dunring the Burmese–Siamese War of 1767 Bishop Brigot, his missionaries together with their Christians and seminarians, a Jesuit, Dominicans, another Portuguese priest, and their Christians were taken prisoners. Seeing fellow Christians in misery, he gave them everything he had, he even sold his episcopal ring. During the month of May they were taken to Tavoy and then in November to Rangoon. The Franciscans and Barnabites missionaries in this city, chose him as arbitrator on an issue that divided them, and accepted his decision. On 31 January 1768 he consecrated Giovanni Maria Percoto as the Titular Bishop of Maxula Prates and the Vicar Apostolic of Ava e Pegù. He left in March of that year to Pondicherry.

Dartmouth had adopted football as a school sport in 1881 when the team went 1–0–1. Prior to Wurtenburg's hiring, the team had won two consecutive Triangular Football League championships under coach Wallace Moyle. Wurtenburg had been a highly successful player at Yale, where he had played at quarterback on teams that went 46–1–1 in a four- year span. He had graduated from the school in 1893 and coached the Navy Midshipmen football program for a year before his hiring by Dartmouth. During Wurtenburg's five year coaching tenure, Dartmouth went 8–2 in conference contests and won four consecutive Triangular Football League championships. The 1895 season was made up of thirteen games, a record-setting amount for a Dartmouth team. It included the closest loss to rival Harvard up to that point. The 1896 was the most successful season of Wurtenburg's, in terms of winning percentage; the squad went 5–2–1, the tenth-best record among major teams, for a .688 win percentage. The fewest games played in a season under Wurtenburg were seven in 1897. That team managed a 4–3 record, which included a three-game scoreless streak. The 1898 squad finished the season with a losing record, 5–6, but managed to outscore its opponents 205–137. Wurtenburg's final season as Dartmouth's head coach was his worst. The team had a 2–7 overall record and went 0–2 in conference play. The season was also marked by several of the largest blowouts of Dartmouth in years. Overall, the Dartmouth football program went 23–23–2 in Wurtenburg's five years of coaching. The 1898 season was the final Triangular Football League championship the school would win; the conference would become defunct in 1901, two years later. Following Wurtenburg's departure, Frederick E. Jennings, a player under Wurtenburg, would take over the program, leading it to a 2–4–2 record in one year of coaching. Another former player, Walter McCornack would coach the program starting in 1901, and led the team to a 15-win record in two years. Wurtenburg's tenure as coach has occasionally been remarked as the beginning of Dartmouth's acceptance as a major team. Prelude Dartmouth College fielded its first football team in 1881, when the school challenged Amherst College to a two-game series. They won the first contest, one touchdown to none, and tied the second. The following year, the team played their first major opponent when they traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts and played the Harvard Crimson. Dartmouth was blown out 53–0, and a rivalry with Harvard formed. The Dartmouth football team developed through the 1880s, skipping the 1885 season but challenging several major opponents. Prior to Wurtenburg's arrival, the school had won four Triangular Football League championships in seven years. Wallace Moyle was the first coach hired by the program; he served in that position during the two years before Wurtenburg's appointment and led the school to a 9–7 record. William Wurtenburg was born and raised in Western New York by immigrant parents. He was introduced to football while a student at Phillips Exeter Academy, where, in his senior year, he played quarterback and served as team captain. In 1886, Wurtenburg entered Yale University to study to become a doctor. He joined the school football team in his first year, playing as a backup halfback. He remained a backup halfback on the 1887 team, which went undefeated and was later recognized as a national champion. Wurtenburg transitioned to the quarterback position in 1888 and took the starting spot. He finished playing with the team regularly in 1889. During the time Wurtenburg played, Yale went 46–1–1. Upon graduating from Yale in 1893, Wurtenburg accepted a position as head coach of the Naval Academy football team for the 1894 season. He guided the team to a 4–1–2 record. Aftermath After the 1899 season concluded, Wurtenburg declined to return the next year. Instead, he was replaced by one of his former players, Frederick E. Jennings. During the time that Wurtenburg coached Dartmouth, the program went 23–23–2 and won four consecutive Triangular Football League championships. The team had also amassed an 8–2 conference record. Jennings took the 1900 squad to a 2–4–2 record, and was replaced following that season by Walter McCornack. He found more success with the program and led it to a 15–3–1 record over two years. The Big Green would never win another Triangular Football League championship; the conference folded after the 1901 season. Following his coaching career, Wurtenburg became an occasional referee for Yale, and later established himself as a respected surgeon. Fred Crolius, captain of the 1898 team, would reflect on Wurtenburg's coaching career at Dartmouth for William \\"Big Bill\\" Edwards' book Football Days, stating that: :One man, whose influence more than any other one thing, succeeded in laying a foundation for Dartmouth's wonderful results, but whose name is seldom mentioned in that connection is Doctor Wurtenberg, who was brought up in the early Yale football school. He had the keenest sense of fundamental football and the greatest intensity of spirit in transmitting his hard earned knowledge. Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with his enthusiasm and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway that nothing could stop its growth.

At Oxford, he rowed three times in The Boat Race against Cambridge, being on the winning side in 1869 and losing in 1870 and 1871, and also played football for the University. Baker graduated from Oxford University in 1871, with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Football career He later played football for Clapham Rovers, alongside R.S.F.

This was the fourth unofficial match between the two countries, which England won 2–1, with Walker scoring both England's goals. Teaching career On graduating from Oxford, Baker was briefly a school master at Whitgift School in Croydon, before emigrating to New Zealand in 1873. He sailed to New Zealand on board the SS Dallam Tower. The ship eventually reached Port Chalmers, New Zealand, after a dramatic voyage in which she lost a mast and travelled 2,000 miles under a jury rig. Baker had originally planned to set up business in the flax industry but instead he established a private school at French Farm, at Akaroa near Christchurch. He continued to maintain his interest in sport, winning the athletics championship at Timaru in 1878 and playing cricket for Canterbury between 1874 and 1880. In 1890, he moved to Tasmania, where he taught for two years at Christ College, before returning to New Zealand in 1892. He then established the Goodwood House prep school at Otago. In 1896, he became manager of a boarding house at Otago Boys' High School, Dunedin; his contract gave him the right to conduct his own school on the premises. Baker remained at Dunedin until he died in June 1902. He was buried in Dunedin Northern Cemetery.Northern Cemetery plot records Family Baker married Josephine Dicken in 1878 and they had four daughters including Eleanor, the eldest, who became a doctor and surgeon in remote areas of New Zealand's North Island.

For decades she had collected salvaged wood, stained glass, and other materials from abandoned buildings in the city's Central Ward, which had been hollowed out by poverty and riots in the late 1960s. She built the Ark on an empty lot; it was still unfinished when the city condemned it in 1987. Unable to find a new location, Tawana dismantled her ship in 1988. Tawana's Ark is classified as an example of visionary art and vernacular architecture. There are numerous questions about Tawana, her personal and gender identity, and her past. She told people in Newark that she was born in Japan, to a Japanese mother and an American father, who was a civil engineer, and came with him and her brother to the United States after World War II. She said her mother and sister had been killed in a bombing raid in Japan. But her obituary said that she was born on an Indian reservation and ran away at age 12. She worked for some years at a variety of itinerant jobs in the South before settling in Newark in the 1950s. There she worked for decades in a range of construction trades. After being forced to dismantle her Ark, she moved to Port Jervis, New York in western Orange County. She lived there for her remaining years. Early life Kea Tawana told people that she was born circa 1935 in Japan, the second of three siblings. Her mother was Japanese and her father was an American civil engineer. Her mother and sister died during Allied bombing raids in World War II. Tawana and her brother moved with their American father to the United States in 1947. By her account, her father remarried but died in a displaced persons camp in California, leaving her and her brother homeless and orphaned by age 12. But her obituary said that she was born on an Indian reservation and ran away from home at age 12. She worked her way South. Strong and sturdy, she had a fierce independence and usually wore men's clothes to protect her privacy. On the road Tawana supported herself as an itinerant worker in a variety of jobs, including learning construction trades. She found acceptance primarily in the African- American community. In 1953, Tawana freighthopped to Newark, New Jersey, where she found work in construction and theater lighting. She also worked in a shipyard in Brooklyn, New York. She lived and worked in Newark for more than 30 years. She moved to Port Jervis, New York in the late 1980s, after being forced to demolish her Ark. She was known in the small town, and died there at home on August 4, 2016. Ark Tawana began construction of her Ark on August 8, 1982, using wood salvaged from abandoned buildings, connected with mortise and tenon joints. The ship's frame was 86 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 28 feet high. As she intended it to be both sculpture and a seaworthy vessel, she reinforced the Ark's bulkhead with iron and built five waterproof compartments. She intended to christen the Ark as the AKE Matsu Kaisha (Red Pine). Tawana was evicted in 1986, after the vacant lot she occupied was purchased by the New Community Corporation. She moved the Ark by herself to the parking lot of the Humanity Baptist Church, where she worked as a caretaker and guard. Photographer Camilo José Vergara said that Tawana was \\"the only folk artist in the Eastern United States to have built a work comparable in scope and conception to the famous Watts Towers of Los Angeles.\\" Didi Barrett of the Museum of American Folk Art described Tawana and the Ark as \\"compelling symbols of hope and human potential in a community that has suffered a troubled past.\\" Lynda Hartigan, former chief curator of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, said that Tawana's work \\"genuinely original, uncommercialized, and straight from the heart and mind...\\" Tawana generated controversy by her work, her androgynous or masculine appearance, and her opposition to urban development in the Central Ward. A spokesperson for Mayor Sharpe James expressed such discomfort with her identity, when she was prominently opposing the city's plans for development. But she gained support from the Folk Art Society of America, critics, and numerous other groups to preserve her work.\\"Kea Tawana's Ark\\", Letter to Mayor Sharpe James from Ann F. Oppenhimer, Folk Art Society of America, 1/15/1988, SPACES website; accessed 1 April 2017 Though no structural flaws were cited, the Newark Department of Engineering condemned the Ark as unsafe in 1987 and ordered its demolition. Tawana went to court, where her lawyer defended the Ark as a work of art and as free speech. After a temporary injunction, Tawana agreed to demolish the Ark, a process which she completed in the summer of 1988.

He was honored by the Government of India, in 2012, with the fourth highest Indian civilian award of Padma Shri. Biography Maniratnam was born on 6 January 1936 at the remote hamlet of Seethapuram in Tiruvalur of the undivided Andhra Pradesh, India, to Rangaiah Naidu and Mangamma. He did his schooling in Tirutani and during that period, he came under the influence of the renowned Gandhians, N. G. Ranga and Nirmala Deshpande. He started his social involvement by organizing a few children's clubs called Balananda Sangham when he was 15. Later, he joined the Bharat Sevak Samaj, and got associated with their youth welfare programs during the period 1960-66. In 1970, Muniratnam moved to Tirupati where he had the opportunity to meet the social activist, Rajgopal Naidu. The association paved the way for the organization, Rayalaseema Seva Samithi, in 1981, which was later renamed as Rashtriya Seva Samithi (RASS). Muniratnam, a recipient of DLitt (Honoris Causa) from Sri Venkateswara University, lives in Tirupati where RASS has its headquarters. Rashtriya Seva Samithi and social career Rashtriya Seva Samithi, erstwhile Rayalaseema Seva Samithi, has hosted the social activities of Muniratnam, ever since he founded the organization, with assistance from Rajgopal Naidu, in 1981. One of the first attempts was to make modern scientific applications available to the poor farmers of the drought prone Rayalaseema region and he succeeded in establishing a Krishi Vigyan Kendra under the umbrella of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Later, his activities focussed women and child welfare for which several Mahila Mandals were established. He is known to have initiated several agro-forestry and horticultural programs by supplying saplings free of cost. The nursery, set up by RASS is reported to have supplied over six hundred thousand saplings and grafts to the farmers. The organization has developed a 75-acre farm, received as a grant from the Government of Andhra Pradesh, where modern agricultural methods are being implemented. They have also supplied smokeless chulhas (kitchen stoves) and have a running program to train the women in using the stoves. Another area of focus of the organization is in employment generation for which they have established several small scale manufacturing units in garments, assembly of electronic products, toys and food stuffs. The units provide training and job opportunities to people and help them set up their own units after successful completion of training by providing financial assistance. They claim the scheme has benefitted over 2000 women. They are also involved in sanitation programs under which 750 low cost comfort stations have been constructed. The program also incorporates waste water disposal by channelising it for irrigation purposes. Awareness campaigns on community health, family planning services, personal hygiene and environmental sanitation are also regularly conducted and a nurses training centre is also in operation, since 1986, under the management of the organization. They have also set up many maternity care centres in and sround Chittoor district. Under the guidance of Muniratnam, the organization is reported to have established 600 early education centres, benefiting 30,000 children of the region. The organization is known to have set up 1100 basic education centres in Chittoor and Cudappah districts to provide non formal education to 32,000 children of which 166 centres are exclusively for girls and another 227 centres open to backward communities. Rashtriya Seva Samithi has a reported presence in 2500 villages spread in four districts in the Rayalaseema region. In order to broaden the reach of his activities, Muniratnam has already set up a nationwide organization, Sahaya Samithi, widening the scope of activities to include the rehabilitation of physically and mentally challenged children incorporating assistance from destitute women. Muniratnam attends conferences and seminars to deliver keynote addresses and writes articles to propagate his views. Positions Muniratnam, a former member of the National Planning Commission of India, has served on many government constituted committees and agencies. At the central government level, he has been a member of Sakshara Bharat, (Ministry of Human Resource Development), Regional Committee of the Council for Advance of People's Action and Rural Technology CAPART, (Ministry of Rural Development), National Consultative Committee on De-addiction and Rehabilitation (NCCDR), (Ministry of Social Justice), the Governing Board of Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (RMK), the Executive Committee of the Central Social Welfare Board and the National Literacy Mission Authority, (Ministry of Human Resource Development). He has held the chairs of the State Resource Center and Jan Sikshan Sansthan, two of the Ministry of Human Resource Development initiatives. At the State administration level, Muniratnam has held the chair of Orissa Tribal Development Project and has been a member of the GO-NGO Coordination Committee and the Advisory Council of the Vigilance Commission of the Government of Andhra Pradesh.

Paul Goode, The Decline of Regionalism in Putin's Russia: Boundary Issues, 2001, , pp. 139-141 While most acutely this issue manifested itself during the 2014 pro- Russian unrest in Ukraine, other ethnic minorities in Ukraine sought for greater political or economical autonomy during 1990s. These movements, while not being secessionist, were perceived by central government as a threat to the unity of the state. Russian regionalism in Eastern/Southern Ukraine Many observers noted that political division of Ukraine, as seen in voting patterns during the elections in Ukraine roughly matches the distribution of the Russophone population. Early attempts include suggestions of the Donetsk- Dnipro or Dnipro autonomous region. In 1990, a proposal was put forth in Odessa for a \\"special state status\\" of the historical area of Novorossiya which would have been included five Ukrainian oblasts plus Moldovan Transnistria, which is now a breakaway territory. Of significant development was regionalism in Crimea, which was of varying political success since early 1990s and had eventually led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia. Regionalism in Western Ukraine In the light of violent pro Russian events, the Western Ukraine may be perceived as monolithic, it has its own share of regionalism. Even before the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, there have been call for federalism in the historical Ukrainian region of Galicia. Galicia after the first partition of Poland (1772) was part of the Austrian Empire until its dissolution after World War I in 1918, and therefore its historical development was different from the parts of Ukraine which belonged to the Russian Empire. A representative of the Galician regionalism was Viacheslav Chornovil, one of the first leaders of the Rukh movement, who was instrumental in the convocation of the Galician Assembly. While one of the important resolutions of the Assembly was \\"On the Unity of the Ukrainian Lands\\", Chornovil was severely criticized for \\"separatism\\" and eventually abandoned the idea. О. В.

The band was active from 1984 to 1991. After a split-up in 1991, they re- formed in 1998 and resumed touring until the death of Schultz, singer and original member of the band in 2014. Origin of name The name of the band comes from the Latin adage Si vis pacem, para bellum (If you want peace, prepare for war). Bibliography Parabellum in 2013 The group was originally founded in 1984 by Géant-Vert, at the time manager of Les Porte-Mentaux, a parisian punk rock band. BB Rock, singer of les Porte-Mentaux, considering the lyrics Géant-Vert submitted him, suggests him to set up his own band. Géant- Vert then gathered musicians by recruiting two former members of les Porte- Mentaux: Schultz (his real name, Roger Fritsch) on guitar and Roland Chamarat (nicknamed Roland Chamallow) on bass. The band is completed a little later by Cambouis (whose real name is Jean-François Juvanon) on drums. The name of the band is based on the Latin quotation \\"Si vis pacem parabellum\\" (\\"If you want peace, prepare for war\\") that Géant-Vert has printed on his T-shirt. Unable to find a singer, Géant-Vert offers the role to the guitarist Schultz. In 1984, the group released their first EP \\"Nous sommes gouvernés par des imbéciles\\" (\\"We are governed by fools\\") (where Riton replaced Roland on bass). In 1986, Sven Lava Pohlhammer, chilean guitarist, having also officiated with les Porte-Mentaux, joined the band. The same year, Parabellum released a LP \\"Gratuit: 2 en moins\\" which contains some well-known songs of the band: \\"Ilot Amsterdam\\", a cover of the song Amsterdam of Jacques Brel, with modified lyrics and Cayenne, a popular anarchist song often attributed ( probably wrongly) to Aristide Bruant, whose words have been also reworked. Always the same year, Cambouis is replaced by Patrick Lemarchand on the drums. In 1987, the band released \\"4 garçons dans le brouillard\\". Most of the band's songs have been written by Géant-Vert, with incisive style, dark humor and a sense of shock-formula as evidenced by this cover note: \\"Parabellum est au rock, ce qu'une braguette coincée est à une envie de pisser\\"(\\"Parabellum is to rock, what a stuck fly is to a need to piss\\"). Nevertheless, in the same year, Géant-Vert decided to stop writing for the group, because of the many conflicts that oppose him to Schultz, the leader of the group. In 1988, Parabellum released \\"Anarchy in Chiraquie\\" and \\"Saturnin\\". In 1990, Parabellum released their first album \\"Parabellum\\", but this one receives mixed reviews. Launched in a badly organized tour in Canada, the group played a final concert on June 18, 1991 at Foufounes Electriques in Canada before separating. In 1997, Parabellum decided to reform for a unique concert in Marmande, in front of 7000 people that gave rise to a live album: Post-Mortem. The following year, they went back on tour. Patrick Lemarchand and Roland Chamarat nevertheless left the group and were replaced respectively by Zed (his real name Philippe Leffray) and Olivier Meyrand. In 1999, the band released their first album from Parabellum in 1990: Bordel Inside, followed in 2002 by Bunker. In 2004, Zed died electrocuted at the age of 34 and was replaced by Xavier Mesa, former drummer of BB Doc and Boys Butchers. The group was active and released 3 more albums until the death of Schultz, September 12, 2014, pulmonary edema. On 11 January 2017, Sven Lava Polhammer dies at the age of 59. Influences The music used in the song Saturnin (1988), in the Parabellum compilation, and reused in the song Lies (1997) is from the band Cock Sparrer. One can also compare Anarchie en chiraquie (1988) to Rock You Like a Hurricane (Scorpions, Love at First Sting, 1984). Legacy Parabellum is considered one of the leading groups of the French punk rock scene because of its longevity, the caustic, claimant, anarchist and humorous character of its texts mocking politics and society (\\"Anarchy in Chiraquie\\", \\"Osmose 99 \\",\\" Welcome To Paradise \\"...). Musically, Schultz defined Parabellum as \\"the most punk of rock'n'roll bands and the most rock'n'roll of punk bands\\". Parabellum was known for their rock interpretation of some popular French or French- language songs like Amsterdam by Jacques Brel (now Ilot Amsterdam), A Saint- Lazare by Aristide Bruant or Cayenne. Schultz is known to have been in parallel with Parabellum, guitarist of Los Carayos, a band formed by François Hadji-Lazaro, Manu Chao and Alain Wampas. Géant-Vert was also lyricist of Les Rats, where Roland Chamallow was a bassist.

The address generation unit (AGU), sometimes also called address computation unit (ACU), is an execution unit inside central processing units (CPUs) that calculates addresses used by the CPU to access main memory. By having address calculations handled by separate circuitry that operates in parallel with the rest of the CPU, the number of CPU cycles required for executing various machine instructions can be reduced, bringing performance improvements. While performing various operations, CPUs need to calculate memory addresses required for fetching data from the memory; for example, in- memory positions of array elements must be calculated before the CPU can fetch the data from actual memory locations. Those address-generation calculations involve different integer arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, modulo operations, or bit shifts. Often, calculating a memory address involves more than one general-purpose machine instruction, which do not necessarily decode and execute quickly. By incorporating an AGU into a CPU design, together with introducing specialized instructions that use the AGU, various address-generation calculations can be offloaded from the rest of the CPU, and can often be executed quickly in a single CPU cycle. Capabilities of an AGU depend on a particular CPU and its architecture. Thus, some AGUs implement and expose more address-calculation operations, while some also include more advanced specialized instructions that can operate on multiple operands at a time. Furthermore, some CPU architectures include multiple AGUs so more than one address-calculation operation can be executed simultaneously, bringing further performance improvements by capitalizing on the superscalar nature of advanced CPU designs. For example, Intel incorporates multiple AGUs into its Sandy Bridge and Haswell microarchitectures, which increase bandwidth of the CPU memory subsystem by allowing multiple memory-access instructions to be executed in parallel.

High School and College Career Carpio teamed up with Fritz Gaston, Steve Watson, future pro teammate Padim Israel and Chito Narvasa as a 6’4” center-forward for the Ateneo Blue Eagles from 1974 to 1977, winning back-to-back NCAA titles in 1975 and 1976. He also earned Most Valuable Player honors in 1977.http://www.pba-online.net/basketball/ncaa/awards/ Professional career Carpio joined the Crispa Redmanizers and learned from the team's resident stars like Atoy Co, Freddie Hubalde, Abet Guidaben and Philip Cezar. He was a reliable off-the-bench player as Crispa constantly battled Toyota for PBA trophies. In 1983, he would join a powerhouse offensive team in Great Taste, which boasted of a very promising center in Manny Victorino, 3-time MVP Bogs Adornado (acquired from the disbanded U/tex team) and sensational Fil-Am rookie Ricardo Brown. Carpio faced his former team in two straight championship series (the Reinforced and the Open), losing both to the Grand Slam-winning Redmanizers. Great Taste, however, exacted sweet revenge against Crispa in the Third Conference of the following year, en route to three straight titles extending all the way to the 1985 season. While playing for the Coffee Makers, he earned the moniker \\"The Scavenger\\" from commentator Pinggoy Pengson for his penchant for collaring offensive rebounds and following up on missed shots as well as recovering loose balls. After spending the tailend of his career with Seven-Up, he was forced to end his playing days after nagging knee injuries could no longer be repaired. He spent 13 seasons in the PBA.

It is so known because of the widespread use and availability of narcotics such as opium, heroin, cocaine, morphine, and absinthe. During this period these drugs were widely available and incredibly popular among both men and women of many social classes in many parts of the world. They were marketed to both adults and children, often included in patent medicines such as cough syrups, pain relievers, and asthma medicines. They were administered to infants and women with menstrual cramps, and included in food and beverages such as Coca-Cola. Literary characters such as Sherlock Holmes were portrayed using morphine and cocaine. Holmes is described as having a particular penchant for overt injections of a 7% solution of cocaine - though only when lacking adequate mental stimulation. The period ended with a series of laws regulating narcotic drugs in various countries and internationally. The International Opium Convention, signed in the Hague in 1912 by 11 countries and entering into force in 1915, was the first stab at a comprehensive drug control treaty internationally and inspired domestic drug control laws such as the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act in the United States. ‘Binge’ is 19th century slang, although the meaning has evolved. However, the specific application of the term ‘great binge’ relative to drug use and popular attitudes towards drug use circa 1870–1914 is relatively recent. As well as its use by Bryars and Harper cited above, it was used by British author and comedian Stephen Fry to describe this period in 'More Fool Me'Fry, Stephen (25 Sept. 2014). More Fool Me.

The case led to the conviction of the husband in 1890 and triggered several legal reforms. Events Phulmoni Dasi was a ten-year-old Bengali girl with a 30-year-old husband named Hari Mohan Maiti. She died after her husband tried to consummate their marriage. Trial The case went to trial in the Calcutta Sessions Court on 6 July 1890. The girl's mother provided testimony against the husband. The husband was convicted under Section 338 of the Indian Penal Code for \\"causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others\\". Under an exception clause in Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, introduced in 1860, sex with one's own wife was not considered as rape. As Phulmoni was of legal age and married to Maiti, he was sentenced to 12 months of hard labor. The case is known as Empress v. Hari Mohan Maiti. Reforms On 9 January 1891, the Viceroy of India, Lord Lansdowne presented a bill before the Council of India, which was then headed by Andrew Scoble, called the \\"Age of Consent\\". It sought to amend Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. Previously, the age of consent had been set at 10 in 1860. After the bill was passed on 29 March 1891, the Section 376 included sex with a girl under 12 even if the person is the wife of the perpetrator, as rape.

History  Mir Abu Turab was the chief of the army during Mughal rule of Akbar. In 1579, appointed chief of the Mecca caravan, he brought back a large stone from Mecca with a footprint of the Prophet Mohammed in 1582 (987 H.). This stone is said to have been the same which Syed Jalal-i-Bukhari brought to Delhi at the time of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq. Taken first to Akbar at Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar looked on the whole as a pious fraud, and though the stone was received with great respect, Abu Turab was allowed to keep it in his house. When (1583) Itimad was made Governor of Gujarat, Abu Turab followed him as Amin of the Suba and was buried at Ahmedabad in 1597 (1005 H). The relic was afterwards brought to Ahmedabad, and perhaps near his tomb, had a building raised over it, and drew large numbers of pilgrims. In the disturbed times of the eighteenth century, as the suburbs were no longer safe, the stone was taken within the city walls. He also wrote a book on history of Gujarat, Tarikh-i-Gujarat. The tomb was damaged in 2001 Gujarat earthquake and was restored in 2002 by Archaeological Survey of India. Architecture left left Mir Abu Turab's tomb is simple and graceful, 12.5 sq m (forty-one feet) square platform with a double colonnade of pillars, the inner colonnade formerly enclosed by stone trellis work. Local in style the tomb shows the art in its best form. The flat lintels have throughout given place to the arch, and as no rich minaret bases clash with the plainness of the main building, the whole is uniform and pleasing. On each face three large and two small arches point to the presence of an octagonal dome, and, without confusing, relieve the sameness. The dome is supported by twelve pillars.

Smith. \\"Aelst, Pieter van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 8 December 2014 He should not be confused with Pieter Coecke van Aelst (1502-1550), a Flemish painter who was also a significant tapestry designer. Life He was likely born around 1495 in Brussels (possibly in Aalst) as the son of Pieter van Edingen van Aelst (also referred to as (Pieter van Aelst the Younger'). His father and grandfather were both tapestry weavers. Pieter joined the workshop that his father had set up in Brussels in 1493 and was trained there.Paul F. State, Historical Dictionary of Brussels, Scarecrow Press, 27 July 2004, p. 4 He became the purveyor of tapestries to the Spanish king Charles V, the then ruler of Flanders. This was likely upon the death of Pieter's grandfather Pieter van Aelst I. In 1509 he was mentioned as a restorer of the collection of tapestries of Margaret of Austria, the governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. In 1517 he was paid for tapestries of David and John the Baptist made for the English king Henry VIII. The most famous set his workshop produced was that designed for the Sistine Chapel in Rome, following the Raphael Cartoons, which now belong to the British Royal Collection but since 1865 have been on loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The cartoons are designed by the High Renaissance painter Raphael in 1515-16 showing scenes from the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles. The workshop made four further recorded sets over the following decades, for the kings of France, Spain and England, and Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga.Dussler, Luitpold, Raphael, A Critical Catalogue of his Pictures, Wall-Paintings & Tapestries, online section on the cartoons and tapestries These helped the van Aelst workshop gain other important commissions. A tapestry after Raphael's Bearing of the Cross produced by the van Aelst workshop in 1520 played an important role in the introduction of the Italian Renaissance style in Flanders.Guy Delmarcel, Flemish Tapestry from the 15th to the 18th Century, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 1 January 1999 In 1520 Pope Leo X commissioned a series of 20 tapestries of Children’s Games and Medici Symbols from van Aelst. The contract required the background of the tapestries to be completely filled with gold. The price of the gold accounted for 14,000 ducats in the total price of 17,600 ducats (i.e. 80%) payable for the series. The series of Children's Games depicted winged spirits with attributes and emblems representing the emblems of the House of Medici and the Pope himself. In 1547 and 1548 he was still listed as a tapestry maker for the court of Charles V. Around 1550 van Aelst was commissioned by the Polish king Sigismund II Augustus to make a large and lavish work consisting of 18 tapestries representing various episodes in the book of Genesis. These works were made in collaboration with six other Brussels workshops. As in 1560 his workshop was sold by his heirs to the prominent Brussels weaver Willem de Pannemaker, it is likely that he died not long before. Work The mark 'pva' of his workshop appears on four tapestry series, which were made in collaboration with others: on five of eight History of Noah tapestries (Wawel Castle, Kraków), on seven of 10 History of Abraham tapestries, after designs from the circle Bernard van Orley (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), on two of eight History of Odysseus tapestries (Hardwick Hall, Derbys, NT) and on three of six History of Moses tapestries (Legion of Honor museum, San Francisco).Szenen aus dem Buch Tobias (8 Stücke): 1.

He is generally counted as the fifty- first in the list of 63 Nayanars. He is said to worshipped the god Shiva, his patron, by his Mind and built a grand temple for him in his mind. Hagiographical account A brief account of Vayilar's life is described in the Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Vayilar is one of the six Nayanars from Tondai Nadu and is described to date from the Pallava era. Vayilar was born and lived his life in Mylapore (Mayilai), presently a neighbourhood in the city of Chennai, India. He was a Vellalar, a caste of agricultural land owners. He was a Shaiva, a devotee of the god Shiva. Considering his name, he is described to be dumb. He did not visit the Kapaleeshwarar Temple, a famous Shiva temple of Mylapore. Vayilar did not believe in idol worship and rituals, instead he performed Manasic (\\"mental\\") worship. Vayilar wanted to create a grand temple for Shiva, but did not have the money to do so. Thus, Vayilar built a temple to Shiva in his mind with his imagination. The temple of the mind is described to have five walls of different metals, the outermost was iron and the innermost was gold. It has many towers of gold and spacious halls with silver walls, gold pillars and studded with precious jewels like diamonds and rubies. Mango-sized diamonds that shone like the Sun replaced ordinary lamps to flood the temple with light. Numerous mirrors were fitted in the temple. The garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) has a beautifully carved Lingam (aniconic symbol of Shiva) which was decorated with precious stones and fragrant flowers. The Lingam was surrounded by a Kalpavriksha (divine, wish-fulfilling tree) on each side, whose flowers emitted a salubrious fragrance that diffused every part of the temple. Sekkizhar says that: 'His mind was his temple, self-realization was the lamp lit in the temple; he bathed the Lingam in waters of Ananda (bliss) and worshipped the Lord with the elixir of supreme Love'. Vayilar is described to be engaged in the worship of Shiva of his mind temple day and night. He did not care for food or rest, rain or shine, night or day and continue to serve God. Over course of time, the temple and the Lingam disappeared and his soul became one with God. Remembrance One of the most prominent Nayanars, Sundarar (8th century) mentions Vayilar in hymn to various Nayanar saints. A shrine is dedicated to Vayilar in the Kapaleeshwarar Temple in his home town of Mylapore. Vayilar is worshipped in the Tamil month of Markazi, when the moon enters the Revati nakshatra (lunar mansion). He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals.

The exhibition is seen as capturing a moment when New Zealand jewelers started looked less at European traditions and precious materials and more at Pacific traditions and natural materials.Mark Amery, \\"Talking a walk\\", The Big Idea, 31 October 2013 Development The exhibition was developed by New Zealand's Craft Council (later absorbed into Creative New Zealand) for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to \\"show overseas audiences the new and important direction of New Zealand jewellery\\". It was shown in Asia, Australia and New Zealand over a five-year period. It was curated by artist John Edgar with a selection panel consisting of Edith Ryan, craft programme manager, QE II Arts Council; James Mack, director of the Dowse Art Museum; and jeweller Kobi Bosshard. Twelve artists were eventually selected and they made over 40 new pieces of work in total from bone, stone and shell. Artists were given a brief around materials: > The materials, Bone (ivory, beef, whale), Stone (argillite, greywacke, > nephrite, jade) and Shell will predominate, although not exclusively. Other > complementary materials will be silver, wood, plastic, fibre etc. Bone Stone Shell was designed to show new way of thinking about materials and place in New Zealand contemporary jewellery. It showed New Zealand artists taking inspiration from the history of Maori and Pacific adornment, rather than just Western traditions, and the use of local materials like paua shell and pounamu, rather than the precious stones and metal of European jewellery. As curator John Edgar wrote in the exhibition catalogue: > This exhibition is about awareness – of our heritage of Western civilisation > and our cultural environment in the South Pacific; of our place in the > twentieth century and the values necessary to survive the nuclear age; of > the delicate fragility of our ecology and our relationship to the natural > materials and the non-renewable resources of our region; of the celebration > of the forces that formed these materials and the life within them; and, of > the ability to communicate in objects of beauty, spirit and power. Legacy After the conclusion of the touring show, the pieces were acquired by the Friends of Te Papa for the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. In 2013/14 Te Papa restaged the works from Bone Stone Shell alongside more recent pieces of contemporary jewellery and pieces from its Maori and Pacific collections.

Now in her 40s, she is in a loveless and childless marriage to her husband David (David de Simone) and works as a massage therapist, while still exercising religiously to keep herself in peak condition. After a chance meeting with a former friend from the gymnastics world, Denise (Allison Mackie), Jane takes an interest in aerial dance and begins lessons with gymnastics trainer Nicole (Mam Smith). During her lessons, Jane meets Serena (Addie Yungmee), a Korean- American dancer who grew up in a Jewish adoptive family, and is a closeted (at least with respect to her parents) lesbian. Serena, Nicole and Jane begin to work together on a Cirque du Soleil style aerial act, which Nicole hopes to present in Las Vegas. However, Nicole is forced to drop out for family reasons. As Jane and Serena continue to work together on the act, they develop an increasingly romantic relationship. Jane finds herself torn between her growing love for Serena, and the potential for a rekindled relationship with her husband who now wants a child.

Horseman is most notable for her work on the 1950s comic strips, \\"Pam\\" and \\"The Clothes Horse\\". Biography Marie Horseman was born in Rochester, Victoria on 9 December 1911, the daughter of Frederick Ernest Horseman (1882-1966), a farmer, and his wife Katherine Marie Compston (née Miller), who were migrants from Yorkshire, England. In 1924, when she was thirteen, her parents separated and Horseman travelled with her mother to England before moving to Germany. Horseman's mother managed a canteen for the British Army, whilst Horseman attended a German finishing school. Her parents didn't officially divorce until October 1933. On returning to Australia she was briefly employed by Norman Lindsay and his second wife, Rose, as a governess, for their two daughters. Lindsay was impressed with her drawing skills and recommended she attend the National Art School. For financial reasons, she did not complete her course at East Sydney Technical College but during her studies she was influenced by Rayner Hoff's artistic style. In 1929 Horseman together with Joan Morrison became the first female cartoonists to be permanent employees at Smith's Weekly. Horseman married William Longford Power, an articled clerk, on 2 September 1931 at the North Sydney registry office. They had one son, Roderick Packenham, before they divorced in May 1938. Horseman then married Nelson Illingworth, grandson of the sculptor Nelson Illingworth on 8 June 1938 at the Mosman Presbyterian Church. They had one son and three daughters before the marriage ended in divorce. In the early 1940s the family moved to Brisbane, where Horseman freelanced, drawing comic strips for Frank Johnson Publications as well as contributing cartoons to Man Magazine, Australian Woman's Mirror and Rydge's Business Journal (for whom she created \\"The Tipple Twins\\"). Smith Weekly cartoonists Jim Russell & Mollie Horseman, 1932 From 1946 she worked for The Courier-Mail at the paper's Sydney Production Unit in York Street. Following the suicide of cartoonist, Jean Cullen, Horseman took responsibility for Cullen's new comic strip, \\"Pam\\" in the Sunday Mail and \\"The Clothes Horse\\" in The Sydney Morning Herald. \\"Pam\\" became Horseman's best-known work, running for over eleven years and becoming widely syndicated. In 1957 she moved to Avalon, a northern beachside suburb of Sydney, with her five children, where she remained until 1967. During the early 1960s Horseman was the staff artist at Everybody's. Her illustrations (either anonymous or signed \\"Vanessa\\") included a weekly full-page colour cartoon of the \\"Sexy Man\\" type and the serial Girl Crusoe (1964), a parody of the popular 'good girl cheesecake' comic. In 1963 Everybody's hailed her (somewhat inaccurately) as 'Australia's only woman cartoonist', although she was definitely the best known. Between 1967-69 she returned to Brisbane, where she illustrated books for Jacaranda Press. She then moved to the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, continuing to undertake freelance work and painting landscapes. She was hit by a car in 1973, which led to a stroke paralysing her right hand. As a result, she taught herself to draw with her left hand. Horseman died at the age of sixty-two in the Blue Mountains Hospital, Katoomba on 7 May 1974, and was buried at St Thomas's Church in Mulgoa.

He made many first ascents and other climbs in the Alps during his career. He is best known for his ascents as a guide for Geoffrey Winthrop Young. Early life and family Josef Knubel was born in 1881 at St. Niklaus, Switzerland. His father was Peter Knubel , a mountain guide and carpenter; the Knubel family were collectively well-known for their mountaineering skills. Mountaineering career Knubel began climbing mountains at a young age, and climbed the Matterhorn for the first time in 1896, at fifteen years old, with his father and a client. His first major client was Oliver Perry-Smith, an American climber who hired Knubel to guide him through the Alps in 1903; together, they ascended the Matterhorn, Wellenkuppe, Zinalrothorn, Weisshorn, Lyskamm, Ober Gabelhorn, Dent Blanche, and Täschhorn. Knubel became an official mountain guide in 1904 upon receiving his guide's licence, while continuing to work as a stonemason and tree feller. His mountaineering skills were noticed by British climber Geoffrey Winthrop Young, who hired Knubel as his guide. From 1906 to 1914, Young and Knubel climbed together each summer, making a number of first ascents together, including the Täschhorn's south face, the Weisshorn's southeast and northeast faces, the Rimpfischhorn and Zinalrothorn's east faces, the Gspaltenhorn's west face, Grandes Jorasses' west ridge, and Mont Brouillard. The route the two mapped out to reach the summit of Aiguille du Plan in 1907 is still the route used by most alpine climbers today. On Young's first ascent of the east face of the Aiguille du Grépon with several other climbers and Knubel and Henri Brocherel as guides in 1911, Knubel used an ice axe instead of a piton to clear an overhang; the spot was thereafter known as \\"The Knubel Crack\\". Knubel was taught to ski by Arnold Lunn and later began to use skis while traversing mountain ranges. In February 1920, Knubel and Marcel Kurz, using skis, made the first winter ascents of the Wellenkuppe, Ober Gabelhorn, Schallihorn, and Täschhorn. He became an authorised ski-guide in 1925. Throughout his career, he made over 800 ascents of Alpine peaks higher than (\\"four-thousanders\\") and led around 120 clients. Later life and death Knubel was forced to end his climbing career by a knee injury sustained while climbing the Ortler. He died at Visp on 31 May 1961 after undergoing abdominal surgery—related to an episode of appendicitis earlier in his life—and was buried at his hometown of St. Niklaus.

The collection also includes manuscripts, maps, newspaper clippings, and academic work related to Lane County. In addition, the museum has continued to display memorable favorites like one of the most complete prairie schooners that crossed the country on the Oregon Trail in 1851, as well as a hemlock section with a carving made in 1867, and the original staircase from the 1898 county courthouse.  History  = Early days, 1937–1950 = Lane County legislator E. O. Potter sponsored a bill approved by the Oregon legislature, authorizing establishment of county history museums. The \\"Lane County Pioneer Museum and Veterans Memorial Commission\\" was established in 1935, with Cal Young, known as \\"Mr. Lane County\\", as chair. Young had led Lane County's \\"Oregon Trail Pageant\\" since 1926, with historical costumes, ox teams, and covered wagons on parade annually. He had also collected a number of artifacts at his farm from pioneer days of the previous century, including a prairie schooner. By 1937, F. L. Chambers and E. G. Boehnke arranged a property trade with the federal government—land for a new post office site, in exchange for the old post office building to house the county's history museum. Pioneer relics were stored in the basement of the old post office, but other federal agencies needed offices during the war years, so the space was never used as a museum. In 1951, the first Lane County History Museum, described as \\"a small warehouse museum\\", , was built at the Lane County Fairgrounds to house the growing collection of pioneer relics. By 1954, to display big logging wheels, the museum added a shed, and a covered passage for other vehicles. In 1957 the oldest building in Lane County, the Lane County Clerk's Building was move to the site. Cal Young became the caretaker for the first few years; when he announced, \\"I'm getting too old for this museum business\\", Mrs. E. E. Foss was named the first curator of the museum. = 1950–1999 = By the early 1950s, the Lane County Pioneer Society was established to support the museum's development. To compensate for budget cuts due to a recession in the early 1980s, Friends of the Lane County Historical Museum formed in 1984 as a non- profit organization to keep the museum alive. By 1985, funding (and staffing) had been partially restored. By 1987, county officials had considered funding a $30,000 study on whether to build a \\"Forest Heritage Center\\" that would incorporate the museum's collection with exhibits on forestry management, logging, and milling. The estimated cost of such a center was $3-to-$4 million; neither the study nor the center was funded. Four years later, even as the museum was characterized by a local reporter as \\"perennially short of operating revenues and staff\\", the county administrator proposed cutting a third of the museum's $170,000 operating budget. Intense lobbying of the county's budget committee resulted in partial restoration of the museum's budget, with the provision that \\"the organization come up with a plan to wean the museum from the general fund\\". Museum supporters advocated use of the county's car rental tax and room tax funds to restore the museum's funding. By 1996, Lane County contracted with the newly formed Lane County Historical Society (LCHS) to manage the museum, subsidized by part of the county's Transient Room Tax designated for tourism promotion. = 2000–present = In 2003, Lane County Historical Society board hired its current director, Bob Hart, with plans to focus on enlarging the facility and updating the exhibits. In March 2006, the merger of the Lane County Historical Society with the Friends of the Lane County Historical Society was finalized. Under Hart's direction, the museum has displayed exhibits on a broad range of modern history topics, such as the history of local law enforcement, \\"Tie Dye & Tofu\\", \\"Weird and Wonderful\\", wine, medical history, logging, contemporary Native American culture, and most recently toys. The museum has also developed interactive outreach presentations such as a \\"Hands-on U.S. History Traveling Trunk\\" targeting school children in grades four through twelve, \\"McKenzie River Stories\\", which invited guests to record their own stories about the county's main water source, and special events where Director Bob Hart played historical figures Thomas Condon or Joseph Meek. The museum began digitizing its collection of 300,000 historic photos in 2009, making them available online. A special selection of curated images is also available for browsing. The museum's subsidy was reduced in 2008 to allow greater county support for Lane County Parks, and was reduced again in 2010, from over $210,000 annually to just over $182,000. In 2012, additional budget cuts required layoffs of three museum employees, whose work Hart said would be covered by recruiting ten additional volunteers. Even with the continuing budget cuts, the museum staff has formed collaborations and extended help to other local museums, and the LCHS and museum were awarded a stewardship certificate for loaning a part- time curator to the Springfield Museum. LCHS has as yet been unsuccessful in its quest to either enlarge the current quarters of the museum or to relocate it in another facility. When the downtown Eugene Post Office became available in 2010, Hart not only supported its preservation, he reminded the county of the historic claim the Lane County Historic Museum had on the previous post office property. Use of the vacant Post Office building for a new museum was eventually supported by Mayor Kitty Piercy in her state of the city address in 2013. The museum is currently undergoing a number of updates, including exterior renovations and complete exhibit overhauls in their present building.

Abstract: \\"In this article, the history of the Italian Operations Research Society-Optimization and Decision Sciences is presented. It was founded in 1961 and is still very active at the national and international level.\\" The society is recognized by the International Federation of Operational Research Societies and its subgrouping, the Association of European Operational Research Societies, as the main national society for Operations Research in its country.Member societies: Italy, IFORS, retrieved 2015-02-23. AIRO is part of FIMA, the Italian Federation of Applied Mathematics.  History  AIRO was created in 1961. with the aim of promoting the development of Operations Research and mathematical programming in Italy, both from a methodological point and an applied research point of views. The recognition of the role and the professional qualification of the operation researchers and the promotion of relationships between operations researchers, inside and outside Italy, are strategic goals of AIRO. Since 1961 the society has had the following presidents: * Benedetto Barberi (1961-1970) * Armando Corso (1971-1975) * Bruno Martinoli (1976-1982) * Massimo Merlino (1983-1988) * Paolo Toth (1989-1995) * Giorgio Gallo (1996-2001) * Roberto Tadei (2002-2006) * Renato De Leone (2007-2011) * Anna Sciomachen (2012-2015) * Daniele Vigo (2016-2019) * Dario Pacciarelli (2020-)  Governance  AIRO is governed by a president, four-year term, which manages the association with the Council, consisting of about 15 councilors elected by the assembly of the members: 12 elected members, the President, and for one year the President Elect. Among the elected member the council chooses one or two vice presidents, a treasurer and a secretary. On a proposal of the members, within AIRO some thematic sections can be formed, based on either geographical or methodological and application affinity. The headquarters of AIRO is at the Institute of system analysis and informatics “Antonio Ruberti” (IASI, CNR) in Rome.  Membership  Currently (2020), AIRO has about 250 members – individuals (professors and researches from university and research institutions and professionals) and institutions from academia, industry and administration.  Publications  Jointly with the Belgian Society for Operations Research and the French Operations Research Society, AIRO publishes 4OR - A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, in which methodological and applied papers are published as well as surveys on relevant topics in the field of operations research. The society's publisher is Springer. The 2015 Impact Factor of the journal is 1.371. The AIRO Springer Series, started in 2018, publishes contributed volumes resulting from conferences and other activities carried out by AIRO. From 1970 to 2002, AIRO was responsible for the publication of the scientific journal Ricerca Operativa. Since 2005 AIRO is federated with two national societies in the mathematics area, SIMAI and AMASES, into the FIMA (Italian Federation of Applied Mathematics). From the beginning of 2014 AIRO is involved in the Maddmaths project, a web-site finalized to the dissemination of mathematical education. In particular, AIRO collaborates in the preparation of informative articles, sent via email as madd-letters to interested people.  Conferences  Once a year in September, AIRO organizes the international conference ODS (Optimization and Decision Sciences), attended by about 200 participants. In addition, the AIROYOUNG chapter of AIRO organizes a winter workshop, usually in February, attended by about 70 participants.

It originally aired on October 13, 2011. The episode was written by Michael Narducci and directed by John Behring. Plot Elena (Nina Dobrev), Caroline (Candice Accola), Bonnie (Kat Graham), Tyler (Michael Trevino) and Matt (Zach Roerig) along with other senior students are at the school when Klaus (Joseph Morgan) arrives and gets Elena. He explains that because she is not dead, he cannot create the hybrid army he always wanted and now he wants Bonnie to fix this. Klaus feeds Tyler his blood and kills him, saying that if Bonnie does not find how to fix the mistake that was created by Elena staying alive, Tyler will wake up in transition but he will die. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) is on the road with Katherine but pulls over and demands to know where they are going. Katherine reveals that Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) is unconscious in the trunk of the car. She explains that her old friend, Pearl (Kelly Hu), knew a vampire hunter who knows how to kill Klaus. Pearl never told Katherine who the vampire hunter was but she is sure she told her daughter, Anna (Malese Jow). Damon reminds her that both of them are dead; she explains that Jeremy is the key to contact them since he can see and talk to Anna’s ghost. Stefan (Paul Wesley) tries to save Elena by telling Klaus that she means nothing to him. Klaus compels Stefan to obey him and then asks him to kill the two students in front of Elena. Meanwhile, Rebekah (Claire Holt) is with Caroline and Tyler and is looking at the pictures on Caroline’s phone. In one of them, she sees that Elena is wearing her necklace and shows it to Klaus but Elena tells them that Katherine stole it. As a reaction to the news, Klaus gives Bonnie twenty minutes to find the solution, or Stefan will feed on Elena. Bonnie and Matt try to contact Jeremy to help them with contacting the dead witches but as Katherine has Jeremy's phone, they do not get an answer. Matt has the idea that if he dies and comes back, he will be able to talk to Vicki and find out the answer Klaus needs. He jumps in the swimming pool and drowns; when Bonnie finds him, she starts CPR while Matt sees and talks to Vicki. When he comes back, he tells Bonnie that the doppelganger has to die in order for the transition to complete successfully. They do not want to tell Klaus but he overhears their conversation. The time for Stefan runs out. Knowing he will not be able to resist Klaus’ compulsion, he asks Elena to run. Elena tries to convince him that he can resist it because he loves her but with no result, so she runs away and Stefan starts chasing her. Klaus finds Elena and takes her to Stefan. Klaus is impressed that Stefan did not kill her and compels Stefan to turn off his humanity as it is what holds him back. Tyler wakes up and after few minutes begins to feel unwell. Klaus arrives with Elena’s blood, saying that as the Original Witch said that Elena has to die, then it is exactly the opposite that has to happen. He knows that the Original Witch hates him and she would never tell him the truth. He gives Tyler Elena’s blood to drink and Tyler completes his transition to hybrid successfully. Meanwhile, Anna refuses to help and Damon, trying to make her talk, hits Jeremy. Anna reveals the name of the vampire hunter: Mikael (Sebastian Roché), who is also a vampire. She warns that they should not wake him because he will kill everyone. Damon sees a text from Bonnie about Klaus being in Mystic Falls and he goes back, leaving Jeremy with Katherine to find Mikael. To be able to make more hybrids, Klaus takes more of Elena’s blood. Damon tells Klaus that he and Katherine found Mikael, have awakened him and that by now, he knows where Klaus is. Klaus runs away with Elena’s blood and Damon takes Elena home. Stefan also gets back home telling them that Klaus asked him to keep a watch on Elena till he comes back. The episode ends with Katherine and Jeremy finding Mikael chained in a tomb.

Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- rating saying that the episode was full of twists and surprises and the best episode of the season so far. \\"Character dynamics were shifted in ways likely to resonate for the rest of the season, if not beyond. [...] One great thing about The Vampire Diaries is its willingness to let characters truly evolve and transform, while still managing to maintain the core characteristics that defined them in the first place. If any other show suddenly made their romantic lead a psychotic killer, it might be worrisome. With this show, I’m simply happy to be taken along for the ride.\\" Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 4/4 saying that it was pivotal, fast-paced and filled with epic moments. \\"The writing in this episode leaves a number of opportunities for nitpicking, but the brisk pace, the performances, and the overall execution more than compensate for any script shortcomings. Much of the episode left me breathless, squealing \\"Oh my god!\\" like a 13-year-old at a slumber party.\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.8/5 stating that after this week's episode, Matt was not the only one needing CPR. \\"What an incredible episode of The Vampire Diaries. Consider, Klaus apprehended Elena, compelled Stefan and snapped Tyler's neck; while Matt drowned himself, Katherine kidnapped Jeremy and the rising seniors took some serious TP to the school hallways. And all that happened in the first 30 minutes.\\" Diana Steenbergen of IGN rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying that it was a twisty- turny episode that \\"delivered some shocking developments, although it occasionally relied a little too heavily on characters making leaps in logic. The episode felt a bit disjointed at times, but it was so quick moving on so many levels that it is hard to complain about that too much.\\" E. Reagan from The TV Chick gave a good review to the episode saying that it was another stellar one. \\"There was some great one liners that helped to really pace this tension filled episode.\\" Caroline Preece of Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode saying that season 3 exploded back into life, with one of its best-ever episodes.\\"Counting the interesting and important things that happen in this episode would be a long job, but when wondering what's been resolved or tied up you might realise how much more could lie ahead. The Reckoning is not only an outstanding hour of television, but it could signal many more just like it in the weeks ahead.\\" Emma Fraser from TV Overmind also gave a good review to the episode saying that it was awesome. \\"There are not enough words to praise this episode and how consistently good The Vampire Diaries is; week after week more story and sometimes new characters get added without feeling bogged down.\\" References External links * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 3) episodes ","title":"The Reckoning (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"44635115","text":"The Moose Gustav Grönåsens Älgpark (English: Grönåsens Moosepark) is a Swedish zoo in Kosta, Lessebo kommun i Kronobergs län, in Sweden.

The 257th episode overall, it was written and directed by series co-creator and co-star Trey Parker. The episode premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on December 10, 2014. It is the second part of the two-part season finale which began with the previous episode, \\"#REHASH\\". The episode makes multiple references to earlier episodes over the season, as well as to previous seasons, while mainly lampooning the trend of culture constantly making trending topics with no actual relevance. It also lampoons news events such as the death of Eric Garner, the shooting of Michael Brown, the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby, the use of celebrity holograms, and generationism. YouTuber PewDiePie appeared as himself, continuing his story line from the previous episode. Plot Continuing from the previous episode, \\"#REHASH\\", Kyle Broflovski laments how his younger brother Ike's generation's preoccupation with trending topics and Let's Play videos has led him to be seen as an out- of-touch \\"grandpa\\" by younger kids. Kyle sends out a Twitter message to help families come together. In response, Bill Cosby appears at Kyle's home to invite him to participate in a television special to be watched by families together. Kyle agrees, but after Cosby leaves, he is revealed to be a hologram. Randy and Sharon Marsh go to the police to report about the hologram of Randy created by his ex-manager to replace his stage persona Lorde, but the police are skeptical. Meanwhile, a patrolman brings in the rogue Michael Jackson hologram, but despite the fact that the patrolman says he shot the hologram and used a chokehold on him, the hologram's light skin and features present a problem for the police, as they can only use such harsh tactics on black people. The television special will feature various celebrities, holograms of deceased celebrities, and LP commentary by Eric Cartman. The special is the brainchild of Randy's ex-producer and Cartman. The producer's staff, however, feel he has given too much power to Cartman, whose growing popularity results in his commentary window appearing not only on computers and other devices, but in thin air throughout the episode. Upon seeing a TV commercial for the special, Kyle is angered that his idea has been turned into a social media project, while his best friend, Stan Marsh, is upset because he thinks his father, Randy, is performing again as Lorde. Randy and the Jackson hologram learn about the television special and its intent, and agree to work together to stop it. When the Tupac Shakur hologram sent to capture the Jackson hologram appears at the police station, Randy and the Jackson hologram flee to the Marsh home. Randy then learns that Stan and Kyle have been taken hostage by his ex-producer, and is confronted by the Shakur hologram in his home. When Kyle asks the producer why he is doing this, the producer explains that when he became a grandfather, one day he asked his grandson who his favorite celebrity was, and his grandson said it was PewDiePie. Bewildered that his grandson worshiped an insignificant Internet personality, and was unimpressed with anyone to whom he tried to introduce him, the producer says that with the television special, he will assimilate the younger generation's culture into his own. Stan is astonished that the producer is \\"such a grandpa\\". The Shakur hologram and the Jackson hologram decide to team up against the producer. When Cartman's window appears before the producer, he tries to have him shut down, but Cartman is trending so much and has grown so powerful that he has reached \\"trend-scendence\\". As Cartman continues to appear on screens all around the world, he states that he is now \\"trends-gender\\" and therefore must be given his own bathroom, which was his motivation for being involved in this plan. The Shakur and Jackson holograms appear at the restaurant where the producer is hiding with the hostages. As Jackson fatally shoots the producer, Kyle, realizing that everyone on the planet can see everyone else on their computers, speaks out to his brother, Ike, apologizing for being a \\"grandpa\\". He accepts that Ike will develop his own generational interests, and admits that he was merely sore that Ike was a fan of Cartman in particular. He says that he just wants to be a family again. Ike and his friends resolve to get the public to \\"believe\\" again, and create a new trend which Kyle, breaking the fourth wall, urges the home audience to spread. In response, PewDiePie's window appears, and his commentary is so powerful that Cartman's window is eliminated. In an epilogue, Kyle says he managed to get their family to use the living room again for one hour each night, though Stan is still confused over the events that have just concluded. Kyle suggests that perhaps they are not going to understand it, and further says that at least YouTube celebrities are authentic, and have not been marketed to the public by corporations. PewDiePie's window then appears, and he thanks South Park for being on his show. Production The episode contains numerous references to previous episodes in the series, mostly in connection to Randy Marsh's double life as Lorde. Customer service employee \\"Steve\\" returns from \\"Grounded Vindaloop\\", as does the Washington Redskins logo from \\"Go Fund Yourself\\", while Cartman's desire for his own bathroom is from \\"The Cissy\\". On the DVD audio commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, in hindsight, thought the story would have been better off split up into three episodes and not two, mainly because there was a lot of content left that they wanted to use but not enough time. The original plan was to make the story three episodes long but they settled for two. The episode makes numerous references to the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, as well as the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby. Reception The episode received a B rating from The A.V.

It was formerly called cuprodescloizite or psittacinite (this mineral characterized in 1868 by Frederick Augustus Genth). Duhamelite is a calcium- and bismuth-bearing variety of mottramite, typically with acicular habit. Mottramite is a member of the adelite-descloizite group. Mottramite, which is a copper rich member, forms a series with descloizite, which is a zinc rich member. These two minerals usually contain significant percentages of both copper and zinc and are seldom pure. Mottramite also forms a series with duftite. It was discovered in 1876 and named for the locality, Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, England, where ore was stockpiled, although it was probably mined from Pim Hill Mine, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England.Kingsbury and Hartley (1956). New occurrences of vanadium minerals (mottramite, descloizite, (discredited) and vanadinite) in the Caldbeck area of Cumberland. Mineralogical Magazine 31:289  Crystallography  Mottramite is an orthorhombic mineral belonging to the crystal class 2/m 2/m 2/m, with space group Pnma. The unit cell has sides of lengths a = 7.6 to 7.7 Å, b = 9.2 to 9.5 Å and c = 6.0 to 6.1 Å.Van der Westhuizen, de Bruiyn, Tordiffe and Botha (1986). The descloizite-mottramite series of vanadates from the Otavi Mountain Land, South West Africa: an X-ray study. Mineralogical Magazine 50:137 There are four formula units per unit cell (Z = 4), the molar mass is 402.69 g and the calculated density is 6.19 g/cm3. The structure is composed of chains of edge-sharing CuO6 octahedra and very distorted Pb(O,OH)8 polyhedra linked through VO4 groups into a tight three-dimensional network.  Appearance  Drusy crusts of tiny intergrown crystals are common, also encrustations and mammillary or botryoidal surfaces. The crystals are equant dipyramids or prisms parallel to the c crystal axis, but always microscopic. The colour is various shades of green, yellow-green, blackish brown or nearly black. Crystals often grow step by step, with the different steps or zones having different colours. The streak is yellowish green, or yellow, and the crystals are transparent to opaque, with a greasy lustre.

The mineral is brittle and breaks with a subconchoidal to uneven fracture. It is quite soft, with Mohs hardness 3 to , just a little harder than calcite. The hardness is slightly greater on crystal surfaces. It is a heavy mineral, with specific gravity 5.9, because of the lead content. It is readily soluble in acids.  Optical properties  Orthorhombic crystals (and triclinic and monoclinic crystals) have two directions in which light travels with zero birefringence; these directions are called the optic axes, and the crystal is said to be biaxial. The speed of a ray of light travelling through the crystal differs with direction. The direction of the fastest ray is called the X direction and the direction of the slowest ray is called the Z direction. X and Z are perpendicular to each other, and a third direction Y is defined as perpendicular to both X and Z; light travelling along Y has an intermediate speed. Refractive index is inversely proportional to speed, so the refractive indices for the X, Y and Z directions increase from X to Z.Klein and Hurlbut (1993) Manual of Mineralogy 21st Edition. Wiley For mottramite the orientation with respect to the crystal axes a, b and c is X = c, Y = b and Z = a. The refractive indices are nα = 2.170(2), nβ = 2.260(2) and nγ = 2.320(2). The maximum birefringence δ is the difference between the highest and lowest refractive index; for mottramite δ = 0.150. The angle between the two optic axes is called the optic angle, 2V, and it is always acute, and bisected either by X or by Z. If Z is the bisector then the crystal is said to be positive, and if X is the bisector it is said to be negative. Mottramite is usually biaxial (–), and rarely biaxial (+). The measured value of 2V is 73°. Also 2V can be calculated from the values of the refractive indices, giving a value of 46°, which differs considerably from the measured value. 2V depends on the refractive indices, but refractive index varies with wavelength, and hence with colour. So 2V also depends on the colour, and is different for red and for violet light. This effect is called dispersion of the optic axes, or just dispersion (not to be confused with chromatic dispersion). If 2V is greater for red light than for violet light the dispersion is designated r > v, and vice versa. For mottramite dispersion is strong, usually with r > v, and rarely with r < v. The mineral is pleochroic; when viewed along the X or Y direction it appears canary yellow to greenish yellow and when viewed along the Z direction it appears brownish yellow.  Occurrence  The type locality is Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, England, UK and type material is conserved at the Natural History Museum, London 52314-52315. Mottramite is a secondary, supergene mineral found principally in the oxidized zones of vanadium bearing base metal deposits, especially sandstones. Associated minerals are descloizite, duftite, mimetite, wulfenite, cerussite, azurite and dioptase.  Localities  * Australia, Kintore open cut: Mottramite is the only secondary mineral with essential vanadium recorded from the Kintore open cut, Broken Hill, Yancowinna County, New South Wales. It has been found scattered on greenish to yellowish drusy plumbogummite - hinsdalite as tiny black glossy pyramids or aggregates of dull black, flattened bipyramids up to 0.4 mm across.Australian Journal of Mineralogy (1997) 3-1:66 * Australia, Braeside Station: Braeside station is in the Gregory Ranges District, Shire of East Pilbara, Western Australia. Both mottramite and descloizite are common in the central part of the Braeside field. They occur with vanadinite, pyromorphite and cerussite. Descloizite- mottramite was the last to crystallise showing a variety of colours and habits. These include yellow-orange drusy or botryoidal opaque crusts on chalcedony, brown, olive or yellow flaky wedge-shaped transparent crystals up to 100 micrometres wide that form rosettes in association with coronadite and hemimorphite, and short prismatic and bipyramidal green crystals that form a 10 to 15 micrometre thick crust on quartz.Australian Journal of Mineralogy (2007) 13-2:59 * Australia, Shangri La: At Shangri La, Kununurra, Wyndham-East Kimberley Shire, Western Australia, green to brown mottramite forms thin botryoidal crusts of fine-grained, platy crystals on quartz and iron oxides, and may be associated with vanadinite. Some crusts have a radiating internal texture and show a variation in composition from mottramite at their core, to descloizite at their rim. Mottramite generally grew at the same time as vanadinite.Australian Journal of Mineralogy (2011) 16-1:21-22 * Morocco, Bou Azer: Mottramite is the only vanadium mineral known from the Bou Azer district, Tazenakht, Ouarzazate Province, Souss-Massa-Draâ Region, Morocco. It has been found as tiny dark brown resinous crystals on a single piece of heavily altered galena. The specimen shows secondary mineralisation containing mimetite and possibly wulfenite.The Mineralogical Record (2007) 38-5:384 * Russia, Berezovskoe Gold Deposit: Mottramite has been found at the Berezovskoe gold deposit, Berezovskii, Ekaterinburg, Sverdlovskaya Oblast', in the Middle Urals. It was found in a quartz vein, in a cavity containing galena, tetrahedrite and tennantite, with associated bushmakinite, cerussite, bindheimite, vauquelinite and pyromorphite.The Mineralogical Record (2004) 35-2:175 * United Kingdom, Caldbeck Fells: Mottramite occurs at several localities in the Caldbeck Fells, Allerdale, Cumbria, England. * Caldbeck Fells, Arm O’Grain: A variety of supergene minerals occur as microscopic crystals at Arm O'Grain, Caldbeck Fells. These include mimetite, pyromorphite, vanadinite, duftite, plumbogummite and beudantite, as well as mottramite . Mottramite is the commonest of them. It occurs as black elongated boat shaped crystals up to about one mm long, scattered over white vein quartz. Occasionally, crusts of mottramite occur in cavities in the quartz that appear to have been formed by the dissolution of baryte. Mottramite was almost certainly produced by oxidation of galena.Journal of the Russell Society (2006) 9:44-53 * Caldbeck Fells, Brandy Gill: Mottramite has been reported from Brandy Gill, Carrock Fell, Caldbeck Fells as minute yellowish green globular aggregates associated with bayldonite, malachite and mimetite, and as olive-green pyramidal crystals associated with bayldonite, beaverite and beudantite. The primary sulfide minerals at Brandy Gill are galena, chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite. * Caldbeck Fells, Short Grain: Mottramite is quite common at Short Grain, Deer Hills, Caldbeck Fells. It usually occurs as thin druses of yellow or dark greenish brown crusts associated with pyromorphite or baryte. Less commonly it occurs as bipyramids on quartz. The crystals are inconspicuous and rarely exceed 0.1 mm. It is sometimes associated with chrysocolla. Most mottramite contains some arsenic substituting for vanadium, so there is a gradation toward vanadium-rich duftite.Journal of the Russell Society (2009)12:57 * Caldbeck Fells, Ingray Gill: Minute drusy yellow to yellow-brown mottramite crusts made up of characteristic boat-shaped crystals a few tens of micrometres across cover specimens from the mine dump at Ingray Gill, Caldbeck Fells. Mottramite encrusts mimetite and white to pale green pyromorphite epimorphs after galena. It is one of the most common supergene minerals at Ingray Gill, but because of its colour and habit it is easily mistaken for pyromorphite or mimetite.Journal of the Russell Society (2009) 12:38 * Caldbeck Fells, Low Pike: Several supergene minerals including bayldonite, beudantite, brochantite, cornwallite, duftite, malachite, mimetite, philipsburgite and pseudomalachite as well as mottramite occur in thin fractures in quartz at Low Pike, Caldbeck Fells.Journal of the Russell Society (2003) 8(1):43-44 * Caldbeck Fells, Balliway Rigg: Mottramite is rare at Balliway Rigg. It has been found as minute olive green pyramidal crystals on hemimorphite and chrysocolla and as scattered yellow to yellow-brown blocky crystals on lavender-blue plumbogummite. It also occurs as minute brown pyramidal crystals on green pyromorphite. The largest crystals are a few tenths of a millimetre across.Journal of the Russell Society (2008) 11:19 * Caldbeck Fells, Brae Fell Mine: Mottramite is quite common on the mine dump at Brae Fell Mine, Roughton Gill, Caldbeck Fells, as coatings of minute rice-grain shaped crystals less than 0.1 mm long on quartz. The crystals are dark brown to buff in colour, often associated with pyromorphite, and occasionally associated with cerussite.Journal of the Russell Society (2006) 9:39-44 * Caldbeck Fells, Sandbed Mine: A yellow-brown crust on samples from the dumps of the Sandbed mine has been identified as mottramite.Journal of the Russell Society (2006) 9:2-38 * US, Brown Monster Mine and Reward Mine: Mottramite is relatively common at the Brown Monster Mine and Reward Mine, Russ District, Inyo County, California. It forms pale yellow-green to tan, brick-red and chocolate brown botryoidal crusts, commonly associated with mimetite and wulfenite, or with dark reddish-brown vanadinite.The Mineralogical Record (2010) 41-2:189 * US, Otto Mountain: At Otto Mountain, Baker, San Bernardino County, California, mottramite is generally seen as crusts of botryoidal green to olive-green spheres in association with white vanadinite needles.Rocks & Minerals (2011) 86-2:132  References  Category:Vanadate minerals Category:Copper(II) minerals Category:Lead minerals Category:Descloizite group Category:Orthorhombic minerals ","title":"Mottramite"},{"id":"44635160","text":"Allen-Mangum House is a historic plantation house and national historic district located near Grissom, Granville County, North Carolina.

Dispersion polymerization is a type of precipitation polymerization, meaning the solvent selected as the reaction medium is a good solvent for the monomer and the initiator, but is a non-solvent for the polymer. As the polymerization reaction proceeds, particles of polymer form, creating a non-homogeneous solution. In dispersion polymerization these particles are the locus of polymerization, with monomer being added to the particle throughout the reaction. In this sense, the mechanism for polymer formation and growth has features similar to that of emulsion polymerization. With typical precipitation polymerization, the continuous phase (the solvent solution) is the main locus of polymerization, which is the main difference between precipitation and dispersion. Polymerization mechanism SEM-Picture of PMMA-particles fabricated by dispersion polymerization after drying / removal of the organic liquid phase (cyclohexane) At the onset of polymerization, polymers remain in solution until they reach a critical molecular weight (MW), at which point they precipitate. These initial polymer particles are unstable and coagulate with other particles until stabilized particles form. After this point in the polymerization, growth only occurs by addition of monomer to the stabilized particles. As the polymer particles grow, stabilizer (or dispersant) molecules attach covalently to the surface. These stabilizer molecules are generally graft or block copolymers, and can be preformed or can form in situ during the reaction. Typically, one side of the stabilizer copolymer has an affinity for the solvent while the other side has an affinity for the polymer particle being formed. These molecules play a crucial role in dispersion polymerization by forming a “hairy layer” around the particles that prevents particle coagulation. This controls size and colloidal stability of the particles in the reaction system. The driving force for the particle separation is steric hindrance between the outward-facing tails of the stabilizer layers. Dispersion polymerization can produce nearly monodisperse polymer particles of 0.1–15 micrometers (µm). This is important because it fills the gap between particle size generated by conventional emulsion polymerization (0.006–0.7 µm) in batch process and that of suspension polymerization (50–1000 µm). Applications Particles produced by dispersion polymerization are used in a wide variety of applications. Toners, instrument calibration standards, chromatography column packing materials, liquid crystal display spacers, and biomedical and biochemical analysis all use these micron- size monodisperse particles, particles which were hard to come by before the development of dispersion polymerization methods. The dispersions are also used as surface coatings. Unlike solution coatings, dispersion coatings have viscosities that are independent of polymer MW. The viscosities of dispersions are advantageously lower than those of solutions with practical polymer levels. This allows for easier application of the coating. One dispersion polymerization system being studied is the use of supercritical liquid carbon dioxide (scCO2) as a solvent. Because of its unique solvent properties, supercritical CO2 is an ideal medium for dispersion polymerization for many soluble-monomer with insoluble-polymer systems. For example, polymers can be separated by releasing the high pressure under which the scCO2 is held. This process is more efficient than typical drying processes. Also, the principles of dispersion polymerization with scCO2 follows principles of green chemistry: low solvent toxicity, low waste, efficient atom economy, and avoidance of purification steps.

He is generally counted as the thirty-fourth in the list of 63 Nayanars. He was a crypto-Hindu posing as a Buddhist, practicing Shaivam in secrecy. He was reported to have worshipped Lord Shiva, his patron god, by hurling stones at his iconography. Hagiographical account The life of Sakkiya Nayanar is described in the Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Sakkiya is one of the six Nayanars from the region of Tondai Nadu and lived around the time the Pallava dynasty ruled the area. He is considered a historical figure from the 6th century CE, pre-dating Appar Tirunavukkarasar and Sambandar, both dating from the 7th century CE. Sakkiya Nayanar was born in the rural village of Tiru Changa Mangai, modern-day Sangaramangai, Nagapattinam District, Tamil Nadu, India. The village at the time was dominated by Tamil Buddhists, followers and contemporaries of the Pallava prince Bodhidharma. Religious tensions were strife during this period, with attacks on Hindus being a regular occurrence. Sakkiya and his family were agricultural land owners from a Hindu Vellalar background, albeit they did become assimilated for their own safety and started posing as Buddhists. In keeping in line with the rest of the Buddhist populace as well as being legitimately interested in spirituality, he went to Kanchipuram and studied at a monastery, eventually becoming a Buddhist monk (Bhikshu). Sakkiya was well-versed in Buddhist theology and philosophy. This is also the origination of his name Sakkiya, a Tamil derivation of Shakya, the name of the clan of the Buddha belonged to. However, Buddhism did not relinquish his thirst for knowledge and enlightenment. So, he embraced Shaivism, however, he did not give up the garb of a Buddhist monk and continued to dress in saffron garments as he was convinced that external appearances did not matter for self-realization. Sakkiya then realised that Shaivism was the true path to salvation and became a devotee of the god Shiva, eventually accepting Shaivism. He realised that the Shaiva philosophy of \\"the deed, doer, its effect and the controller of the effect\\" was the most accurate and Shiva was the Truth he was seeking. Sakkiya commenced the worship of the Lingam, Shiva's aniconic symbol. One day, he unconsciously threw a stone at the lingam with great devotion. The next day, Sakkiya felt that it was Shiva's divine wish that he worship Shiva by throwing a stone a day at the lingam as an offering. Sakkiya realized that God will accept any offering which is offered to him with great devotion. Sakkiya would not have food without throwing a stone at the lingam daily. Once, Sakkiya forgot his daily stone worship and was about to partake food. However, he remembered his daily duty and unmindful of hunger, rushed to the temple and threw a pebble at the lingam. Pleased, Shiva appeared before him, blessed him and took him to Kailash, the god's eternal abode. Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. One of the most prominent Nayanars, Appar Tirunavukkarasar (7th century) alludes Sakkiya in a hymn to Shiva where deeds of various saints are recalled. The hymn says how Shiva made Sakkiya worship Him by throwing a stone before having his kanji (porridge) and abandon the eating of rice. Shiva also granted Sakkiya to do service as a Shaivite Sakkiya Nayanar is depicted with a top-knot or flowing matted hair and with folded hands (see Anjali mudra). A holy day in his honour is observed on the twenty-sixth day of the Tamil month of Margazhi, generally coincides with 10 January. The moon enters the Pūrva Ashādhā nakshatra (lunar mansion) on this day. He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals.

It is the leading UK importer of shotguns, rifles and rifle ammunition and also distributes other shooting related products. Many of the brands it represents are market leaders in the UK. GMK Ltd (previously Gunmark until January 1998) is a privately owned enterprise which commenced trading in 1971 and has been continuously owned and managed by the Waktare family. Founded by Bjorn Waktare, he was then joined by his sons, Karl and Oskar, in 1994 and 1996, respectively. They now head the company following Bjorn’s retirement in 1998. In 2005, Beretta, the major supplier to GMK bought 20% of the company. In March 2013, Beretta increased their share of the business to 60%. The remaining 40% continues to be owned by the Waktare family.  History  Bjorn Waktare moved from Sweden to the UK and founded Gunmark, in 1971. The company exclusively imported and distributed foreign goods. In 1977 Gunmark was appointed Beretta distributor for the UK and quickly developed Beretta into one of two leading shotgun brands in the UK market. The company worked hard to diversify their business and introduced many new products on to the UK market. In 1989 they became distributors for the luxury rubber boot brand Le Chameau, which grew to become their second largest brand after Beretta. Le Chameau was purchased by Lafuma Group SA in the early 1990s. In the mid 1990s a new UK Sales Manager was appointed for Le Chameau, to spearhead the move into non- shooting country-wear stores. It was this move which prompted the change of name from Gunmark Ltd to GMK Ltd. Having recruited his two sons into the business, Waktare moved to the South of France in 1998, making Karl Waktare managing director at the age of 31 and Oskar Waktare, finance director at 28. In 2000, GMK became the distributor for Franchi shotguns, followed a year later by their appointment as distributor for Tikka rifles from Finland. In that same year they won the UK distribution rights from US ammunition giant ATK (brands including Federal, CCI and RCBS), and began importing their products in to the UK. The storage of this ammunition coupled with generic growth forced GMK to look for new premises and in 2002 they moved into a new, purpose built building. Also in 2002 GMK moved the distribution of Le Chameau into a joint venture with Lafuma called LLC Ltd. Having begun supplying to UK police forces, GMK’s presence in the Law Enforcement market steadily increased. In 2004 they applied for ISO 9001 certification which was later awarded. In 2005 The Beretta Gallery was opened, on the corner of St James Street and Jermyn Street, London. A joint venture between Beretta and GMK Ltd, this flagship store sells both ladies and gentlemen’s luxury shooting clothing and related goods. The top floor of the Beretta Gallery houses the largest gun room in London, exhibiting the entire range of Beretta shotguns. The company continued to show strong growth right up until the 2008 financial crisis, where problems with exchange rates created difficulties for GMK Ltd. However, troubles in the domestic markets were offset by strong growth in their tactical sales. In 2008 GMK supplied the British MOD with Benelli M4 shotguns, for use by the British Army as an urgent operational requirement. In 2013 GMK won its biggest tender to date, to supply the British MOD with Steiner military 8 x 30 R binoculars. This was a multimillion pound contract, initially for five years but with options to extend. Although sales were obviously affected by the financial crisis of 2007-08 and the subsequent recession, GMK took the opportunity to re-evaluate certain areas of the business, emerging stronger and recovering very quickly. At the end of 2013 GMK completed a major project to install solar panels on the roof of the building. The system generates large amounts of electricity, even on overcast days, and feeds excess electricity back into the National Grid.

Description Carex acaulis has at least two flowering spikes; the terminal one contains staminate (male) flowers and is long, while the others contain pistillate (female) flowers, each of which is subtended by a scale and may produce a utricle up to long. Carex acaulis is very similar to the closely related species C. macrosolen, and the ranges of the two species overlap, but C. macrosolen has much longer utricles than C. acaulis, at long. Taxonomy and distribution Carex acaulis was first described by Jules Dumont d'Urville in 1826. He based his description on type material from near Port Louis on East Falkland Island. The holotype was deposited at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris. The species has subsequently been reported from Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego in Argentina, although the Fuegian reports are considered suspect by the sedge expert Gerald Allen Wheeler; many of them actually refer to specimens of Carex sagei. Conservation and ecology Like many other sedges, Carex acaulis is restricted to wet habitats, such as bogs and lake margins. It is not included on the IUCN Red List, but it is rare in the Falkland Islands, and is listed nationally as a vulnerable species.

The charity supports projects across the North West of England and beyond, providing medical equipment and facilities to NHS Trusts, schools, clinics and community groups.  History  The charity was founded in 1985 by a family from Prestwich, Greater Manchester. Their daughter was seriously ill with meningitis at Booth Hall Children's Hospital in Manchester, where she made a full recovery. At the time, the hospital was unable to afford some vital items of equipment and so to show their gratitude to the hospital, the couple set out to raise money for the hospital. The family set out to raise £1 million for a new neonatal intensive care unit, at this time the organisation was known as the Booth Hall Children’s Hospital’s Research and Development Trust but was more commonly known as the Bobby Bear Appeal. Once this target was reached, the charity continued to fundraiser under the title of \\"Children's Hospitals Appeals Trust\\" or CHAT, working specifically with hospitals across Greater Manchester. In 2004, the charity re-branded to become known as MedEquip4Kids and expanded their remit beyond just hospitals to support other organisations that care for children.  Organisation  MedEquip4Kids is currently governed by a board of 11 Trustees, who volunteer their time to plan the strategic future of the charity, make policy decisions and ensure the charity is accountable to all beneficiaries. On a day-to-day basis, the charity is run by Chief Executive, Ghazala Baig who is supported by a small team of fundraisers and administrators.  Present day  MedEquip4Kids has appeals offices based out of Rico House in Prestwich. Since their creation in 1985, the charity has raised over £20 million to fund healthcare equipment. In 2014, they began an appeal focused on improving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) across the UK. In the first round of this appeal, the charity has raised over £22,000 to fund CAMHS projects nationwide. The second round of funding closes on 11 December 2014. The money raised as part of this appeal will help supply books, resources and therapy items to help and support children and young people with a range of conditions including autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a range of eating disorders, depression and self harm.  30th anniversary  In 2015, MedEquip4Kids will be celebrating their 30th Anniversary and have launched a special anniversary challenge, 30 Peaks, as part of their celebrations.http://www.lep.co.uk/news/regional/teams-wanted-for-30-peaks- trek-1-6976083  Fundraising activities  MedEquip4Kids runs a number of fundraising events each year which includes their Duck Race, Mega Trek (previously known as Trek 50),http://www.actionforcharity.co.uk/eventdetailsnew2.php/urlsearch/Mega- Trek-2015 the Lancashire Loop, and the Shimmer Ball  References  Category:Children's charities based in England Category:Health charities in the United Kingdom Category:Charities based in Manchester Category:Organizations established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in England ","title":"MedEquip4Kids"},{"id":"44635522","text":"Charles Hamya, is a Ugandan businessman.

Introduction, p. xxiv. and nathair (\\"serpent\\" and \\"adder\\").Carmichael (1900). p. 312. The word may also mean \\"wild beast\\" and may be derived from the Norse for \\"bear\\" according to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop. Folklore The beithir is described as \\"the largest and most deadly kind of serpent\\",Campbell, John Gregorson (1900). Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons. p. 224. or as a dragon (but without certain typical draconic features such as wings or fiery breath).Campbell, John Francis (1892). Popular Tales of the West Highlands (Vol. 3). Alexander Gardner. pp. 406, 415 (footnote). It dwells in mountainous caves and corries (valleys) and is equipped with a venomous sting. If a person is stung by the beithir then they must head for the nearest body of water such as a river or loch. If they can reach it before the beithir does then they are cured, but if the monster reaches it first then the victim is doomed.Mackenzie (1935). p. 250. Another cure for the sting is water in which the head of another snake has been placed. The beithir is considered one of the fuath, a general term for various monsters and spirits associated with water. It is said that if a normal snake is killed then the head must be separated a proper distance from its body and destroyed. Otherwise, both parts will come together and the snake will return to life as a beithir. Donald Alexander Mackenzie in Scottish Folklore and Folk Life (1935) drew a possible connection between the beithir and the mythological hag known as the Cailleach Bheur. In a story from Argyll the Cailleach was slain by a hunter who hacked her to pieces, but she returned to life when all her body parts came together again. Mackenzie suggested that the serpent-dragon of the loch may be one of her forms. John Francis Campbell in 1890 recounted a traditional story about a wicked stepmother who was the wife of an Irish king, and she gave the king's son a magic shirt that was a beithir in disguise. As long as the \\"great snake\\" remained coiled about his neck, the prince was under his stepmother's enchantment, but he was eventually freed from the beithir with the help of a wise woman.Campbell, John Francis (1890). Popular Tales of the West Highlands (Vol. 1). Alexander Gardner. Introduction, pp. lxxxix–xc. John Gregorson Campbell in 1900 provided an account of the beithir: > The big beast of Scanlastle in Islay was one of this kind. It devoured seven > horses on its way to Loch-in-daal. A ship was lying at anchor in the loch at > the time, and a line of barrels filled with deadly spikes, and with pieces > of flesh laid upon them, was placed from the shore to the ship. Tempted by > the flesh, the \\"loathly worm\\" made its way out on the barrels and was killed > by the spikes and cannon. Writing in the Celtic Review in 1908, the folklorist E. C. Watson described the beithir as a \\"venomous and destructive creature\\". She suggested the basis of the legends were founded in the destructive characteristics of lightning and serpents. The beithir was said to be sighted on summer nights when lightning strikes occurred.

He was Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, Secretary of State for Ireland, a Privy Councillor and a Member of Parliament. He was the son of William Cooke and Frances Grey, daughter of Lord John Grey and Mary Browne, and grandson of Sir Anthony Cooke, of Gidea Hall and Anne Fitzwilliam. Educated at Oxford University, his rise in politics was mainly due to his family connection to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, who had married his aunt, Mildred Cooke. He sat in the Parliament of 1584 as member for Lymington. As an MP he was embarrassed by a lawsuit brought against him in the Court of Chancery by Margery Dyke, but he was able to plead Parliamentary privilege to defeat her claim. He was granted 2,000 acres of escheated lands in County Wexford and the Manor of Dunshaughlin in County Meath. His descendants lived mainly at Sleanagrane, County Wexford, which they renamed Cookestown. He first came to Ireland in about 1595. By 1608 he was considered to be a leading figure in the Irish administration. Notwithstanding his important role in Government he preferred to live in England, where he spent most of the years 1612–1614. He only returned to Ireland under threat of removal from office. In 1615 he was writing to the London government complaining about the maladministration of Ireland, and urging that the Irish Parliament be dissolved. He died a year later. His will has not survived. He married Anne, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Christopher Peyton (d. 1612), Auditor-General of Ireland, and his wife Anne Palmer. After his death Anne remarried Sir Henry Colley (d. 1637), of Castle Carbury, grandson of Sir Henry Colley. Cooke was the father of Sir Walsingham Cooke, of Tomduffe, High Sheriff of Wexford, and a younger son William. His descendants included the writer and businessman John Walsingham Cooke Meredith (1809-1881). His widow and her second husband were ancestors of the Duke of Wellington.

In its early years, Jankel provided specialist design and manufacturing services to improve the performance of rally and racing cars. By 1970 Jankel had established Panther Westwinds and was manufacturing production sport cars and coach-built touring limousines for VIP customers. Jankel then diversified into coachwork for the likes of Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Mercedes-Benz, specialising in armoured, Head of State vehicles. In 1997 Jankel branched out into producing vehicles for the UK MoD and Police. The company's current UK HQ is Hamm Court Farm, Weybridge, Surrey. The current Chairman of Jankel Group and Jankel Holdings Inc. is Andrew Jankel, son of founder Robert Jankel. Jankel is now a $100 million business. From around 30 employees when current chairman Andrew Jankel took over the company, Jankel now employs over 500 people globally; 150 in the UK; circa 75 at each of two facilities, Weybridge and Rustington, 80 in South Carolina in the USA, and 270 in Jordan. Jankel has a joint venture in Jordan with King Abdullah II Design and Development Bureau (KADDB), Jordan Light Vehicle Manufacturing LCC which was established in 2003. Jankel's US subsidiary, Jankel Tactical Systems, was founded in 2008 and US turnover is now in the region of $35 million a year. The current portfolio of products and services is wholly defence and security focused and covers the design, development, prototyping and production of armoured vehicles, light tactical vehicles, counter terrorism vehicles and equipment, and customised occupant survivability solutions for military, security, government, aid agencies and NGOs. Robert Jankel/Andrew Jankel Robert Jankel founded the Jankel Group in 1955 and remained an active member of the Jankel Group until his death on 25 May 2005. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2002. Jankel had married Jennifer Loss, daughter of bandleader Joe Loss, in 1962. The couple have three sons and a daughter. Following the death of Robert, son Andrew took over the helm of Jankel. Andrew had worked under his father since leaving school at 18. Pre-defence/security focus From its formation in 1955, Jankel had been a relatively small concern, focusing on coachbuilding. On a parallel path Robert Jankel had established Panther Westwinds in 1972. Panther was a manufacturer of sports cars based on commercially available mechanical components from manufacturers such as Jaguar, Vauxhall and Ford. Panther Westwinds went bankrupt in 1979 and it was subsequently sold to South Korean businessman Young Kim. Jankel then turned his attention back to the Jankel Group and concentrated on building specialist versions of cars from other high-end manufacturers, mostly Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Range Rover. From 1983 to 1989, Jankel was the exclusive subcontractor to Rolls-Royce Motor cars to build more than 130 units of the Silver Spur Limousine, a 42-inch extension of the standard vehicle. For Land Rover, he built a number of specialist hunting and all-terrain Range Rover vehicles for Middle Eastern customers. In 1992 he built the Jankel Tempest, a Chevrolet Corvette-based super car, with ultra-luxury interior and 6.7 litre supercharged V8, which produced 535 bhp and was capable of 200 mph, as well as holding the 1992 Guinness Book of Records 0-60mph acceleration record of 3.89 seconds. From the mid-1980s the company also supplied discreetly armoured saloon cars to the British and other governments, as well as commercial customers worldwide. Around 30 units per year were produced. Jankel bought back the Panther name in 2001 and was reportedly working on a new Panther sports car at the time of his death. Defence/security focus In 1997 Jankel branched out into producing vehicles for the UK MoD and Police. Defence and security are now Jankel's primary areas of business. Metropolitan Police Ford F450 Jankel Guardian vehicles of the MET Police around Parliament Square in the aftermath of the 2017 Westminster attack. In the mid 1990s Jankel was approached by the UK MoD to see if the company would be interested in bidding for government work, and in 1997 Jankel branched out into producing vehicles for the UK MoD and Police. Defence and security are now Jankel's primary areas of business. Jankel’s first defence/security-related vehicles were armoured Jaguars for the RUC in 1997. These were followed by a specialist fleet of Guardian counter-terror/anti-riot vehicles for the Met and then Essex Police forces. These Ford-based designs were to replace Land Rover-based designs which had been found wanting in areas of space and performance. Jankel also introduced the Aigis discreet paramilitary vehicle, this based on General Motors K series chassis and automotives. The UK MoD ordered a number of different Aigis-based designs around 1999-2000, and in 2000 four examples were ordered by Jordanian Special Operations Command. Following on from success with VIP customers, Jankel identified the Middle East as a key market, and it was this that brought about the development of the relationship with King Abdullah II Design and Development Bureau (KADDB), part of the Jordanian Armed Forces in The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Jankel entered into a collaborative venture with KADDB in 1999 and in 2003 the formation of the joint venture concern Jordan Light Vehicle Manufacturing (JLVM) was announced. Orders disclosed around this time included 60 AB2 Al-Jawad and 500 examples of the Desert Iris, the latter a light strike buggy-type design. JLVM's facility encompasses eight production lines and is located on an area of approximately 40,000m². JLVM has a production strategy of ‘Build to Order’ and/or ‘Engineer to Order’ for the customer’s specific requirements, ranging from soft skin and special purpose vehicles, to fully armoured internal security vehicles (ISVs) based on a variety of commercial off the shelf chassis. In 2004, Jankel secured its first Long Term Supply Agreement with the United Nations, for a range of armoured Toyota Land Cruiser vehicles, this leading to the expansion of the JLVM. Also in 2004 JLVM disclosed details of its Al Thalab (Fox) Long- Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV), this designed primarily for internal security, reconnaissance, and border patrol operations in arid, remote, and high- altitude areas of operation. The original Al Thalab was based on a tropical specification Toyota '79 Land Cruiser chassis. Jordan's armed forces received around 200 Al-Thalabs. The first export order was for 15 vehicles to Mauritania. Other export customers have included Botswana, Brunei, Indonesia, Italy, Oman, South Korea, and Spain. The most recent 79 Series-based order was announced at Eurosatory 2018. Masstech of France has delivered 30 vehicles to meet France's urgent VPS 2 (Le Véhicule Patrouille SAS) requirement. The Iraq War (and then Afghanistan) and the increased intensity of IED attacks would generate substantial business for the company. The first related armouring contract was to upgrade the British Army's Land Rover WMIK. For the WMIK, and other vehicles without an occupant protection system, from around 2005 Jankel developed its MAPIK product, a quick-fit, lightweight modular armour system to provide zoned ballistic and fragmentation protection. The company was also contracted to develop and certify an armour solution for the 700 Supacat Jackal vehicles for the UK MoD. As part of this process Jankel discovered that all the seats available on the market were not fit for purpose to protect the soldiers in light vehicles from blast acceleration in particular. The company then developed and patented its own armoured seat solution, BLASTech. Having developed the BLASTech seat design the company undertook a survey of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)-type vehicles to discover many were lacking in the required armoured seat protection. Around the same time, the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) were undertaking an armoured seat study following a number of fatalities. Jankel participated and supplied seats for testing. To comply with ‘made in USA’ requirements the company established a factory in Duncan, South Carolina. Since its first order in 2011 Jankel has supplied over 90,000 seats to date from this 90,000 sq ft facility. Vehicles fitted with BLASTech seats include those produced by Navistar, Oshkosh and General Dynamics. Jankel’s US facilities have since grown to offer all of Jankel’s capabilities to US, Canadian and Latin American customers. Jankel is now an established supplier to various US agencies including the DoD, SOCOM, DoS, CBP, and the Marshalls. In 2008 Jankel unveiled the prototype of the Hunter, an internal security vehicle based on the Toyata Land Cruiser 79 Series chassis. It was disclosed in August 2009 that the now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) had appointed Jankel as a worldwide distributors for the Jeep J8 to supply to government and military customers. The J8 is a militarised Jeep Wrangler JK. Jankel further modified the J8 and offered the product under the trading name of JGMS (Jeep Government & Military Sales). Jankel’s first J8 customer was the US Government who, in 2011, purchased a fleet of kit-enhanced J8 Jeeps for UN peacekeeping operations. The Jeep JK was replaced by the Jeep JL in 2019, and the JK-based J8 is no longer available. Jankel had offered discreetly armoured saloon cars and ultily vehicles/SUVs including the Toyota Land Cruiser since the mid-1990s, but in 2013 introduced hot-formed armour technology to the Land Cruiser 200 Series. According to the company, conventional armouring comprises hundreds of individual pieces of flat armour, this being reduced to just 36 pieces of hot-formed armour for the 200 Series. Using hot-formed technology, application time is reduced by about 80% to 20 hours per vehicle. The Jankel-armoured Land Cruiser 200 Series is certified to German VPAM standard. Continuing success Jankel announced in January 2016 a contract contract for 108 Jankel Fox Rapid Response Vehicles (RRVs) Jankel announced in January 2016 that the Belgian government had awarded the company a contract contract for 108 Jankel Fox Rapid Response Vehicles (RRVs). These are the first Fox family vehicles to be delivered on the Toyota Hilux chassis. Fox variants are now available on either a Land Cruiser or Hilux chassis. In addition to the base vehicles, Belgium has ordered 38 removable protection kits and ring mounts for mounting 12.7 mm HMGs or 40 mm AGLs on 60 of the vehicles (all 108 can mount 7.62 mm MGs). Jankel will also provide 76 mm smoke grenade launchers, communications antennas, and installation kits for (government-furnished) communications equipment. In March 2018 Jankel announced a second award from the Belgian MoD, this a contract for 199 Light Troop Transport Vehicles (LTTVs) that will be delivered between 2019 and 2021. Based on a Mercedes-Benz Unimog U5000 chassis, the LTTV fleet will be procured in four variants: special operations forces (SOF), rangers, ambulance and command post. The rear portion of each vehicle, known as the ‘mission module’ can be completely removed and interchanged between different base platforms. In September 2018 Jankel displayed a new 6x6 variant of the Fox light tactical vehicle range. The 6x6 Fox has a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 6,300 kg with a configurable payload of up to 3,000 kg and is capable of speeds up to 155 km/h at maximum GVW. For the new 6x6 variants, Jankel partnered with NSV and MDT of Australia and the vehicles use Multidrive technology that has been used commercially and was originally developed in Australia and manufactured by NSV. The company also announced their achievement of Direct Partnership certification from Mercedes-Benz. This partnership arrangement gives Jankel access to otherwise unavailable levels of technical information and support from Mercedes-Benz. During the first three months of 2019 Jankel announced ‘production ready’ status for the latest generation of the Hunter Tactical Intervention Vehicle (TIV). The Hunter TIV will be built at JLVM. At the time of the announcement Jankel revealed that the company had over 350 vehicles in service across 11 countries in the Middle east and neighbouring regions. The company also made two US-related announcements: Jankel Tactical Systems was awarded contracts to supply armoured Chevrolet Suburbans and Toyota Land Cruisers to the US Marshals Service and the US Customs and Border Patrol, and was also awarded three contracts to supply BLASTech mitigation seats to a US based MRAP provider. The contracts value is undisclosed but stated to be multi-million dollar. In October 2019 the company announced the award of a Lifecycle Management Services (LMS) contract by the US DOD. The award (initially of a 12-month duration) will see Jankel delivering a service provision package in support of a wide range of non-standard tactical and armoured military and civilian vehicles. Within the range of supported platforms will be Jankel’s own civilian armored vehicles (CAVs) and multiple other tactical wheeled vehicles and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), operated by US DOD.

Reasons to use multiple kernel learning include a) the ability to select for an optimal kernel and parameters from a larger set of kernels, reducing bias due to kernel selection while allowing for more automated machine learning methods, and b) combining data from different sources (e.g. sound and images from a video) that have different notions of similarity and thus require different kernels. Instead of creating a new kernel, multiple kernel algorithms can be used to combine kernels already established for each individual data source. Multiple kernel learning approaches have been used in many applications, such as event recognition in video,Lin Chen, Lixin Duan, and Dong Xu, \\"Event Recognition in Videos by Learning From Heterogeneous Web Sources,\\" in IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013, pp. 2666-2673 object recognition in images,Serhat S. Bucak, Rong Jin, and Anil K. Jain, Multiple Kernel Learning for Visual Object Recognition: A Review. T-PAMI, 2013. and biomedical data fusion.Yu et al. L2-norm multiple kernel learning and its application to biomedical data fusion. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:309 Algorithms Multiple kernel learning algorithms have been developed for supervised, semi-supervised, as well as unsupervised learning. Most work has been done on the supervised learning case with linear combinations of kernels, however, many algorithms have been developed. The basic idea behind multiple kernel learning algorithms is to add an extra parameter to the minimization problem of the learning algorithm. As an example, consider the case of supervised learning of a linear combination of a set of n kernels K. We introduce a new kernel K'=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\beta_iK_i, where \\\\beta is a vector of coefficients for each kernel. Because the kernels are additive (due to properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces), this new function is still a kernel. For a set of data X with labels Y, the minimization problem can then be written as :\\\\min_{\\\\beta,c}\\\\Epsilon(Y, K'c)+R(K,c) where \\\\Epsilon is an error function and R is a regularization term. \\\\Epsilon is typically the square loss function (Tikhonov regularization) or the hinge loss function (for SVM algorithms), and R is usually an \\\\ell_n norm or some combination of the norms (i.e. elastic net regularization). This optimization problem can then be solved by standard optimization methods. Adaptations of existing techniques such as the Sequential Minimal Optimization have also been developed for multiple kernel SVM-based methods.Francis R. Bach, Gert R. G. Lanckriet, and Michael I. Jordan. 2004. Multiple kernel learning, conic duality, and the SMO algorithm. In Proceedings of the twenty- first international conference on Machine learning (ICML '04). ACM, New York, NY, USA =Supervised learning= For supervised learning, there are many other algorithms that use different methods to learn the form of the kernel. The following categorization has been proposed by Gonen and Alpaydın (2011)Mehmet Gönen, Ethem Alpaydın. Multiple Kernel Learning Algorithms Jour. Mach. Learn. Res. 12(Jul):2211−2268, 2011 Fixed rules approaches Fixed rules approaches such as the linear combination algorithm described above use rules to set the combination of the kernels. These do not require parameterization and use rules like summation and multiplication to combine the kernels. The weighting is learned in the algorithm. Other examples of fixed rules include pairwise kernels, which are of the form :k((x_{1i}, x_{1j}),(x_{2i},x_{2j}))=k(x_{1i},x_{2i})k(x_{1j},x_{2j})+k(x_{1i},x_{2j})k(x_{1j},x_{2i}). These pairwise approaches have been used in predicting protein-protein interactions.Ben-Hur, A. and Noble W.S. Kernel methods for predicting protein- protein interactions. Bioinformatics. 2005 Jun;21 Suppl 1:i38-46. Heuristic approaches These algorithms use a combination function that is parameterized. The parameters are generally defined for each individual kernel based on single-kernel performance or some computation from the kernel matrix. Examples of these include the kernel from Tenabe et al. (2008).Hiroaki Tanabe, Tu Bao Ho, Canh Hao Nguyen, and Saori Kawasaki. Simple but effective methods for combining kernels in computational biology. In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future, 2008. Letting \\\\pi_m be the accuracy obtained using only K_m, and letting \\\\delta be a threshold less than the minimum of the single-kernel accuracies, we can define :\\\\beta_m=\\\\frac{\\\\pi_m-\\\\delta}{\\\\sum_{h=1}^{n}(\\\\pi_h-\\\\delta)} Other approaches use a definition of kernel similarity, such as :A(K_1,K_2)=\\\\frac{\\\\langle K_1,K_2 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\langle K_1,K_1 \\\\rangle\\\\langle K_2,K_2\\\\rangle}} Using this measure, Qui and Lane (2009)Shibin Qiu and Terran Lane. A framework for multiple kernel support vector regression and its applications to siRNA efficacy prediction. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, 6(2):190–199, 2009 used the following heuristic to define :\\\\beta_m=\\\\frac{A(K_m,YY^T)}{\\\\sum_{h=1}^{n}A(K_h,YY^T)} Optimization approaches These approaches solve an optimization problem to determine parameters for the kernel combination function. This has been done with similarity measures and structural risk minimization approaches. For similarity measures such as the one defined above, the problem can be formulated as follows:Gert R. G. Lanckriet, Nello Cristianini, Peter Bartlett, Laurent El Ghaoui, and Michael I. Jordan. Learning the kernel matrix with semidefinite programming. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5:27–72, 2004a :\\\\max_{\\\\beta,\\\\operatorname{tr}(K'_{tra})=1,K'\\\\ge0} A(K'_{tra},YY^T). where K'_{tra} is the kernel of the training set. Structural risk minimization approaches that have been used include linear approaches, such as that used by Lanckriet et al. (2002).Gert R. G. Lanckriet, Nello Cristianini, Peter Bartlett, Laurent El Ghaoui, and Michael I. Jordan. Learning the kernel matrix with semidefinite programming. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Machine Learning, 2002 We can define the implausibility of a kernel \\\\omega(K) to be the value of the objective function after solving a canonical SVM problem. We can then solve the following minimization problem: :\\\\min_{\\\\operatorname{tr}(K'_{tra})=c}\\\\omega(K'_{tra}) where c is a positive constant. Many other variations exist on the same idea, with different methods of refining and solving the problem, e.g. with nonnegative weights for individual kernels and using non-linear combinations of kernels. Bayesian approaches Bayesian approaches put priors on the kernel parameters and learn the parameter values from the priors and the base algorithm. For example, the decision function can be written as :f(x)=\\\\sum^n_{i=0}\\\\alpha_i\\\\sum^p_{m=1}\\\\eta_mK_m(x_i^m,x^m) \\\\eta can be modeled with a Dirichlet prior and \\\\alpha can be modeled with a zero-mean Gaussian and an inverse gamma variance prior. This model is then optimized using a customized multinomial probit approach with a Gibbs sampler. Mark Girolami and Simon Rogers. Hierarchic Bayesian models for kernel learning. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Machine Learning, 2005 These methods have been used successfully in applications such as protein fold recognition and protein homology problems Theodoros Damoulas and Mark A. Girolami. Combining feature spaces for classification. Pattern Recognition, 42(11):2671–2683, 2009Theodoros Damoulas and Mark A. Girolami. Probabilistic multi-class multi-kernel learning: On protein fold recognition and remote homology detection. Bioinformatics, 24(10):1264–1270, 2008 Boosting approaches Boosting approaches add new kernels iteratively until some stopping criteria that is a function of performance is reached. An example of this is the MARK model developed by Bennett et al. (2002) Kristin P. Bennett, Michinari Momma, and Mark J. Embrechts. MARK: A boosting algorithm for heterogeneous kernel models. In Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2002 :f(x)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\sum_{m=1}^P\\\\alpha_i^mK_m(x_i^m,x^m)+b The parameters \\\\alpha_i^m and b are learned by gradient descent on a coordinate basis. In this way, each iteration of the descent algorithm identifies the best kernel column to choose at each particular iteration and adds that to the combined kernel. The model is then rerun to generate the optimal weights \\\\alpha_i and b. =Semisupervised learning= Semisupervised learning approaches to multiple kernel learning are similar to other extensions of supervised learning approaches. An inductive procedure has been developed that uses a log-likelihood empirical loss and group LASSO regularization with conditional expectation consensus on unlabeled data for image categorization. We can define the problem as follows. Let L={(x_i,y_i)} be the labeled data, and let U={x_i} be the set of unlabeled data. Then, we can write the decision function as follows. :f(x)=\\\\alpha_0+\\\\sum_{i=1}^{L}\\\\alpha_iK_i(x) The problem can be written as :\\\\min_f L(f) + \\\\lambda R(f)+\\\\gamma\\\\Theta(f) where L is the loss function (weighted negative log-likelihood in this case), R is the regularization parameter (Group LASSO in this case), and \\\\Theta is the conditional expectation consensus (CEC) penalty on unlabeled data. The CEC penalty is defined as follows. Let the marginal kernel density for all the data be :g^{\\\\pi}_m(x)=\\\\langle\\\\phi^{\\\\pi}_m,\\\\psi_m(x)\\\\rangle where \\\\psi_m(x)=[K_m(x_1,x),\\\\ldots,K_m(x_L,x)]^T (the kernel distance between the labeled data and all of the labeled and unlabeled data) and \\\\phi^{\\\\pi}_m is a non-negative random vector with a 2-norm of 1. The value of \\\\Pi is the number of times each kernel is projected. Expectation regularization is then performed on the MKD, resulting in a reference expectation q^{pi}_m(yg^{\\\\pi}_m(x)) and model expectation p^{\\\\pi}_m(f(x)g^{\\\\pi}_m(x)). Then, we define :\\\\Theta=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Pi} \\\\sum^{\\\\Pi}_{\\\\pi=1}\\\\sum^{M}_{m=1} D(q^{pi}_m(yg^{\\\\pi}_m(x))p^{\\\\pi}_m(f(x)g^{\\\\pi}_m(x))) where D(QP)=\\\\sum_iQ(i)\\\\ln\\\\frac{Q(i)}{P(i)} is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The combined minimization problem is optimized using a modified block gradient descent algorithm. For more information, see Wang et al.Wang, Shuhui et al. S3MKL: Scalable Semi-Supervised Multiple Kernel Learning for Real-World Image Applications. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA, VOL. 14, NO. 4, AUGUST 2012 =Unsupervised learning= Unsupervised multiple kernel learning algorithms have also been proposed by Zhuang et al. The problem is defined as follows. Let U={x_i} be a set of unlabeled data. The kernel definition is the linear combined kernel K'=\\\\sum_{i=1}^M\\\\beta_iK_m. In this problem, the data needs to be \\"clustered\\" into groups based on the kernel distances. Let B_i be a group or cluster of which x_i is a member. We define the loss function as \\\\sum^n_{i=1}\\\\left\\\\Vert x_i - \\\\sum_{x_j\\\\in B_i} K(x_i,x_j)x_j\\\\right\\\\Vert^2. Furthermore, we minimize the distortion by minimizing \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{x_j\\\\in B_i}K(x_i,x_j)\\\\left\\\\Vert x_i - x_j \\\\right\\\\Vert^2. Finally, we add a regularization term to avoid overfitting. Combining these terms, we can write the minimization problem as follows. :\\\\min_{\\\\beta,B}\\\\sum^n_{i=1}\\\\left\\\\Vert x_i - \\\\sum_{x_j\\\\in B_i} K(x_i,x_j)x_j\\\\right\\\\Vert^2 + \\\\gamma_1\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{x_j\\\\in B_i}K(x_i,x_j)\\\\left\\\\Vert x_i - x_j \\\\right\\\\Vert^2 + \\\\gamma_2\\\\sum_i B_i where . One formulation of this is defined as follows. Let D\\\\in {0,1}^{n\\\\times n} be a matrix such that D_{ij}=1 means that x_i and x_j are neighbors. Then, B_i={x_j:D_{ij}=1}. Note that these groups must be learned as well. Zhuang et al. solve this problem by an alternating minimization method for K and the groups B_i. For more information, see Zhuang et al.J. Zhuang, J.

Recognition of the company’s commitment to its customers continued in 2015 when BES Utilities was shortlisted again for the Treating Customers Fairly award, and in the Telecom Team of the Year category for the first time. = 2018: South Africa expansion = In 2018, as part of its expansion plans, BES created a new team based in Cape Town, South Africa. The team in Cape Town now handles all first line customer contact relating to general service issues, change of tenancies and debt collection. = 2019: BES Utilities win £600m contract = BES Utilities won a major contract with ESPO, one of the UK’s largest public sector buying organisations, which is worth an estimated £600m over two years and will help local authorities, the NHS, schools and emergency services drive down their energy costs. =BES Utilities Legal Action= In January 2018, BES Utilities settled a High Court case against two men, in which the company had alleged that they had made false claims about the company for three years. Following the hearing, in the High Court at Manchester, the defendants were issued with court orders containing penal notices. They gave undertakings to the court to cease their behaviour and remove any published reference to BES, its directors, employees, agents and representatives. If the men fail to comply with the order they may be held in contempt of court and could be fined or imprisoned. The court also ordered that if the defendants breach the undertakings, they will be required to pay £250,000 towards BES’s substantial legal costs. Both defendants signed the following statement: “We withdraw any allegation of fraud or dishonesty against Business Energy Solutions Limited and BES Commercial Electricity Limited, their directors, officers, agents, legal advisers and other professional representatives.”  BES Metering Services Ltd  In 2019, BES Utilities announced its own specialist metering services division following the acquisition of Liverpool-based metering, asset and management company Access Install, which will now trade as BES Metering Services. All 80 existing jobs were protected, and there will be a further seven-figure investment in the next 12 months. The acquisition strengthens BES' smart meter offering as the government aims to install more than 53 million smart meters in homes and businesses by the end of 2025, this includes a partnership with energy supplier Green.

In Summer 2013, BES Utilities supported the Trinity Hospice Corporate Challenge, and more recently, Card Saver has donated merchant service terminals to Trinity Hospice and Brian House Children’s Hospice enabling members of the public to donate by card rather than having to look for loose change. = Tackling Bullying in Schools = In February 2019 it was announced that Andy and FTFC would pledge £10,000 to help tackle bullying in schools by supporting a ground-breaking training programme headed up by local Human Behaviour Trainer and Success Coach, Norry Ascroft. Following on from the success earlier in the year Andy, along with BES Utilities and Card Saver, pledged a further £20,000 to the MADD About Bullying programme, supporting over 300 schools in the North West directly. = Providing free and at-cost electricity for Blackpool Illuminations = BES Utilities sponsored Blackpool illuminations, providing free electricity in 2014 and half price electricity in 2015. Their sponsorship was worth in excess of £100,000 over two years – the biggest donation to the Lights in more than a decade. = Sponsor of local champion boxer, Brian Rose = Fleetwood Town FC, BES Utilities and Card Saver all sponsor local professional boxer Brian ‘The Lion’ Rose. As well as providing sponsorship, Andy has given Brian full use of the state-of-the-art facilities at Poolfoot Farm, along with access to coaches and physios. = Maintaining East Pines Park = In 2018, Andy and Fleetwood Town FC partnered with East Pines Park, and offered to maintain their football pitches. The pitches were often completely out of use due to poor drainage, and after playing football at East Pines Park as youngster, Andy decided to step in and help. Following extensive improvement work and maintenance by the grounds team from Fleetwood Town, the pitch now plays host to a variety of community football sessions for youngsters as well as weekly walking football sessions for older players. = Support for Amputee Footballers = The story of local young footballer, Jamie Oakey, who was born with one foot inspired Andy to support England’s next generation of amputee players. Jamie, who was named in the England Amputee FA’s under-23 squad, is also part of a group of junior players hoping to take part in an international training camp in Hoffenheim, Germany, in July. To get there the young amputees and their families needed to raise £5,000, so Andy decided to provide financial support for the Germany training camp as well as giving the England squad free use of the Cod Army’s Poolfoot Farm training base whenever they needed it. = More = * Sponsor of Thornton Christmas Lights * Creation of the BES Fund to support businesses struggling with energy or other debts * Funder of national charity, Business Debtline References External links * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:English businesspeople Category:Fleetwood Town F.C.

Following the withdrawal of financial support from Macmillan Cancer Relief in 2004 new trustees were sought and the British Colostomy Association is replaced by the Colostomy Association - an entirely self-funded charity.  Services  The Colostomy Association provides a number of services to fulfill its role of representing the interests of people with a colostomy. Most notably, it runs a confidential helpline that runs 24/7 where members of the public can call for advice, support or information. Additionally, The Colostomy Association has over 100 trained volunteers all of which are colostomates. They provide emotional support by speaking to patients before and after surgery as well as providing home visits for stoma patients. The Colostomy Association also produces a range of advisory literature written by colostomates and nursing professionals, all of which is available freely on request. The Association's quarterly magazine, 'Tidings', is written specifically for the ostomate community and currently has a readership of over 50,000 people. In 2015, the Colostomy Association launched a new international initiative, Stoma Aid, to ship unused and surplus ostomy supplies from the UK to people in developing countries who cannot afford or access stoma appliances.

She was the chairwoman of the Meretz political party from 2012 to 2018, when it had five to six seats in the Knesset. Biography Zehava Schnipitzky (later Gal-On) was born in 1956 in Vilnius in the Soviet Union (now in Lithuania). She immigrated at age four to Israel in 1960 with her parents: father Aryeh (born 30 December 1925), a plumber for a subsidiary of Solel Boneh (a construction company), and mother, Yaffa (19 February 1923 – 10 March 2012), a teacher. They lived in a ma'abara transit camp and eventually moved to a housing project in Petah Tikva.\\"Meretz leader Zahava Gal-On is not looking to be loved\\", haaretz.com; accessed 22 July 2014. During her service in the Israel Defense Forces, Schnipitzky served as a clerk in the Paratroopers Brigade. She earned a bachelor's degree in Special Education and Linguistics from Beit Berl College, and an M.A. in the Philosophy of Education from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Galon, Zehava, Knesset Family Gal-On is married to Pesach (born 5 December 1953). They have two sons, Yiftah (born 4 March 1980) and Nadav (born 28 January 1982), and still lives in Petah Tikva. Political career Gal-On served as general secretary of the paper Politika, of the Human Rights organization B'Tselem, and of the Ratz party. She is a member of the general directorate of Meretz. Among her main activities: the struggle for human and civil rights, women's rights, and the fight for social justice. In regards to IDF refuseniks, she has said that \\"Meretz should not go with the wind of refusal, but should not try to oppose it. We are a party that believes in ideological pluralism and should not bury our heads in the sand. Meretz must show empathy towards the refuseniks and must bring the matter up for public discussion and reveal the reasons why the officers are refusing to serve.\\" She was elected to the Knesset in 1999, and served as chairwoman of the Knesset committee for the struggle against trafficking in women. She was a member of the Knesset law and constitution committee and the Knesset committee. That same year, she also called for a repeal of the Law of Return, stating that \\"The Law of Return is discriminatory, it discriminates between Jews and non-Jews. I can accept that after the Holocaust, it was kind of a necessity. But maybe after 51 years, we are not in the same situation, and we don't need to run our country based on such undemocratic laws.\\"\\"Jewish agency, Meretz Party, Jewish law, Sun- Sentinel, 6 December 1999 In 2007, Gal-On launched an unsuccessful bid to become the leader of Meretz. She believes that the party has to reinvent itself and promote a civilian agenda, which encompasses human rights and civil liberties, in order to remain politically viable. Gal-On said that Meretz could not afford to watch while other parties adopted some of its long-time positions, and it must work to cement the principles of democracy and equality in Israeli society. She lost to Haim Oron, as the polls predicted.MK Zahava Gal-On launches Meretz leadership bid, themarker.captain.co.il; accessed 22 July 2014. Gal-On volunteered her third spot on the Meretz list for the 2009 elections as a gesture of respect for Nitzan Horowitz, but lost her seat when the party was reduced to three seats. She attributed the party's failure to its uncertain response to Israel's Operation Cast Lead, and said: \\"My opinion was different than that of most party members. Because Meretz is an ideological party, it must have a clear statement even in such a situation\\". In March 2011 she returned to the Knesset after Haim Oron retired. On 7 February 2012 Gal-On was elected Meretz party chair, with more than 60% of the vote in the party's primary. In the 2013 legislative elections Meretz doubled its number of seats from three to six. Prior to the next election, Gal-On had said during the campaign that she would resign if the party won only four seats. When preliminary results of the 2015 election indicated that the party would be reduced in representation, Gal-On announced she would resign as chairperson of Meretz as soon as a successor is chosen, and from the Knesset in order to open a place for Tamar Zandberg, the party's fifth-place candidate, who appeared to have lost her seat. Zandberg, Ilan Gilon and others urged Gal-On to reconsider her decision. Once absentee and soldier ballots were counted, Meretz gained a fifth seat. With this success, Gal-On announced that she continue as party leader. She said: \\"Meretz received a fifth seat from young supporters, from Israeli soldiers, who raised the party's rate of support. That allowed Meretz to maintain its strength in terms of the number of voters – some 170,000 – compared with the last election.

It is located in Winchester in Hampshire, England and is part of Winchester's Military Museums.  History  The Gurkha Museum was first established at Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Church Crookham and was officially opened by Field Marshal Lord Harding on 21 June 1974. From the beginning it was clear that the museum, housed in a wooden barrack block, would need larger and more permanent premises. The closure of the Rifle Depot at Peninsula Barracks, Winchester offered this opportunity. In April 1989 the museum at Church Crookham was closed and the transfer of the artefacts to Winchester began. Field Marshal Lord Bramall officially opened the relocated museum on 16 July 1990. In 1994, a Gurkha Museum was established at a temporary site in Kathmandu; it moved to Pokhara in 2005 and has become one of the main attractions of the area.  Collections  Besides tableaux, dioramas, showcases and interactive touchscreen displays, there are visual and audio depictions of Nepal and of the Gurkhas' renowned military history, including the award of 26 Victoria Crosses. The collections tell the story of Gurkha service to the Crown in many wars and campaigns and describe the history of the four Gurkha regiments which transferred to the British Army in 1948 (the Royal Gurkha Rifles, The Queen's Gurkha Engineers, the Queen's Gurkha Signals and the Queen's Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment).

It was designed by J. F. Doyle and built in 1910–11. The church is located near Wallasey Golf Club and is known as the Harrison Memorial Church or the Golfers' Church. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Funding for the church was donated by members of the local Harrison family, and it was designed by the Liverpool architect J. F. Doyle. The foundation stone was laid by a member of the Harrison family on 26 April 1910. The church cost £15,000 to build and provided seating for up to 700 people. It was consecrated by the Rt Revd Francis Jayne, Bishop of Chester on 29 November 1911. It is known as the Harrison Memorial Church and, because of its proximity to Wallasey Golf Club, as the Golfers' Church. Architecture =Exterior= St Nicholas Church is built in Storeton sandstone and is roofed with Yorkshire stone flags. The church is orientated in the opposite direction from the usual liturgical orientation, with its chancel at the west end. It is built on sand and therefore stands on a raft of steel and concrete. The church has a cruciform plan, with a central tower above the crossing, a nave and a chancel, both with clerestories, north and south aisles, north and south transepts, north and south porches, a chancel, a south Lady Chapel, and a north vestry. The tower has louvred bell openings, a battlemented parapet, and an octagonal stair turret on the northwest corner. The windows contain curvilinear tracery. Carvings by Norbury and Sons are located around the doors and windows and along the sides of the church. These include depictions of King George V and Queen Mary, King Edward I and Queen Eleanor, and foliage, seaweed, a dragon, and a medieval monk. =Interior= Inside the church, the arcades have quatrefoil piers, pointed arches, and capitals with carvings that include the Four Evangelists, a ship, an anchor, seaweed, and the emblems of Saint Nicholas. There are also carvings of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, Saint Peter, and Saint Nicholas. In the chancel are carvings of cherubs and angels, and wooden corbels carved with seaweed, fish, a cross, an anchor, a heart, and a crown. The oak reredos was designed by Doyle; it is high and is intricately decorated. In the central panel are carvings of Christ on the cross flanked by the Virgin Mary and Saint John, and the outer panels contain angels. The canopy is elaborately decorated and has pinnacles, crockets, and openwork. The lectern is in the form of an eagle, and its pedestal stands on the backs of three lions. The pulpit is approached by seven steps and contains carved panels. The wooden font stands on two steps and has an octagonal bowl on a quatrefoil shaft; its panels are carved with symbols relating to baptism. There are two screens, each a memorial to one of the World Wars. The stained glass in the windows is by Shrigley and Hunt, to designs by Carl Almquist, E. H. Jewitt and others. In the north transept is the Harrison Window, which depicts Christ preaching from a ship and the draught of fishes. On the north side is a war memorial window showing a fallen soldier wearing a kilt, with Reims Cathedral in the background. Another window, known as the Parkin Window or the Golfers' Window, includes depictions of golfers with their golf bags and Liverpool landmarks. The ring consists of eight bells. Six of these were cast in 1911 by John Warner & Sons, and the other two date from 1977 and were cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The three-manual pipe organ was made in 1911 by John Nicholson of Worcester. It was modified in about 1975 by John Cowin of Liverpool, and again in about 1995 by Keith Ledson, also of Liverpool. Appraisal The church was designated as a Grade II listed building on 21 July 2005. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to buildings that are \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". Present day St Nicholas is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Wallasey, the archdeaconry of Chester, and the diocese of Chester. It is sited near Wallasey Golf Club. Services are held in the church each Sunday.

The remainder came from the urban-based Socialist League of Palestine, which was dissolved into the party.Sicker, Martin. Pangs of the Messiah: The Troubled Birth of the Jewish State. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 2000. p. 199. The Hashomer Hatzair movement had positioned itself politically between the moderate mainstream Mapai and the radical communists since the 1920s. The movement had however been reluctant to form a political party, since its leaders had felt that entering into party politics could push the movement into ideological deviations.Tessler, Mark A. A history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Indiana series in Arab and Islamic studies. Bloomington [u.a.]: Indiana Univ. Pr, 1994. p. 200 The movement had tried to seek unity with Mapai and Ahdut HaAvoda before forming a party of its own, but those merger talks had failed as the other parties rejected the bi-nationalist positions of Hashomer Hatzair.Heller, Joseph. The Birth of Israel, 1945-1949: Ben-Gurion and His Critics. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2000. p. 198 In contrast with Mapai, the main Labour Zionist party in Palestine at the time, the Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party put heavier emphasis on class struggle.Gal, Allon. Socialist Zionism: theory and issues in contemporary Jewish Nationalism. Cambridge, Mass: Schenkman Pub. Co, 1973. p. 188 The party could not achieve unity in action with the Communist Party, as the Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party supported aliyah whilst the communists had ambiguous positions on the issue.Heller, Joseph. The Birth of Israel, 1945-1949: Ben-Gurion and His Critics. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2000. p. 202 The Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party was the sole Zionist political organization in Palestine at the time that recognized the national rights of the Palestinian Arabs. The party advocated a bi-national state, to be shared between Jews and Arabs. The party was repeatedly criticized by other Zionist groups for their bi-national position, accusing the party of breaking the united Zionist front. The party opposed partitioning Palestine, instead preferring converting the British Mandate into an international trusteeship. In the longer perspective, a 'Palestinian Commonwealth' with Jewish majority would be established. The party maintained links with Ihud, a small circle of Jewish intellectuals who shared the bi-national vision of the party.Beinin, Joel.

A time book is a mostly outdated accounting record, that registered the hours worked by employees in a certain organization in a certain period.Accounting: Systems and Procedures. Gregg Division, McGraw-Hill, 1 jan. 1982. p. 244 These records usually contain names of employees, type of work, hours worked, and sometimes wages paid. In the 19th and early 20th century time books were separate held records. In those days time books were held by company clerks or foremen or specialized timekeepers. These time books were used by the bookkeeper to determine the wages to be paid. The data was used in financial accounting to determine the weekly, monthly and annual labour costs, and in cost accounting to determine the cost price. Late 19th century additional time cards came in use to register labour hours. Nowadays the time book can be a part of an integrated payroll system, or cost accounting system. Those systems can contain registers that describe the labour time spend to produce products, but those registers are not regularly called time books, but timesheets.  History  Before the 19th century employees could be registered on a payroll, especially in cases such as crewmembers on a ship or soldiers stationed in a location. The paid wages were noted in daybooks, in which daily expenses were registered, and eventually in the other accounts in the bookkeeping systems. = Origins, early 19th century = In the 19th century when organizations started to grow a separate register of labour hours emerged, which was called a time book. There were used to keep account of the work done.Samuel Worcester Crittenden, S. H. Crittenden (1853). An Inductive and Practical Treatise on Book-Keeping by Single and Double Entry, designed for Commercial Institutes. p. 28 Loudon (1826) explained, that in gardening the books necessary for the system of keeping accounts are, the time-book, the cash-book, and the forest or plantation book.Loudon (1826, 1671) Loudon described how time books were handled in those days: Time-Book, in Loudon 1824 > The master inserts the name of every hand; and the foreman of each > department inserts the time in days, or proportions of a day, which each > person under his care has been at work, and the particular work he or she > has been engaged in. > At the end of each week the master sums up the time from the preceding > Saturday or Monday, to the Friday or Saturday inclusive; the sum due or to > be advanced to each man is put in one column, and when the man receives it > he writes the word received in the column before it, and signs his name as a > receipt in the succeeding column. > The time-book, therefore, will show what every man has been engaged in > during every hour in the year for which he has been paid, and it will also > contain receipts for every sum, however trifling, which has been paid by the > gardener for garden-labour. And furthermore: > In short, it would be difficult to contrive a book more satisfactory for > both master and servant than the time-book, as it prevents, as far as can > well be done, the latter from deceiving either himself or his employer, and > remains an authentic indisputable record of work done, and of vouchers for > money paid during the whole period of the head gardener's services. > In laying out grounds in a distant part of the country, where upwards of > two hundred men were employed under one foreman, we have had their time, > employment, and payments recorded, and receipts taken, in this way, and > found it an effectual bar to every thing doubtful or disagreeable. In those days time books, as Loudon explained, were used on farms, but also in minesRobert McIntosh (2000). Boys in the Pits: Child Labour in Coal Mines. p. 246 and in the emerging Iron and steel industry.Roch Samson (1998). The Forges Du Saint-Maurice: Beginnings of the Iron and Steel Industry in Canada, 1730-1883. p. 287 Occasionally time books were also used to register the time, that a working steam engine had been in operation.Great Britain, William David Evans, Anthony Hammond, Thomas Colpitts Granger. A Collection of Statutes Connected with the General Administration of the Law: Arranged According to the Order of Subjects, with Notes, Volume 10. W.H. Bond, 1836. p. 936 = Accounting in industry, mid-19th century = With the emerge of larger machine shops mid 19th century accounting methods developed in larger farm companies were applied in the growing industry. In his 1885 book on factory accounting Metcalfe gave a description of normal system of labour registration mid 1870s: Time book for month of April, 1874 Work Report for April 2d, 1874 Time book and Report of Work in the Machine Shop, for April, 1874. > The timekeeper, generally the foreman, goes about the shop towards the close > of the day and asks each workman how he has spent it ; according to the > workman's recollection he enters the time reported in a book, as hereafter > described.Metcalfe (1885, p.59-62) Metcalfe noted that \\"an exception to this practice existed in [his] time at the National Armory, where, in some departments, each workman entered on a little slip of paper in his own language, the manner in which his time had been employed. This and the time were copied into the time book; but nothing more was done with the tickets. This practice was the germ of the system herein developed.\\" Metcalfe (1885) continued to explain the general forms of time book (see images): > There are two general forms of time book; * one, form A, in the nature of a > pay-roll, in which the time made by each man during each day is entered in > gross ; * and forms B and C, in which an attempt is made to show how the > time so reported has been employed. ** Form B occupies a page for each day, > and a line for each man. To save copying the names anew each day, it is > customary to paste a fly slip on the back of the first page, which, being > unfolded, serves for all successive pages and also gives more room for the > daily record of employment. ** Form C, which is a combination in form as > well as in name, was in use at the National Armory during my service there. > Its great advantage over form B is the greater space it affords for > inserting the names of employments upon which the workman has been engaged. > It also permits the use of a smaller time unit, and consequently of a more > exact definition of its record ; for in form B the small space allotted for > a description of the work, and the need of re-writing it every day tends > naturally to the consolidation of entries ; whereas in form C an entry once > made stands good for the whole month, provided that the workman always calls > the same work by the same name. Sequentially Metcalfe saw a series of objections against the existing time books registration (based on form B and C): > # The workman has to remember so suddenly all the jobs he has worked on > during the day, that he is very apt to make mistakes by lumping different > jobs under one head ; or by calling the same work by different names, or > different work by the same name on different days. # He is apt to use > general terms loosely, charging his time, say, to \\" Miss. Repairs,\\" \\" Shop > Fixtures,\\" \\" Jobbing,\\" etc., instead of giving it definite names by which > its exact nature may be hereafter distinguished. # In case the workman is > absent, during all or part of the day, there is nothing but the memory of > the foreman to rely upon as to the fact. For example, the workman may be > marked \\" absent \\" when present, or may be credited with some time when > absent ; in neither case will the error be discovered until the pay-roll is > signed, nor even then unless the workman has kept his own time, and unless > in the latter instance he has been honest enough to forego the advantage > given by the foreman's mistake. # Besides such errors in stating the gross > amount of time, the following mistakes are not infrequent in the > distribution of the time: In form B, the foreman, being cramped for room if > he has many entries to make on one line, is led to abbreviate them or to > condense them, so as to save himself trouble. Metcalfe main concern was, that he was unable to account for costs within the workshops,Reid, William H. \\"The Development of Henry Metcalfe's Card System of Shop Returns at Frankford Arsenal, 1880-1881.\\" Journal of Management 12.3 (1986): 415-423. and as main reason he saw the lack of written records.Yates, J. \\"For the record: The embodiment of organizational memory, 1850-1920. \\" Business and Economic History 19.1 (1990): 172-182. = Factory accounting, late 19th century = With the further development of machine shops into machine factories late 19th century, a new type of accounting, called factory accounting, emerged which to related to that new more complex practice. In the 1886 Captain Henry Metcalfe was the first, to proposed a new system for piece work in the machine shop. This system introduced an additional service card for the direct registration of working time spend on the work floor. Metcalfe (1886) explained: Service Card, Frankford Arsenal 1886, Time Book and Return of Work done in Machine Shop, Frankford Arsenal, 1885 > A man working on piece work, who has completed a suitable batch of pieces, > makes out a ticket to correspond, and gives it with the pieces made to the > foreman or inspector. If the work receives the inspector's approval, he > punches the service card and forwards it with the other cards. Whatever > deductions are necessary, are indicated on the face of the card, so that it > may tell its own story completely. The amount space may be filled, or not, > at pleasure; it is for convenience in saving recomputation. > Besides making a charge for his labor, it is almost as necessary that the > piece workman shall inform the office of how much time he has spent on his > work, so as to guide the office in future adjustments of the tarif... > ... The cards go to the Cost Clerk and are shuffled, first, by names of > workman ; second, by shop-order numbers under each name. The time is then > entered in the time book... opposite to the shop-orders on which the man has > been employed. This is to enable each workman's wages to be charged to the > proper appropriation....Metcalfe, (1885. p. 72.) In Metcalfe's proposed system the time book is no longer register for the primary registration of labour time. The time spend is first recorded on a \\"service\\" or labor record card. About the use of the service cards in relation to the time books Metcalfe (1885) further explained: > When the service cards, duly stamped by the foreman, are received by the > cost clerk, he sorts them first by names if they require it, and then by > shop-orders, and enters the gross results under each shop-order on the time > book... Except for piece workers, the time book carries the subdivision of > the order no further; details of the employment must be looked for on the > service cards.Metcalfe (1885, p. 272) Another system for time recording in railways was described by Marshall Monroe Kirkman in his The science of railways, Vol 9. 1895. In this system a division was made in a general time book and several specialized time books for different sorts of employees: Railways, General Time Book, 1907 Time Book of Locomotive Engineers, 1907 > A general time book should be kept by each foreman of the force he employs; > it must be closed and sent forward to the proper officer on the first day of > the month. Before sending it, however, the foreman should enter the amount > on his \\"report of supplies received and expenses incurred,\\" as already > directed.Kirkman (1895, p. 113) In Kirkman's system different people were involved in governing the labor practices in employing labour, keep up the time and make up the accounts. Kirkman first explained the theory of the subject, before taking up specific regulations necessary In handling the labor of a great corporation: > The amount that a railroad expends for labor is so great that the rendering > of accurate returns in connection therewith, including the making of true > and faithful pay rolls, is a matter of the utmost importance. > Wherever men are engaged, whether at shops, roundhouses, yards, warehouses, > storehouses, depots of supply, upon the track, at stations, upon trains, or > at any other place, intelligent provision must be made for keeping accurate, > account of the time they work, whether the work is done by the hour, day, > month or piece. Otherwise It cannot but follow that injustice will result, > either to the employee or to the company....Kirman (1895, p. 121) And furthermore: > ... the details (distribution) of each man's time should also pass through > the hands of the local officials. These details are shown in the time book; > this book should accompany or follow the pay roll.... The timebook is then > ready for use in making the pay roll... The correctness of each time book > should be formally certified by the timekeeper (i.e. person who makes it) as > follows: 'I hereby certify that this time book is correct.' This certificate > should be signed not only by the person who actually takes the time, but by > the official who is immediately in charge; thus, at shops it should > be.Kirman (1895, p. 131) In the 1907 revised edition of this work, Kirkman presented different specialized time books for Bridge and Building; for Freight Trainman; for Locomotive Engineers; for Passenger Trainman; and for Tracks.Kirkman (1895/1907) = Fully developed system becomes obsolete, first part 20th century = Early 20th century the time book has become a regular tool of management, sometimes in the shape of a loose leaf binder.American Machinist. Vol. 26. (1903). p. 1599 The handling the labor accounts, however, keeps causing great difficulties as Kirkman (1907) explained, and therefor he introduced the track time book.: Track Time (and Distribution) Book, 1907. > In regard to handling the labor accounts for work performed by section > foremen and others, there has been great difficulty experienced, not only in > accurately ascertaining how much time each man works, but the class of work > he has been engaged upon. The form of the track time book - very clearly > shows both.* It has been in use many years, but has been amended from time > to time, as experience and new things suggested Improvement. The main point > in connection with it — as in the case of material — is that every section > foreman can keep the account of work performed, and what it was performed > on, with ease and little labor, leaving It to the accountants at > headquarters to determine the cost and sum up the total.Kirkman (1907) And furthermore: > By reference to this time book it will be seen that the labor of section men > can be apportioned to all the various operating, construction and other > accounts that come within the compass of their duties and this with such > facility that any section foreman can perform the clerical work accurately, > and with so little time that it will take nothing practically from his daily > duties. Thus, when the day is over, he will enter opposite the name of each > man the total number of hours he has worked, and opposite that, under > appropriate columns provided therefor, how many hours are chargeable to each > of the various operating, construction or other accounts upon which the man > has been engaged. Nothing could be more simple or more comprehensive.Kirkman > (1907, p. 106) In his 1908 Cost Keeping and Management Engineering Halbert Gillette presented a cost keeping system and its application to sewer work, which incorporated an advanced type of time book, which he called time sheet. Although the form was named time sheet, it was actually a fully developed time book, and not a modern time sheet. This system was in use at the Moore-Mansfield Construction Company and the Mansfield Engineering Company from Indianapolis, Indiana, an engineering designing and general contracting office. Gillette explained the system as follows: > The essential and fundamental feature of the system depends upon the form of > the time sheet used (front view of time sheet (first image), and back view > (second image)). The time sheet is folded when in use by the timekeeper and > carried in a cover, making the same of book size, and practically the same > form as the ordinary time book. On the left hand side of the front appears > the time sheet in the usual form. Time Sheet, front, 1909. (fig. 65) Time Sheet, back, 1909 (fig. 66) > This time sheet is arranged so that it may be used for a gang reporting time > weekly, and is also used where the time sheet is turned in each day, in > which latter case the lines under the column dates are ignored and the time > placed in the total hour column. On the left hand side appears first the > timekeeper's check column. > The instructions to the timekeeper on the back of the sheet (second image) > are probably sufficiently clear, although it might be added that where the > time sheet is used as a weekly report, as is generally the case, where the > gang is small or where the work is unimportant, the time is checked and > divided by means of the four squares under each date and opposite each name, > each square thus representing one-fourth of a day. > In the case of the time sheet as illustrated, the distributions shown are > for a sewer job and the particular distributions required are shown printed > in by means of a rubber stamp. Each distribution thereby for this job shows > a particular key letter although the same letter may not mean the same thing > on any two jobs, but reference is made to the rubber stamp heading on each > contract to determine the meaning of such letter...Halbert Gillette, R.T. > Dana. Cost keeping and Management Engineering. 1908. p. 164-193 > This form of timekeeping would be of value because of the system of > uniformity alone, even if no regard were given to the other features > mentioned, although the above companies using this report are satisfied that > they are securing more valuable data by this form than they would have ever > been able to do by previous forms used. The value of the uniform time sheet > lies in the education of the timekeepers, resulting in a more efficient > working force. Under the old system with individual time sheets, prepared > especially for each job, the forms of the time sheets were many and various, > and, for this very reason timekeepers presumed to incorporate their own > ideas and make changes and innovations, resulting in a bunch of data that > required hours, and generally the personal attendance of the timekeepers, to > work out. > Passing from the time sheets, (see figures) pay rolls, and the cost record > book, the next feature of the system of information or cost data consists of > progress charts. These of course, will vary with any job according to the > character of same, and, as they are used by nearly every large construction > company, it will only be necessary to say that blue prints are prepared > (generally blue line prints) upon which the timekeeper is able to color in > the work completed each day of the week, marking dates thereon and turning > such charts into the office.

In his 1913 Principles of factory cost keeping by Edward P. Moxey one chapter is devoted to \\"Accounting for Labour,\\" whereby different Methods of Recording Time are described.Moxey, Edward Preston. Principles of factory cost keeping. Ronald Press Company, 1913; 1920. Chapter III. in the course of the 20th century the discipline of recording work time started to alter as the following quote from the dressmaking shop A. & L. Tirocchi in Providence, Rhode Island from 1915 to 1947 revealed: > Good payroll records are a necessity for any business. One of the > fundamental types of record is the time book, with printed forms to record > the hours worked by employees on a weekly basis. A. & L.

It originally aired on October 20, 2011. The episode was written by Julie Plec and Caroline Dries and directed by Rob Hardy. Plot Elena (Nina Dobrev) starts training with Alaric (Matt Davis) to be able to protect herself from vampires, while Rebekah (Claire Holt) moves in with Stefan salvatore (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) as Klaus (Joseph Morgan) left the town and left her behind. Damon, Elena, Caroline (Candice Accola) and Alaric try to find a way to capture Stefan Salvatore, and Tyler (Michael Trevino) joins them. When he hears what they are planning to do he does not agree as it is not in Klaus’ interest. Damon realizes that Tyler is sired to Klaus and he knocks him down so he will not destroy their plan. Caroline takes Tyler home while the rest continue with their plan. Matt (Zach Roerig) keeps seeing Vicki (Kayla Ewell) who tries to convince him to do a spell ritual to bring her back. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) sees Matt talking alone and he realizes that he still sees Vicki. Anna (Malese Jow) tells Jeremy that Matt should not listen to Vicki and not bring her back because something bad will happen. Jeremy informs Bonnie (Kat Graham) about it and Bonnie tries to find Matt before he tries to do the ritual. Meanwhile, Matt completes the ritual while Vicki guides him on what to do. They are both happy that the ritual has worked, but Vicki reveals that she had a deal with the witch from the other side to kill Elena on her return, as Elena is the key for Klaus to create more hybrids. Matt tries to stop Vicki but without success, so he calls Bonnie to tell her what he did. Bonnie finds him and they try to reverse the spell so Vicki can go back to the other side. At the bonfire party, Elena pretends to be drunk to fool Stefan while Damon keeps Rebekah occupied. Elena manages to lead Stefan away from the others and Alaric shoots him with vervain. They put him in the car and try to leave, but Vicki sets the car on fire with Elena and Stefan trapped inside. Alaric manages to get Elena out, then Elena helps Stefan get out before the car explodes. Bonnie manages to send Vicki back before she does anything else. Meanwhile, Katherine tries to wake Mikael (Sebastian Roché). She manages to do it and she asks him if he really knows how to kill Klaus. Mikael says that he does, that he will kill Klaus and asks Katherine to unchain him. When she does, Mikael tells her that he does not feed on human blood; when she asks what he feeds on, he grabs her and begins feeding on her. The episode ends with Jeremy and Anna realizing that they now can feel each other’s touch, while Mason Lockwood appears at the Salvatore house and hits Damon.

See the through- silicon vias (TSV). High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is a high-speed computer memory interface for 3D-stacked SDRAM from Samsung, AMD and SK Hynix. It is used in conjunction with high-performance graphics accelerators, network devices and in some supercomputers. (Such as the NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA and Fujitsu A64FX)ISSCC 2014 Trends page 118 \\"High-Bandwidth DRAM\\" The first HBM memory chip was produced by SK Hynix in 2013, and the first devices to use HBM were the AMD Fiji GPUs in 2015. High Bandwidth Memory has been adopted by JEDEC as an industry standard in October 2013.High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) DRAM (JESD235), JEDEC, October 2013 The second generation, HBM2, was accepted by JEDEC in January 2016.  Technology  HBM achieves higher bandwidth while using less power in a substantially smaller form factor than DDR4 or GDDR5.HBM: Memory Solution for Bandwidth-Hungry Processors , Joonyoung Kim and Younsu Kim, SK Hynix // Hot Chips 26, August 2014 This is achieved by stacking up to eight DRAM dies (thus being a Three-dimensional integrated circuit), including an optional base die (often a silicon interposerhttps://semiengineering.com/whats-next-for-high-bandwidth- memory/https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced- packaging/2-5d-ic/interposers/) with a memory controller, which are interconnected by through-silicon vias (TSVs) and microbumps. The HBM technology is similar in principle but incompatible with the Hybrid Memory Cube interface developed by Micron Technology.Where Are DRAM Interfaces Headed? // EETimes, 4/18/2014 \\"The Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) and a competing technology called High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) are aimed at computing and networking applications. These approaches stack multiple DRAM chips atop a logic chip.\\" HBM memory bus is very wide in comparison to other DRAM memories such as DDR4 or GDDR5. An HBM stack of four DRAM dies (4Hi) has two 128bit channels per die for a total of 8 channels and a width of 1024 bits in total. A graphics card/GPU with four 4Hi HBM stacks would therefore have a memory bus with a width of 4096 bits. In comparison, the bus width of GDDR memories is 32 bits, with 16 channels for a graphics card with a 512bit memory interface.Highlights of the HighBandwidth Memory (HBM) Standard. Mike O’Connor, Sr. Research Scientist, NVidia // The Memory Forum – June 14, 2014 HBM supports up to 4 GB per package. The larger number of connections to the memory, relative to DDR4 or GDDR5, required a new method of connecting the HBM memory to the GPU (or other processor). AMD and Nvidia have both used purpose- built silicon chips, called interposers, to connect the memory and GPU. This interposer has the added advantage of requiring the memory and processor to be physically close, decreasing memory paths. However, as semiconductor device fabrication is significantly more expensive than printed circuit board manufacture, this adds cost to the final product. = Interface = The HBM DRAM is tightly coupled to the host compute die with a distributed interface. The interface is divided into independent channels. The channels are completely independent of one another and are not necessarily synchronous to each other. The HBM DRAM uses a wide-interface architecture to achieve high- speed, low-power operation. The HBM DRAM uses a 500 MHz differential clock CK_t / CK_c (where the suffix \\"_t\\" denotes the \\"true\\", or \\"positive\\", component of the differential pair, and \\"_c\\" stands for the \\"complementary\\" one). Commands are registered at the rising edge of CK_t, CK_c. Each channel interface maintains a 128bit data bus operating at double data rate (DDR). HBM supports transfer rates of 1 GT/s per pin (transferring 1 bit), yielding an overall package bandwidth of 128 GB/s. = HBM2 = The second generation of High Bandwidth Memory, HBM2, also specifies up to eight dies per stack and doubles pin transfer rates up to 2 GT/s. Retaining 1024bit wide access, HBM2 is able to reach 256 GB/s memory bandwidth per package. The HBM2 spec allows up to 8 GB per package. HBM2 is predicted to be especially useful for performance-sensitive consumer applications such as virtual reality. On January 19, 2016, Samsung announced early mass production of HBM2, at up to 8 GB per stack. SK Hynix also announced availability of 4 GB stacks in August 2016.  HBM2E  In late 2018, JEDEC announced an update to the HBM2 specification, providing for increased bandwidth and capacities. Up to 307 GB/s per stack (2.5 Tbit/s effective data rate) is now supported in the official specification, though products operating at this speed had already been available. Additionally, the update added support for 12Hi stacks (12 dies) making capacities of up to 24 GB per stack possible. On March 20, 2019, Samsung announced their Flashbolt HBM2E, featuring eight dies per stack, a transfer rate of 3.2 GT/s, providing a total of 16 GB and 410 GB/s per stack. August 12, 2019, SK Hynix announced their HBM2E, featuring eight dies per stack, a transfer rate of 3.6 GT/s, providing a total of 16 GB and 460 GB/s per stack. On 2 July 2020, SK Hynix announced that mass production has begun. = HBMnext = In late 2020, Micron unveiled that the HBM2E standard would be updated and alongside that they unveiled the next standard known as HBMnext. Originally proposed as HBM3, this is a big generational leap from HBM2 and the replacement to HBM2E. This new VRAM will come to the market in the Q4 of 2022. This will likely introduce a new architecture as the naming suggests. While the architecture might be overhauled, leaks point toward the performance to be similar to that of the updated HBM2E standard. This RAM is likely to be used mostly in data center GPUs.  History  = Background = Die-stacked memory was initially commercialized in the flash memory industry. Toshiba introduced a NAND flash memory chip with eight stacked dies in April 2007, followed by Hynix Semiconductor introducing a NAND flash chip with 24 stacked dies in September 2007. 3D-stacked random-access memory (RAM) using through- silicon via (TSV) technology was commercialized by Elpida Memory, which developed the first 8GB DRAM chip (stacked with four DDR3 SDRAM dies) in September 2009, and released it in June 2011. In 2011, SK Hynix introduced 16GB DDR3 memory (40nm class) using TSV technology, Samsung Electronics introduced 3D-stacked 32GB DDR3 (30nm class) based on TSV in September, and then Samsung and Micron Technology announced TSV-based Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) technology in October. = Development = AMD Fiji, the first GPU to use HBM The development of High Bandwidth Memory began at AMD in 2008 to solve the problem of ever-increasing power usage and form factor of computer memory. Over the next several years, AMD developed procedures to solve die- stacking problems with a team led by Senior AMD Fellow Bryan Black.High- Bandwidth Memory (HBM) from AMD: Making Beautiful Memory, AMD To help AMD realize their vision of HBM, they enlisted partners from the memory industry, particularly Korean company SK Hynix, which had prior experience with 3D-stacked memory, as well as partners from the interposer industry (Taiwanese company UMC) and packaging industry (Amkor Technology and ASE). The development of HBM was completed in 2013, when SK Hynix built the first HBM memory chip. HBM was adopted as industry standard JESD235 by JEDEC in October 2013, following a proposal by AMD and SK Hynix in 2010. High volume manufacturing began at a Hynix facility in Icheon, South Korea, in 2015. The first GPU utilizing HBM was the AMD Fiji which was released in June 2015 powering the AMD Radeon R9 Fury X. AMD Ushers in a New Era of PC Gaming including World’s First Graphics Family with Revolutionary HBM Technology In January 2016, Samsung Electronics began early mass production of HBM2. The same month, HBM2 was accepted by JEDEC as standard JESD235a. The first GPU chip utilizing HBM2 is the Nvidia Tesla P100 which was officially announced in April 2016.  Future  At Hot Chips in August 2016, both Samsung and Hynix announced the next generation HBM memory technologies. Both companies announced high performance products expected to have increased density, increased bandwidth, and lower power consumption. Samsung also announced a lower-cost version of HBM under development targeting mass markets. Removing the buffer die and decreasing the number of TSVs lowers cost, though at the expense of a decreased overall bandwidth (200 GB/s).

Both types had quite different circumstances and goals. Small wheel tractors appeared after World War I, during a time of new opportunity. Large-wheel tractors appeared after World War II, during a period of austerity. = Small wheel tractors = Lister Auto-Truck The first monowheel tractors appeared in the 1920s, as a result of technical developments in small petrol engines. These had been driven by improving engine technology, particularly for motorbikes. Such engines now represented an affordable and portable power source. An entire powertrain could be constructed as a single monobloc unit, carried on a single wheel, and this mounted onto a trailer through a large swivel bearing. The engine and its drivetrain represented a relatively high technology machine for the period, although its trailer could be much more crude. The engine units were made by the new light engineering works of the time, such as R A Lister, and custom- made trailers could be produced for a wide range of tasks by less sophisticated workshops, down to village blacksmiths. The completed vehicles had small wheels and little suspension. This limited their use to smooth floors, such as factories and railway stations, rather than muddy farm tracks or even the roads of the period. In most cases they were replacing hand barrows. Their advantage was that they were faster than a loaded barrow, limited to around the same speed as walking with an empty barrow and they only required one operator, no matter what load. Loads of up to 2 tons could be carried. Some vehicle were driven by a driver riding or standing on-board with direct tiller steering, others were pedestrian controlled by walking alongside. All were highly manoeuvrable, the full swivel of the self-contained engine unit allowing them to turn within their own length. Examples include: * Lister Auto-Truck * Reliance of Heckmondwike, from 1935, originally the Redshaw Lister Woollen Machinery Co. * Salsbury Motors 'Turret Truck' of 1946. This used a cylindrical motor enclosure that could be rotated completely to allow reverse. The 6hp motor and continuously variable transmission were based on Salsbury's pre-war scooter designs. = Large wheel tractors = Opperman Motocart After World War II, tractors were a well-developed and widespread piece of agricultural machinery, although they were still expensive. Some items, such as their large rubber tyres, were particularly difficult as they relied on imported raw materials. Britain, for some years after the war, was in a period of austerity and currency controls applied to overseas purchases. An obvious simplification was to take the technology of the tractor, but use only a single wheel and a smaller engine. Many of the large monowheel tractor's tasks would be in either replacing horse carts, or else as a cheaper substitute for more conventional tractors. S. E. Opperman of Boreham Wood did this in 1945 with their Opperman Motocart. This used a tricycle cart chassis of welded steel sheet, drawn by a tractor wheel mounted on a single small- diameter kingpin above it. The entire powertrain was carried on the wheel hub, including an JAP or Douglas single cylinder petrol engine. Although there was still no suspension other than the large front tractor tyre, the Motocart's wheel steering and large wheels allowed a greater speed than other carts, up to (for legal reasons). Many were road registered, although not provided with full lighting. Using the full range of low gears, a load of up to tons on trial was carried up steep hills. A similar, although smaller, vehicle was patented in the US. This was intended as a manoeuvrable light tipper for construction sites. The monowheel concept continued into the 1960s, although now aimed more at \\"colonial\\" overseas use. In 1966 the British government through the NRDC was working on a design developed for the National Institute of Agricultural Engineers. Examples include the Opperman Motocart.

The Third Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature London, UK:Springer-Verlag, 1994, pp. 249–257. The considered problem is decomposed into subproblems. These subproblems are optimised separately while exchanging information in order to solve the complete problem. An optimisation algorithm, usually but not necessarily an evolutionary algorithm, is embedded in C3 for optimising those subproblems. The nature of the embedded optimisation algorithm determines whether C3's behaviour is deterministic or stochastic. The C3 optimisation algorithm was originally designed for simulation-based optimisation but it can be used for global optimisation problems in general.Glorieux E., Svensson B., Danielsson F., Lennartson B.: \\"Constructive cooperative coevolution for large-scale global optimisation\\", Journal of Heuristics, 2017. Its strength over other optimisation algorithms, specifically cooperative coevolution, is that it is better able to handle non-separable optimisation problems.Glorieux E., Danielsson F., Svensson B., Lennartson B.: \\"Constructive cooperative coevolutionary optimisation for interacting production stations\\", International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 2015. An improved version was proposed later, called the Improved Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary Differential Evolution (C3iDE), which removes several limitations with the previous version. A novel element of C3iDE is the advanced initialisation of the subpopulations. C3iDE initially optimises the subpopulations in a partially co-adaptive fashion. During the initial optimisation of a subpopulation, only a subset of the other subcomponents is considered for the co-adaptation. This subset increases stepwise until all subcomponents are considered. This makes C3iDE very effective on large-scale global optimisation problems (up to 1000 dimensions) compared to cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (CC) and Differential evolution.Glorieux E., Svensson B., Danielsson F., Lennartson B., \\"Improved Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary Differential Evolution for Large-Scale Optimisation\\", 2015 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, December 2015 The improved algorithm has then been adapted for multi-objective optimization.Glorieux E., Svensson B., Danielsson F., Lennartson B., \\"Multi-objective constructive cooperative coevolutionary optimization of robotic press-line tending\\", Engineering Optimization, Vol. 49, Iss. 10, 2017, pp 1685-1703 Algorithm As shown in the pseudo code below, an iteration of C3 exists of two phases. In Phase I, the constructive phase, a feasible solution for the entire problem is constructed in a stepwise manner. Considering a different subproblem in each step. After the final step, all subproblems are considered and a solution for the complete problem has been constructed. This constructed solution is then used as the initial solution in Phase II, the local improvement phase. The CC algorithm is employed to further optimise the constructed solution. A cycle of Phase II includes optimising the subproblems separately while keeping the parameters of the other subproblems fixed to a central blackboard solution. When this is done for each subproblem, the found solution are combined during a \\"collaboration\\" step, and the best one among the produced combinations becomes the blackboard solution for the next cycle. In the next cycle, the same is repeated. Phase II, and thereby the current iteration, are terminated when the search of the CC algorithm stagnates and no significantly better solutions are being found. Then, the next iteration is started. At the start of the next iteration, a new feasible solution is constructed, utilising solutions that were found during the Phase I of the previous . This constructed solution is then used as the initial solution in Phase II in the same way as in the first iteration. This is repeated until one of the termination criteria for the optimisation is reached, e.g. a maximum number of evaluations. {Sphase1} ← ∅ while termination criteria not satisfied do if {Sphase1} = ∅ then {Sphase1} ← SubOpt(∅, 1) end if while pphase1 not completely constructed do pphase1 ← GetBest({Sphase1}) {Sphase1} ← SubOpt(pphase1, inext subproblem) end while pphase2 ← GetBest({Sphase1}) while not stagnate do {Sphase2} ← ∅ for each subproblem i do {Sphase2} ← SubOpt(pphase2,i) end for {Sphase2} ← Collab({Sphase2}) pphase2 ← GetBest({Sphase2}) end while end while Multi-objective optimisation The multi-objective version of the C3 algorithm is a Pareto-based algorithm which uses the same divide-and-conquer strategy as the single-objective C3 optimisation algorithm . The algorithm again starts with the advanced constructive initial optimisations of the subpopulations, considering an increasing subset of subproblems. The subset increases until the entire set of all subproblems is included. During these initial optimisations, the subpopulation of the latest included subproblem is evolved by a multi- objective evolutionary algorithm. For the fitness calculations of the members of the subpopulation, they are combined with a collaborator solution from each of the previously optimised subpopulations. Once all subproblems' subpopulations have been initially optimised, the multi-objective C3 optimisation algorithm continues to optimise each subproblem in a round-robin fashion, but now collaborator solutions from all other subproblems' subspopulations are combined with the member of the subpopulation that is being evaluated. The collaborator solution is selected randomly from the solutions that make up the Pareto-optimal front of the subpopulation. The fitness assignment to the collaborator solutions is done in an optimistic fashion (i.e. an \\"old\\" fitness value is replaced when the new one is better). Applications The constructive cooperative coevolution algorithm has been applied to different types of problems, e.g. a set of standard benchmark functions,Glorieux E., Danielsson F., Svensson B., Lennartson B., \\"Optimisation of interacting production stations using a Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary approach\\", 2014 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE), pp.322-327, August 2014, Taipei, Taiwan optimisation of sheet metal press linesGlorieux E., Svensson B., Danielsson F., Lennartson B., \\"A Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary Algorithm Applied to Press Line Optimisation\\", Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing (FAIM), pp.909-917, May 2014, San Antonio, Texas, USA and interacting production stations.

He was succeeded by Louis- Charles-Auguste Hébert. Early life Nicolas Champenois was born in the month of April 1734. He belonged to the diocese of Reims where he served the ministry, especially Chaourse parish. He was probably priest even before he entered the Paris Foreign Missions Society Seminary on 13 July 1776. He was sent to the Malabar Mission (Pondicherry) and reached there on 13 January 1777. He had been first in-charge of an inland mission. Towards the end of the same year, became procurator of the Mission. Later he became the Superior of the Major Seminary. Papal brief dated 14 June 1785 made him the Coadjutor Superior of Karnatic Mission with Doliche as his titular see. He was consecrated by Pierre Brigot on 5 November 1786 in Pondicherry. Because of the ill health of his predecessor, he was in charge of the diocese immediately. As a Bishop One of his first acts was to prevent Karaikal in Malabar mission to be entrusted to the Apostolic Prefecture run by the Capuchins. He obtained from Rome by decree of 19 July 1788, the power over all the Catholics of the diocese of Mylapore inhabiting the lands where the bishop of Mylapore could not carry out his jurisdiction. He also received greater powers than before regarding marriage dispensations, various indulgences and permission to recite some offices. An agreement signed on 17 September 1793, the Capuchins Apostolic Prefect, Fr. Benjamin and Bishop Champagne agreed to iron out the then existing jurisdictional difficulties by mutually transmitting their powers. Customs of India sometimes raising doubts that left no worry of some missionaries, the bishop gave them advice marked mindedness and based on experience. He built in Pondicherry, close to the cathedral, a new seminar and a small college. This later became the Petit Seminaire Higher Secondary School. He also completed the construction work of the Cathedral which was begun by the Jesuits in 1770 on the same place in which it was destroyed in 1736. He consecrated it on 20 June 1791. In 1792 Mgr.Champenois was forced by the British soldiers to sing Te Deum in the Place d'Armes, where they had to plant a tree of liberty, but he refused. The soldiers threatened him, but he replied: \\"My body is in your hands, my heart is in God's\\". He was forced to leave French territory and retire to San Thome. He returned to Pondicherry few months later, when the English had taken this city. In September 1794 he went to visit places of his mission. He stopped at length at Trichinopoly and in Madurai. The Goans accused him and caused him many trouble; eventually he was forced to leave the place. The English Government, at their request, said not to recognize other jurisdiction in the country, than that of the Bishop of Mylapour. In order to end this situation, he tried unsuccessfully to get the title of Vicar Apostolic: the Holy See maintained the status quo. At that time, the English had such distrust of the French priests, whom they refused Mgr. Champenois necessary passport to visit the two missions that Rome entrusted to him by the brief of 23 August 1796: one with the Capuchins of Patna, the other among the missionaries of Madras in order to bring harmony among these apostolic workers, and to put an end to the administrative difficulties. Even while governing the mission, he administered a few parishes in Pondicherry, especially Ariancoupam where we can frequently find his name on the parish registers from 23 December 1798 to the year 1809. Death Around 1805, his health began to deteriorate. He asked for a coadjutor. Mgr. Hébert was named as his coadjutor. Because of falling down on April 27, 1810 his health became even worse. He died in Pondicherry on 30 October 1811. It was worn out with mortification and was exhausted. He insisted on continuing his austerities; He continued to fast even when the Roman Pontiff granted him special dispensation. His official biography at MEP archives end as follows: \\"His administration was wise, prudent, and with very limited resources, he managed to deal with the most pressing needs\\".

Poblacion, Guiguinto, Bulacan, Philippines. The parish church, under the aegis of Saint Ildephonsus, Bishop of Toledo, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos. History =Parish History= Guiguinto was founded by the Augustinian Friars as a visita of nearby town Caruya (now Balagtas) on 31 October 1607 and placed under the advocation of Saint Ildephonsus although it has been mentioned in the records as early as 1591. On 31 October 1617, it was annexed to the parish of Bulakan. In 1621, the convent of Guiguinto was declared independent from its matrix with Father Bernabe de Villalobos as first parish priest. However, it was again attached to the convent of Bigaa in 1633. Records tell that the convent of Guiguinto was not as affluent as its neighbors. In 1641, it was exempted from paying its dues to the San Agustin Monastery in Manila due to lack of funds. A similar incident occurred in 1669. =Edifice History= The exact date of construction of the present parochial structure could not be identified clearly. It is assumed that the ministers of Guiguinto were only able to erect parochial structures after 1621. Moreover, records tell that the convent of Guiguinto applied for the collection of rice for the construction of a church in 1734. This leads to the estimate that construction of the present church may have started by the latter part of the 17th century but was still unfinished by 1734. Father Buzeta, parish priest in 1832, built the road to Bigaa and the Catholic cemetery in 1848. The church and convent of Guiguinto sustained great damage from an earthquake in 1863. Repair works were still being conducted in 1864. Between 1955 and the early 1960s, the church of Guiguinto was renovated under Father Carlos E. Bernardo. The remodeling, which involved the plastering of the exterior, repainting of the entire structure and construction of a new altarpiece, reportedly costs ₱ 50, 000.00. Architecture The façade is divided into three vertical sections by four sets of Doric columns. The columns, which is said to be added for ornamentation purposes, supports a triangular pediment adorned by an oculus and volutes on the end. Geometric motifs can also be found on the plastered side portals. Saint's niches, stained glass and an Augustinian emblem add details to the otherwise plain façade. To the right of the church rises the four-level, octagonal bell tower which features similar designs as the façade. Two bells can be found on the tower: one cast by Hilario Sunico in 1889 and was installed by Father Pedro Quiros and a smaller one dating 1887.

Life Riedel starter Riedel APU fitted on a BMW 003 Riedel studied mechanical engineering and worked in the 1930s, first with Ardie and then at Victoria. During the Second World War, he developed a starter engine (\\"Riedel starter\\") for the first German jet engine-powered combat aircraft's powerplants. The starter system, which consisted of a Riedel 10 hp (7.5 kW) two-stroke flat engine hidden in the intake, essentially functioned as a pioneering example of an auxiliary power unit (APU) for starting a jet engine. A hole in the extreme nose of the centrebody contained a manual pull-handle (except for the BMW 003 engine) which started the piston engine, which in turn rotated the compressor. Two small petrol tanks were fitted in the annular intake. The engine was considered an extreme short stroke (bore / stroke: 70 mm / 35 mm = 2:1) design so it could fit in the hub of the turbine compressor. For reduction it had an integrated planetary gear. It was produced in Victoria in Nuremberg and served as a starter for the operational German Junkers Jumo 004 and BMW 003 jet engines, placed on the centreline of each of these, and was also meant for use on the Heinkel HeS 011 experimental jet engine, but relocated above the intake passage within a Heinkel-designed prefabricated sheet metal component instead. In 1947, he founded the Riedel Motoren AG in Immenstadt, where he designed the light motorcycle Imme R100 which was manufactured in series. By the end of 1951 12,000 units were built. In December 1949, Riedel began design work for the scooter Till Riedel, however due to the insolvency of Riedel Motoren AG did not go into production in October 1951. In development was also an Imme with a two-cylinder engine. Victoria Swing 200 (1955) After the bankruptcy of Riedel Motoren AG he went back to Victoria, where he developed the models Victoria Swing and the 200 cc two-stroke scooter Victoria Peggy.

These were the very first findings of such skulls in the East, thus sparking interest in the West. = Marche Expedition = Local explorers found these bones in a cave of one of the islands of the Tres Reyes Islands of Marinduque, PhilippinesThe first systematic exploration in Marinduque was done by the French explorer, Antoine- Alfred Marche, in 1881. With the help of his allies and the locals, Marche explored the Isle of Grottos (Island of caves). During his explorations, numerous jars, dishes, figurines, golden jewelry, bones, coffins and ceramics were unearthed in several parts of the province. These findings came mostly from Boac, Islet Tres Reyes, Bathala Cave, and Gasan. Most of the artefacts are currently contained in Musée du Quai Branly and Musée de L'Homme, both located in Paris, while some are in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.  Notable discoveries  One of his notable discoveries would be the wooden coffins excavated from a sepulchral cave in Marinduque. These coffins had carvings of crocodile images in its lids, similar to those found in Nosy Loapasana, Madagascar. Another would be his discovery of deformed skulls in the caves of Los Tres Reyes, Pamintaan and Macayan. These deformed skulls were similar to the ones discovered by Fedor Jagor in the 1860s. Such deformation in the skulls are a result of compression of the head, of a newborn child between two boards. This practice was done to make the head appear more elongated rather than round, and the forehead more flat, a feature considered as a “special mark of beauty” during the ancient times. Astoundingly, the same skull deformation was evident in those of ancient Mayan, Egyptian, and Incan people, despite not having any contact amongst each other. Marche’s further excavations were due to his “intoxication” when he excavated the Pamintaan Cave, a cave believed to be a burial site. In here, several antiques, varying from Chinese urns, vases, gold ornaments, and such, were excavated. A publication of Alfred Marche’s expedition in Marinduque provides evidence for the Morionistic culture of the province during the past. According to this publication, the locals before were very superstitious about places that are yet to be explored. In line with this, they tried to stop Marche to go into the caves for they feared that he would be eaten by the aswang Thus, when he came out safely during the first explorations, they believed that he had an \\"\\" (a pendant or charm) in hand that protected him from the \\"\\". = Chinese Junk Shipwreck = In 1982, the National Museum and the Marine Archaeology Unlimited, Inc. headed an excavation of a shipwreck about  below the surface in the southwest coast of Marinduque. The site was discovered by a local fisherman who was able to retrieve many ceramic pieces even without any diving equipment in the said site.List of wrecks which may be of interest. (2011, February 6). Retrieved October 4, 2015. It is believed that the ship was a Chinese trading galleon from the Ming dynasty. More than 1,100 pieces of artifacts from the site were collected, most of which are porcelain plates, jars, and stoneware[10]. The stoneware jars notably resembled the jars containing dragon designs excavated from the Pamintaan cave. Pinggan, the barangay closest to the shipwreck site, was allegedly named after the findings of the porcelain plates (pinggan- Filipino word for plate). A re-excavation was done years later in the middle of the Pinggan coast and Gaspar Island. = San Isidro Cave and Subterranean River = A hidden cave with a subterranean river was recently discovered in Sta. Cruz, Marinduque. The San Isidro cave system contained small waterfalls gushing from the rocks, stalactites and stalagmites of varied colors and shapes, freshwater shrimps, eels, swallows, and a king cobra that guards the entrance. The cave is yet to be discovered and excavated. = Pilapil Cave = An excavation in Pilapil Cave was made by Alfredo E. Evangelista in 1961. In this excavation, local artefacts were associated with Sung and Yuan sherds. These archaeological records provide evidence for early Chinese contact in the Philippines.  Beliefs and cultures  The present-day Marinduqueños are very much rich in culture and artistry. Some of the traditions being performed today are already centuries old. The future of Marinduque would not have been the same without these \\"present-day artifacts\\". = Religion: Moriones Festival = The locals from Marinduque are very religious people. This can be observed in their festivities. Marinduque is mainly known because of its Moriones Festival, a week-long Lenten event. The term \\"Moriones\\" came from the word which means masks. The main event of the festival is the re-enactment of the story of a Roman soldier named Longinus. It is said that Longinus was a Roman soldier with a blind eye who lived during the time of Jesus Christ. When Jesus was crucified at Golgotta, Longinus was tasked to pierce the ribs of Jesus with a spear to see if He is still alive. When he did this, blood and water spurted out and some went to his eyes. This caused his blind eye to heal and be able to see. When this miracle happened, he run and told everyone about this, and saying the Jesus Christ was really the Saviour. The emperor learned of this and ordered that Longinus be captured. The chase between the Roman soldier and Longinus began. Longinus was then captured and as punishment of blasphemy, Longinus was sentenced to death by having his head cut off. This tragic story first originated in the town of Mogpog, but later on spread to the other towns. = Morionism = Prior to the Spanish Colonization, the natives of Marinduque had paganistic beliefs. Just as in other parts of the Philippines, the belief in supernatural entities such as the anitos, aswangs, and such, was likewise prevalent in the province. However, upon the arrival of the Spaniards, Morionism then blended with their religious teachings, forming a belief that God is the creator of human beings. Morionism centers on the principle that the soul is housed on a perishing, superficial body that must undergo physical and mental tortures in order to attain the purification and glorification of the soul. The existence of such culture is proven by the excavated Pastores (Marinduque anitos) in the Pamintaan Cave. Moreover, the culture documented in a publication on the Marche expedition (as discussed above) better explains Morionism. = Artistry and innovation = Morions are men dressed up like Roman soldiers. They are the main attraction of the famous Moriones Festival of Marinduque The Marinduqueños are very creative, resourceful and crafty. Each mask and armor of the are self-made. In the town of Torrijos, the people are experts in traditional weaving of Buntal fibers into mats and wall decorations. They also create wonderful earthenware from swamp clay. When tourists and (locals coming home from outside the country) come to Marinduque, the people have a special welcoming celebration called \\"\\". The local sing and dance, offer flowers, and place crowns on the heads of the guests. Then they shower coins as a sign of blessing. This is accompanied with music coming from the guitar and sometimes from the , a wooden percussion instrument unique to Marinduque. The province is also a place of delicacies, the most abundant of which are \\"\\" (delicacies made from rice). Marinduque is known for its arrowroot cookies and . = Natural wonders = A journey to Marinduque would not be complete without a visit to the many natural wonders of the province. Marinduque is said to be the Butterfly Capital of the Philippines. Many of the butterfly farms can be found in the town of Gasan. (Gasan was named after the shell \\"\\" which a shell found in the riverside.) Caves are also scattered throughout the province. The Bathala Cave houses bats and pythons, as well as beautiful stalagmites and stalactites. Other caves are Duyay Cave, Talamban Cave, Tarug Cave, Talao Caves, and many more unexplored and undocumented caves. The province also houses many falls, to name a few: Ginaras Falls, Kabugsakan Falls, and Norada Falls. Surrounding the mainland are other islands: Tres Reyes Islands, the Polo, Maniwaya, and Mongpong Islets, Natangco Islet, Salomague Island. Some islands, like the Gaspar Island of the Tres Reyes Islands, have white sand beaches. But if the thought of traveling by boat is scary, there is still white sand beach in Torrijos called the Poctoy White Beach. Marinduque also has an inactive volcano in it, named Mt. Malindig, and is said to be the highest peak of Marinduque. Near Mt. Malindig, natural hot springs can be found. One of these is the Malbog Hot Springs and is said to be able to cure certain diseases, in spite of its foul smell.

History =1966-7= UH-34D at the base in October 1966 3rd Tank Battalion M48 up the Dong Ha River, 6 July 1967 The base was located at the mouth of the Cửa Việt/Thạch Hãn River approximately 16 km north of Quảng Trị and only approximately 10 km south of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The base was first established by the 3rd Marine Division in 1966 as a logistics and support base for Marine units along the DMZ and particularly the Đông Hà Combat Base once the Cửa Việt/Thạch Hãn River had been dredged to allow passage for LCUs. In February 1967 the 12th Marines stationed 6 LVTH-6 at the base. On 18 March an LST ramp opened at the base allowing supplies to be transhipped on LCUs and LCMs to Đông Hà. A petroleum, oil & lubricants (POL) facility was also established at the base, protected by a company from the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines. In April 1967 under the name Operation Napoleon the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion with the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines was tasked with keeping waterways around the base open. On 16 May the base was hit People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) rocket and artillery fire resulting in 5 Marines killed. Throughout the latter part of 1967 the base was subjected to frequent PAVN artillery and rocket fire from north of the DMZ. During the northeast monsoon season the base's LST facility was closed from 7–29 December, limiting the flow of supplies to Marine bases. =1968–71= 2/4 Marines memorial service at Cua Viet Base in 1969 1/9 Marines enjoy the surf during 2 day rest and recreation at Cua Viet beach in 1969 On 20 January 1968 PAVN artillery fire targeted navy boats on the river forcing the closure of the waterway. PAVN artillery fire, mines and fire from the north bank of the river continued to menace shipping for the following days and the Marines suffered 16 dead in clearing out PAVN ambush sites. From 23–26 January the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines launched Operation Badger Catch to secure the north bank of the river and prevent PAVN reinforcements from entering the area. On 24 February the Navy established Task Force Clearwater composed on 20 PBRs plus assorted support ships to keep the river open. On 29 February 3 Marines moved to the base to take control of the newly merged Operation Napoleon/Saline. The Marines and ARVN claimed over 1000 PAVN killed in area during the month of February. On 10 March the base was hit by PAVN artillery, destroying 150 tons of ammunition, damaging numerous buildings and killing 1 American. On 11 April PAVN artillery hit the base's fuel farm destroying 40,000 gallons of petroleum. On 13 June PAVN artillery destroyed 104,000 gallons of petroleum at the base. On 19, 21 and 24 June the base was hit by PAVN artillery fire resulting in the destruction of ammunition and petroleum storage facilities. An in-country rest and recreation center was established at the base and it was used for rehabilitation of Marine units coming in from operations along the DMZ. On 21 February 1969 at 03:15 a U.S. Navy LCM-6 tied up at the base was damaged by an explosion, killing one sailor. At 04:00 two other LCMs were damaged by explosions. At 04:20 an explosive ordinance team detonated another satchel charge attached to an LCM and at 05:48 another explosion hit an LCM. U.S. Navy personnel saw a swimmer in the water and fired on him and at dawn found a dead North Vietnamese swimmer wearing Soviet scuba gear. In September 1969 as part of Operation Keystone Cardinal the 3rd Marine Division began its withdrawal from Vietnam. The 4th Marines assumed responsibility for the Cua Viet area from the 3rd Marines, before departing from Cua Viet themselves on 22 October. The Marines handed over control of their tactical area of operations (including base) to the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division and the ARVN 1st Division. On 15 February 1970 Naval Support Activity Cửa Việt was disbanded and responsibility for the base was handed over to the US Army. =1972–5= In late October 1972 as part of the counteroffensive to the Easter Offensive, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) began attacks north of Quảng Trị to try to regain positions along the south bank of the Cam Lộ/Cửa Việt River. The attacks were met with a stiff PAVN resistance and were stopped at the Thạch Hãn River. A further attack from the coast by the Vietnamese Marines in November made limited gains. By the end of 1972 the Marines and ARVN occupied positions 5 km south of the river. As the ongoing peace negotiations would soon lead to a ceasefire, the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff sought the most advantageous battlefield positions possible and so ordered a further effort to regain the south bank of the Cam Lộ/Cửa Việt River. On 15 January 1973 planning began for a final assault on Cửa Việt . A special combined unit called Task Force Tango was organized, consisting of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Marine Battalions and elements of the 1st Armored Brigade. The task force was put under the command of Colonel Nguyen Thanh Tri, Deputy Commander of the RVN Marine Division. The operation began at 06:55 on 26 January with Task Force Tango advancing in two columns. Besides ARVN firepower, naval gunfire of the United States Seventh Fleet was used to soften the target and hinder PAVN reinforcements. The PAVN put up fierce resistance to the attack, destroying 26 M-48s and M-113s with AT-3 missiles and shooting down two Republic of Vietnam Air Force planes with SA-7 missiles. At 01:45 on 28 January the Marines made a final assault and by 07:00 had broken through the PAVN lines to recapture the base. At 08:00 in accordance with the Paris Peace Accords the ceasefire came into effect and the U.S. stopped all support for Task Force Tango. On the evening of 29 January, the PAVN launched a counterattack against Task Force Tango, and by the next day had succeeded in cutting off its lines of communication and began bombarding the encircled Marines. A Republic of Vietnam Navy LCM was destroyed as it tried to resupply the Marines. The Marines attempted to break out on the early morning of 31 January and the PAVN recaptured the base. Following the capture of the base the PAVN integrated it into their logistics network in northern Quảng Trị Province. During the 1975 Spring Offensive, the PAVN moved the 66th Mechanized Infantry Battalion, 202nd Armored Brigade by rail to Vinh and then by ship to Cửa Việt.

The society is recognized by the International Federation of Operational Research Societies and its subgrouping, the Association of European Operational Research Societies, as the main national society for Operations Research in its country,Member societies: Hungary, IFORS, retrieved 2015-02-23.  Aims and scope  The main aims of the society are to * provide information relevant to the scientific public life in operations research (OR), * spread the OR culture, * build and maintain ties with similar scientific societies at domestic (Bolyai János Mathematical Society, John von Neumann Computer Society) and international (EURO, IFORS) level, * organize domestic and international conferences, workshops. Hungary has a long tradition in cultivating the theory and application of OR. Researchers have contributed to several areas of this scientific discipline. OR is included in the curriculum of college and university education. Among universities that offer OR related courses and also degree it is worth mentioning Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Corvinus University of Budapest, University of Debrecen, Eötvös Loránd University, Óbuda University, University of Pannonia, Széchenyi István University, and University of Szeged. The doctoral (PhD) schools of these universities offer research topics in OR within mathematics, computer science, informatics and engineering. The importance of OR has been recognized also by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS). As a result, HAS has set up the Academic Committee of Operations Research. Many members of the Committee are also members of HORS.  History  Operations Research (OR) was introduced in Hungary by Prof. András Prékopa in 1959\\\\. It rapidly raised considerable interest in academic and industrial circles. The first Hungarian Conference on Operations Research was held in 1967 with over 100 participants. While subsequent conferences were organized on a regular basis the official formation of the Hungarian Operations Research Society (HORS) dates to 1991. The membership consists of ordinary members, students, retired members as well as honorary members and sponsors. Members (except honorary) pay membership fee which makes the society self-supporting.  Governance  The society is governed by the Presidium elected for three years and consisting of a President, Vice President, Secretary and two members. The Honorary President of HORS is Prof. Acad. András Prékopa. In the 2014-2017 period HORS can be contacted through the President Prof. István Maros.  Awards  HORS recognizes the long lasting, successful and influential OR activities of its members by awarding the \\"Egerváry memorial plaquette\\" to at most one person a year.  Conferences  HORS organizes/co- organizes two series of conferences: since 2004 every other year VOCAL (Veszprém Optimization Conference: Advanced Algorithms) an international conference co-organized with University of Pannónia (Veszprém, HU) and in the gap years Hungarian Conference on Operations Research. Both series are well attended. Hungarian operations researchers organized a series of Mathematical Programming Conferences in Mátrafüred and Mátraháza (Hungary) in the period of 1970 and 1980. The events were an important meeting point between OR people of East and West during the cold war. These series formed the basis of the more recent VOCAL conferences. HORS played an important role in the success of the EURO 2000 (EURO XVII) conference held in Budapest, Hungary, as a co-organizer of the event.  Publications  The society contributes to the maintenance of the Central European Journal of Operations Research (CEJOR).

It contains both pork and beef, as well as dark soy sauce, pickled bean curd, and some other spices, and is normally served with meatballs and pig's liver. The soup also contains lueat mu sot or lueat nuea sot (), which is pig or cow blood mixed with salt and spices, to season the soup. The color of the soup is similar to beef noodle soup () but considerably thicker due to the blood added. It is commonly served in a small bowl. The other ingredients of boat noodles are garlic, fried garlic, radish, cinnamon, bean sprouts, parsley, morning glory, and some Thai chilli flakes. Type of the noodles for boat noodle are several, thin rice noodles, egg noodles, sen yai (, lit: big noodle), and sen lek. (, lit: small noodle) Boat noodles are commonly served with pork crackling and basil or sweet basil. History Boat noodles have been served since the period of Plaek Phibunsongkhram in 1942, and were originally served from boats that traversed Bangkok's canals. In the past, a merchant who sold boat noodles would have been the only person working on a small boat, and would have had to do everything by himself from paddle a boat, scald the noodles, season the soup, serve the dish, handle money and wash the dishes. If the bowl was too big, it would be difficult to hand over to the customer on the land and might be easily spilled. This is the reason why the boat noodle's bowl is small, for the convenience and safety of the merchant. Nowadays the dish is also served in restaurants, but the dish's historical identity is maintained by it still being served in a small bowl, and often with a boat moored in front of the place.

Biography  Passionate about History, Valente has been thoroughly studying Jewish history and war refugees' lives. She graduated in journalism, with a postgraduate degree in Brazilian literature. With this background, Valente drew the path to her main calling, historical fiction. After some important works in the documentary and journalistic fields, she put her extensive research to the service of the novelist. In 2012, Valente thus plunged into the fictional writing, publishing her first novel, The Secret of the Shrine (O Segredo do Oratório), by Editora Record, which ended up as a finalist of the São Paulo Literature Prize in 2013. The novel was translated and published in the Netherlands by Nieuw Amsterdam with the title De sleutel tot het familiegeheim (2013). It is a historical fiction that reveals Brazilian's Jewish roots through the saga of a \\"New Christian\\" family that crosses three centuries. In 2015, she released her second novel, A Square in Antwerp (Uma Praça em Antuérpia), also published by Record. It also reached the other side of the Atlantic: the Portuguese version was published by Saída de Emergência. In 2016, Valente wrote the play The Indecipherable World (O Mundo Indecifrável). In 2017, she published her third novel, Sonata in Auschwitz (Sonata em Auschwitz), also published by Record in Brazil and by Saída de Emergência in Portugal. The film and TV rights of her first two novels, The Secret of the Shrine and A Square in Antwerp, were acquired in 2017 by the Brazilian producers Breno Silveira (Conspiração / director of Fox series One Against All) and Paula Fiuza (Canal Laranja). In the nonfiction field, she partnered with photographer Elaine Eiger to write the book Israel: Routes and Roots (Israel: Rotas e Raízes) in 1999. This partnership also produced the documentaries Paths of Memory: The Trajectory of the Jews in Portugal (Caminhos da Memória: A Trajetória dos Judeus em Portugal) in 2002 and The Star Hidden in the Backlands (A Estrela Oculta do Sertão) in 2005, both exhibited in various festivals in Brazil and abroad – Lincoln Center, Festivals of San Diego, Jerusalem, among others – and on TV, constituting important archives of Judaism history in the world. The first documentary won the Best Documentary Direction Award at the New York Independent Film Festival in 2003 and the second one won the Best Documentary Award at the Jewish Film Festival of São Paulo in 2005. As a journalist, Valente has worked for more than two decades on television covering international affairs, on Globo broadcast network. Her journalistic background and experience is the root of the trademark of her work, the richness of research in loco: Luize writes her novels always after a field research trip and a reconstitution of the characters' journeys.

The species is commonly called the common rough-scaled lizard or savanna lizard. It is largely found in southern Africa. These lizards are terrestrial and found in the range of mesic savannah. The common rough-scaled lizard is medium in size and well distributed in parts of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Angola, Tanzania, and Zambia.Meroles squamulosa from the Reptile Database online Description Common rough-scaled lizards are medium-sized lizards each with a small head, body, and a long tail. The frontonasal is divided and has small body scales in 42 to 58 rows at the midline. The backs of these lizards are brownish grey with narrow dark blotches and rows of pale spots. Unlike the Ichnotropis species, M. squamulosus does not have subocular scales bordering the lip. Habitat These lizards can be found in semi-arid, shrub savannas in Africa such as Ngamiland, Botswana. They dig branching burrows in the soft sand usually at the base of Acacia trees that may be shared with several individuals. Biology These lizards are insectivorous and actively hunt during the day feeding on termites, grasshoppers, beetles and other small insects. They seem to have a sympatric relationship with Ichnotropis capensis as their mating season alternates so they do not compete for the same resources. =Taxonomy and evolution= Based on morphological evidence, the South African Ichnotropis capensis and the North American genus Psammodromus diverged from the lineage of Lacerta lepida and Lacerta monticola during the Oligocene epoch (24 to 36 million years ago). Since 1854, the common rough-scaled sand lizard was classified under the genus Ichnotropis, determined through morphological characteristics. More recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA markers determined that it did not group with Ichnotropis, but with the genus Meroles. Morphological traits can change over time influenced by factors such as microhabitat and environment or a combination of factors. Phylogenetic evidence of the common rough-scaled sand lizard was found in 2007, but was not accepted due to incomplete taxon sampling for Ichnotropis. =Mating= This lizard has a life expectancy of 8 to 9 months.Goldberg, Stephen. (2008). \\"Reproductive cycle of the common rough-scaled lizard, Ichnotropis squamulosa (Squamata: Lacertidae) from southern Africa\\". The Texas Journal of Science. The males have a symmetrical armatured hemipenes which only one is used at a time. The males and females have 11 to 18 femoral pores on each thigh of which pheramones are commonly excreted. The females lays 8 to 12 eggs around April or May and hatchlings appear from October through November. The long incubation period is due to the cold conditions of winter. Growth is rapid as these lizards reach sexual maturity in 4 to 5 months. =Helminths= M. squamulosus is one of 8 genera of lizards in southern Africa that have been reported to harbor helminths These helminths have a paratenic relationship with these lizards using them to transport and infect others.

Poblacion, San Miguel, Bulacan, Philippines. The parish church, with Saint Michael, the Archangel as patron saint, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos. History =Parish History= It is believed that the town of San Miguel was initially established as a town under the province of Pampanga. The parish of San Miguel de Mayumo was founded years before 1607 as a visita of Candaba and was said to be declared an independent parish in 1725. However, some records tell that the parish of San Miguel was later annexed to Gapan in 1726 as a visita. It was also recorded that San Miguel de Mayumo was once annexed to Macabebe, also as a visita. On May 8, 2018, 3 days before his death, The late Bishop Jose F. Oliveros of the Diocese of Malolos celebrated his final mass in the parish =Architectural History= There are no records as to who built the first parochial structures in San Miguel. Sources are also not clear as to whether Father Juan Tombo built or simply rebuilt the current church and convent. Father Francisco Arriola continued with the construction until it was complete in 1869. The Catholic cemetery is attributed to Father Arriola while the convent was constructed under Fathers Arriola, Tombo and Ortiz during their respective periods as minister of San Miguel. During World War II in 1941, the roof of the church nave collapsed. Architecture The church of San Miguel is the only Spanish-era church in Bulacan with the belfry attached atop the façade pediment. The church, with its predominantly Baroque features, has a two-level façade and a curved pediment surmounted by the rectangular belfry with a bulbous dome.

Built in 1915 to a design by Lewiston architect Harry S. Coombs, it continues to house the town's municipal offices today. It is a fine example of Colonial Revival architecture, representing the town's growth in the early decades of the 20th century, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The town of Rumford, Maine experienced rapid growth with the arrival in the 1880s of industrialist Hugh J. Chisholm and the railroad in the 1890s. Chisholm in 1893 established the paper processing industry that still dominates the town, and its population and central business district grew rapidly in the following decades. This growth prompted the need for a new town hall, and in 1915 the town retained Harry S. Coombs, a Maine architect based in Lewiston, to design a new municipal building, with a projected cost of $25,000. The building Coombs designed ended up costing $95,000 to complete. The building Coombs designed is a 2-1/2 story Colonial Revival structure, faced in brick with granite trim. The main block is five bays wide, set on a raised foundation, with a hip roof topped by a clocktower with a coppered cupola. The main entrance, centered on the front facade, is accessed via a small flight of stairs, and is sheltered by a portico supported by Doric columns. The portico has an entablature topped by an extended dentillated cornice. First floor windows are rectangular sash windows with a decorative granite keystone. The second floor window above the entry is a Palladian window, its sections separated by engaged columns, with a swag decoration above. The remaining second floor windows are rectangular, with a recessed round-arch section above. There is a cornice line separating the second floor from the attic level, which has groups of smaller windows just below the roof.

Thus far it remains the only one of its kind found in England, and the only ogham inscription in England east of Cornwall and Devon. The stone is held in a storage facility of Reading Museum in Reading, Berkshire. Background The pillar stone was found upside down some five to six feet beneath the surface, apparently at the bottom of a former well. A white metal or pewter vessel \\"of peculiar form\\" lay underneath, crushed by it. Further investigation revealed an ogham inscription upon the pillar. According to Amanda Clarke and Michael Fulford of the University of Reading, Rhys noted that the sandstone marker was \\"rudely carved into what seems to me to be a phallic form\\", though the upper part was broken off and missing. What was left \\"may be described as the frustum of a cone, below which the stone narrows greatly, then widens into a moulded base.\\" The inscription is in two lines beginning at the widest part of the frustum at its base.\\"Excavations on the site of the Roman city of Silchester, Hants in 1893\\", Archaeologia 54, January 1894, 199 - 238 Dating Map of Irish migration to Britain The pewter vessel, when reconstructed, turned out to be \\"a simple, biconical flagon similar to a few other examples found in southern Britain which can be dated broadly to the fourth and no earlier than the late third century.\\" The most recent version of the translation on the stone is \\"[The something] of Tebicatus, son of the tribe of N”. The missing word may be \\"memorial\\" or, less probably, \\"land\\", if the stone were a territorial marker rather than a grave marker. J. A. Baird argues that both archaeological and linguistic evidence suggest that the stone belongs to \\"the earliest phases of the ogham script\\", which emerges with contact between late Roman Latin and Old Irish.Baird, J. A., \\"Dura Dererta: The Death and Afterlife of Dura Europos\\", in Vrbes Extinctae: Archaeologies of Abandoned Classical Towns, Ashgate, 2012, p.340. On the basis of existing evidence, Reading University says that the \\"inscription has been interpreted as an epitaph and it has been variously dated to the fifth and sixth centuries\\". Baird says that it \\"could well date to the late fourth or fifth century\\". This would make it \\"one of the earliest ogham stones anywhere.\\" Significance The inscription was created during Sub-Roman Britain, a period of intense cross-cultural contact between Britain and Ireland at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions. Most ogham inscriptions are present in the British strongholds of Cornwall, Devon and Wales. The Silchester inscription is in Hampshire — east of Devon — and is presumed to be the work of Irish settlers occupying land further east than other known Irish migrants. The tradition of the expulsion of the Déisi and their migration from Ireland may be related to this pattern of settlement and British-Irish cultural integration.Meyer, Kuno (Ed.) (1901). \\"The Expulsion of the Dessi\\". Y Cymmrodor 14: 101–135.

He was also responsible for the founding and settlement of Oneota (Duluth), located in present-day West Duluth. Superior Hiking Trail The Superior Hiking Trail has two optional routes near Ely’s Peak; one is a 300-ft \\"spur trail\\" that ascends the peak, arriving on the top; the other rounds the peak and descends into a maple-forest area that overlooks the City of Duluth.

Upon returning from prayer, Ikotmi comes across a wounded deer and believes his prayer was answered. Ikotmi builds a fire and cooks the deer meat, but while doing so he grows cold. Realizing he has nothing to put on for warmth, he decides to go back to retrieve his blanket that he gave to Inyan. Upon return to his teepee he sees that his meat has been eaten and that his fire is out. Ikotmi realizes that he should have eaten the meat first before going to retrieve his blanket. =Iktomi and the Muskrat= Iktomi is preparing some fish when he hears a voice calling him \\"friend\\". He looks around and sees a muskrat by his feet. The muskrat asks Iktomi if he will share his fish, and Iktomi suggests that they race for the fish and that if the muskrat wins, they will share it. The muskrat tells Iktomi that he cannot race, but Iktomi offers to strap a heavy rock around his waist to give the muskrat a fair chance. The muskrat agrees and they head off in opposite directions, so that they can race back to the fish. The muskrat swims across the lake and wins the race, and tells Iktomi he should have just shared in the first place. =Iktomi and the Coyote= Iktomi is walking across a prairie when he comes across a coyote lying on the ground. He believes the coyote is dead even though it is still warm. Iktomi decides to take the coyote back to his teepee to cook. But the coyote is alive, and when Iktomi arrives at his place, he builds a fire and throws the coyote into the fire. The coyote escapes the fire and tells Iktomi that he had better make sure his prey is dead before preparing the meal. =Iktomi and the Fawn= Iktomi comes across a beautiful peacock in a tree and wishes to be as beautiful as the peacock. He begs the peacock to give him wonderful feathers, so the peacock magically transforms Iktomi into a peacock. The only condition is that Iktomi may not try to fly. Being stubborn, Iktomi tries to fly but fails and gets transformed back into a human being. Next Iktomi comes across an arrow and is transformed into it, but again fails to follow one rule and returns to normal. Finally, he comes across a fawn and asks the fawn to give him spots similar to him. In order to get the spots, Iktomi has to be buried in a hole and burned with dried grass, sticks, and cedar ember. The fawn agrees to help Iktomi, and Iktomi lies down in the hole and blue smoke rises, but Iktomi climbs out of the fire before burning, and does not get the brown spots he desired.

He had been member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong between 2000–04 and 2008–12. He was the founding member of the Democratic Party before he was expelled in 2015 for his support in the government's constitutional reform proposals. He was also briefly a founding member of the Third Side, a centrist political party. He is also former member of the North District Council and Regional Council. Background Wong was born in Hong Kong in 1957. He obtained his Bachelor of Social Work from Hong Kong Polytechnic University and was a social worker before joining Hong Kong politics. He was the member of the Meeting Point a liberal party and was first elected to the North District Board in Choi Yuen with party mate Tik Chi-yuen. He became the founding member of the Democratic Party when the Meeting Point was merged with the United Democrats of Hong Kong. He lost his seat in North District Council in the 1994 District Board elections to So Sai-chi of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), who became his long-time rival in the area. He was nevertheless elected to the Regional Council in 1995 and served until it was abolished in 1999.  Legco member  Wong ran for the Legislative Council (Legco) in New Territories North in 1995 but lost to DAB's Cheung Hon-chung. He ran in New Territories East in the 1998 Legislative Council election, placing second on the list behind Andrew Cheng Kar-foo and helped Cheng to get elected. In the 2000 election, the Democratic Party split Cheng and Wong into two tickets to avoid wasting the votes as the electoral mechanism was largest remainder method and the strategy got them both elected with fewer votes. He lost in 2004 through a weak electoral strategy as the all the pro-democratic candidates formed a combined party-list in the election, Wong was placed in fourth behind Andrew Cheng, Emily Lau Wai-hing and Ronny Tong Ka-wah who all got elected. Before that he also lost his seat in the District Council in 2003 as his changed his constituency to challenge So Sai-chi in Choi Yuen. He returned to the Legco in 2008 in a successful strategic voting with Andrew Cheng. In June 2010, he voted with his party in favour of the government's 2012 constitutional reform package, which included the late amendment by the Democratic Party – accepted by the Beijing government – to hold a popular vote for five new District Council functional constituencies.Cheers and jeers for political reform vote, SCMP, Gary Cheung, Albert Wong and Fanny WY Fung, 25 June 2010 He also returned to North District Council in 2007 election, running in Shek Wu Hui. In 2011, he was defeated by So Sai-chi again in Choi Yuen. Wong was defeated in the 2012 election, which left the Democratic Party only one representative in New Territories East, Emily Lau. = Gay rights = Wong is an evangelical Christian and a social conservative. He opposed amendments to the Domestic Violence Ordinance that would offer same-sex couples equal protection under the law on the grounds that the amendment would include same-sex relationships as if they were couples. He opposed the government would take actions go a step further to make laws which prohibited discrimination against the LGBT people.Gay sex violence row hits Democrat This position give him as the same attitude with other pro-Beijing conservative members in Legco, such as Priscilla Leung. Wong's conservative stances on gay rights made him different with other pan-democrats, which many of them take liberal stances on social issues.  Third Side  In July 2015, Wong was expelled from the Democratic Party due to his defiance of the party line and clandestine proposal in support of the government's constitutional reform package, which was panned by pan-democrats for being \\"fake universal suffrage\\". He later set up a moderate party, the Third Side, with ex-Democrat Tik Chi-yuen which aimed for a middle- of-the-road approach between the pan-democrats and pro-Beijing camp. He ran in the 2015 District Council election in Fanling South in his North District base but was not elected. In 2016, he also ran in the Legislative Council by- election in New Territories East, receiving 17,295 votes, 4% of the total ballots and failed to return to the Legislative Council. In July 2016, he left the Third Side to contest the Social Welfare constituency in the upcoming legislative election after failing to get the party's approval. He received the fewest votes in the five-candidate contest.

It is the fourteenth book in his extensive Dray Prescot series of sword and planet novels, set on the fictional world of Kregen, a planet of the Antares star system in the constellation of Scorpio. It was first published by DAW Books in 1977. The Dray Prescot series is made of several cycles of novels, each cycle essentially forming a series within the series. In addition to being the fourteenth volume in the series as a whole, Krozair of Kregen is also the last of three volumes in the Krozair Cycle. It is set in the fictional Eye of the World on the continent of Turismond . The 52 completed novels of the Dray Prescot series were written by Bulmer between 1972 and 1997, when a stroke stopped his writing, also the later Dray Prescot books, after 1988, were originally only published in German. The series is in the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars series.Ken Bulmer obituary The Guardian, published: 22 December 2005, accessed: 9 December 2014 Plot summary Map of the Eye of the World The book directly follows Renegade of Kregen with Prescot being made an oar slave on a Magdagian galley and still trying to come to terms with the death of his daughter Velia. After some time Prescot, still using the name of Dak, is reunited with Duhrra, who had been captured when his ship was taken, and a young man, Vax. Prescot learns that Zena Iztar had helped Duhrra to a new hand, a prosthetic quite beyond the skills of local doctors. Prescot and his companions break their chains and free all the slaves on their ship, liberating two more vessels in the process. Prescot takes command of one of the three ships. When Vax gets drunk celebrating their new freedom he reveals that he is Jaidur of Valka, youngest son of Pur Dray, who he hates for abandoning his mother and ruining his chances becoming a Krozair. Prescot is surprised that he has another son and daughter, Jaidur and Dayra, they having been born after he was exiled to Earth. Eventually, to prevent Vax from going to Magdag, Prescot breaks the news to him that his sister Velia has been killed, without disclosing the fact that he is his father and knows of his true identity. Prescot is spied on by the Gdoinye once more and discovers that Vax, like Drak before, can see the bird, though nobody else can. Traveling east Prescot and his men learn that Zandikar is under siege, that the City's King has been slain and a usurper holds the throne. They realize that, should the city fall the road to Holy Sanurkazz, chief city of Zair, will be open to the enemy. They therefore decide to head for Zandikar. Prescot confronts the usurper's men when they come to take the food his ship carries. He visits the great-granddaughter of the former King, Miam, and learns that she and his son Zeg are in love. Miam is unaware of Prescot's true identity. He overthrows the usurper and in his place installs Miam as Queen. Through treachery a gate to the city is almost opened but a Savapim, a servant of the Savanti, saves the situation. Prescot realizes that the Savanti have taken the side of the Zairians. He prepares traps for the attackers and successfully holds the city. Eventually a messenger arrives with news that Zimuzz is about to fall but that Prince Drak is arriving soon with an army from Vallia, equipped with flying boats. Prescot realizes the siege has come to a decisive stage when King Genod arrives with an armada of flying boats and saddle birds, against which Zandikar is defenseless. Prescot sets out to address this problem with a crew of men. They encounter a galley from Magdag and are saved by another galley, led by Pur Zeg, his middle son. Like Vax, Zeg hates his father but also does not recognize him. Instead the two almost come to blows before parting to carry on their task. Prescot is greatly impressed by his son and saddened about the years lost. After reaching the coast near the enemy positions Prescot leaves his men and enters the Grodnim camp, again assuming the alias of Gadak. He meets Grogor and through him gains access to Gafard and King Genod and manages to enter their flying boat for a reconnaissance mission. Gafard is surprised to see Gadak again, and finally, when Prescot adds the pieces together for him, recognizes the latter is Pur Dray and the father of his late beloved wife. Gafard tackles the King and throws them both overboard, dying the same way Velia had. During this Prescot briefly glimpses an attack by the Gdoinye on the Savanti dove. As the Grodnim air fleet prepares to attack the Vallian fliers arrive just in time, with Drak as their leader. He lands and Prescot for the first time in 21 years sees his oldest son. Drak recognizes the similarities between Dak and his father and is confused by it. The final assault of the Grodnim against Zandikar with flying boats pushes the defenders close to defeat with a gate falling when an air armada from Valka led by Delia takes the day and destroys the besieging army. Prescot is finally reunited with Delia and his sons learn his true identity. He has to break to Delia the news of Velia's death, while she informs him of the birth of a new daughter. From Zandikar Prescot, his family and friends head to Zy where he argues his case for lifting the Apushniad against him. He succeeds, and also has Jaidur admitted to Krozair status.

The structure was built in 1878 to assist a local copper mine in the removal of water from mine shafts. It was the last tower mill ever built in Wales. The windmill remained in use until the mine's closure in 1904. History The area around Parys Mountain has been mined for copper for several centuries. A substantial source of copper ore was discovered in 1768 and the site quickly developed into the world's largest copper mine. As the mine progressed, its shafts were sunk further into the ground and the need for the removal of water increased. This was initially done by hand and later by steam engine. In order to save money on the coal required to power the engines, the Parys Mountain Windmill was constructed in 1878, around the mine, to replace the engines. The windmill was the last tower mill built in Wales. It was also used to remove ore from the shafts and lift machinery in and out for miners. The windmill was unusual in that it featured five sails, the only windmill in Anglesey that was constructed in this way; typically windmills are built with four. It was also constructed with three doorways. The site remained in production for more than two decades before it eventually closed in 1904. The windmill fell into a state of disrepair and, by the end of the 1920, was described as a \\"capless shell\\". Geography The Parys Mountain Windmill is located at the top of Parys Mountain and is visible for miles around. The structure was built at the mountain's highest point, above sea level. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales reports that a survey of the structure, undertaken in 1975, noted that it measured high and featured a deep cellar.

The flap itself (here extended to 20 degrees deflection) is smoothly bendable and does not open gaps in the wing surface. Also the two triangular gaps between the flaps and the fixed wing are bridged by flexible material. Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE) is a research project on shape- changing flaps for aircraft wings, intended to reduce the aircraft's fuel costs and reduce noise during take-off and landing. It is a join effort by NASA and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and first airborne tests have been conducted in late 2014. ACTE flaps close the gaps present in conventional flaps using flexible material, generating a continuous bendable surface. As of 2015 enhanced hinged wing flaps (which fold out from under the wing's trailing edge and are used on most jets) are studied. A Gulfstream III business aircraft of the AFRL has been equipped with flaps from FlexSys Inc. and is performing airborne flight tests since 7 November 2014. FlexSys Inc., a company founded by Prof. Kota in 2000, is dedicated to develop the concept of a flexible aircraft wing and received 40 million in financial assistance from the Air Force's small business innovation research program.

They were founded in early December 1941 as a reaction to a massacre on Bosniak men and women carried out in Foča by the Serb Chetniks. The organisation was formed in poor conditions and was not so supported at first by the Croatian puppet government. They rose to power after the Partisans started to burst deeper into Bosnia. Their leader was Nešad Topčić. History On 5 December 1941 the Italians in agreement with the Chetnik commander Sergej Mihailović gave the city of Foča under Chetnik control, the Bosniak populated parts of the town started organizing their own \\"Muslim Defense Force\\". The poorly armed defense units couldn't prevent the massacres of Bosniaks in the Podrinje area of Bosnia. After several attacks and massacres mainly against the civilians of that area, the prominent Bosniak leaders held a conference in Sarajevo on 28 August 1942 at which it was made clear that the NDH government was not doing anything in the defense of the Bosniak population in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That's why the prominent Bosniak leader Muhamed ef. Pandža made a statement where an immediate action of the NDH government is needed. They founded and proclaimed the \\"People's Committee of the National Salvation of Bosniaks\\" and the first tasks of the committee were to found the first Bosniak defense force after the fall of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Some of the members of the conference led by Topčić went to Berlin to request from the Germans the establishment of an autonomous Bosnia and Herzegovina. Another two meetings were held but didn't get any successful result and the situation of the Bosniak population in NDH remained desperate. Statute The conference also confirmed the statute of the defense forces. The statute contained many points but the main 4 that were related to the Green Cadres were: # Protection of Bosniak populated areas in Bosnia # Controlling the movement of Orthodox population in these areas # The planning and preparations of action of the Green cadres need to be done with strict confidentiality. # Traitors will be executed. 1943 reorganization After the Partisans carried out several attacks in northeast Bosnia and suffered big losses in men, the key officials supporting the militia left it and joined side with the Partisans or the NDH army. The biggest reason for the reorganization was the death of Muhamed Hadžiefendić and the destruction of his \\"Muslim-Volunteer\\" legion. The Green cadres did not intend to be on any side but they were occasionally gifted with supplies which made them carry on. The organisation was present in most towns in Bosnia and its main purpose still was to protect the civilian population from the chauvinist Chetnik forces. End of the war With the rapid advance of Tito's partisans in 1945 it was clear that the NDH government together with other Axis factions would collapse with the capitulation of Germany in May 1945. Most of the Green Cadres units which still were under control of some town councils took over control in agreement with the Partisans. Some of the units of the Green Cadres joined the Partisans and together liberated some areas in Bosnia. Most famously was the help in the liberation of Sarajevo were parts of the Green Cadres were incorporated into the 16th Partisan Muslim Brigade.

He worked in his final years in France.Joseph van Bredael at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Jozef van Bredael was born into an artist family in Antwerp as the second son of Joris van Bredael and Johanna Maria van Diepenbeeck.Wilhelmus Johannes Franciscus Juten, G. C. A. Juten, Taxandria, Volume 7, 1900, p. 184 His father as well as his grandfather Peeter van Bredael were painters. His uncles Jan Frans van Bredael and Jan Peeter van Bredael the Elder were also painters. His mother was the daughter of the prominent Baroque painter Abraham van Diepenbeeck.Walther Bernt, The Netherlandish painters of the seventeenth century, Volume 1, Phaidon, 1970, p. 19 His brother Jan Peeter was also a painter who had a successful career in Vienna. Jozef trained under his father. Village on the banks of a river In 1706 Jozef van Bredael and his cousin Jan Frans entered into a contract with the Antwerp art dealer Jacob de Witte to produce copies after the paintings of Philips Wouwerman and Jan Brueghel the Elder for a number of years. Under the contract, Jozef was to receive for each copy he produced 6 guilders in the first year, 8 guilders in the second and 10 guilders in the third and fourth years plus a bonus of 1 shilling. At the end of the contract he would also get a blue coat. Jan Frans was paid a marginally higher fee as he was more experienced than his 18-year cousin but Jan Frans was also bound by an exclusivity obligation to work only for Jacob de Witte. Since they did not sign the copies, it is not possible to distinguish who was responsible for individual copies.Die Künstlerfamilie Van Bredael at wouwerman.de 1991 It is possible that the not so scrupulous art dealer de Witte even sold these copies as originals since the copies were such good imitations of the style of the original artists.Ad. Siret, BREDAEL, Jean-François VAN, in Biographie nationale de Belgique Jozef was originally contracted to work for de Witte for a period of four years but he may have worked for him for a longer period. Mountainous landscape with a figure reading before a cottage It is not clear when he moved to France. There is mention of him going to France to work in 1725. Here he worked as a copyist and made several copies after Claude Lorrain for Jean-François Leriget de La Faye, an important French art collector.Rochelle Ziskin, Sheltering Art: Collecting and Social Identity in Early Eighteenth-century Paris, Penn State Press, 2012, p. 100 Other historians state that Jozef only moved to France in 1735 or 1736 after he had completed the paperwork related to the inheritance of his brother Jan Peeter who had died in Vienna. He had appointed the Flemish painter Frans van Stampart, a court painter in Vienna, to act as the administrator of his brother’s estate.F. Jos. van den Branden, Franz Jozef Peter van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche Schilderschool, Part 1, Buschmann, 1883, p. 1033 In France he became a member of the Royal Academy of the court of Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans.Jozef van Bredael, Village animated with people , at De Jonckheere Master paintings He never married and likely died in Paris in 1739. Work Joseph Bredael painted mostly landscapes and battles and made both copies and pastiches of compositions of 17th-century painters who were still popular in the 18th century such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Philips Wouwerman and Claude.D. H. van Wegen, Het Vlaamse schilderkunst boek, Waanders, 2005, p. 220 Harbour scene with a windmill As he signed his paintings with the monogram JB, like Jan Brueghel, there have been a number of erroneous attributions of his work to Jan Breughel the Elder. Jozef van Bredael had copied many Brueghelian compositions and was thus inspired by their style. He interpreted the Brueghelian idiom through the aesthetics of his day and added a personal note to the contours of his figures and his strokes. Van Bredael’s quality of execution and delicate naturalism placed him amongst the best followers and imitators of Jan Brueghel the Elder, alongside Peeter Gijsels, Théobald Michau and Mathys Schoevaerdts. He paid particular attention to detail, meticulously executing his figures and décor in the style of a miniaturist. He was able to create the illusion of a succession of planes in his compositions through the use of lateral screens and a subtle and nuanced palette, which tended towards tones of dominant blues and browns, though always gentle and subtle. He executed his successful compositions in many, almost identical versions as is shown by the two versions of a Village with a windmill, one of which sold by Christie’s on 4 July 2012 in London, lot 148 and the other of which was sold by De Jonckheere Master paintings.

The German title is Das Tagebuch der Geliebten and the Italian title is Il diario di una donna amata, which means \\"the diary of a woman in love\\". An historical romance, it was directed by Henry Koster under his original name of Hermann Kosterlitz and starred Isa Miranda as the Ukrainian artist and diarist Marie Bashkirtseff and Hans Jaray as the French writer Guy de Maupassant. It was loosely based on Bashkirtseff's diaries, in which she records her studies in Paris to become an artist towards the end of the 19th century, and possibly on her correspondence with Maupassant, which she had begun under an assumed name. The film focuses on a feud between Maupassant and one of Bashkirtseff's teachers that leads to a nascent (and highly fictionalized) romance between Bashkirtseff and Maupassant. The romance is cut short in the film by Bashkirtseff's early death from tuberculosis. The film was made just before Koster moved to the United States to join Universal Studios. It was filmed in Vienna.

which the Agricultural Wages Board regulated the amount that farm workers were paid, in order to guarantee a fair minimum wage scale, depending, for example, on type of work, or years of experience. After the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was introduced, agricultural wages tended to be slightly higher than those at the minimum. However, the Conservative-Liberal-Democrat coalition government decided to allow farm worker wages to be reduced by repealing most of the 1948 Act in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013.

Early life and education MacNicol was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on 5 July 1869, the daughter of Peter MacNicol, a teacher and school principal, and Mary Ann Matthews. Several of her siblings died in infancy (including her twin sister Mary), but she grew up with two surviving sisters with whom she shared a penchant for music. She had some health problems consequent on suffering from allergies during the summer months. She attended Glasgow School of Art from 1887 until 1892 and afterwards, at the urging of school director Francis Henry Newbery, studied art in Paris at the Académie Colarossi, which was one of the first of the Paris studios to offer classes in which women trained alongside men. She was thus part of the first wave of women artists who were crossing to Paris from the United Kingdom to further their art education as their male peers had been doing for several generations. However, she apparently did not gain much from her time at Académie Colarossi, feeling that she was being constantly repressed rather than encouraged. Career On her return to Scotland, MacNicol moved back into the family home and not long afterwards acquired a studio in St Vincent Street. In 1893 she exhibited Fifeshire Interior at the Royal Scottish Academy (the only time she would exhibit there), and Study of a Head at the Royal Glasgow Institute. In 1895, she exhibited work at the Stephen Goodden Art Rooms in Glasgow, and in 1896 at the Munich Secession Exhibition. That year she spent time in the artist's colony of Kirkcudbright, where she painted the portrait of leading Kirkcudbright artist Edward Atkinson Hornel. In 1899 she married , a physician and artist, and they lived in the Hillhead area of Glasgow, where she set up a large studio at the back of the house. Both her parents died in 1903, and she was in the late stages of a pregnancy when she died in Glasgow on 4 June 1904, at the age of 34. Her husband remarried shortly before his own death by suicide in 1908, and his second wife sold the Hillhead house and all of MacNicol's paintings the same year. This could be one reason that so few of MacNicol's works and papers are known to exist; there are only a few letters and photographs, and no sketchbooks appear to have been found. MacNicol's paintings in oil and watercolour are influenced by the plein air tradition of the Barbizon School, as well as by the impressionism of James McNeill Whistler and some of her Glasgow contemporaries among the Glasgow Boys such as Hornel. She was known for her masterful command of color, light, and texture, while her portraits are admired for their solid composition and psychological depth. One contemporary writer, admiring her dextrous touch and expressive color, compared her favourably to Berthe Morisot. Like Morisot, she often painted young, fashionable women posing outdoors, but with a distinctive dappling of leaf shadows that creates a strong overall pattern of alternating light and dark. During her lifetime, her work was exhibited in Scotland and London, as well as in several European and American cities. Today she is included in group known as the Glasgow Girls, among whom are also numbered Margaret MacDonald, Frances MacDonald, Jessie M. King, Jessie Wylie Newbery, Ann Macbeth, and Norah Neilson Gray. The Glasgow Girls were featured in a 1990 traveling exhibition organized by curator Jude Burkhauser and originating at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Her work is held in the collections of the Kelvingrove Museum as well as the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery in Glasgow.

Biography He was born Eduard Beyer in the Rhineland, and was a graduate of the Düsseldorf Academy of Art, or the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he studied between 1837 and 1838 under Josef Wintergerst and Rudolf Wiegmann. He traveled to the United States in 1848 with his wife, living first in Newark, New Jersey and later in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cincinnati, Ohio. He visited Virginia in 1854 and stayed until about 1856 or 1857 sketching and painting a number of scenes that would appear in his \\"Album of Virginia\\" (1857).A Look Back at Edward Beyer, Artist, The Roanoke Times, January 16, 2017Beyer, Edward.

In his painting of the Bellevue Plantation near Ridgeway, Henry County, Virginia, a homestead of the Andrew and Maria Lewis family, Beyer depicts eight slaves toiling in a wheat field. The painting is accomplished \\"in the dramatic style of the Dusseldorf Academy, which emphasized atmosphere, action and drama.\\"Landscape of Slavery: The Plantation in American Art, edited by Angela D. Mack, Stephen G. Hoffius Some of his works comprised industrial scenes such as railroads and bridges, juxtaposing romanticism and realism. The painting of what was Charleston, Virginia in 1854 was declared a painting trifecta by Antiques Roadshow (U.S. TV series) appraiser Colleene Fesko. Fesko said she was amazed when she saw the piece and had to pull out her glasses to fully examine in detail the panoramic work. While in Charleston, Beyer was offered a commission from a number of businessmen in the community. They had to have a lottery to decide who would own the painting, and it stayed with the same family ever since. Fesko said that Beyer created 40 panoramic landscape paintings of Virginia towns in the mid-19th century.Patrick, Anna. \\"W.

Life and career At the time of the 1911 Census, the three-year-old Hill was the youngest of eight surviving children of William Hill, a coal miner, and his wife Ann. He was born in the Monkwearmouth area of Sunderland, which was then in County Durham. He played football for Esh Winning and Jarrow before signing for Football League club Newport County in 1928. He played only twice in Third Division matches, but scored more than 40 goals for the club's other teams. He returned to the north-east of England at the end of the 1928–29 season and signed for Darlington. On the same day, Darlington signed Peterborough & Fletton United's Maurice Wellock, whose goal record, of 71 goals from 104 league matches over three seasons, illustrates why he was preferred to Hill at centre-forward. Hill played infrequently, either in the absence of Wellock or with Wellock alongside him at inside forward, and scored 14 goals from 22 league appearances over two seasons, which included two hat-tricks. The first was against South Shields in an 8–3 victory, and the second came in the first half of a 5–2 defeat of York City, though the Yorkshire Post reported that the first of the three goals failed to cross the line and the third was offside. As he had been with Newport, he was prolific at reserve-team level, but at the end of the 1930–31 season, he was given a free transfer, and he signed for North-Eastern League club West Stanley. After a season with West Stanley, Hill, \\"a very good centre forward and a strong shot\\", joined Spennymoor United, with whom he was to spend the next five years, apart from a brief foray to Ramsgate at the start of the 1934–35 season. In 1937, the Football Association gave permission for the club to arrange a testimonial match in appreciation of his services. \\"One of the most prolific scorers in the North Eastern League during the past five seasons\\" – he scored more than 200 goals for Spennymoor, including 54 in 1936–37 – he signed for Horden Colliery Welfare for 1937–38 and was expected to \\"get a 'bagful' of goals\\".

He is generally counted as the fifty-fourth in the list of 63 Nayanars. He was an Irukku Velir chieftain, who is described to not only have pardoned a devotee of the god Shiva, who stole from the royal granaries, but also distributed rice to devotees of Shiva. Life Idangazhi was born and lived in Kodumbalur (Kodumpalur), currently in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Idangazhi was one of the Irukku Velir, petty chieftains who served under the Chola kings. He is said to have been descended from the Yadavas of Dwarka, who migrated to South India with the sage Agastya. He is sometimes also described to be part of the Kalabhra dynasty, who flourished in the Kalabhra interregnum, a period between 3rd and the 7th century. The life of Idangazhi is described in the Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Idangazhi was the chieftain of the kingdom of Konadu (which was around present-day Pudukkottai district), whose capital was Kodumbalur. He was a staunch devotee of the god Shiva, the patron god of Shaivism. He lived and governed by Shaiva ways and made arrangements for worship of Shiva in temples as per the Shaiva Agama scriptures. There was another devotee of Shiva in Konadu. He had taken the vow of serving and feeding Shiva's devotees. However, once he became poor over time and could not get food to feed a devotee of Shiva. To complete his vow, he entered the royal granaries to steal rice, but was caught red-handed and arrested by the guards. The arrested devotee was presented to Idangazhi, who understood the rationale of the intended burglary. He pardoned the devotee and let him free. He realized the futility of a full go-down when devotees of Shiva were going hungry. Idangazhi made announcements throughout the kingdom that devotees of Shiva can come and take away not only rice from the granary, but also other riches from the treasury, as much as they wanted. Idangazhi was instrumental in the spread of Shaivism and thus gained the grace of Shiva. In the Periya Puranam, Idangazhi is described as the ancestor of the Chola King Aditya I (c. 871 – c. 907 CE). Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Idangazhi Nayanar is specially worshipped in the Tamil month of Aippasi, when the moon enters the Krittikā nakshatra (lunar mansion). He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals.

Freedhem was a Swedish settlement in the early 1900s that was an agricultural gem of Morrison county, Minnesota. It had a large farmers’ co-operative creamery, general store and two Swedish churches. The Swedish Free Evangelical was organized at Sam Bloom's home. At this meeting a name was selected for the little settlement. Freedhem, which in Swedish means “Peaceful Home”. In May 190l the church was incorporated. The Sam Bloom family donated two acres in the northwest corner of their land to build a church and create a burial place for the settlers. As more people moved to the little settlement, a need was created for a Lutheran church in addition to the Evangelical church already in existence. A meeting was held at A.J.

A multi-course harp is a harp with more than one row of strings. Harps with two rows are called double harps; harps with three rows are called triple harps. A harp with only one row of strings is called a single-course harp.  Diatonic double harps  A diatonic double-strung harp consists of two rows of diatonic strings one on either side of the neck. These strings may run parallel to each other or may converge so the bottom ends of the strings are very close together. Either way, the strings that are next to each other are tuned to the same note. Double-strung harps often have levers either on every string or on the most commonly sharped strings, for example C and F. Having two sets of strings allows the harpist's left and right hands to occupy the same range of notes without having both hands attempt to play the same string at the same time. It also allows for special effects such as repeating a note very quickly without stopping the sound from the previous note. Diatonic double harps can also be tuned in octaves to allow for an extended range on small instruments.  Chromatic double and triple harps  A French cross-strung chromatic harp. Chromatic double and triple harps have one row of strings that is tuned pentatonically to allow for chromatic playing. These harps exist both as parallel chromatic harps or as cross-strung harps. = Parallel chromatic double and triple harps = These harps have the strings strung in parallel, and are not to be confused with inline chromatic harps.A triple harp features three rows of parallel strings, two outer rows of diatonic strings, and a center row of chromatic strings. To play a sharp, the harpist reaches in between the strings in either outer row and plucks the center row string. Like the double-strung harp, the two outer rows of strings are tuned the same, but the triple-strung harp has no levers. This harp originated in Italy in the 16th century as a low headed instrument, and towards the end of 17th century it arrived in Wales where it developed a high head and larger size as the Welsh triple harp. It established itself as part of Welsh tradition and became known as the Welsh harp (telyn deires, \\"three- row harp\\"). The traditional design has all of the strings strung from the left side of the neck, but modern neck designs have the two outer rows of strings strung from opposite sides of the neck to greatly reduce the tendency for the neck to roll over to the left. = Cross-strung double harps = Cross-strung double harps have two rows of strings that intersect in the middle.

History The Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE was put into production since the spring of 2008. It was created primarily for Alpine and Nordic countries. The first customer, who contributed to the creation of the model, placed an order for three types of the low-entry bus, to a company in Austria. The first information about it appeared during the AUTOTEC Trade Fair in Brno in June 2008, after the delivery of the buses to Austria. Officially debuted during the IAA Nutzfahrzeuge Trade Fair in 2008 in Hannover, which was held from September 25 - October 2, 2008, while in Poland it was shown at the Transexpo Trade Fair in Kielce in October 2008. Solaris Alpino 8,9 LE The Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE is extended by more than 30 cm from the low-floor variant Solaris Alpino. It has a longer wheelbase and longer rear overhang, which resulted in an increase in weight. Just like the base model it is structurally related to the third generation Solaris Urbino buses. It is equipped with Cummins ISBe4 250B engine (with a capacity of 6.7 dm3 and 250 HP in power) centrally mounted at the back and a Voith Diwa 854.5 automatic gearbox. Optionally the bus can be mounted with a 6-speed automatic ZF 6HP-504 gearbox. This engine meets the standard Euro 4 using SCR technology, which requires AdBlue. The front suspension can be installed independently or alternatively with the IFS Voith ZF RL 75 EC. At the rear, it has a standard RS ArvinMeritor axle 24 on double tires. The width was reduced by 15 cm when compared with the Solaris Urbino series, and the desire to preserve adequate headroom in the rear of the bus without unduly increasing the height of the whole bus resulted in the need for the rear tires to have a reduced size. To ensure a broad aisle, on the one side of the bus instead of double seats there are 1 + 1/2 type seats on the rear axle. The cab is fitted as standard with a dashboard designed by Solaris, there is an optional dashboard by Siemens VDO or Multibus Actia. Initially, the Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE had the Euro 4 engine as standard. At present, the ISBe5 Cummins engine or Cummins ISB6.7E5 250B or ISB6.7E5 285B can be used which meets Euro 5 (which is the same type, but with an additional filter) or EEV. The bus can also be fitted a CNG-powered engine. To reduce the rear axle load fuel tank with a capacity of 165 dm3 was placed behind the front door, and the AdBlue tank with a capacity of 40 dm3 was placed between the front wheel arches and the middle door. By using these solutions such as the central lubrication system and the self-diagnostic KFBS1 Kogel and the maintenance-free bearings in the drive and steering, this has reduced servicing time and cost. In 2011, the company debuted the first prototype Solaris Urbino electric LE 8.9 electric bus, which was created by a significant redesign of the Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE.

It was originally created in 1939 to protect the watershed in the municipality of Guinayangan known as the Maulawin Spring Watershed Forest Reserve declared through Proclamation No. 365 by President Manuel Luis Quezon. It had an initial area of . In 2000, the forest reserve was enlarged and was redesignated as a protected landscape under the National Integrated Protected Areas System by virtue of Proclamation No. 295 issued by President Joseph Estrada. It is the only source of potable water for domestic consumption of the more than 40,000 residents of Guinayangan. Geography The Maulawin Spring Protected Landscape covers an area of of lowland forest in the barangays of Himbubulo, San Pedro and Magsaysay in west-central Guinayangan. It sits on a hilly terrain in the eastern portion of the Tayabas Isthmus and the northeastern extreme of Bondoc Peninsula near Guinayangan's border with the municipalities of Calauag and Lopez. The park is traversed by several rivers and creeks, some of which dry up during the summer months and which empty into the Catabangan Bay and Ragay Gulf, including the Maulawin River, Hiwasayan River, Tubog Creek and Prenza River. These rivers supply water for the Guinayangan Water District. The topography of the park is characterized as a complex of land configuration ranging from slightly level, sloping to rolling, and steep to hilly and rugged mountains. It has an elevation of between and above sea level and is composed primarily of clay loam. The park is located about west of the Guinayangan Poblacion and some east of the provincial capital city of Lucena. It is surrounded by private agricultural lands and coconut plantations in Ermita, San Roque, Dungawan and Sisi. It is accessible via the provincial road to Guinayangan from the Pan-Philippine Highway (AH26) in Calauag, thence by foot through numerous trails from barangays Sisi and Calimpak. Biodiversity The park is a forested area with sixty percent of its territory inhabited by dipterocarp trees, including molave, kamagong, guijo, red lauan, and white lauan, yakal and manggachapui. It is home to a diverse bird species, such as the Philippine dwarf kingfisher, rufous hornbill, sooty woodpecker, black- naped oriole, Philippine coucal, jungle crow, coleto, black-winged kite and island collared dove. It also supports some large mammals, including the crab- eating macaque, Philippine deer, Philippine warty pig, Asian palm civet, as well several bats and snakes.

Club career Latta is the son of former Otago prop John Latta, however after finishing off his schooling at Wellington College he started his senior rugby career in New Zealand's capital city. He debuted for the Lions during the 2012 ITM Cup, but only managed a couple of appearances. He was to receive a serious setback at the end of the year as he badly injured his hip and it took him a full 16 months to recover. When he did get back to full fitness he started out in club rugby with the Zingari- Richmond club in his native Otago and was then signed to the Otago Razorbacks ITM Cup team for the 2014 season. Although Otago endured a disappointing campaign, Latta made a big impression in the second row scoring 1 try in 8 appearances. This form led to him being named as a member of the wider training group for the 2015 Super Rugby season, and making his debut against the Brumbies on 24 April 2015. On 11 November 2015, Latta signed a two-year deal to join English club Gloucester in the Aviva Premiership.

It was an attempt to unite Anti-Nebraska members of the Opposition Party into a single party. The convention adopted a party platform and nominated a ticket led by William Henry Bissell for Governor of Illinois. Bissell would be elected later that year, making him one of the first governors elected as a Republican. Background By 1850, the Democratic Party had emerged as the leading political party in the United States. An uncertain stance on slavery led to the demise of the main Democratic competitor, the Whig Party. The slavery debate was briefly quelled by the Compromise of 1850, which settled several questions about the legality of slavery in new territories. However, the Kansas–Nebraska Act, proposed four years later, reignited tensions. The act would create two new territories and determined that slavery status there would be determined by a popular vote of residents. Illinois had been a free state since its inception. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was designed by Senator Stephen A. Douglas and supported by his colleague James Shields, both Democrats. William Alexander Richardson led support of the bill in the United States House of Representatives, but failed to win the support of Democratic representatives Long John Wentworth and William Henry Bissell, as well as all Whigs. The act was passed on May 30, 1854, sparking a political upheaval. The Whig party dissolved and anti-slavery Democrats, including Bissell and Wentworth, abandoned their party; they united in a de facto Anti-Nebraska party, known as the Opposition Party. After its ratification, Douglas spoke in the state capital of Springfield during the Illinois State Fair on behalf of the act. During the fair, prominent abolitionist Owen Lovejoy attempted to organize a convention against slavery, but struggled to convince political allies to join. Lincoln countered Douglas' defense of the act, and went on to debate him in seven other cities in 1858. Fueled by support in the central and northern parts of the state, the Opposition Party secured enough support to send Lyman Trumbull to the US Senate in place of Shields. Elihu B. Washburne, James H. Woodworth, James Knox, and Jesse O. Norton were elected to US Congress on behalf of the Opposition, which helped to usher in a national plurality in the lower house. On January 15, 1856, the chairman of the nine existing state Republican Parties called for an informal convention in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on February 22. Delegates from twenty-four states and four territories attended the event, which officially established a national Republican Party after three sessions. Concurrently, an Editorial Convention was held in Decatur, Illinois, for all state anti-Nebraska newspaper editors; twenty-five papers were represented. One of the resolutions approved by this convention was for the appointment of a state committee to call a state Republican convention. Convention The first official Republican convention in Illinois was held on May 29, 1856, in Bloomington. Chairman John M. Palmer was elected convention president after his opening address. Nine vice presidents and five secretaries were then elected. The convention nominated Bissell for governor with Francis Hoffmann as lieutenant governor, Ozias M. Hatch for secretary of state, Jesse K. Dubois as auditor, and James Miller as treasurer. Hoffmann was found to be ineligible for his position due to a residency requirement, and John Wood was nominated in his place. The following resolutions defining the party platform were approved: > Resolved, That foregoing all former differences of opinions upon other > questions, we pledge ourselves to unite in opposition to the present > administration and to the party which upholds and supports it and to use all > honorable and constitutional means to wrest the Government from the unworthy > hands which now control it and to bring it back in its administration to the > principles and practices of Washington, Jefferson and their great and good > compatriots of the Revolution. Resolved, That foregoing all former > differences of opinions upon other questions, we pledge ourselves to unite > in opposition to the present administration of the Government; that under > the Constitution Congress possesses the power to prohibit slavery in the > Territories ; and that, whilst we will maintain all constitutional rights of > the South, we also hold that justice, humanity, the principles of freedom as > expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our national constitution, > and the purity and perpetuity of our Government require that that power > shall be exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territory > heretofore free. Resolved, That the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was > unwise and injurious; an open and aggravated violation of the plighted faith > of the States, and that the attempt of the present administration to force > slavery into Kansas against the known wishes of the legal voters of that > Territory is an arbitrary and tyrannous violation of the rights of the > people to govern themselves, and that we will strive by all constitutional > means to secure to Kansas and Nebraska the legal guaranty against slavery of > which they were deprived at the cost of the violation of the plighted faith > of the nation. Resolved, That we are devoted to the Union and will, to the > last extremity, defend it against the efforts now being made by the dis- > unionists of this administration to compass its dissolution, and that we > will support the Constitution of the United States, in all its provisions > regarding it, as the sacred bond of our Union and the only safeguard for the > preservation of the rights of ourselves and our posterity. Resolved, That we > are in favor of the immediate admission of Kansas as a member of this > Confederacy under the constitution adopted by the people of said Territory. > Resolved, That the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of > our country, guarantees the liberty of conscience as well as political > freedom, and that we will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise on > account of religious opinions, or in consequence of place of birth. Lincoln delivered the closing address. The speech was purportedly so captivating that no reporter made a record of it. The address has become known as Lincoln's Lost Speech. The delegates to the convention were: *1st District: Sheldon M. Church *2nd District: William B. Ogden, declined and replaced by John Evans *3rd District: G. D. A. Parks *4th District: Thomas J. Pickett *5th District: Edward A. Dudley *6th District: William H. Herndon *7th District: Richard J. Oglesby, declined and replaced by J. C. Pugh *8th District: Joseph Gillespie *9th District: David L. Phillips *At-large: Ira C. Wilkinson Aftermath The Democrats had nominated Richardson for governor at their convention earlier that month. The remnants of the Whig party declined to run a candidate. The first Republican National Convention met that June, nominating John C. Fremont for president. Fremont was defeated handily in his bid for president, including in Illinois, but the Republican state ticket in Illinois was successful. Bissell became the first Governor from a party other than the Democrats since 1838. Republicans would win every subsequent gubernatorial election through 1893.

Nearby is Criterion Summit, which at about above sea level is the highest point along the highway between The Dalles to the north and Redmond to the south. In the late 19th century, the route over the summit was a wagon road linking The Dalles to Lakeview and California. A post office was established here in 1913. The name comes from the dictionary word meaning a standard by which to judge quality. The founder who proposed the name linked it to the idea of a model community. Although other local residents preferred the name Three Notches, for a large, notched juniper tree growing nearby, the Post Office rejected the two-word proposal in favor of the single word, Criterion. The post office closed in 1926. The Criterion Ranch Trail is an hiking route between Route 197 at Criterion and the Deschutes River to the west. It follows power lines and an old ranch trail used recently as a firebreak during a wildfire in 2011.

History  Punta Jandia in 2017 Completed in 1864, it is one of the oldest lighthouses in the Canaries; Punta de Anaga Lighthouse on Tenerife was also opened in the same year. Built in a similar style to other Canarian 19th century lights, it consists of a whitewashed single storey house, with dark volcanic rock used for the masonry detailing. A 19 m masonry tower is attached to the side of the house facing the Atlantic Ocean. With a focal height of 33 m above the sea, its light can be seen for 22 nautical miles, and consists of a flash of white light every four seconds. The interior of the keeper's house has been converted into an interpretation centre for the Jandía nature reserve. There are five different coloured rooms, each one displaying information about a particular aspect of the reserve, such as its volcanic geology, vegetation, animals and maritime life, which also includes information about the lighthouse. The lighthouse is maintained by the Las Palmas Port authority. It is registered under the international Admiralty number D2790 and has the NGA identifier of 113-24024.

In 2010 the company began manufacturing the bus with the engine powered by CNG. History Solaris Urbino 15 LE was put into production since the spring of 2008. It was based on a model of the Solaris Urbino 15 which was built to be used primarily for Alpine and Scandinavian countries. The bus is also popular in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first customer, who contributed to production of the model by placing an order for three types of low-entry buses, is a Ledermair company in the city Schwaz, Austria. The first official information about the bus, including photographs, appeared in June 2008 during the AUTOTEC Trade Fair in Brno, that is, after the delivery to Austria. The official debut took place at IAA Nutzfahrzeuge Trade Fair in Hannover and the Transexpo Trade Fair in Kielce in autumn in 2008. It is one of the few buses with a length of 15 metres produced in Europe and the world. Thanks to the high floor in the rear of the vehicle, the engine and gearbox are placed in the centre for the third axle. It works with the SCR technology using AdBlue. All axles are from ZF. Due to the use of larger wheel size 295/70 tires the bus has an extended wheel arch. Behind the front axle there is a storage possibly for snow chains. Two illuminated steps provide access to the higher floor level at the rear. All seats are located on the raised floor and are equipped with safety belts, while those located on the side of the stairs have additional armrests and handles. Above the seats in the low floor part of the bus there are shelves for luggage on the ceiling. The higher door has wheelchair access. Optionally, in place of the wheelchair bay the space can be transformed for four additional passenger seats. The ventilation of the interior of the bus has side windows and two electric sunroofs. Instead of tilting windows there can be installed an air conditioning system. There are several versions of the cab: open (open door), semi-closed (with glass door) and closed (fully built cabin). Doors used in Solaris Urbino 15 LE all open to the outside.

Saint Cecilia, 1846, Musée Ingres de Montauban Her work was influenced by one of her teachers, the French neo-classical painter, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin was another of her teachers. Yet she had her own personal pictorial voice which through her striking and strong use of colour was also reminiscent of Italian Renaissance art and certain paintings of the Spanish Baroque painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo.  Early years  Born in Paris on March 1, 1817, Anne Joséphine Cécile Raoul Rochette (known as Joséphine Raoul Rochette) was the daughter of the French archaeologist Désire Raoul Rochette and granddaughter of the neoclassical sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon. As her father often travelled because of his work as perpetual secretary of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and his own research, her early education and that of her only sister were left in the hands of their pious mother.  Marriage to Luigi Calamatta  In 1839, Joséphine, at the age of 16, became engaged to the Italian painter and engraver, Luigi Calamatta (1802–1869), whom she had met whilst he was collaborating in Paris with his friend, Ingres, whom he had first met in 1820 when the French artist lived and worked in Florence. The couple married on December 1, 1840, and moved to Brussels where Luigi Calamatta had been made professor of engraving at the Ecole Royale. Today, his portrait painted by Joséphine hangs in the Galleria di Arte Moderna in Palazzo Pitti in Florence. In 1842, their only daughter, Marcelline, called Lina in the family, was born in Paris.  Abandonment of her family  Joséphine left her husband and daughter in 1852. The name of the man she deserted them for is unknown. However, in October 1894, the writer Edmond de Goncourt in his journal tells us that she ran away from her 'crazy' engraver husband 'who dressed in pink' for a young man who dressed 'normally' and that she kept until her dying day the mattress on which the lovers had spent so many happy hours had caused quite a scandal even in artistic libertine circles. Now, free of family ties, Joséphine settled in Paris where she barely supported herself with her painting and where she failed to become recognized for her considerable talent. Her daughter, Lina, remained with and was brought up by Luigi.  Marriage of her daughter, Lina  On May 17, 1862, Lina married Jean-François- Maurice-Arnauld, Baron Dudevant, better known as Maurice Sand, the son of writer George Sand, who was an old friend of her father. The friendship stemmed from the time he had painted a now well-known portrait of her in 1837. Joséphine did not attend the wedding as it is probable that she did not approve of the difference in the ages of the two fiancées nor that the young couple would live with Maurice's mother who exercised a strong hold over him. But Lina adored her mother in law and was a source of pride and joy for the writer whose relationship with her own daughter, Solange, was, problematic. In 1863, Lina had a son, Marc-Antoine Dudevand-Sand, who died the following year; three years later, she gave birth to a daughter Aurore \\"Lolo\\" Dudevand-Sand (1866–1961) and then another daughter, Gabrielle \\"Titite\\" Dudevant-Sand (1868–1909), two years after that. Aurore would marry the French painter Charles Frédéric Lauth whilst Gabrielle married an Italian drawing teacher, Romeo Palazzi. Neither had children. Portrait of Maurice Sand (1845), oil, by Joséphine Calamatta  Relationship with George Sand  Without doubt, the two mothers-in-law knew each other as Joséphine had painted Maurice Sand's portrait in 1845. There is also evidence that, with discretion, George Sand attempted to help the artist procure painting commissions and to show her works at least one exhibition.  Death of Luigi Calamatta  After Lina's marriage the rapport between mother and daughter improved and he letters demonstrated that Joséphine was very fond of her daughter. This remained so until Luigi Calamatta died in Milan in 1869. When it came time to divide his estate in 1872, Joséphine simply ignored the fact that it was she who had run out on her family twenty years before. She, instead, believed that Maurice was promoting his wife's inheritance at her expense. Perhaps motivated by her own less than flourishing finances, she felt she was being deprived of what was rightfully hers and she let it be known, intimating that her daughter would lose even more on her death—and so it was to be. Joséphine also opposed a proposed biography of Luigi Calamatta that Lina had hoped George Sand would write. In response, she made no qualms about indicating that basically her husband had only been an engraver, albeit a good one, but that 'in the end, an engraver is never anything but a second rate artist, because he is nothing but a copyist'. She also demanded that if the biography were to be published, it should be published after her death so that her private life would not be made public fodder. In the end, it was never written.  Religious life  Between 1881 and 1882, Joséphine, under the spiritual guidance of Abbot Huvelin, a noted confessor in Paris, turned towards the religious life. In 1884, joined the order of the Sœurs de l'Adoration Réparatrice and devoted herself to prayer and penitence. Nonetheless, she continued to paint, now preferring religious themes.  Death  After a short illness, Joséphine Calamatta died in Paris on December 10, 1893. She was buried in her nun's habit at Montparnasse cemetery not far from the monumental tomb of the Sœurs de l'Adoration Réparatrice. Her gravestone simply reads 'Anne Joséphine Cécile Raoul Rochette, widow Calamatta, in religion Sister Marie-Joseph of Mercy. Pray for her. 1817-1893'. True to her word, in her will she left only a small amount of money to Lina. An annuity and money left to her by her cousin were bequeathed to the poor. In the same document, she stated that she bitterly regretted the mistakes she had made in her past and the bad example she set asking her daughter and her family to forgive her from the bottom of her heart.  Works  According to Anne Chevereau in her article \\"Joséphine Calamatta, élève d’Ingres et mère (méconnue) de Lina\\", Joséphine Calamatta's works have been scattered and that to make a catalogue of them would be virtually impossible. According to Clara Erskine Clement, however, Joséphine did receive two medals at the Salons but she does not tell us at which ones. The following list,of her paintings is partial and incomplete.

Six years later in 1892, he received his engineering degree at the School of Mines at Columbia University, where he was classmate of Edward B. Durham.Columbia University. Handbook of Information. 1893. p. 98 After some years working in the industry, Gillette served as assistant New York State Engineer under Campbell W. Adams from 1896 to 1898. The next three years he worked as a contractor, and from 1903 to 1905 he was associate editor of the Engineering News. In 1905, he founded Scranton Gillette Communications, Inc., where he became president. From 1906 to 1907, he served as chief engineer of the Washington Railroad Commission. Later, Gillette became an instructor of science at Columbia University. Gillette was a member of the American Society of Consulting Engineers, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Society of Engineering Contractors, the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education. Gillette died on June 18, 1958, and was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.  Work  Starting in the early 1900s, Gillette wrote and co-wrote more than a dozen books on topics ranging from rock excavation, to management and cost accounting, to his latest work in the 1930s on forecasting weather. = Rock excavation: methods and cost, 1900s–10s = Chicago Drainage Canal, 1900s Gillette his first book on earthworks, entitled Earthwork and Its Cost, was prized for its verve and clarity as well as its technical comprehensiveness.American Architect and Architecture, Vol. 118, 1920. p. 757 In its preface Gillette (1903) explained: > There are few engineering works of magnitude that do not involve the > excavation of earth. Indeed the cost of earthwork forms one of the greatest > of cost items in canal, in reservoir and in railway construction, nor is it > an inconsiderable item in the construction of roads, sewers or water works. > What will this excavation cost? This is a question that the engineer first > asks himself in making his preliminary estimates. Later the same question > confronts the contractor. To the engineer an erroneous answer may mean loss > of reputation, to the contractor it assuredly means ruin where the work is > extensive. A glance at the wide range in contract bids for most earthwork > jobs will convince anyone that few contractors do more than guess at costs. > While the numberless engineering structures that have cost more than the > preliminary estimates prove quite as conclusively that engineers too often > guess also.Gillette (1903, p. iii) Gillette said that this was \\"the first published volume treating of earth economics in a comprehensive way.\\" In line with this topic Gillette in 1904 published Rock excavation: methods and cost. In its preface Gillette (1904) gave an introduction of mineral production and rock excavation: > The value of the mineral products of America annually exceeds > $1,000,000,000. For explosives alone the sum of $20,000,000 is expended each > year, and it is well within limits to say that fully twice as great a sum is > paid out to drillers and blasters. When we consider the labor, the power and > the powder required to mine and to quarry products in the aggregate so > enormously valuable, we can not fail to be impressed with the scantiness of > literature on the economics of rock excavation. A dozen years ago, when > called upon to estimate the cost of some open cut rock excavation, I was > astonished to find no text book that in the least served to guide me. I > subsequently learned also that most of the matter to be found in the few > books on blasting was either theoretic or too meagre to be of material > value. What was true then has unfortunately remained true.Gillette (1904, p. > iii) In 1916, Gillette published the enlarged Handbook of Rock Excavation. Juniper Prize-winning author Steve Yates wrote, \\"Here was a book created when engineers could still write like Henry David Thoreau and think like James B. Eads. Gillette covered rock work and quarrying methods from ancient hand drills through steam's dominance in mining to just before the advent of gas- powered drills.\\" = Construction cost keeping and management, 1900s = In the 1900s Gillette published as series of books on the more topic of construction cost keeping and management, which included: * Economics of road construction, first published in 1906. * Handbook of cost data for contractors and engineers, first published in 1907. * Concrete Construction: Methods and Cost, first published in 1908, and * Construction Cost Keeping and Management, written with Richard T. Dana and first published in 1909.  Offices appliances  In Construction Cost Keeping and Management, Dana & Gillette (1909) gave an overview of the many appliances which were used in his days to compile records, and process information in business offices, including time clocks, the mimeograph, mechanical calculators (separate adding machines and multiplying machines), etc. Gillette wrote, \\"Such an appliance which may not, in general, be used in the field, but which is of immense value in the office and particularly in a shop, is the time clock. Various forms of time clocks are in common use, two types of which are illustrated. [The first] is a time card recorder, which is a clock so no made that it will automatically stamp on a card inserted in a slot in the clock by the workman the time of his arrival and of his departure. The cards are made to hold a record covering the pay period and need no attention from a timekeeper or clerk until the termination of this period. The record of the men's time can then be compiled very readily by one who need not be a skilled mathematician or time clerk.\\"Gillette (1909, p. 110-111) And furthermore, \\"the time clock system has been developed very highly in shops for keeping track of time used in completing any job by workmen, but as this in a way is not in the realm of field cost keeping, it will not be entered into here. Another form of time clock, shown in [the second image], has the numbers of the employees fixed on the outer edge of a disk or ring and a record is made by the employee who shifts a revolving arm and punches his number upon entering the office and leaving.\\" = Fundamental divisions of cost = In Cost keeping and management engineering, Dana & Gillette (1909) went into the topic of the fundamental divisions of cost. They made clear, that such a subdivision can be illustrated (see image) but is not complete. Dana & Gillette explained: Chart of total construction costs, 1909 > ... it would be futile to attempt to make a complete outline that would > apply to any contracting firm. Keeping books is writing the history of > business transactions; hence, it is obvious that no outline of the 'history' > can be made until the 'events' are known. Even though two firms are in the > same line of work, these 'events' are never of quite the same nature in both > concerns. Therefore, it is clear that before an outline of the records of a > concern can be made, that particular concern must be studied to learn the > nature of all its transactions. For this reason no general discussion of the > methods of keeping accounts for any line of business can hope to be more > than thoroughly suggestive.Dana & Gillette. Cost keeping and management > engineering, (1909) pp. 128–130 Dana & Gillette continued that \\"every source of expense to a contracting business contributes to the total cost of the contracts carried by the firm. A certain proportion of the Office Rent, the Legal Expenses in connection with lawsuits, the cost of making unsuccessful tenders, etc., are just as much a part of the cost as wages paid to carpenters and bricklayers. To allocate these various costs seems a difficult problem, but the first step is simple, for each item can be readily classified...\\" They proposed the following divisions : * Direct Expense: Direct Expense includes all expenditures that pertain to only one contract, and that can be charged to that contract without subdivision or apportionment. * Overhead Expense : Overhead Expense includes all expenditures that pertain to all the contracts carried, and that cannot be charged to the individual contracts without subdivision or apportionment. The Direct Expense Account is divided into two parts: # Field Expense: Field Expense includes all items which can be directly charged to the work in the field. # Sub-Contract Expense. Sub-Contract Expense includes all amounts paid for work done by sub-contractors. Under Field Expense we have four subdivisions : # Labor: All expense for labor (except when sub-contracted) employed in the field is charged under Labor. # Materials: Expenditures for materials which are found in the completed structure, and which are paid for according to the contract, are charged under Materials; e. g., Cement, Sand, Crushed Stone, Bricks, etc. # Supplies: Supplies include all such items of material as are necessary to the carrying on of the work, but which are partially, or wholly, destroyed in the process of construction; e. g.. Oil, Waste, Coal, Rope, Hose, etc. # Miscellaneous: General items of expense which do not come under any of the first three classifications, but which can be directly charged to the Field Account of a contract, come under Miscellaneous; e. g., Plant Rental, Plant Depreciation, Telephone and Telegraph, Postage, etc. Dana & Gillette (1909) continue with a further description of the analysis of overhead expense accounts.  Time sheet  Time sheet, front, 1909 Time sheet, back, 1909 In his 1908 Cost Keeping and Management Engineering Gillette presented a cost keeping system and its application to sewer work, which incorporated an advanced type of time book, which he called time sheet. This form resembles actually the fully developed time book, and not a modern time sheet. Gillette explained how this system worked at an engineering designing and general contracting office in Indianapolis, Indiana: > The essential and fundamental feature of the system depends upon the form of > the time sheet used (front view of time sheet (first image), and back view > (second image)). The time sheet is folded when in use by the timekeeper and > carried in a cover, making the same of book size, and practically the same > form as the ordinary time book. On the left hand side of the front appears > the time sheet in the usual form.Gillette & Dana. (1908. pp. 164–193) > This time sheet is arranged so that it may be used for a gang reporting time > weekly, and is also used where the time sheet is turned in each day, in > which latter case the lines under the column dates are ignored and the time > placed in the total hour column. On the left hand side appears first the > timekeeper's check column... Gillette concluded that \\"this form of timekeeping would be of value because of the system of uniformity alone, even if no regard were given to the other features mentioned, although the above companies using this report are satisfied that they are securing more valuable data by this form than they would have ever been able to do by previous forms used. The value of the uniform time sheet lies in the education of the timekeepers, resulting in a more efficient working force. Under the old system with individual time sheets, prepared especially for each job, the forms of the time sheets were many and various, and, for this very reason timekeepers presumed to incorporate their own ideas and make changes and innovations, resulting in a bunch of data that required hours, and generally the personal attendance of the timekeepers, to work out.\\" = Forecasting weather conditions, 1920s–30s = In the last decennia of his working live Gillette had focussed his attention to the study of weather cycles, and in 1937 published his last book, entitled Climatic Cycles Reflected in Geological Data. A 1943 article\\"Science and the secret doctrine, Electronic Cycles\\" in: Theosophy, Vol. 32, No. 2, December, 1943. pp. 77–80. in the Theosophy magazine summarized Gillette's efforts:\\"Scientist's New Theories May Aid in Forecasting Weather Conditions\\", article 1930. > For many years Mr. Halbert P. Gillette ... has made an intensive study of > weather cycles. In the beginning his theories made such bizarre reading from > the point of view of scientists, that little attention seems to have been > paid to them. Essentially, they were based on theories of interflow of > electrons between the earth, the sun, and the other planets. The real nature > of electrons, and their ubiquity, now being better recognized, his ideas > fall more into line with the thought of the day. > Gillette has sought to tie up his theories to the clay varves, or seasonal > layers, in lake deposits. Among the most important of the cycles discovered, > is one of approximately 605 years, subdivided into three equal periods of > less importance. This is equal to 51 orbital periods of Jupiter. He believes > that it represents the orbital period of Pickering's undiscovered \\"Planet > P.\\" Pickering's estimate of this orbital period was 656 years. And furthermore: > Gillette claims that whenever a planet is in solar longitude either of 108 > or 288 degrees, it causes a peak of a rainfall cycle, whether evidenced by > rainfall records, tree rings, or varves. Such peaks coincide with sunspot > maxima. In addition to the major cycle produced by each planet, it causes > harmonic sub-cycles of 1/3, 1/9, 1/27 of the length of the major one, etc. > The great maxima and minima of rainfall, of course, come when peaks and > depressions of cycles and subcycles coincide. According to Gillette we are > progressing toward a period of great drought whose apex will be 1984. > Volcanic upheavals and compass variations appear to have cycles closely > coinciding with the major rain cycles, he says... The article confirms the \\"this coincidence of cycles is of vast importance in the occult side of nature; as is well known to Theosophists, the years 1897-98 signalized a coincidence of cycles, the longest of which was about 5,000 years, of such intensity that the entire world order was upset by it.\\"  Selected publications  * Gillette, Halbert Powers.

Marie, Ontario. The group are defined by their accessible progressive rock sound, and recognition through the Internet. The band has functioned internationally despite geographic distance from their audience and – in 2016 – signed to Progressive Gears Records – a subsidiary of Progressive Gears Management – in Northern Ireland. Machines Dream was founded in 2008 and the current line-up consists of Craig West (Bass/Vocals), Brian Holmes (Keyboards), Ken Coulter (Drums), Rob Coleman (Lead Guitar) and Jake Rendell (Acoustic Guitar/Vocals). Machines Dream released their self-titled debut in 2012, followed in 2014 with the sophomore album Immunity and digital EP 100 Afternoons. Their third album, Black Science, was released in 2016 to relative widespread praise from European radio stations and internet radio prog fans. A follow up to Black Science was Machines Dream's live off the floor recording at Revelle Studio's in their hometown.  Origins  Machines Dream were formed in 2008 when Craig West (lead vocals, bass guitar), Brian Holmes (keyboards), Ken Coulter (drums), and Shayne Wigglesworth (guitar) began jamming regularly following a one-off performance to fulfil a contractual obligation of West's. In 2009, the group added Marco Pierucci on bass guitar, allowing West to play second guitar, and recorded demos that would be the basis of their first album. In 2010 Pierucci left the band so prompting West to return to the role of bassist/vocalist.  Self titled album  Their first album, self-titled Machines Dream, was recorded by Craig West at his home studio, Bear Dog Digital, beginning in late 2010 and was released on March 15, 2012. During the recording process, Wigglesworth left the band and was replaced by guitarist Keith Conway. The quartet of West, Holmes, Coulter and Conway played regularly in their hometown throughout 2012 and 2013. Many of the lyrics on the first album deal with mental illness and alienation in one form or another. For example, London By Night was written after West suffering a panic attack while visiting London, England; Unarmed At Sea is about vulnerability and features image-heavy lyrics written by singer/songwriter and associate of the band Chris Belsito; and Toronto Skyline is about feelings of loneliness being amplified by living in or visiting a large city. Of the album's two longer tracks, the lyrics for the song Mad For All Seasons were written about conspiracy theorists, while The Session was partly written by Belsito after hearing the rest of the songs on the album and offering a set of lyrics that he felt reflected the entire album. Musically the album reflects the band's influences as well as the sound of the group jamming. Guitarist Keith Conway's melodic blues lead style worked well with the Pink Floyd influenced Toronto Skyline and Colder Rain. Brian Holmes, who had previously played with metal band Gates Of Winter brought symphonic elements to the sound of the album. West and Coulter practiced extensively together to develop a rhythm section that would blend modern and classic prog elements. The band chose to release their first album through Aurovine, an artist-centric distribution service that allowed the band to release the album using a \\"pay what you want\\" model. Machines Dream was consistently among the most downloaded artists on Aurovinehttp://machinesdream.aurovine.com/ including holding the Number One spot in the Aurovine download chart for over one year. To capitalize on this online breakthrough, the band began investing time in social media, using Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to communicate directly with their growing fan base, largely located in the United Kingdom and United States.  Immunity / 100 Afternoons  Shortly after the band's appearance at their community's Rotaryfest Second Stage music festival on July 20, 2013, Keith Conway left the band. Unsure of the group's future, West, Holmes, and Coulter spent a weekend retreat jamming at Coulter's cabin, located north of Sault Ste. Marie, and decided that Machines Dream had a distinct identity greater than the sum of its parts and that they would carry on. The trio began working on the band's second album throughout the remainder of 2013, writing and recording new material. West played guitar, bass and provided lead vocals, Holmes played keyboards and bass, and Coulter played the drums. As recording progressed, the band added two session players, Rob Coleman on lead guitar and Jake Rendell on backing vocals (who had also recorded the backing vocals on the first album) to help complete the album. The album was once again recorded and mixed at West's Bear Dog Digital studio, with additional recording at Case's Music. According to West, the 26-minute title track about is about media desensitization, using immunization as a metaphor. In the same way a person can be immunized against a disease, he suggests that most people have bombarded themselves with so much information on a daily basis between news, entertainment and advertising that they have become numb to situations or information that should be shocking or upsetting. The three shorter songs, Battersea Transcendental, My Ocean Is Electric and Broken Door were written for the first album, but were not recorded at the time. Musically the album has a colder feel than its predecessor, most noticeable in the lack of acoustic guitar and tense arrangements. Immunity features saxophone performed by guest musician Josh Norling and, as with the first album, some lyrics were contributed by songwriter Chris Belsito. Machines Dream completed recording Immunity by summer 2014, with mixing and mastering continuing throughout the autumn. The album's mastering and duplication process were crowd-funded using the Fundervine platform. Immunity was released on December 2, 2014 through Sonic Vista, a record label owned by Aurovine. Immediately following the sessions for Immunity, the band recorded a digital-only five song EP, 100 Afternoons, which was offered as a bonus incentive to those who pre-ordered Immunity. The EP consisted of tracks that were written between 2009 and 2012, partly recorded, but unfinished. The band felt these songs did not fit either album and they had been left off for that reason, however the EP has generated some fan favourites including the upbeat Jupiter and the ballad Trading Stars For Solitude. Following the release of Immunity, the band were featured several times on Stafford Radio's The Prog Mill,http://www.staffordradio.com/presenters/shaungeraghty.htm a weekly radio show that showcases progressive rock, hosted by Shaun Geraghty. Machines Dream played Indie Weekhttp://www.local2.ca/ssm/viewarticle.php?id=16252 in Toronto, on October 16 and 17, 2014 becoming semi-finalists. Also in October, Coleman and Rendell were offered, and accepted, full-time membership in the band, officially making the group a quintet for the first time since 2009. The now five piece began rehearsing heavily following the release of Immunity, and the chemistry between the members led to the group's most stable line-up as well as its most characteristic voice to date. Writing songs organically and collectively had always been a goal for Machines Dream and, with the current line-up this method of song writing has been realized. Progressive Gears In early 2014, the band became acquainted with Eugene Rogers and Progressive Gears Management. Rogers discovered Machines Dream while he was looking for music by the progressive band IT, which he discovered on the Aurovine website. While there, he saw a free download of the first Machines Dream album and decided to listen to it on speculation. He enjoyed the album and began recommending the group to several progressive rock radio shows, including the Prog Mill hosted by Shaun Geraghty. The band and Rogers connected via Twitter and discovered that they had a common philosophical outlook on music and the business of music. In July, 2014 the band asked Rogers if he was interested in taking on managing Machines Dream to which he agreed. Rogers began promoting the music to as many people as possible using both traditional marketing methods as well as working with new social media tools and reaching out to established progressive artists and musicians. The results have been an increase in plays on specialist Internet radio stations that meet the demand for new Progressive Rock. This led to the growth of a global audience for Machines Dream. RECORD While Black Science was being mixed, the band went into the studio to record songs for radio broadcast on Guy Bellamy's Great Music Stories radio show on Meridian FM (links). The band performed older songs as well as tracks from the as yet unreleased Black Science album but experimented significantly with the arrangements. Josh Norling was brought in to play saxophone along with the band adding jazz elements to their sound, and the sessions featured an improvisational quality. The group had originally planned on recording three songs for the radio broadcast, but came out of the recording sessions with over four hours of music. The band were happy with the quality of the material and decided to release the songs that were recorded as a download-only album. It was released for free on Christmas Day, 2016 as a gift to fans and became available later on all streaming services. The second half of these recordings were made available as part of the pre-order for Black Science and featured entirely instrumental improvisations. Black Science On April 22, 2016 Machines Dream announced the title of their upcoming third album, Black Science and accompanied the announcement with a digital single, Heavy Water. The album was originally slated for release in late summer 2016, but was held back to accommodate additional recording which was completed in late 2016. On May 15, 2017 the band announced a pre-order for Black Science, with a release date of June 12, 2017. Pre-orders were accompanied by a digital EP of bonus tracks called IMPROV which would only be available during the pre-order and not released again. A second digital single, Airfield On Sunwick (For Wojtek) was released to coincide with the pre-order campaign. Musically, the album marks the first time that the band's material has been written collaboratively with all the songs stemming from improvisation. In the past, West and Holmes were the primary writers with additional material originating in jam sessions. For Black Science, all the band members were involved in the composition process from beginning. Thematically, Black Science explores instances in the twentieth century that have led to/or are parallels for contemporary political, social and economic problems. The lyrics on the album were mostly written by West, with the exception of three tracks; one written by songwriter and lyricist Chris Belsito (Airfield On Sunwick (For Wojtek)), one West/Belsito collaboration (Weimar), and one set of lyrics (UXB) written by the band's manager, Eugene Rogers. In addition to the established five-piece line-up, Black Science also sees contributions from saxophonist Josh Norling, guest lead vocals from Jakub Olejnik of Polish band Maze of Sound and background vocals courtesy of Jennifer Gauvreau and Chris Belsito. Black Science was produced and mixed by Craig West, mastered by Will Geraldo and features visual artwork from Monique Holmes. IMPROV During the recording sessions at Reveal Music which led to the RECORD digital album, the band also captured an additional two hours of improvised instrumentals. It was felt the inclusion of these tracks would offer fans a look at the band's compositional process, underscoring the writing process used for Black Science. The addition of saxophonist Josh Norling on the recordings allowed the group to explore the jazz-fusion genre in addition to their usual sound. It was decided that IMPROV would only be available to those pre-ordering Black Science and that it would not be made available again. Without Further Ado (Live) Machines Dream played live to celebrate the release of Black Science and decided to record their CD Release performance. It was recorded on Sunday July 9, 2017 with live engineering by Dustin Goodall, and was subsequently mixed by Craig West and mastered by Will Geraldo. As with RECORD, it was released on Christmas Day, 2017 for free to fans, and later made available through all streaming service. The title comes from remarks made by Craig West before the band began to play, which can be heard at the beginning of the recording. Along with the core five-piece band, several tracks on this recording feature Jennifer Gauvreau on backing vocals, who had previously contributed backups to the song Trading Stars For Solitude from the Voices For Hospices CD and Heavy Water from Black Science. Revisionist History With the band's 10th anniversary approaching in December 2018, it was decided that the first two albums, now both out of print, should be remastered and re-released as a deluxe double CD set through Progressive Gears. This would make both albums available in a physical format for a limited time to fans who may not have had a copy of either CD. Once work began on the project, Craig West insisted that Immunity in particular should be at least partly re-recorded and entirely remixed in order to correct errors in quality that he claimed marred the original album. To this end, in May 2018 Ken Coulter re-recorded the drums for Immunity following which West re- recorded all the bass on the track as well as some additional guitars and keyboards. The re-recorded Immunity title suite (no longer split into two parts), A Poor Turn For The Soul, Jupiter, A Stone's Throw (from the 100 Afternoons digital EP) and Trading Stars For Solitude (which had appeared on the Voices For Hospices charity CD) were combined with original album tracks Battersea Transcendental, My Ocean Is Electric and Broken Door to create an entirely new version of the Immunity album. According to West, this is the vision of the Immunity album the band had which was not properly realized at the time. As the Immunity remix was happening, West also decided to remix the first album as well. “Originally the first album was just going to be remastered, but Immunity was sounding really clean and powerful” states West, “and it seemed like if we were going to go through the trouble of digging these albums out for re-release, then they should both be as good as we can possibly get them.” The bass guitar on Toronto Skyline was re-recorded during the remixing process due to noise discovered on the original track. In August 2018, original guitarist Keith Conway visited West in his studio to review the remixes of the first album. This marked his first involvement with the band since 2013. \\"I had never lost touch with Keith\\" claims West, \\"but this was the first time we had sat down together and gone over these songs since they were recorded almost ten years ago. It was a lot of nostalgia and a lot of fun.\\" The booklet for Revisionist History contains a photoshoot from Conway's era that had been intended as part of an insert booklet for the first album, but which was not printed at the time due to financial constraints. According to Craig West, Revisionist history \\"... brings us up to date, and helps us both celebrate ten years but also move forward. It's the closing of an era for me, and hearing all these songs cleaned up, properly mixed and mastered, and seeing it all gathered together is liberating. The nagging feeling I've had for years that we could have done better with Immunity is now gone. There's a lot here to be proud of and also a lot to build on.\\" The Revisionist History package contains remixes of the entire self-titled first album, the Immunity album, the song from Voices For Hospices and the digital EP (100 Afternoons) all remastered and presented in a limited physical edition along with unreleased photographs spanning the first six years of the band's career. Influences As a whole, Machines Dream sees the band as influenced by classic, neo-progressive and third wave prog. Individually, the members of Machines Dream each have specific influences. When the band began jamming they had no set mandate to create progressive music, but when they listened back to their jams, they discovered their natural sound would best be categorized as prog rock. Individually, Craig West cites Pink Floyd, Marillion, Porcupine Tree and Rush as key influences on his work with Machines Dream, along with The Who's Quadrophenia album, and the DIY ethos of Hüsker Dü; Rob Coleman's cites Yngwie Malmsteen, Greg Howe, and Pat Metheny; Jake Rendell has a Bachelor's Degree in Music, specifically voice and his influences include the classical and vocal music he studied in school as well as 90's alternative rock, Motown and traditional blues; Ken cites Big Big Train and Porcupine Tree as contemporary influences along with Pearl Jam, Electric Light Orchestra, Soundgarden, Led Zeppelin, The Who and Radiohead; Brian started as a classical musician before working in heavy metal and progressive rock and cites Devin Townsend, Anathema, Bach and Behemoth amongst his many influences. Characteristics Machines Dream's sound has been described as neo- progressive, cinematic, and radio host Guy Bellamyhttp://www.meridianfm.com/guy-bellamy/ recently dubbed their sound as “widescreen”. They fall into the more accessible and song-oriented stream of progressive rock such as Pink Floyd, Genesis, Marillion, Spock's Beard, Porcupine Tree and Riverside as opposed to more experimental or technical groups including King Crimson, Van Der Graff Generator, Dream Theater and Yes. Technique is subservient to songwriting, and even during more adventurous instrumental passages, the groups’ two primary soloists, Holmes and Coleman, favour melody over virtuosity. West has stated on several occasions that he is critical of the lyrics in much of the genre as being too fanciful and claimed that the band's goal is to balance the atmosphere that progressive rock creates with lyrics that have a harder subject matter such as mental illness, politics, and media.

Born in Blackrock, County Cork, Buckley first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-one when he first linked up with the Cork senior team. He made his senior debut during the delayed 1903 championship. Buckley immediately became a regular member of the starting team, and won one All-Ireland medal and two Munster medals. At club level, Buckley was a six-time championship medallist with Blackrock. He was one of the most prolific goal-scorers of his era, and scored upwards of 21 championship goals. Throughout his career, he made 21 championship appearances. He retired from senior inter-county hurling after the 1914 championship, however, he later returned as a member of the Cork junior team. Playing career =Club= Buckley made his senior debut with Blackrock as a seventeen-year-old in a 1-15 to 1-11 championship semi-final defeat by Redmonds on 20 October 1901. Two years later he had established himself as a regular member of the team as \\"the Rockies\\" faced St. Finbarr's in the championship decider at Turner's Cross. Blackrock played with a strong wind in the first half and built up an eight-point advantage at the interval. \\"The Barr's\\" fought back in the second half, however, Blackrock went on to narrowly win the game by 2-8 to 1-10, with Buckley collecting a first championship medal. Blackrock endured several disappointing campaigns over the next few years, before once again reaching the decider in 1908 with Midleton providing the opposition. Buckley was one of \\"the Rockies\\" goal scorers as they powered to a 4-11 to 2-3 victory. Once again Blackrock failed to retain the title, however, they reached the championship decider again in 1910. Reigning champions Dungourney were bested by 6-3 to 3-1, with Buckley collecting a third championship medal. Blackrock went on to dominate the championship over the next few years. A 3-2 to no score defeat of Aghabullogue in 1911 saw Buckley win a fourth championship medal as Blackrock retained the title for the first time in over ten years. Buckley was captain of the team in 1912, as \\"the Rockies\\" aimed to secure a third successive title. The game once again turned into a rout as Redmonds were defeated by 4-2 to 0-1. Blackrock received one of their sternest challenges yet in a championship decider in 1913, as Midleton sought to dethrone them. A narrow 3-3 to 2-3 victory gave Buckley a sixth and final championship medal. Blackrock's record of four-in-a-row stood for twenty-five years until it was bettered by Glen Rovers. =Inter-county= Buckley made his senior championship debut on 4 September 1904 in Cork's 4-12 to 3-1 Munster semi-final defeat of Limerick. He missed the subsequent provincial decider, however, Buckley returned to the team in time for the All- Ireland decider with London on 12 November 1905. Cork were never troubled throughout the game, with Buckley collecting an All-Ireland medal following a 3-16 to 1-1 victory. After missing the 1904 campaign, Buckley returned to the team the following year. He won his first Munster medal that year following a 7-12 to 1-4 trouncing of Limerick. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 14 April 1907 saw Kilkenny provide the opposition. The game was a high-scoring affair with Cork winning by 5-10 to 3-13. The game, however, had to be replayed as Cork goalkeeper Daniel McCarthy was a British army reservist and Kilkenny’s Matt Gargan had earlier played with Waterford in the Munster championship. The replay was another high-scoring one, with Jimmy Kelly scoring 5-2 for Kilkenny. A puck-out by Cork's Jamesy Kelleher is said to have bounced and hopped over the Kilkenny crossbar. Kilkenny won the game by 7-7 to 2-9, with all seven of their goals coming in a thirty-minute spell. After being on and off the team over the next few years, Buckley was appointed captain for the opening championship game in 1912. He later collected a second Munster medal, as four goals by Jimmy \\"Major\\" Kennedy helped Cork to a 5-1 to 3-1 defeat of Tipperary in the provincial decider. Yet another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned, with Kilkenny providing the opposition on 17 November 1912. The game was an extremely close affair with Sim Walton proving himself to be the goal-scoring hero. A speculative Matt Gargan shot also hopped past the goalkeeper to give Kilkenny a narrow 2-1 to 1-3 victory. Buckley was an unused substitute during the game. Buckley's last game for Cork was a 6-6 to no score All-Ireland semi-final defeat of Galway on 6 September 1914.

When he was 23, in 1982, Fish and his father established Suffolk Construction Company, an offshoot of the family construction business, which was immediately put under Fish's control. Suffolk was unique in that it used non-union labor unlike the Fish family's existing company. In 2006, Fish bought out his father's stake in the company. Fish built the company into a top national construction company responsible for high-profile projects such as Boston’s Millennium Tower, a new facility at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and most recently Encore Boston Harbor. By 2017, the company had 2,010 employees and $3.5 billion in annual sales.Suffolk Hires Nick Dhimitri As National Vice President Of External Affairs Fish was a vocal advocate for hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics in Boston, and he was chair of the Boston 2024 Partnership, a private group that worked on the bid until the city ultimately withdrew its bid to host the Games on July 27, 2015.

The Hollywood fault is an active fault of approximately in length located along the northern edge of the Los Angeles basin. It is part of a system of seismically active folds and faults that constitute the complex transition zone between the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges. The Malibu Coast—Santa Monica—Hollywood fault system is the result of transtension and transpression associated with rotation of the Transverse Ranges in the Cenozoic Era. It has an established dip angle of between 70° and 90° based on surface and subsurface observations, and has experienced significant left-slip movement since the late Miocene. Its minimum and maximum dip-slip displacement rates are estimated at 0.3 mm and 0.5 mm per year, with a strike-slip displacement rate of 0.3–0.6 mm per year which together suggest an annual oblique slip rate of between 0.5 mm and 0.6 mm. Although it has never produced a significant earthquake in recorded history, if the fault eventually ruptures by itself its size and geology could produce a quake with a magnitude of between 5.8 and 6.5 every 1,600 years or so. However, if the Hollywood fault is, in fact, a continuation of the somewhat larger nearby Raymond Fault, the combined strength of a rupture along both faults could produce a quake with a magnitude of as much as 7.0, though such an event would likely happen only once every 3,000 to 5,000 years.

Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 London John Murray 1926 Vol. 1 p.64 His career however was marked by violence and controversy: he fled to Ireland after being imprisoned for trespass after a raid on Sempringham Priory, although he was later pardoned for his part in the raid. He was a friend and neighbour of Sir Geoffrey Luttrell of Irnham, who commissioned the Luttrell Psalter.Coleman, Joyce \\"New Evidence about Sir Geoffrey Luttrell's Raid on Sempringham Priory 1312\\" (1999) The British Library Journal p.103 Family Birthorpe, present day He was born at Birthorpe in Lincolnshire, eldest son of John de Birthorpe, Lord of the Manor of Birthorpe.Ball p.64 He qualified as a lawyer, and is known to have acted as his father's attorney. He succeeded to the family estates before 1312. He has been described as a \\"forceful and dextrous\\" speaker,Coleman p.107 but, like many medieval landowners, he was quite capable of resorting to violence to achieve his ends. The raid on Sempringham Priory and its consequences Sempringham Priory In 1312 the neighbourhood of Birthorpe was plagued by a series of raids and counter-raids, involving John de Camelton, the Prior of Sempringham (the priory was about a mile from Birthorpe) on the one hand, and Roger and his brothers, assisted by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell and other neighbours, on the other. In July 1312 the Prior made a formal complaint to the Crown that these men had invaded the priory, broken down its doors, carried off goods to the value of £500 and assaulted several of the monks.Coleman p.103 A commission of oyer and terminer was set up to investigate the complaint, and in due course it found Roger guilty of trespass: he was fined 500 marks (£333), a sum which Roger, whose income was about £40 a year, could not possibly pay.Coleman p.117 Presumably because he defaulted on the payment, he was imprisoned in Lincoln Castle, from which he escaped. His estate at Birthorpe was forfeited to the Crown, and regranted to Henry de Beaumont: Roger fled to Ireland and was outlawed.Coleman p.105 A second commission, set up to investigate Roger's counter-claim that the Prior had unlawfully seized some of his cattle, was abandoned almost at once.Coleman p.104 =Roger's defence= According to Roger's later petition he was the innocent party in the conflict, although he admitted to having impounded some cattle belonging to the Prior.Coleman p.105 By his account he and his companions fully intended to reach \\"a good accord\\" with the Prior, who however would not receive them; and then \\"conceiving a malicious plan, he had the doors cut down by the men of his household\\", and raised the hue and cry against Roger. Roger pleaded that the Prior's false accusation had led to his wrongful conviction, and that \\"for the great malice of the said Prior, Roger dared not remain in England but crossed into Ireland\\", and subsequently the Prior put so much pressure on the authorities that Roger was declared an outlaw. Roger accordingly pleaded for the restitution of his lands.Coleman p.105 In Ireland While Roger may well have been minimizing his own part in the Sempringham raid, his account of subsequent events is probably truthful enough. He arrived in Ireland in 1313, very likely to seek the assistance of relatives of his friend Geoffrey Luttrell, who had recently become influential there. He also acquired powerful patrons in the FitzGerald family, headed by John FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare.Coleman p.118 In 1316, Kildare and other \\"magnates of Ireland\\" procured a royal pardon for him and thereafter his rise to power was rapid.Ball p.64 In 1318 he became a justice in the court of the Justiciar of Ireland, and subsequently a justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). In 1327, the same year he petitioned the King for the restitution of his lands, he became Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer.Ball p.64 Last years His plea for the restitution of his property was not successful in the short run, but he returned to Lincolnshire about 1330. He seems to have been restored to favour, and he sat on at least two commissions of oyer and terminer. There is a suggestion that he had regained possession of Birthorpe by 1344, although it passed to the Deyncourt family soon afterwards, which suggests that neither Roger nor his brothers had any issue.Ball p.64 References Category:People from South Kesteven District Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer ","title":"Roger de Birthorpe"},{"id":"44639413","text":"Sally in Our Alley may refer to: * Sally in Our Alley (song), a 1725 song by Henry Carey * Sally in Our Alley (1902 musical), a 1902 musical * Sally in Our Alley (1916 film), a 1916 silent film * Sally in Our Alley (1927 film), a 1927 silent film * Sally in Our Alley (1931 film), a 1931 film ","title":"Sally in Our Alley"},{"id":"44639418","text":"The Jelcz PR110D is a coach and intercity bus produced by the Polish company Jelcz in Jelcz-Laskowice near Oława in Poland in 1984-1992.

The bus was built on its basis in 1984 with several units of the bus with the name Jelcz PR110D. The letter D means long-distance. Specification The engine was a Mielec SW680 / 164. Initially, it reached 186 horsepower power, however, since 1988 the engine had the power of 202 HP and with the marking SW680 / 165. The mechanical gearbox, which was used, wore the designation S6-90 and had 6 gears. The bus steering mechanism had a ballscrew hydraulic power of type 8065. Jelcz also had a dual-circuit brake that worked on the front axle and rear axle; the emergency brake and parking brake were pneumatic, working in the rear axle. The engine brake was activated pneumatically by cutting off the fuel injection and exhaust flow throttling. Lowering the front wall of the cab resulted in lower drag, and therefore had better handling on the road.

It was acquired by a rival in June 1950. Foundation The Compagnie Générale Transsaharienne (CGT) was founded on 23 May 1923. The founder was Gaston Gradis, president of the Nieuport-Astra airplane construction company and son-in-law of Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe, who had founded the first French airline, the Compagnie générale transaérienne. The retired General Jean Baptiste Eugène Estienne, who had designed and built tanks during the war, was made president of the company. The purpose of the company was to \\"study, establish and exploit land and air communications between the various territories of the African continent, particularly between Algeria and Niger.\\" The company planned to provide land and air transport, including infrastructure and operations, for tourism and for topographic reconnaissance of the Mediterranean-Niger railroad project. Exploratory expeditions French Sahara showing some of the first locations reached by trans-Saharan automobile The company began with two exploratory voyages at the end of 1923 and the start of 1924. The first mission was led by lieutenant Georges Estienne, son of General Estienne, with his brother René and lieutenant Hubel, accompanied by four legionnaires and four Citroën mechanics. It travelled from Béni Ounif to Adrar, Algeria, and onward to Tessalit, then returned to Colomb-Béchar. Four Citroën cars with Kégresse tracks towed a Nieuport-Delage aircraft with folding wings covered by a huge white tarpaulin. The mission left Adrar on 17 November 1923, reached Tessalit on 30 November, and returned to Adrar on 13 December, having mapped a shorter route than those known before, over excellent terrain. A second exploratory expedition left Colomb-Béchar at midnight on 25 January 1924, headed by Gaston Gradis, with three large six-wheel Renault cars with double tires. Gradis was accompanied by the Estienne brothers, M. Schwob, an engineer from Renault, and three mechanics. A rival Citroën expedition had left a day before, and the press made great play of the competition, which Gradis thought obscured the important goal of establishing a trans-Saharan route. After reaching Adrar the expedition left for the south in two vehicles, following the tracks of the November reconnaissance expedition, which were still visible. The six-wheel cars proved faster than the Citroën caterpillars. This expedition reached Gao, on the Niger River, and returned to Béchar on 1 March 1924. Gradis was optimistic about the potential for aerial travel along this route. Another expedition left Colomb-Béchar on 15 November 1924 in three six-wheel Renaults headed by Gaston Gradis. Gradis was accompanied by the journalist Henri de Kérillis, and Marshal Louis Franchet d'Espèrey was accompanied by commandant Ihler. The Estienne brothers again joined the expedition. The other members were three Renault mechanics and three legionnaires. The expedition reached Savé in Dahomey on 3 December 1924 after a journey of . The expedition leaders took the train south, and reached Porto-Novo on the Atlantic on 14 December 1924. They then returned to Europe by boat, while the Estienne brothers raced back from Savé to Colomb Bechar in six days, setting a new record for long- distance speed in Africa. The trans-Saharan expedition was acclaimed as a great success, but Georges Estienne was not satisfied due to the huge resources that had been required. The two brothers returned to improve the track. In February 1926 they marked out the route from Adrar so vehicles could find their way in sands storms and heat haze. At each kilometer on the route they placed a numbered barrel with a water reserve. This was the famous \\"Bidon V\\" route. Operations Georges Estienne became head of the CGT. In April 1926 he and René Estienne created a \\"sleeping car\\", a moving hotel that made it possible to cross the Tanezrouft in comfort. To publicize the practicality of the crossing, in 1927 Georges traveled alone from Oran to Niamey in five days as part of an eleven-day journey from Paris to Fort-Lamy. On 18 May 1927 René was killed when a convoy of trucks he was in was attacked by robbers on the road from Tafilalt. Georges continued without his brother, and pushed the track through to Gao. The route soon became popular for sporting expeditions. In the winter of 1927–28 the CGT began running a regular service from Colomb- Béchar to Gao using Renault automobiles. In 1928 Georges Estienne resigned from the army to dedicate himself to the CGT. The local French forces, who already had difficulty maintaining order in the desert, had to cope with an influx of tourists who were completely unfamiliar with the conditions, although the cost and duration of the trips kept numbers low. The administration was forced to reclassify Timbuktu and Gao in 1931 so they would qualify for funds allocated to tourism and business development. Hotels along the route in Reggane, Gao and Niamey were operated by the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique. In 1933 Georges Estienne resigned from the CGT and became involved in opening the oasis route through the Hoggar Mountains. He was made head of the Société Algérienne des Transports Tropicaux (SATT). The CGT took the western route, while its competitor the SATT took the eastern route Algiers – Ouargla – Tamanrasset – Agadès – Zinder – Kano. At the end of October 1938 the army contracted with the CGT to provide trucks and cars for desert crossing. This was not a very effective arrangement, and service could not be provided during the rainy season. The tracks were also not capable of handling the load of repeated convoys, despite deployment of convict labor for repairs. In 1939–40 the CGT transported 4,000 soldiers in 16 convoys of 250 men, carried in seven trucks, from Gao to Bechar. The journey took at least ten days. In March 1942 CGT made arrangements with Mer Niger for maintenance of the military and civilian bases on the route. The CGT, then based in Paris, provided weekly service using Renault trucks and cars from Bechar to Gao. Both the CGT and the SATT added air service after World War II (1939–45). CGT provided air transport for passengers and freight. In October 1946 plans were made to create an air network centered on Niamey. The plan was approved on 18 May 1947. The company was based in Algiers, with Maurice Bonhomme as president and Pierre Puyt as Director of African operations. In August 1947 it opened five routes with four Junkers Ju 52 aircraft. The main route was Algiers – Mascara – Aïn Séfra – Colomb Béchar – Adrar – Gao – Niamey – Bobo Dioulasso – Bamako, with flights twice a month. The airline hoped to link up to Brazzaville. Publicity at the time advertised \\"Rapid transport from the Pyrenees to the Niger\\". After a series of accidents, in 1948 the airline returned the Ju 52 planes to the army and used a Bristol 170 and two Douglas DC-3 machines on loan from the Compagnie Air Transport. This belonged to the same group as the Compagnie générale transatlantique, with which the CGT merged in June 1950.

Under the abbreviated name ESM Challans in 1971 the team was promoted to the first division of the French Basketball Championship, the National 1. There Challans finished in seventh place, which represented the beginning of the establishment in the first division. In the 1975-76 season the team came out seventh in final standings and acquired a right to the FIBA Korać Cup of the next season. There, they lost despite a strong 69-58 victory in the second leg against Cannon Venezia, since the first leg was clearly lost. The sixth place in 1977-78 league season was reached again, it was followed by the second part in the Korać Cup. This time the club eliminated by the Spaniards of Cotonificio. After many years in the top league, the benefits were finally worse, the descent into the second division could not be prevented in the season 1981-82. However, in 1983 Challans failed to resurgence. In addition, the same year the club won the French basketball trophy for unterklassige teams against CRO Lyon. After the first season was ended after the climb to 10th place, the team tied in the 1984-85 season on the successes of the past and was re-sixth. On his third participation in the Korać Cup the club for the first time succeeded in gaining the last 16, and thereby reach the group stage, but where managed just one win in six games. Despite the double burden once more the sixth place in the league has been reached. In the Korać Cup participation 1986-87 the team sold properly at Estudiantes Madrid and Mobilgirgi Caserta, but failed in the group. In 1987 although Challans still qualified for the inaugural play-offs for the French League and was there until the quarter-finals, the club withdrew voluntarily from the professional basketball back and started again in 1993 in the fourth division.

Founded in 1948, UUCA was the first Unitarian church in Washington, D.C.'s suburbs. Throughout its history, UUCA has taken part in progressive causes from the Civil Rights Movement to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Virginia. During the Civil Rights Movement, UUCA was the only Virginia church to speak out in favor of racial integration. UUCA's sanctuary building, designed by local architect Charles M. Goodman in 1964, is a concrete Brutalist structure that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and Virginia Landmarks Register in 2014. It is one of only three church buildings designed by Goodman and the only one in Virginia. History In the early 1940s, leaders from All Souls Church, established in 1821 as the first Unitarian church in Washington, D.C., encouraged its suburban members to start new Unitarian communities in their respective areas. The first one established in the suburbs was the Unitarian Church of Arlington with support and funds from the \\"mother church\\", All Souls. The first meeting was held in George A. Collier's home, located at 832 South Courthouse Road, on September 16, 1943. The following services were held in various spaces on Sunday afternoons so members could still attend the morning services at All Souls. Meeting spaces included the Buckingham Community Room, Ashton Heights Women's Club, and Kate Waller Barrett School. Gilbert A. Phillips, an associate pastor at All Souls, became the Arlington church's minister in 1946. Membership of the Arlington congregation reached 117 by 1948 while the church school had an enrollment of 103. That same year members voted to establish their own independent church. Their approved resolution stated: \\"Be it therefore resolved that the Board of Trustees be petitioned to terminate the Fellowship as an instrumentality of All Souls Church as of March 31, 1948, and be it further resolved that this Fellowship then be organized as a Unitarian Church affiliated with the American Unitarian Association.\\" As membership continued to grow, the congregation needed to find a permanent meeting place. The church purchased a 1.07 acre (0.43 ha) lot at the intersection of present-day Arlington Boulevard and South George Mason Drive. In November 1948, ground was broken on the church's first building, located at 4451 1st Place South, with assistance from the American Unitarian Association which gave the congregation a $15,000 loan. The original building was designed by architect and church member Earl B. Bailey. It was a brick Colonial Revival building containing an auditorium, a kitchen, an office for the minister, and a few meeting rooms. The first service in the new building was held in June 1949 and it was dedicated on October 2. By 1950, church membership had reached almost 250. The success of the Arlington church convinced All Souls minister Arthur Powell Davies to establish the Greater Washington Association for Unitarian Advance (later renamed the Greater Washington Association for Unitarian Universalist Churches) in 1950. The organization was founded to assist with establishing additional Unitarian congregations in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and All Souls and the Arlington church were its first members. UUCA's original building in 1957. In 1953 a religious education wing, also designed by Bailey, was added to the church building, increasing the size of the auditorium and adding classrooms and offices. By the following year the church building had already reached its capacity and the congregation began holding two services on Sundays. The church school, with an enrollment of over 500, also began holding two services on Sundays. The church purchased adjoining property and in 1958 constructed the parsonage, a -story brick Colonial Revival building. By 1959, there were eight Unitarian congregations in Washington, D.C.'s suburbs, with the Arlington church being the largest. The congregation began planning for a new facility and chose Charles M. Goodman, a prominent local architect known for his modernist work, to design the church building. A church committee wrote that it was \\"confident that Mr. Goodman’s concept of design, his wide experience, and his original and creative genius promise for us a distinctive building which will portray in structural form the spirit and aspiration of this congregation.\\" Church leaders invited the congregation to give suggestions for Goodman's design which included \\"an architectural style which would express the inspiring tradition of Unitarianism in Virginia\\" and a \\"free form and no stained glass, [resulting in] a building to represent our cleavage with the past.\\" The congregation wanted the building to \\"reflect their liberal, progressive beliefs and that would signify the UUCA's leadership position within the denomination.\\" According to one UUCA minister, \\"Charles Goodman spent a lot of time with the congregation and incorporating the values and theology of the congregation into the design of the building.\\" Goodman finished his design in late 1961 and the church began seeking financing shortly thereafter. His design included plans for a main sanctuary and adjoining wing, the latter which was not built at the time due to budget concerns. Construction of the sanctuary was carried out by the Martin Brothers contracting firm. The total cost was approximately $300,000, and the dedication was held on March 22, 1964, with a sermon by Dana McLean Greeley entitled \\"Building a Faith for the Future.\\" UUCA's sanctuary is one of only three churches designed by Goodman and his only church building in Virginia. His other two church designs are Bethesda United Church of Christ in Bethesda, Maryland, and Christ Church of Washington (now called Embassy Church) in Washington, D.C. In the mid-to-late 1960s, attendance at church services and enrollment at the church school experienced dramatic decreases. The congregation replaced their minister and began a campaign to attract new members. Attendance gradually increased over the next several years and by 1974, membership had reached 724. The church continued to thrive throughout the next decade and by the late 1980s, church members decided more space was needed. The congregation held meetings regarding the church expansion throughout the next several years. Finally, in 1993, members approved the construction of an addition to the sanctuary. The new wing, designed by Kerns Group Architects of Washington, D.C. and built by Dustin Construction, Inc. of Gaithersburg, Maryland, was dedicated on October 2, 1994. The addition included classrooms and office space, a chapel, and meetings rooms. The design of the new wing was praised by architectural critics and Kerns Group Architects received an Excellence in Architecture award from the American Institute of Architects's Virginia chapter. An additional expansion, designed by Intec Group of Fairfax, Virginia, and built by Sully Construction of Sterling, Virginia, was added in 2013 and includes a hall space and multipurpose activity room. UUCA's 1964 sanctuary was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in September 2014 and the National Register of Historic Places on November 19, 2014, following a two-year effort for the building to be named a historic landmark. One of the church's leaders said \\"We're hoping by it being put on the national registry, people will realize that the physical presence of a group in a community matters. It says something to the world.\\" The 900-member congregation is currently led by Rev. Terasa Cooley. Prominent members, past and present, at UUCA include Representative William R. Ratchford of Connecticut and Arlington County Board Member Jay Fisette, Virginia's first openly gay elected official. =Activism= Cornerstone of the church Like other Unitarian congregations, UUCA is a liberal church that has been active in social justice causes and interfaith dialogue throughout its history. When UUCA was founded, church leaders wrote \\"Our Church like all Unitarian Churches, is dedicated to the progressive transformation and ennoblement of individual and social life through religion, in accordance with the advancing knowledge and the growing vision of mankind.\\" In 1949, a time when most local organizations were segregated, the church operated a children's summer camp open to all races. During the 1950s, the church was one of the few places in Northern Virginia where black and white individuals met to discuss race relations and ways to improve society. In 1951, UUCA minister Ross Allen Weston founded the Community Council for Social Progress, an interracial, interfaith group that promoted \\"full development of democratic principles in human relationship\\". UUCA's members were active during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, protesting against segregation and other unfair treatments of minorities. UUCA minister Weston, who was also president of the Unitarian Fellowship for Social Justice, even received a letter of gratitude from Martin Luther King, Jr. Following the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision, Bolling v. Sharpe, which made segregation in Washington, D.C.'s public schools illegal, Virginia Governor Thomas B. Stanley sought input from the state's citizens. UUCA was the only Virginia church that spoke out in favor of integration. In October 1958, the church received a bomb threat the morning of a sermon by Rabbi Emmet A. Frank of Temple Beth-El. This was part of a larger effort by the American Nazi Party, headquartered in Arlington, to intimidate synagogues and other institutions affiliated with or friendly towards Judaism. The bomb threat was widely condemned by area churches and the Arlington congregation released a statement saying it would not be intimidated, harassed, or coerced to change the way it practiced religion. The church continued to support civil rights causes in the 1960s, registering black voters from Arlington County, and renaming its 1949 building (now demolished) Reeb Hall in honor of James Reeb, an All Souls minister who was killed by segregationists while protesting in Selma, Alabama. Since the 1970s, church members have continued to advocate social justice causes including, but not limited to, environmentalism, women's rights, LGBT rights, and affordable housing. One of UUCA's most prominent projects was the Culpepper Garden Senior Center, a nonprofit retirement housing community for low-income senior citizens, which opened in 1975 and has expanded since then. From the 1990s until it was demolished in 2011, Reeb Hall was rented out to nonprofit groups including the Northern Virginia chapter of Habitat for Humanity and Arlington Street People's Assistance Network. Since the 1990s, Kol Ami, a Reconstructionist Jewish community, has met at UUCA in the library and fellowship rooms. Design and location The church is located on a 3.97 acre (1.61 ha) lot on the southwest corner of Arlington Boulevard (U.S. 50) and South George Mason Drive near the Arlington Forest neighborhood. The property extends south to First Place South, a residential street where the church parsonage is located. A large parking lot, where Reeb Hall once stood, is on the south and west sides of the property. Church attendees access the building's 1994 wing from the parking lot via concrete walkways and a concrete pedestrian bridge beneath a steel canopy. South of the church is the Memorial Wall and Garden, dedicated in 1996. The landscaped garden includes concrete walls, paths, and benches. Concrete blocks inscribed with the names of church members are also found throughout the garden. South of the garden is a playground, built in 2007, that is enclosed by a wooden fence. The 1964 sanctuary, which faces the road intersection, is on the northeast corner of the property on a wooded knoll. Facade of the church, seen from Arlington Boulevard UUCA is composed of three sections: the 1964 sanctuary is a rectangular-shaped, two-story reinforced concrete building; the 1994 addition is a two-story rectangular-shaped concrete structure on the south side of the sanctuary; the 2013 addition is a two-story square-shaped concrete structure on the east side of the 1994 addition and southeast corner of the sanctuary. The two additions \\"complement the original building in their scale, style, material, and fenestration pattern, and fulfill Goodman’s original plans to expand the church with additional space for educational, administrative, and social functions.\\" They are set back and at a lower height in deference to the sanctuary. The sanctuary is a precast concrete building designed in the brutalist style. It features an overhanging concrete flat roof, concrete block foundation, and corrugated concrete wall panels. Square clerestory windows are on the north, east, and west sides of the building's top level and narrow fixed-light windows are on the first floor. The east and west sides of the sanctuary are five bays wide while the north and south sides feature three bays, a large central bay with a smaller bay on each side. The bays are defined by tall concrete columns, spaced apart, that stand from the ground to the underside of the roof. Pale blue wooden doors flanked by black wooden frames provide access to the sanctuary while there are two narrow doors on the north side. The main entrance to the sanctuary is on the south side where the 1994 addition is sited. The 1994 addition runs along the entire south side of the sanctuary and extends west past the building. It is a building that includes a social hall, classrooms, and office space. Like the sanctuary, the 1994 addition features a flat roof and concrete foundation. The concrete walls are a lighter color than the sanctuary and are also smoother. A one-story terrace was originally on the southeast corner of the 1994 addition, but this was replaced by the 2013 addition, named the Celebration Center. The Celebration Center is also faced with light-colored concrete and has a random- coursed stone facing on its east side. Similar to the sanctuary, it features an overhanging roof and wrapping clerestory windows. The sanctuary's meeting space measures by 62 feet and features a polished reinforced concrete floor set in a large grid pattern. The north, east, and west walls are faced with beige brick while the ceiling is exposed concrete. The sanctuary's design allows for the meeting space to have natural lighting which is complemented by patterned rows of light fixtures along the ceiling. The fixtures are the original black-painted, metal cylinders designed by Goodman. A 2.5 foot (0.76 m) high concrete platform stage, now covered with wood, is on the north wall. It features a wheelchair ramp obscured by a decorative wood screen. Seating in the meeting space is composed of padded, moveable pews and chairs. There are two staircase lobbies on the south side of the meeting space that lead to the first floor. The east staircase provides access to the choir balcony via concrete dogleg stairs and an elevator installed in 1974. Goodman chose to place the choir on the south side of the space because he considered it \\"the most desirable location for a choir.\\" The balcony features stepped stairs for choir members and a large pipe organ. The ground floor is a north-south corridor plan with an east-west corridor on the south side giving access to the staircases. The lower floor, which includes meeting and storage spaces, features concrete floors in most areas, concrete block dividing walls, and concrete ceilings.

Barber won the long jump at the 1932 United States Olympic Trials and qualified for the 1932 Summer Olympics, where he played fifth. He was IC4A long jump champion in 1931 and 1932. Career Barber became a successful long jumper at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, winning the 1928 California state high school championship with a meeting record jump of 23 ft in (7.14 m). After graduating from high school he entered the University of Southern California, where he was coached by Dean Cromwell. In 1929, his freshman year, he placed fourth at the national championships with a jump of 23 ft in (7.15 m) and won the national junior title. He was one of the favorites at the 1930 IC4A championships, but failed to qualify for the final. At the other major collegiate meet of the year, the NCAA championships, Barber placed third behind Ed Gordon and Ed Hamm with a jump of 24 ft in (7.37 m). USC Trojans were team champions in both meets. Barber won the 1931 IC4A long jump title with a leap of 25 ft in (7.71 m), which was a new meeting record; USC successfully defended its team title in a close battle against Stanford. At the NCAA meet Barber only jumped 24 ft in (7.55 m) and placed third behind Gordon and Lamoine Boyle, but he was still named the top collegiate All- American. Barber injured his leg in a minor meet in March 1932 and missed the early part of the 1932 season, but returned in top form and jumped 25 ft 4 in (7.72 m) in Fresno on May 14. USC did not compete in the 1932 NCAA meet, but both the Trojans as a team and Barber individually successfully defended their IC4A titles. At the 1932 Olympic Trials, Barber only placed seventh in the qualification, and normally only the top five qualified for the final. However, at the last moment the United States Olympic Committee decided to allow eight finalists instead of five; Barber thus qualified for the final, and jumped his personal best, 25 ft in (7.73 m), to win the trials ahead of Gordon and Lambert Redd. Although the Trials doubled as the AAU (national) championships, Barber is not considered the 1932 AAU champion as the rule change only applied to the Trials and he would not have been a finalist under AAU rules; instead, Gordon became the national champion. As Trials champion, Barber was one of the favorites for the Olympics in Los Angeles, but in the Olympic final he only reached 24 ft 3 in (7.39 m) and placed fifth. In addition to long jumping, Barber played for the Trojans football team starting in late 1931, and was a member of the 1931 and 1932 national championship teams.

Early years Born in 1904, Flynn graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Class of 1926), moving to Chicago in 1927. In Chicago, Flynn became a radio actress and announcer. She was used as a radio announcer, a rarity for women in the 1920s, as she was known for controlling her emotions. This quality of not becoming emotional was exploited in the Vic and Sade show, where she would play the role of straight man to the comic daffiness. Radio One of Flynn's earliest activities on radio was on WJZ in New York City. She replaced Virginia Carter in the ingenue's role on the Empire Builders program. The following year, she was heard on Rin Tin Tin. Also in the summer of 1931, she portrayed Mrs. Jones in The Private Affairs of the Jones Family. Sponsored by Montgomery Ward, the show was one of four tested by the company to test audience response. A newspaper story about it related, \\"Miss Flynn [has] been heard in many dramatic productions from Chicago stories.\\" She was heard in Malik Mystery Drama in 1932. In 1932, Paul Rhymer chose Flynn to play Sade as the character lacked a sense of humor. Even in the most humorous of situations, Flynn's emotional self-control ensured that Sade would never break character. The 15-minute program was aired from 1932 to 1945, and in 1946, it was put back on the air as a one-hour show. Flynn and Durward Kirby co-starred in Daytime Radio Newspaper in 1943. The 15-minute program on CBS had Kirby delivering straight news items and Flynn handling human-interest reports. Television Flynn appeared in both of the television incarnations of Vic and Sade, the only cast member to appear in both the 1949 Colgate Theater episodes and the 1957 revival The Humor of Vic 'n' Sade. She also played Lorna Corey in the soap opera Hawkins Falls, Population 6200, which ran on NBC from 1951 to 1955.Terrace, Vincent (2011). Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010.

After Vic and Sade completed its run on the radio, she joined the touring company of \\"Apple of His Eye,\\" which starred Walter Huston. Later years Flynn retired from broadcasting in 1957 (the same year Art Van Harvey, who played Vic on Vic and Sade, died). In 1964 she moved to Clay City, Illinois, her husband's home town. Personal life Born in Madison, Wisconsin, Flynn married the physician Chester C. Doherty in 1933. Dr. Doherty later became an associate professor at Northwestern University Medical School. The couple had had two sons, Anthony and Bill. (Another source says Flynn was \\"mother of five fine sons.\\") During World War Two, while Dr. Doherty was serving as a flight surgeon in the Army Air Corps at several bases in the US, Flynn also worked as a radio reporter for a daily news program.

She is best known for her 1982 play The Keeper: A Play About Lord Byron. Education Nelke was born in the Bronx, New York to Harold and Teresa (née Apuzzo) Nelke in 1948. She grew up in Wappingers Falls where she attended Roy C. Ketcham High School. After high school Nelke attended Russell Sage College in Troy, New York for a time, before studying speech arts at the American University in Washington, D.C., where she graduated in 1970. She later received her master's degree in English from State University College at New Paltz and an M.Phil. in English from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Career After college, Nelke was a member of the Folger Theatre Group, now the Shakespeare Theatre Company, in Washington, D.C.. She appeared in several productions with the Folger Group, including Natural and Unnatural Acts where she played the role of Lady Caroline Lamb, best known for her affair with Lord Byron, and inspiration for Nelke's most notable play. In 1976, Nelke was the first playwright to be awarded the Lucy Martin Donnelly Fellowship from Bryn Mawr College for her Byron play The Keeper, which was produced by the Philadelphia Theatre Company in their 1976-1977 season and directed by Robert Hedley. The Fellowship awarded Nelke with a cash grant, and an invitation to conduct workshops with Bryn Mawr and Haverford College students with regards to the production of her play during the academic year. In 1982, The Keeper was produced at the Philadelphia Drama Guild and starred Dwight Schultz as Lord Byron, with Patricia Elliott as his sister Augusta, Valerie Mahaffey as his wife Annabella, and Richard Frank as his friend John Cam Hobhouse. The play was directed by Steven Schachter and featured in The Burns Mantle Theater Yearbook: \\"The Best Plays of 1982-1983\\". Nelke's second play, a post World War I love story called Casualties, made its debut at In the Works, Amherst MA (André Bishop Artistic Director).

It was later scheduled to premiere as the closing production of the 1988-1989 season, although it was subsequently scratched from the season due to the full-scale production concerns of the large cast and running time of the script. Personal life Nelke also has had recipes featured in Richard Sax's Classic Home Deserts:A Treasury of Heirloom and Contemporary Recipes. One of her paternal great-uncles, Alexander Nelke was a notable maritime painter, and another, Boris Nelke, was the captain of the Estonian ship Eestirand who saved thousands of Estonian conscripts during the Soviet evacuation of Tallinn in 1941.

Life A native of Scotland (Jean de Launoy, however, states that he was Irish),Irish Ecclesiastical Record, 24-5, mentions John of Ireland Ireland was first at St Andrews University but left in 1459 without a degree and joined the University of Paris as student and teacher. According to his own testimony he remained in France, \\"neare the tyme of thretty yere\\". Records of the Sorbonne suggest he came from a St Andrews family, although Perth has been suggested as his birthplace.Quinn 1965, xii-xiii. Ireland settled in Paris, and became a doctor of the Sorbonne. As Johannes de Hirlandia he served as Rector of the University of Paris in 1469.. Louis XI of France sent Ireland to Scotland in 1480 to urge James III to declare war on England, and to reconcile Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany with his brother the king (failing in this). King James induced him to return to live in Scotland, and gave him a benefice. Ireland then acted as his confessor, and wrote an advice book on kingship which was dedicated to his son and successor. His name appears on the rolls of the Scottish parliaments, and he is referred to by the Scottish historians John Lesley and Thomas Dempster.. As rector of Hawick, Ireland was one of the Scottish ambassadors sent in 1484 to France to receive the oath of Charles VIII to the treaty of 1483. On 23 September 1487 Henry VII of England, at the request of King James, granted a safe-conduct to the Bishop of St Andrews and John Irland, clerk. Works Ireland wrote a book of advice for James III, who died during its compilation, and it was presented to his successor James IV. Divided into seven books, it comes from the Mirrors for princes genre. Book III is an exposition of the Apostle's Creed. Ireland borrowed in it from the works of Jean Gerson, without acknowledgement;. and it has also been argued that he used The Tale of Melibee by Geoffrey Chaucer as a source. The work references Troilus and Criseyde, and includes a religious lyric of Thomas Hoccleve, incorrectly attributed to Chaucer. Ireland was rector of Yarrow (de Foresta), when he completed this book at Edinburgh. The book, preserved in manuscript in the Advocates Library, Edinburgh (MS. 18, 2, 8), and labelled Johannis de Irlandia opera theologica, is a treatise in Scots on the wisdom and discipline necessary to a prince. Usually called the Meroure of Wysdome it is the earliest extant example of original Scots prose. In the text, and in the title of the manuscript, it is noted that Ireland finished the work and gave it to the king in 1490.McDonald 1990, 165. Ireland also wrote a substantial Sentences commentary in four books; the last two books survive in manuscript, in Aberdeen University Library. In the Meroure John refers to two other vernacular writings, one of the \\"commandementis and uthir thingis pretenand to the salvacioune of man\\", the other, of the \\"tabill of confessioune\\". According to Thomas Dempster, Ireland also wrote Reconciliationis Modus ad Jacobum III Regem super dissidio cum Duce Albaniæ. Notes References * * Quinn, F., ed.

Prior to its development, it was a largely wooded area owned for much of the 19th century by the Fry family. The district is centered on the private Fry's Spring Beach Club, whose property includes the eponymous spring, and includes 300 mainly residential buildings with historic character. The architectural styles that predominate in the district are Craftsman and Colonial Revival, although other revival styles such as the Spanish and Tudor Revival are represented by smaller numbers of buildings. There are also four churches in the district. The district extends southward along Jefferson Park Avenue, south of the railroad tracks, and radiates out along Stribling, Todd, Robert, and Raymond Avenues as far as Highland Avenue.

(1941). \\"Molecular Size Distribution in Three Dimensional Polymers I. Gelation\\". J. Am. Chem. Soc. 63, 3083 The Flory- Stockmayer theory represents an advancement from the Carothers equation, allowing for the identification of the gel point for polymer synthesis not at stoichiometric balance. The theory was initially conceptualized by Paul Flory in 1941 and then was further developed by Walter Stockmayer in 1944 to include cross-linking with an arbitrary initial size distribution.Stockmayer, Walter H.(1944). \\"Theory of Molecular Size Distribution and Gel Formation in Branched Polymers II. General Cross Linking\\". Journal of Chemical Physics. 12,4, 125 The Flory-Stockmayer theory was the first theory investigating percolation processes. History  Gelation occurs when a polymer forms large interconnected polymer molecules through cross-linking. In other words, polymer chains are cross-linked with other polymer chains to form an infinitely large molecule, interspersed with smaller complex molecules, shifting the polymer from a liquid to a network solid or gel phase. The Carothers equation is an effective method for calculating the degree of polymerization for stoichiometrically balanced reactions. However, the Carothers equation is limited to branched systems, describing the degree of polymerization only at the onset of cross-linking. The Flory-Stockmayer Theory allows for the prediction of when gelation occurs using percent conversion of initial monomer and is not confined to cases of stoichiometric balance. Additionally, the Flory-Stockmayer Theory can be used to predict whether gelation is possible through analyzing the limiting reagent of the step-growth polymerization.  Flory’s assumptions  In creating the Flory-Stockmayer Theory, Flory made three assumptions that affect the accuracy of this model.Stauffer, Dietrich, et al.(1982) \\"Gelation and Critical Phenomena\\". Advances in Polymer Science 44, 103 These assumptions were # All functional groups on a branch unit are equally reactive # All reactions occur between A and B # There are no intramolecular reactions As a result of these assumptions, a conversion slightly higher than that predicted by the Flory- Stockmayer Theory is commonly needed to actually create a polymer gel. Since steric hindrance effects prevent each functional group from being equally reactive and intramolecular reactions do occur, the gel forms at slightly higher conversion.  General case  A general image of a multifunctional branch unit, A_f, reacting with bifunctional monomers with A and B functional groups to form a step-growth polymer.

Soc. 63, 3096 :linear units with two A-groups (concentration c_1), :linear units with two B groups (concentration c_2), :branched A units (concentration c_3). The following definitions are used to formally define the system > :f is the number of reactive functional groups on the branch unit (i.e. the > functionality of that branch unit) :p_A is the probability that A has > reacted (conversion of A groups) :p_B is the probability that B has reacted > (conversion of B groups) :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{ f c_3 }{2 c_1+f c_3} is the ratio of > number of A groups in the branch unit to the total number of A groups > :r=\\\\frac{2 c_1+f c_3}{2 c_2}=\\\\frac{p_B}{p_A} is the ratio between total > number of A and B groups. So that p_B=r p_A. The theory states that the gelation occurs only if \\\\alpha > \\\\alpha_c, where :\\\\alpha_c = \\\\frac{1}{f-1} is the critical value for cross-linking and \\\\alpha is presented as a function of p_A, :\\\\alpha(p_A) = \\\\frac{ r p_A^2 \\\\rho } { 1 - r p_A^2 ( 1 - \\\\rho ) } or, alternatively, as a function of p_B, :\\\\alpha(p_B) = \\\\frac{ p_B^2 \\\\rho } { r - p_B^2 ( 1 - \\\\rho ) } . One may now substitute expressions for r, \\\\rho into definition of \\\\alpha and obtain the critical values of p_A, (p_B) that admit gelation. Thus gelation occurs if :p_A>\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{ \\\\alpha_c } { r(\\\\alpha_c + \\\\rho - \\\\alpha_c \\\\rho )}}. alternatively, the same condition for p_B reads, :p_B> \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{ r \\\\alpha_c } { \\\\alpha_c + \\\\rho - \\\\alpha_c \\\\rho }} The both inequalities are equivalent and one may use the one that is more convenient.

It is also known as Return Camp 46 and Burke and Wills Camp R46. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 December 2008.  History  The Burke and Wills Plant Camp on Durrie Station is associated with explorers Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills. On the 3 April 1861, on their return trip from the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Burke and Wills expedition were approximately north of the present day Birdsville. That evening Wills made his last astronomical observations and then \\"planted\\" his instruments and associated equipment, presumably in a shallow hole, on an unnamed creek near return camp XLVI (also known Camp R46 or Plant Camp). This return trip was a desperate race to reach their depot camp number LXV - the site of the famous Dig Tree located close to the border with South Australia and near the present Nappa Merrie Homestead. Burke, the leader of the expedition, was born in 1821 in County Galway, Ireland, of Protestant gentry. Following an education at the Woolwich Academy, the young Burke served as a lieutenant in the Austrian cavalry and later the Irish Mounted Constabulary, before emigrating to Australia in 1853. After several postings with the Victorian Police, Burke was appointed to lead the Victorian Exploring Expedition, a position he had anxiously and diligently pursued. Wills, born in Devon England in 1834, trained in medicine. He migrated to Australia in 1853 and after a short stint working as a shepherd at Deniliquin, New South Wales, Wills assisted his father with his medical practice at Ballarat, Victoria. Wills later studied surveying and astronomy, and accompanied the expedition as astronomer, surveyor, and third-in-command, behind camel master George Landells. The Victorian Exploring Expedition was undertaken in the spirit of previous epics such as Edward Eyre's journey between Western Australia and South Australia in 1840, and Ludwig Leichhardt's 1844-1845 trek from the Darling Downs in Queensland to Port Essington near Darwin. Organised by the Royal Society of Victoria and supported by the government, the expedition's objectives were hazy, beyond the desire to make the already-prosperous colony mightier by taking the lead in exploration efforts. The expedition would prove extremely expensive both financially and in lives, yet was ultimately successful in its bid to beat South Australia's John McDouall Stuart to the first north-south crossing of the continent. On 20 August 1860, a large crowd in Melbourne provided a farewell for the explorers. The party comprised fifteen men, twenty-six Indian camels with their drivers, packhorses, wagons, food and supplies. In early October the party reached Menindee on the Darling River. Burke had already begun to shed baggage, determined to travel light and fast, leaving behind much of the equipment and some provisions at Balranald. Burke left more provisions at Menindee. He also quarrelled with Landells, who subsequently resigned. Burke promoted Wills to second-in-charge and engaged local man William Wright as third officer. Despite having received clear instructions that he was to establish his main base camp at Cooper's Creek, Burke pressed on quickly with an advance party of eight, leaving the remainder of the men and stores under the charge of Wright. Wright lingered at Menindee for three months, contrary to Burke's orders to proceed to Coopers' Creek as soon as possible, and Wright failed to arrive at Cooper's Creek with the reserve provisions and transport before Burke returned from the Gulf of Carpentaria. On 6 December 1860 Burke and his seven men established Camp LXV (65) at Cooper's Creek, having halted at several other spots along the Creek during the preceding three-and-a-half weeks while searching for the best location for a longer-term depot. Here Burke split his party once again, and on 16 December pressed on to the Gulf. This northern party was made up of Burke as party leader, Wills as second-in-command and astronomer, navigator and meteorologist, King as attendant to the party's camels, and Gray as camp organizer. Brahe, Thomas McDonough, William Patten and Dost Mahomet were instructed by Burke to wait for at least three months (the more cautious Wills preferred four months), before retracing their steps homewards via the Darling River. During their stay at Camp LXV, Brahe's party erected a timber stockade to protect themselves and their supplies from the unwanted interest of local Aborigines. Following a line to the northeast of Stuart's proposed track, Burke and his team arrived at the Little Bynoe River on 11 February 1861. By this time, they were 57 days out from Cooper's Creek and 13 days over that planned. As they were running low on stores and concerned about meeting the remainder of the exploration party at Cooper's Creek, Burke and Wills left Gray and King at Camp 119 and pushed further north through the mangroves in an attempt to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria coast. However, after three days of difficult travel, they returned south picking up Gray and King. The return trip from the Gulf of Carpentaria became a desperate race to reach the depot camp on Cooper's Creek on low rations and with failing camels. On 3 April 1861, the Burke and Wills Expedition were approximately north of present-day Birdsville. Burke on that day gave an order \\"for leaving behind everything but the grub and just what we carry on our backs.\\" That evening Wills made his last astronomical observations and then, according to the notes in his astronomical journal, \\"planted\\" his equipment in a shallow hole on an unnamed creek near Camp RXLVI (Camp R46). Between February 14 and April 21, the four men, with Gray sickening, continued to struggle back towards Cooper's Creek. Gray became increasingly ill suffering from \\"pain in his head and limbs\\". His condition continued to deteriorate until he died on the morning of April 17. On the morning of 21 April 1861, William Brahe and his party of three others including the seriously-injured Patten, left for Menindee. Burke's party reached Camp LXV that same evening with his two surviving though exhausted camels and with perilously low stores. Brahe had left messages carved into the Dig Tree pointing to the cache of supplies. Subsequent events would prove to be a litany of missed opportunities and failure to communicate. A week after their departure from Camp LXV, Brahe met with Wright's party, heading north and finally en route to Cooper's Creek. Brahe and Wright then returned to the camp, but having noticed no evidence of Burke's return on 21 April, left no further messages or indications and retraced their steps southwards. Brahe arrived in Melbourne late in June 1861 to report on the missing men. On April 23 Burke's trio began the westward journey to Blanchewater Station, near Mount Hopeless in South Australia, preferring to take this direction over the longer, but known, journey to Menindee. Twice they were forced back to Cooper's Creek due to lack of water to the west. They then remained along the Creek throughout June. On 30 May 1861 Wills had returned to Camp LXV. He found no evidence of Brahe's return in early May, and placed his journals and a new note in the buried cache for fear of accidents, and returned to his companions waiting further along Cooper's Creek. After surviving on ground nardoo, which was slowly poisoning them due to their lack of expertise in its preparation in leaching out the toxins, Wills died alone on the banks of Cooper's Creek on 27 or 28 June. He had insisted that his companions head further down the creek to seek assistance from the Aborigines. A day or two later, Burke also succumbed, having sent King on to look for help. With the assistance of Aborigines, King survived along the watercourse until found on 15 September 1861 by Alfred William Howitt's search party. When it became known that the well-publicised Burke and Wills expedition had foundered, a number of search parties were quickly organised. Howitt left from Melbourne, John McKinlay from Adelaide, Frederick Walker from Rockhampton, and William Landsborough from Brisbane. Howitt's party, which included Brahe and King, arrived at Camp LXV on 13 September 1861. The Royal Commission was told that they found the depot as Mr Brahe had left it, the plant untouched, and nothing removed of the useless things lying about, but a piece of leather. The party located Wills' remains where his body had been covered by King, some miles downstream of Camp LXV. They buried Wills on 18 September 1861, and inscribed a tree. Field books, notebooks and various small articles were recovered. Three days later and approximately away, Howitt found Burke's remains near Innamincka Waterhole, north of Innamincka) in South Australia. Burke was buried wrapped in a Union Jack, under a box tree on the south-eastern bank of Cooper's Creek. Howitt blazed this tree at the head of Burke's grave. The Royal Geographical Society, organised to promote exploration, awarded Burke a posthumous RGS Founder's Medal in 1862. Wills was awarded nothing, as the Society's policy was to award only one medal to an exploration party. King received a gold watch, as did McKinlay, Landsborough and Walker for leading their various search parties. These search parties helped open up vast areas of inland Australia for settlement, as a result of the increased knowledge of the country they brought back with them. A Commission of Enquiry was organised to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Burke and Wills. The enquiry was held in Melbourne in November and December 1861. The commissioners interviewed thirteen people connected to the expedition, including the only survivor John King, and examined a range of evidence including Wills' journal. The findings of the enquiry were published in a report released at the end of January 1862. While critical of Brahe's decision to leave the depot camp before he was rejoined by Burke, Wills and King, the commission reported that the many of the calamities that befell the expedition might have been averted, including their deaths, if expedition leader Burke kept a regular journal and gave written orders to his men. In 2010, a student of the University of Queensland, Nick Hadnutt, published his PhD thesis which undertook a detailed analysis of artefacts found at the site when compared with the known dates of the expedition using primary and secondary sources to confirm the authenticity of the site. The thesis concluded that the site was indeed Burke and Wills Camp 46R.  Description  Boundary map, 2015 The Burke and Wills Plant Camp site is located on an unnamed creek on Durrie station, approximately two hours drive north of Birdsville. The archaeological record of the Plant Camp has two key components in two different locations. The majority of the European artefacts found to date were located at the terminus of the intermittent unnamed creek and a claypan. Artefacts have been found all along the unnamed creek in varying concentrations. All artefacts are located within the influence of the drainage pattern of the unnamed creek, however artefacts are mostly found on the high points within this local environment. The depth of the artefacts also varies with the majority being found close to the surface or within the top of soil. A number of artefacts have been collected by a number of researchers who have visited the site including canvas/leather sewing kit needles, thrust block, duck bill leather sewing pliers, percussion cap, nipples and bullets consistent with the calibre, vintage and make of weapons taken on the Burke and Wills Expedition. These artefacts have been compared with the \\"List of Stores III\\" from the expedition and found to be consistent with goods that were officially supplied. The remainder of the site consists of two scarred trees located and east along the creek from the main artefact concentration. The origin of the scars on these trees remains unknown, but it is possible that these are the remains of blazes associated with the Burke and Wills expedition, providing a visible marker for the location of the Plant Camp for other explorers, or in the case of this expedition, to any potential rescuers. Evidence of indiscriminate looting of archaeological artefacts is visible throughout the Plant Camp site. More extensive excavations have also been undertaken at the base of the two scarred trees thought to be associated with the Burke and Wills expedition. Both tree locations show evidence of extensive shovel testing or turning of soil - presumably the digger was searching for buried instruments of other artefacts. Ongoing disturbance is a key threat facing Plant Camp as the process of retrieving surface artefacts without sufficient concern for their provenance and the indiscriminate digging up of artefacts removes them from their archaeological context and thus limits our ability to obtain reliable information about the Burke and Wills expedition.  Heritage listing  Burke and Wills \\"Plant Camp\\" was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 December 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The Burke and Wills Plant Camp is significant in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history as evidence of the nineteenth century interest in scientific exploration. The Burke and Wills expedition, and the subsequent search parties sent to find the lost explorers, contributed to the opening up of Queensland and large portions of inland Australia to pastoralism. The process of pastoral expansion commenced soon after the expedition concluded. Expansion into the largely unknown areas of western Queensland and the gulf forever changed these regions. The Plant Camp is significant as a representation of the past in the present, providing tangible evidence of the first overland north-south crossing of the continent from settled areas in Victoria through Queensland to the Gulf of Carpentaria covering a distance of around . The place was the final camp established by the explorers and is representative of a key stage in the expedition when Burke and Wills decided to abandon most of their equipment. The Plant Camp is significant for its potential to contain additional archaeological artefacts associated with the Burke and Wills expedition, particularly equipment associated with Wills' decision to \\"plant\\" or bury his astronomical equipment and Burke's order to leave behind everything except food and whatever they could carry on their backs. The Plant Camp has been identified through the presence of archaeological artefacts and two blazed trees situated along an unnamed ephemeral creek line on Durrie Station. Artefacts located to date include percussion caps, nipples, buckles, canvas/leather sewing kit needles, thrust block and duck bill leather sewing pliers a number of the brass fittings, including a clasp, escutcheon, latch and hinge all suggestive of a possible instrument case. These artefacts date to the same period (s-1860s) as the Burke and Wills expedition and are consistent with items listed in the detailed \\"List of Stores III\\" of goods officially supplied to the expedition. Plant Camp is significant for its research potential, especially future comparative analysis of archaeological artefacts with others documented at other Burke and Wills campsites. Comparative analysis could provide new and important information on the decisions made by the explorers throughout the expedition, including the rationing of supplies and the value placed on certain objects and items in their possession. For example, scientific analysis may reveal evidence as to why the explorers kept certain scientific instruments and abandoned more practical and useful items which could have increased their chances of success and ultimately survival. Comparative analysis of Plant Camp archaeological artefacts with other early exploration sites across Queensland may also benefit our understanding and knowledge of the conduct of those exploration events. The Plant Camp has potential to substantiate or challenge documented accounts and myths surrounding the final days of the Burke and Wills expedition. Documentary evidence is limited to that provided in William Wills' journals and to that recorded by the Commission of Enquiry for the expedition held in 1862. Additional archaeological research at the Plant Camp may lead to a greater understanding of the reasons behind the ultimate failure of the expedition and enable a better understanding of the hardships endured by the explorers during the expedition. The Plant Camp is significant for its special association with prominent Australian explorers Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills, who both died during the return journey in 1861.

It is located next to the Kinský Palace, on the corner of Old Town Square and Týnská street.  Origin of the name  Stone bell The house is named after the stone bell embedded in the outside corner. The bell could be a reminder of the arrival of John of Bohemia to Prague in 1310, after a futile siege of the city occupied by Henry of Bohemia.  History  The Stone Bell House = Summary = The house today is a remainder of a larger residence from the mid-14th century. It most likely served as a temporary residence for Elizabeth of Bohemia and John of Bohemia after their move to Prague. The house was rebuilt during the 15th-19th century. During these years, the Gothic image of the palace was practically lost. Between 1975-1987 an extensive Gothic revival of the house was carried out. During this renovation, the Gothic facade was uncovered and restored, instead of the existing Baroque one. A reinforced concrete parapet was also added to the roof, which the house previously lacked. Since 1988 it is under administration of the National Gallery in Prague. = 14th – 16th century = The first documented reference of the house dates back to 1363, when it belonged to the nobleman Henslin Pesold from Cheb. In the following years the house had many owners, ranging from rich noblemen to small nobles. Furthermore, the house was a gem of the square thanks to its intricate facade decorations which inspired the articulation of the eastern facade of the new city hall which was built at the end of the 14th century. Between the years 1484-1513, the price of the house doubled. This suggests that the house underwent major renovations during these years. During the first decade of the 16th century, when the house was owned by Václav Šlechta from Pomberk, the eastern wing and a [Renaissance portal were built. Also from this time, several paintings of draperies, which decorated the walls, have been preserved. Sometime after completion, the northern wing was added, which enclosed the courtyard. = 17th – 19th century = A significant milestone for the house was the year 1685, when the house underwent another major renovation. All the Gothic elements which were protruding from the facade were removed and used in the walling up. The house also gained a new roof and its height was reduced. Another major adjustment was changing the number of floors of the corner tower from three to four, which gave the western facade a very distinct character. However, the articulation of three windows was preserved. The northern snail staircase lost its function as the main staircase due to changes in the floor-to-floor height and was used from then on as a pantry. The year 1775 was another year of significant adjustments to the house. A built-on gallery, seated on massive Baroque brackets, was built in the inner courtyard and the western facade got a new stucco accentuation. In the 19th century the house once again underwent smaller adjustments, although not nearly as significant as the previous reconstructions. For example, the Baroque facade was simplified. In the 90s however, the house regained its Neo-Baroque stucco decoration. = Restoration in the 20th century = Boss in the ground floor of the palace During the 20th century, the rooms of the Stone House Bell were used as offices, storage spaces or workshops and the building slowly dilapidated. During the 60s, there were several historical surveys which showed that the house was an exceptional Gothic building. The Head of the State Institute for the Restoration of Historical Towns and Buildings (SÚRPMO) Jan Muk (civil engineer and art historian) together with Josef Hýzler (architect and architectural restorer) discovered the main facade from the Gothic period. The House in 1959, before the Gothic revival After the surveys, a thorough Gothic revival of the house began in 1975 and lasted until 1987. The design works were undertaken by architects A. Charvátová and V. Pelzbauer, while the restoration of the Gothic architectural elements was under the guidance of architectural conservator- restorer Jiří Blažej. At the centre of the Old Town Square, a temporary stonemasonry workshop was created, where the fragments of the elements found in the brick backing were restored. Fragments of stone decorations were temporarily stored in the cellar of the house. Some were stored into a collection storage room. More than 12,000 fragments were found while renovating the house. In the corner tower, the original two floors were restored, thus the Baroque windows were plated and the original Gothic windows were restored. The tracery was assembled from the found fragments, however the baldachins with gablets between the windows were only preserved in the torso. The roofing of the corner tower does not correspond with its historical situation. Originally, the house had a high chiselled roof made of shingles ending only with eaves. However, during the restoration, the designers gave the house a slate, which was not used in Gothic Prague because of its unavailability. They finished off the roof with a reinforced concrete machicolation. Inside, restorers were able to find and restore polychromatic wooden ceilings on both floors as well as painted chapels on the ground floor and first floor. The snail staircase with garderobes was also restored. The inner courtyard, however, retained its Baroque appearance, including the built-on gallery, seated on massive Baroque brackets.  Exterior  As the Stone Bell House is now called a corner tower to which the southern wing is connected. The eastern and northern wings which were completed later, enclose the courtyard of the house. The transverse west wing which was not preserved, stood at the site of today's Kinsky Palace. The facades were plastered with the exception of decorative stone around the jamb, which was very common with medieval burgher houses. The western facade however was an exception, as it was left completely unplastered. = Western facade = The facade facing Old Town Square is the most beautiful from the whole house. Compared to the other facades it is much more sophisticated and can boast with intricate stone carvings. Western lancet windows are regularly arranged in three axes. It has Gothic tracery with trefoils and quatrefoils which end with nuns. Above the windows were gables with trefoils inside, decorated with crockets and finished off with flowers. Torsos of statues of the King and Queen from the west facade of the house - currently in a chapel on the ground floor Between the windows of the first and second floor were niches with brackets for statues. They were also finished with off with lancet arches, decorated with nuns and above them were gables with crochets and plants. On the sides of the niches grew pinnacles from waterleaf capitals. Position of the house between the Kinský palace Church of Our Lady before Týn within the Old Town Square Inside these eight niches were statues. All were placed on brackets and protected by baldachins. Between the windows of the first floor were statues of kings and queens sitting on the throne. By their side, they were accompanied by knights in full armour. The torsos of these statues were reassembled from fragments by Jan Blažej and can be seen today in the chapel located on the ground floor. The statues in the niches of the second floor were not preserved. It is speculated, that there may have been the statues of saints – Czech patrons - Wenceslaus I, Vitus, Adalbert of Prague, and Procopius of Sázava. The ground- floor part of the facade could not be fully renovated due to poor condition. However, after findings of a horse rump, it is speculated that an equestrian statue could have been placed above its portal. The layout of the statues on the front facade and the ornaments refer to both the architecture of cathedrals, as well as ancient Byzantine art. All window jamb profiles and other stone elements are of the same character and show unity, which is proof that the tower was built in a short period of time (around 1310) by a single masonry workshop. The statue decorations reveal that the artists belonged to the same masonry workshop, but it is not known which workshop in particular. While some sources refer to a French-oriented masonry workshop, others refer to a lodge from Cologne.  Interior  = Ground floor = The entire ground floor of the tower is made up of an entrance hall that leads through a passage into the courtyard. The width of the passage indicates that the house could be ridden through on a horse but not a horse-drawn carriage. The carriageway was accessible from the Týnská alley behind the building. Floor plans: 1 - Entrance hall, 2 - Small spiral staircase, 3 - Passageway to the yard, 4 - Passageway to the chapel, 5 - Lower chapel, 6 - Courtyard, 7 - Large spiral staircase, 8 - Hall on the first floor of the tower, 9 - Private chapel, 10 - Built-on gallery A chapel is accessible from the passageway through small Gothic portals. The architectural concept of the space indicates it was not originally intended to be a chapel. It is a long room with two bays of ribbed groin vaults divided by a wide stone strip. The windows facing into the courtyard and into the street are plain and of rectangular shape. The room lacks liturgical requisites except for the murals with a sacral theme, dating back to 1310, which suggest the space was a chapel, despite the walls dating back to the second half of the 13th century. Before the space was consecrated, there may have been a shop or a merchant's room, which in medieval houses was usually located behind the entrance hall. It should however be noted, that also domestic chapels in Central Europe were often situated in very similar spaces with two bays of vaults. = First floor = The tower is accessible from a spiral staircase, located on the left side of the entrance hall. It connects the individual floors of the corner tower. It is used to access the garderobes, and originally allowed entrance to the first floor of the west wing, which had a lower floor-to-floor height. The space of the first floor of the corner tower is once again unified, and there is no doubt that it was used as a representative hall. There are three richly decorated lancet windows which face west towards the square and have stone seats beneath them. The lateral windows facing the side street are rectangular shaped, but from the outside they look like lancet windows with a tympanum. On the northern wall, there is a restored painting showing elements of court art of the second half of the 14th century. The key point in identifying the room’s purpose is the lancet arch portal when entering the spiral staircase from the hall. The portal boasts with a finely profiled jamb with a tracery at the top. On the sides there were brackets in the form of lions' heads and out of these grew pinnacles. Also worth mentioning is a private oratory located in the southern wing. Unlike the chapel on the ground floor, which is located directly below the oratory, the purpose here is clear. The chapel is situated between living chambers and from the location of the door, it shows that it was accessible from both sides and served as the last chamber in this floor. Church services could be viewed by the residents of the house from the adjoining chamber through a horizontal mullioned window. Example of polychromy in a niche in a private oratory Inside, the oratory exuberated with many architectural details. The most significant include a trefoil niche in the east wall. The largest middle foil had a lancet arch with a tracery on the top placed on brackets with vegetal patterns. At the bottom it was finished off with a protuberant cornice, which replaced an altar. Square-shaped niches by the sides complemented with gamblets served as tabernacles and reliquaries. All three niches are decorated with crochets and flowers. Partially preserved are also polychrome (saturated red and blue colors) niches. The oratory has two groin vaults with ogee moulded vaulting ribs, yielded by brackets with once again vegetal patterns. The northern boss is speculated that to have been shaped like the sun, while the southern boss like a crowned face. It is also speculated that other chambers of the first floor served for private purposes, except for the unpreserved transverse hall located in the west wing. Besides the small snail stairway in the tower, the rooms were accessible mainly from the wide spiral stairway in the north wing. = Second Floor = On the second floor of the tower there is a unified space, which was renamed during renovations in the 20th century as the throne room of Elizabeth of Bohemia. It boasts with lancet windows to the west and a triple niche in the southern wall, which is speculated to have been a space for the grand throne. Two brackets found during the renovation of the house are located on the eastern wall, indicating that a fireplace had been here in the past. Above them there is an opening or a niche, connected to the flue of the fireplace. However, the claim that the throne room was actually located on the second floor has its drawbacks. Triple niche in the southern wall of the hall on the second floor Firstly, it is worth noting that the passage between the snail staircase and the hall is not nearly as decorated as the portal of the floor below. This indicates a space of less importance. Another breach in this speculation is the fact that a representative hall already existed on the first floor, another hall therefore lacks purpose. Furthermore, the flue over the fireplace was wrongly dated and is much newer than the opening above it. This proves, that the fireplace was most likely added to the room during the later renovations, the stone brackets therefore do not cohere with it. The research of associate professor Rykl and professor Škabrada shows that these brackets could have been placed in the apex of the triple niche, today finished off with unmoulded stone blocks. According to their opinions, the room was divided into a smaller entrance hall, a room with heating and a hall room with windows in the wall facing the Old Town square. The three rooms were supposedly divided by wooden partitions, the room with heating had a lower wooden ceiling, its structure unfolding from the triple niche. Warm smoke could then be pumped into the space above the room, from where the smoke could escape through the opening by the ceiling. Wooden structures which forged a room with heating inside a larger room were not unusual in the Middle Ages. The room was inhabited probably by women and children in the colder months and could even serve as a place to sleep. The hall next to it was used mainly in the summer. From the layout we can assume that a set of living chambers were located on the second floor of the tower, which typologically corresponds to the more sophisticated buildings of the period. The second floor of the other wings was not directly accessible from the second floor of the tower due to height differences. The layout corresponded to the layout of the rooms located on the first floor, with the difference that the hall of the transverse wing was probably replaced with more private chambers.  Interesting facts  * The Royal Palace of the Prague Castle was uninhabitable for some time after the fire in 1303, therefore it is possible that John of Bohemia and Elizabeth of Bohemia lived in the Stone Bell House, and that Charles IV was born here in 1316. He may have stayed here shortly even after his return to Bohemia in 1333. * Since 2012 the Brikcius Festival is held here - a cycle of concerts of chamber music (spring-autumn.) * Today, it is hard to understand the extensive Baroque adjustments of the building. The changes they made to the Gothic elements of the house are somewhat drastic and incomprehensible. However, it is important to mention, that the research carried out by Jan Blažej revealed that most of the elements were in very poor condition at the time and the whole house seemed to look dingy. This was due to the inappropriate use of marlite on the facade. The use of low-quality stone, or the moulding of some elements caused the architectural elements to be exposed to the effects of water. The Baroque adjustments were therefore essential and brought the building greater comfort of living. * Renovations from the 1960s to the 1980s are still a subject of many disputes. The added concrete wreath of the gallery is controversial as well as use of the technique anastylosis. This technique leaves the original elements in place wherever possible and restores the broken ones with exact replicas. Although opinions on the Gothic revival of the building differ and some scientific circles even reject or disagree with it, the building still remains to be one of great importance in Europe and is an extraordinary example of the profane Gothic architecture which is unparalleled in areas east of France.  Exhibitions  In the building is located The Prague City Gallery, so in the house are often placed exhibitions of the modern and contemporary art, which make a very interesting and special contrast in the antient space of the rooms and halls. * June 2018 - September 2018 - Santiago Calatrava: Art and Architecture  See also  * Old Town Square * Old Town Hall (Prague) * Elizabeth of Bohemia * John of Bohemia * Old Town (Prague) * Czech Gothic architecture  Sources  * HANÁK, Milan.

Dugoni (June 29, 1925 - September 23, 2020) was the former dean of the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry at University of the Pacific and a national leader in dentistry and dental education. In addition to heading University of the Pacific's dental school for 28 years, Dugoni served as president of the California Dental Association, the American Dental Association, the American Dental Education Association and the American Board of Orthodontics. He presented some 1,000 lectures, papers, clinics and essays during his career, and published more than 175 articles. Dugoni championed a humanistic approach to dental education, one that became a model for the nation. He also worked to address the high cost of dental education, and led dental licensure reform at the state and national levels.  Early life and education  Dugoni grew up in San Francisco as one of three children of Arthur B. and Lina Dugoni, who were immigrants from Italy. In a 2011 interview published in Inside Dentistry, he recalled that everyone on the block was a relative and that the whole family came together every Sunday to eat, tell stories and sing operas. He graduated as valedictorian from St. James High School in San Francisco, which later merged with Riordan, and then began college at the age of 17 at the University of San Francisco. With the war, he transferred to Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, where he met his future wife, Katherine A. Groo, who attended Holy Names Academy. Dugoni graduated as valedictorian from Gonzaga in 1944.  Career  Persuaded by the family dentist to follow in his footsteps, the young Dugoni enrolled in dental school at the University of Missouri–Kansas City before completing his D.D.S. degree at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in San Francisco, the school that would later be named after him. In 1948, Dugoni delivered the valedictory address to his fellow dentists at the school. After launching a successful clinical practice, Dugoni returned to the dental school in 1951 as assistant professor of operative dentistry. He held several other faculty positions, including professor and chair of the Department of Orthodontics. In 1963, he completed his M.S.D. degree in Orthodontics at the University of Washington and then went on to pioneer the primary and mixed dentition orthodontic clinic at University of the Pacific. Dugoni continued to maintain a private orthodontic practice in South San Francisco until 1987. In 1978, he was appointed dean of the School of Dentistry at University of the Pacific. On August 28, 2004, when Dugoni was 79, the University honored him for his long and distinguished leadership by renaming the school as the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry. Some 1,600 guests attended the ceremony, including 22 deans of U.S. dental schools as well as Richard W. Valachovic, longtime executive director of the American Dental Education Association. Dugoni stepped down as dean in 2006, but continued to be involved with the school and the university as dean emeritus, professor of orthodontics and senior executive for development.  Leadership, honors and awards  Served as president of the American Dental Association (1988-1989), American Dental Association Foundation; American Association of Dental Schools, and California Dental Association, and as treasurer of the Federation Dentaire Internationale FDI World Dental Federation. Among his many honors, Dugoni was elected in 1998 to the FDI World Dental Federation List of Honour, which is limited to 30 living individuals worldwide who have made distinguished contributions to international dentistry. In 2001, he received the William John Gies Award, the highest honor bestowed by the American College of Dentists. The California Dental Association recognized him with its Dale F. Redig Distinguished Service Award in 2003. In 2009, the ADEAGies Foundation honored him with its Award for Outstanding Achievement - Dental Educator. He received honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Detroit; University of Louisville; and Louisiana State University. Dugoni is a fellow of the American and International College of Dentists and the Academy of Dentistry International, a member of the Pierre Fauchard Academy, and a founding member of the National Academies of Practice. He is an honorary member and fellow of the Academy of General Dentistry and an honorary member of the American Academy of Oral Medicine.

The species is known solely from the Oligocene sediments found exposed in central coastal Alaska, US. It is one of several extinct species belonging to the living section Rubra. Taxonomy Acer kenaicum is known from a pair of leaf specimens and a solitary samara which were recovered from two different outcrops of Early Oligocene strata. The Redoubt Point Flora is part of the Tyonek Formation, while the Tsadaka Canyon belongs to the Tsadaka Formation. While hundreds of fossil leaves were examined from the Redoubt Point flora, only one A. kenaicum leaf and one samara fossil was identified. In the Tsadaka Canyon flora a single A. kenaicum leaf was found. An additional leaf fragment, which was to fragmentary to describe to species, but showing morphology seen in the modern Acer section Spicata species. The type specimens for A. kenaicum are the holotype leaf type specimen and paratype fruit from Redoubt point, and the paratype leaf from Tsadaka Canyon, all of which are part slab fossils. At the time of description, all three were preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the National Museum of Natural History, part of the Smithsonian. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. kenaicum in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name kenaicum is a reference to the type locality of the species within the Kenai Group. Based on the characters seen in the leaves and fruits of Acer kenaicum, Wolfe and Tanai suggested the species was a probable ancestral maple for the modern Acer saccharinum (silver maple). Acer saccharinum leaves Description Leaves of Acer kenaicum are simple in structure, with perfectly actinodromus vein structure and are widely ovate in shape. The leaves are five-lobed with upper lateral lobes that are two thirds as long as the median lobe. All the lateral lobes are triangular in outline while the medial lobe is elliptic in outline. The leaves have five primary veins, five secondary veins that diverge from the lateral primary veins and six medial secondary vein pairs. The samara of A. kenaicum has a moderately inflated nutlet and smoothly diverging veins which rarely anastomise. The overall shape of the nutlet is elliptic with a rounded tip and approximate length of and a wing width of . The paired samaras of the species have a 25° attachment angle and have seven veins originating in the attachment scar of the samara that run the length of the wing.

For much of his time there, he was a housemaster; latterly he was Second Master. He was elected Member of the Royal Archaeological Institute in 1950. He published papers on the vegetation of coastal Cornwall and Norfolk (places he had known from boyhood), and on that of Northamptonshire Jurassic limestone. He served on the Council of the British Ecological Society, and was active as a journal editor. He was a member of several natural history clubs and trusts in Northamptonshire and, later, Cambridgeshire. He has been described as, \\"a modest man, courteous, patient, popular with students and staff\\". As well as being a devoted teacher, he loved music: the Hepburn Music Competition at Oundle was started by him (while Second Master) in the early 1950s, and is named after him. He dedicated his book Flowers of the Coast to his wife Phyllis, \\"who loves the sea but is sometimes uncertain of her botany\\". An early review remarks, \\"This book, so clearly and unpretentiously written, so admirably illustrated, is imaginatively stimulating to a quite unusual degree. No fringe of beach or, scrubby headland, no strip of brackish marsh, no tidal estuary can seem, when one has read it, devoid of interest.\\" Personal life Hepburn married Phyllis Champ, daughter of the school's Director of Music, in 1947. He died suddenly at his home in Cambridge, age 72.  Bibliography  * New Naturalist #24.

It is based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and is affiliated with the Institute of Museum and Library Services, based in Washington, D.C. ATALM also maintains close ties with numerous state, regional, and tribal library, museum, and cultural associations, including the National Museum of the American Indian, the Library of Congress, the Sustainable Heritage Network, Amigos Library Services, and several other museums, consortia, and libraries. It is largely funded by grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services and other affiliated institutions.  History and mission  ATALM was officially founded in 2010, building upon work begun at the 2002 National Conference of Tribal Archives, Libraries, and Museums, in Mesa, Arizona and continued at subsequent conferences in 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2009. Initial funding came from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Arizona State Museum, and the Western Council of Libraries. It has sponsored conferences since its inception, continuing the tradition that led to its incorporation in 2010. ATALM seeks to provide support to indigenous archives, libraries, and museums through programming, collaborative work, and advocacy. ATALM further works to guarantee that indigenous nations will, through tribal memory institutions, be empowered to conserve and house their own historical documents, artifacts, and histories.  Membership and governance  As an association of tribal memory institutions, ATALM seeks to ensure representation from a wide range of tribal nations in order to guarantee that the Association maintains cultural relevancy as well as an indigenous perspective. ATALM has both a board and an advisory council. Its current president is Susan Feller, while its administrative vice president is Melissa Brodt. Both the board and advisory council are composed of representatives from many tribal nations with a broad range of library, museum, and archival experiences.  Strategic plan and future  ATALM's strategic planning committee works to guide the Association and to respond to its members’ needs as it builds a plan for the Association's future. Much of the work is informed by a Feasibility Survey Report completed in 2008, prior to ATALM's official incorporation. The Strategic Planning committee works to secure funding and build sustainable strategies for programming, advocacy, and training, among other things. ATALM's aim is for sustainability, growth, and continued advocacy, and its strategic planning committee works towards all goals.  Surveys, engagement, and advocacy  Part of ATALM's core mission includes advocacy for tribal archives, libraries, and museums, as well as more generally for “cultural sovereignty of Native Nations.” ATALM sponsors regular conferences pertaining to indigenous knowledge management, studies tribal libraries and the digital divide on reservations, and compiles numerous surveys and reports to better understand and serve its clientele. = Digital inclusion = ATALM conducted an extensive survey on the digital divide in Indian Country, producing in 2014 a lengthy report as well as resources for tribal memory institutions. Issues of digital inclusion are important to tribal libraries. Some areas lack access due to remote locations or extremely rough terrain, and many telecommunications companies have avoided reservations, as they do not believe the regions merit infrastructure investments. Moreover, Internet service is often low-speed and extremely expensive in tribal nations, and the FCC acknowledges that less than 10% of tribal land in Indian Country has broadband, further positing that the number may be even lower. ATALM's Digital Inclusion in Native Communities, assembled by Miriam Jorgensen, Traci Morris, and Susan Feller, is the first report to consider issues of Internet access in tribal libraries, and provides data on Internet in tribal libraries and on reservations as well as suggestions for improvement and advocacy as tribal memory institutions continue to evolve and move forward. = Surveys and reports = ATALM conducts regular surveys and compiles reports on tribal memory institutions. Much like Digital Inclusion in Native Communities, the reports draw on original research, including surveys and interviews with tribal memory institutions. Many reports also offer advocacy advice and suggestions for improving services or expanding ATALM's offerings. In keeping with its mission, ATALM includes documentation on indigenous peoples’ rights with reports on tribal memory institutions.

He is often referred to as \\"The Elder\\", to distinguish him from his son, Károly Markó the Younger.  Biography  In the early 1800s, although he was already interested in art, he studied engineering as an apprentice in Pest and Kolozsvár. Markó Károly @ the Magyar Életrajzi Lexikonban. From 1812 to 1818, after mastering his craft, he worked as an engineer in Ólubló and Rozsnyó. It was in the latter city that he produced his first paintings, modeled after those of well-known contemporary artists. In 1818, he moved to Pest and studied to improve his drawing skills. Four years later, he moved to Vienna, where he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, majoring in history and landscape painting. He married there and ultimately had eight children. From 1826 to 1830, he lived in Eisenstadt, then settled on the Eszterházy estates, where he produced copies for art dealers and was increasingly in demand. Under the patronage of a local banker, he returned to Hungary and produced Visegrád, one of his most familiar paintings. In 1832, he made an extended tour of Italy, visiting Florence, Venice, Bologna and Rome. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave Rome in 1838 when he became ill with malaria and had to stay in Pisa until 1843. While there, he was elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He travelled again, from 1843 to 1848, when he decided to settle permanently somewhere near Florence, eventually taking up residence in a townhouse at Lappeggi, courtesy of Count Gherardesca. He soon became very popular among the local aristocracy and was never short of work to do. Except for one brief painting trip to Hungary in 1853, he would remain there the rest of his life. His sons András and Ferenc were also well-known painters.

Rolling Stone retracted the story in its entirety on April 5, 2015. The article claimed that Jackie Coakley, a UVA student, identified only as \\"Jackie\\" by the magazine, had been taken to a party hosted by UVA's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity by a fellow student. At the party, Jackie alleged in the article, her date led her to a bedroom where she was gang raped by several fraternity members as part of a fraternity initiation ritual. Jackie's account generated much media attention, and UVA suspended the fraternity. After other journalists investigated the article's claims and found significant discrepancies, Rolling Stone issued multiple apologies for the story. It has since been reported that Jackie may have invented portions of the story in an unsuccessful attempt to win the affections of a fellow student in whom she had a romantic interest. In a deposition given in 2016, Jackie stated that she believed her story at the time. On January 12, 2015, Charlottesville Police officials told UVA that an investigation had failed to find any evidence confirming the events in the Rolling Stone article. UVA President Teresa Sullivan acknowledged that the story was discredited. Charlottesville Police officially suspended their four-month investigation on March 23, 2015, based on lack of credible evidence. At the request of Rolling Stone publisher Jann S. Wenner, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism agreed to audit the editorial processes that culminated in the article being published. On April 5, 2015, Rolling Stone retracted the article and published the independent report on the publication's history. UVA associate dean Nicole Eramo, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and several fraternity members later filed lawsuits against Erdely and Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone lost at trial the suit filed by the university, and settled the lawsuits with the fraternity and its members. In light of the findings, Erik Wemple of The Washington Post pronounced the story \\"a complete crock\\". In the Columbia Journalism Review, Bill Grueskin called the story \\"a mess—thinly sourced, full of erroneous assumptions, and plagued by gaping holes in the reporting\\". The Columbia Journalism Review called the story \\"this year's media-fail sweepstakes\\" and the Poynter Institute named it as the \\"Error of the Year\\" in journalism. Story Sabrina Erdely On November 19, 2014, Rolling Stone published the now retracted article by Sabrina Erdely titled \\"A Rape on Campus\\" about an alleged gang rape of a University of Virginia (UVA) student, identified only as Jackie in the article, by members of the UVA Phi Kappa Psi fraternity during a chapter house party in 2012 as part of a hazing ritual. For anonymity, Erdely only used Jackie's first name and gave pseudonyms to other students discussed in the story. According to Los Angeles Times columnist Jonah Goldberg's summary of the story, on September 28, 2012, Jackie, a freshman at UVA, had a date with a Phi Kappa Psi member \\"Drew\\", a junior at UVA. After the date, they allegedly went to a party at his fraternity house, where he brought her to a dark bedroom upstairs and \\"a heavy person jumps on top of her. A hand covers her mouth. Someone gets between her legs. Someone else kneels on her hair. And for the next three hours she's brutally raped and beaten, with Drew and another upperclassman supposedly shouting out instructions to the pledges, referring to Jackie as 'it'.\\" According to Goldberg, \\"It is an account of a sober, well-planned gang rape by seven fraternity pledges at the direction of two members.\\" After leaving the party around 3 a.m., allegedly with bruises and blood stained clothes, Jackie called her three best friends, \\"Andy\\", \\"Randall\\" and \\"Cindy\\", for support. In Rolling Stones version, Jackie's friends discouraged her from going to the hospital to protect her reputation and because Andy and Randall planned to rush fraternities and worried their association with Jackie might hurt their chances if she reported it. Erdely wrote that Randall was no longer friends with Jackie and, \\"citing his loyalty to his own frat, declined to be interviewed\\". Jackie's academic performance reportedly declined, and she became socially withdrawn due to emotional distress. In May 2013, Jackie reported a sexual assault to dean and head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board, Nicole Eramo, who, according to a recap in New York magazine, offered three options: \\"file a criminal complaint with the police, file a complaint with the school, or face her attackers with Eramo present to tell them how she feels\\". The university would not take further action unless Jackie disclosed the names of the individuals or the fraternity involved. In September 2013, Eramo connected Jackie with Emily Renda, a UVA staff member, recent graduate and leader in the college's sexual assault support group One Less. Two years later, in search of a college student to feature in a story about sexual assaults that occur at a prestigious university, Erdely interviewed Renda, who suggested Jackie for the story and made the introduction. Initial response from UVA community Teresa Sullivan Within hours of the article's publication, UVA president Teresa Sullivan had called the governor's chief of staff and the Charlottesville police chief to start preparing a response. She said her initial reaction was surprise and \\"a certain air of disbelief\\" because during her 44-minute interview for the story, Erdely never brought up Jackie or asked about any of the allegations made in the article. Sullivan said: \\"I was plainly not prepared for what the story looked like. Nor do I think her characterization of my interview was fair.\\" The next day, Phi Kappa Psi voluntarily suspended chapter activities at UVA for the duration of the investigation. A few days later, the university president Sullivan suspended all Greek organizations until January 9, 2015. UVA's student newspaper The Cavalier Daily described mixed reactions from the student body, stating: \\"For some, the piece is an unfounded attack on our school; for others, it is a recognition of a harsh reality; and for what I suspect is a large majority of us, it falls somewhere in between.\\" Cavalier columnist Dani Bernstein rejected Erdely's portrayal of UVA's student body as sharing equal blame with the administration. Bernstein also said that regardless of its veracity, the Rolling Stone article underscored preexisting and recurrent complaints about the school's inadequate handling of sexual assault and their \\"deference to Greek life\\". She argued that \\"the school has been unbelievably slow to investigate Phi Kappa Psi despite many allegations of sexual assault\\". Also within the first day following publication, Phi Kappa Psi's fraternity house at UVA was vandalized with spray-painted graffiti that read \\"suspend us\\", \\"UVA Center for Rape Studies\\", and \\"Stop raping people\\". In addition, several windows were broken with bottles and cinder blocks, and police officials said that the group received \\"disparaging messages\\" on social media. A few hours after the incident, several news groups received an anonymous letter claiming responsibility for the vandalism and demanding that the university implement harsher consequences for sexual assault (mandatory expulsion), conduct a review of all fraternities on campus, the resignation of Nicole Eramo, and the implementation of harm reduction policies at fraternity parties. A few days later, hundreds of people participated in a protest and march organized by UVA faculty as \\"part of a series of responses to the recently published Rolling Stone article\\". A student quoted in The Daily Progress said that men at a nearby bar were \\"quick to yell 'insults and slurs' at the protestors as they walked by\\". A local business owner expressed support of non-violent demonstrations and told The Cavalier Daily that \\"The only way thing[s] change is if you talk about what's happening.\\" The march ended outside of the Phi Kappa Psi house where protesters challenged a perceived \\"culture of sexual assault at the University\\". Community members offered suggestions for immediate steps administration could take to implement preventative measures and address safety concerns regarding sexual assault. One student protester told The Cavalier Daily: \\"I really hope the University takes this article and the protest movement as a sign that they need to be more transparent about the way they deal with sexual assault.\\" Four participants who were sitting on the steps to the Phi Kappa Psi house were arrested on trespassing charges for refusing to move when police officers asked them to leave. The Interfraternity Council (IFC) at UVA released a statement on its website in response to the article that said: \\"an IFC officer was interviewed by Rolling Stone regarding the culture of sexual violence at the University. Although the discussion was lengthy, the reporter elected not to include any of the information from the interview in her article.\\" Story's veracity =Questions emerge= Richard Bradley, editor-in-chief of Worth magazine, was among first mainstream journalists to question the Rolling Stone article, in a blog entry written on November 24, 2014. After an interview Erdely gave to Slate, in which she was questioned about the way she investigated the piece, some commentators escalated their questioning of the veracity of the article. It was later revealed Erdely had not interviewed any of the men accused of the rape. Erdely defended her decision not to interview the accused by saying that the contact page on the fraternity's website \\"was pretty outdated\\". The Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple rejected Erdely's statement, saying that the severity of the accusations she was reporting required \\"every possible step to reach out and interview them, including e-mails, phone calls, certified letters, FedEx letters, UPS letters and, if all of that fails, a knock on the door. No effort short of all that qualifies as journalism.\\" Fraternity officials, who rejected the published allegations, noted a number of discrepancies in the story: there was no party held on the night that Jackie was allegedly raped, no fraternity member matched the description in the story of the \\"ringleader\\" of the rape, and details about the layout of the fraternity house provided by the accuser were wrong. Fraternity officials also noted that, prior to the Rolling Stone story, there had never been a criminal investigation or allegation of sexual assault against an undergraduate member of the chapter. Fraternity officials further disputed a claim in Erdely's piece that said the rape had occurred as part of a pledging ritual by observing that pledging on the UVA campus occurs in spring, not autumn as the story stated. They said that no pledges were resident in the fraternity at the time Erdely claimed. The Washington Post reporters later interviewed the accuser at the center of Erdely's story and two of the friends that Rolling Stone said she had met on the night of the incident. The accuser told the Post that she had felt \\"manipulated\\" by Erdely, and claimed she asked Erdely not to quote her in the article, a request the journalist denied. Jackie requested that her assailants not be contacted, and Rolling Stone agreed. Bruce Shapiro of Columbia University said that an engaged and empathetic reporter will be concerned about inflicting new trauma on the victim: \\"I do think that when the emotional valence of a story is this high, you really have to verify it.\\" He also explained that experienced reporters often work only with women who feel strong enough to deal with the due diligence required to bring the article to publication. The two friends confirmed to the Post that they remembered meeting Jackie on the night of the incident, that she was distraught but not visibly injured or bloodied, and that details she provided then were different from those in the Rolling Stone article. One friend, Ryan Duffin (called \\"Randall\\" in the Rolling Stone article), told The Washington Post that he had never spoken to any reporter from Rolling Stone, although Erdely had claimed him as a source to corroborate the accuser's story. Sandra Menendez, a student who claimed to have been interviewed by Erdely but who was not directly quoted in the article, told CNN that she and others became uncomfortable after speaking with Erdely, concluding she had \\"an agenda\\". =Existence of \\"Drew\\"= The article uses the pseudonym \\"Drew\\" to refer to a third-year student at the University of Virginia who takes Jackie to the fraternity party where the alleged rape takes place. \\"Drew\\" gives \\"instruction and encouragement\\" to the seven rapists. Jackie's friends in the story have provided evidence since then that the man Rolling Stone calls \\"Drew\\" was electronically introduced to them as \\"Haven Monahan.\\" Jackie forwarded messages from \\"Monahan\\", and \\"Monahan\\" exchanged messages with Jackie's friends, including sending a picture of \\"himself\\" directly to Ryan Duffin. However, media investigations have determined that no student named \\"Haven Monahan\\" has attended the University of Virginia; the portrait of \\"Haven Monahan\\" is an image of a classmate of Jackie's in high school, who has never attended the University of Virginia; the three telephone numbers through which \\"Haven Monahan\\" contacted Jackie's friends are registered \\"internet telephone numbers\\" that \\"enable the user to make calls or send SMS text messages to telephones from a computer or iPad while creating the appearance that they are coming from a real phone\\" and love letters written by Jackie and forwarded by \\"Haven Monahan\\" to Ryan Duffin are largely plagiarized from scripts of the TV series Dawson's Creek and Scrubs. Per records released by Yahoo under subpoena in 2016, Haven Monahan's e-mail account was created from inside the University of Virginia \\"only one day before that same account sent an email to Jackie's friend Ryan Duffin\\" in 2012. The same account was accessed on March 18, 2016 from inside ALTG, Stein, Mitchell, Muse & Cipollone LLP, Jackie's legal firm. After initially refusing to answer whether Jackie had access to or created the Haven Monahan email account, on May 31, 2016, Jackie's law firm filed court papers acknowledging they had recently accessed \\"Haven Monahan's\\" e-mail account for the purpose \\"of confirming that documents Eramo requested for the lawsuit were no longer in Jackie's possession.\\" \\"Haven Monahan\\", as reported by T. Rees Shapiro, \\"ultimately appeared to be a combination of names belonging to people Jackie interacted with while in high school in Northern Virginia. Both of those people—who attend different colleges and bear no resemblance to the description Jackie gave of her attacker—said in interviews that they knew of Jackie but did not know her well and did not have contact with her after she left for the University of Virginia.\\" According to news articles covering lawsuits resulting from the Rolling Stone article, Jackie concocted the Haven Monahan persona in a catfishing scheme directed at a UVA classmate named Ryan Duffin. Duffin was a friend of Jackie's who had not responded to romantic overtures that Jackie had directed at him. =Rolling Stone apologizes= Initially, Erdely stood by her story, stating: \\"I am convinced that it could not have been done any other way, or any better.\\" But on December 5, 2014, Rolling Stone published an online apology, stating that there appeared to be \\"discrepancies\\" in the accounts of Erdely's sources and that their trust in the accuser was misplaced. A subsequent tweet sent by Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana offered further comment on Erdely's story: \\"[W]e made a judgement—the kind of judgement reporters and editors make every day. And in this case, our judgement was wrong.\\" On December 6, Rolling Stone updated the apology to say the mistakes in the article were the fault of Rolling Stone and not of its source, while noting that \\"there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account\\". The New York Observer stated that Rolling Stone deputy managing editor Sean Woods (the editor directly responsible for the article) tendered his resignation to the magazine's owner, Jann Wenner. Wenner, who was reportedly \\"furious\\" at Erdely's story, declined to accept the resignation. In the aftermath of the collapse of the story, managing editor Dana revealed: \\"Right now, we're picking up the pieces.\\" Rolling Stones lawyer told jurors in a 2016 trial that Rolling Stone was victim of a \\"hoax\\" and a \\"fraud\\", and added with regard to Jackie: \\"the magazine's editorial staff was no match for Jackie ... 'she deceived us, and we do know it was purposeful'.\\" =Erdely apologizes= Erdely publicly apologized for the article on April 5, 2015, though her apology did not include any mention of the fraternity, or the members of the fraternity who were accused. The Columbia Journalism Review called the apology \\"a grudging act of contrition\\". Spokesmen for both publisher Wenner and Will Dana, managing editor, said that Erdely would continue to write articles for Rolling Stone. =2016 comments by Jackie= On October 24, 2016, in a video deposition, Jackie said, \\"I stand by the account I gave Rolling Stone. I believed it to be true at the time.\\" WCAV of Charlottesville, Virginia, published the audio of Jackie's 2014 statements to Erdely. Debate =Media reaction= The Washington Post journalist Erik Wemple criticized the story's graphic details of the alleged crime and said that it was hard to believe due to the \\"diabolical\\" description. A number of commentators accused the magazine of setting rape victims \\"back decades\\", while The Washington Post described the Rolling Stone story as a \\"catastrophe for journalism\\". Natasha Vargas-Cooper, a columnist at The Intercept, said that Erdely's decision not to interview the accused fraternity members showed \\"a horrendous, hidden bias ... the premise that none of these guys would tell the truth if asked\\", while a staff editorial in The Wall Street Journal charged that \\"Ms. Erdely did not construct a story based on facts, but went looking for facts to fit her theory.\\" Lauren Kling of the Poynter Institute criticized Rolling Stone for \\"blaming [the] source\\" instead of taking ownership of their own errors. Anna Merlan, a writer for Jezebel, who had earlier called Reason columnist Robby Soave an \\"idiot\\" for expressing skepticism of the Rolling Stone story, declared: \\"I was dead fucking wrong, and for that I sincerely apologize.\\" Merlan had also labeled journalist Richard Bradley's doubts about the article a \\"giant ball of shit\\". Fellow Jezebel writer Jia Tolentino wrote an analysis of Erdely's story and reported on fraternity rush after the Rolling Stone article was discredited. In her article Tolentino stated: \\"Five years after I'd left the UVA Greek system, I read 'A Rape on Campus' as an outsider account about a true problem, written by someone good at cherry-picking... So it took me a day or two to admit that I found many of Erdely's details unrecognizable. No one says 'UVrApe'; no one I know has ever heard the Rugby Road-themed 'traditional fight song' that poetically ('fuck for 50 cents'/'panties on the fence') separated the article's sections... Jackie was lying, and railroaded into the spotlight on a story that now appears to be a PTSD-laced delusional flashback.\\" On December 6, The Washington Posts media critic Erik Wemple called for all Rolling Stone staff who were involved with the story to be fired. Wemple posited that the claims presented by the magazine were so incredible that editors should have called for further inquiry before publication. \\"Under the scenario cited by Erdely\\", Wemple wrote, \\"the Phi Kappa Psi members are not just criminal sexual-assault offenders, they're criminal sexual-assault conspiracists, planners, long-range schemers. If this allegation alone hadn't triggered an all-out scramble at Rolling Stone for more corroboration, nothing would have.\\" An editorial in the Boston Herald declared: \\"a fifth-grader would've done some basic fact-checking before potentially ruining men's lives\\" before repeating the call for the firing of Rolling Stone staff involved in the story. Journalist Caitlin Flanagan, who wrote an exposé in The Atlantic titled \\"The Dark Power of Fraternities: A yearlong investigation of Greek houses\\", told On the Media that she was concerned that Erdely's article could inhibit reforms of the Greek system. She said: \\"I think we've gone backwards 30 years. And I think the level of devastation that this Rolling Stone report that's now looking to go from a misremembered event to perhaps an actual hoax.\\" Flanagan noted that \\"what Rolling Stone has pushed me into is that I have now become someone who is on the side of fraternities and defending fraternities.\\" Writing for Time, columnist Cathy Young said that the unraveling of Erdely's article \\"exposed the troubling zealotry of advocates for whom believing rape claims is somewhat akin to a matter of religious faith\\". Christina Hoff Sommers, being interviewed by John Stossel for Reason, commented that the story \\"proved to be a sort of gothic fantasy, a male-demonizing fantasy. It was absurd.\\" After two Vanderbilt University football players were convicted of rape on January 27, 2015, Richard Bradley, who was the first mainstream journalist to question the Rolling Stone story, wrote a blogpost titled \\"Why Didn't Sabrina Rubin Erdely Write about Vanderbilt?\\" In the post, he asked: \\"Is Vanderbilt just not as sexy a story as UVA?\\" Robby Soave in Reasons Hit & Run Blog answered Bradley's query about why Erdely chose UVA over Vanderbilt. He wrote: =Local reaction= Students at the University of Virginia expressed \\"bewilderment and anger\\" following Rolling Stones apology for its story, with one female student declaring \\"Rolling Stone threw a bomb at us.\\" Virginia Attorney-General Mark Herring said he found it \\"deeply troubling that Rolling Stone magazine is now publicly walking away from its central storyline in its bombshell report on the University of Virginia without correcting what errors its editors believe were made.\\" Emily Renda, the university's project coordinator for sexual misconduct, policy and prevention declared that \\"Rolling Stone played adjudicator, investigator and advocate and did a slipshod job at that.\\" Sociology professor W. Bradford Wilcox, meanwhile, tweeted that \\"I was wrong to give it [the Rolling Stone story] credence.\\" Writing in Politico two days after the \\"story fell apart\\", Julia Horowitz, deputy editor of the university's campus newspaper, described the feeling among students: \\"The campus—relatively oversaturated with emotion after a semester of significant trauma—feels as if it is on stand-by, poised in anticipation of where the next torrent of news will take us.\\" =Response of fraternity and sorority groups= Within days following the unraveling of the Rolling Stone story, the North American Interfraternity Conference, the National Panhellenic Council, and the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee demanded that the University of Virginia \\"immediately reinstate operations for all fraternity and sorority organizations on campus\\" and issue an apology to Greek students. On December 8, the University of Virginia restated their original decision that the suspensions would be lifted on the resumption of classes in the new term, on January 9. After Phi Kappa Psi was reinstated at the start of the 2015 Spring semester, UVA Phi Psi President Stephen Scipione said, \\"We are pleased that the University and the Charlottesville Police Department have cleared our fraternity of any involvement in this case... In today's 24-hour news cycle, we all have a tendency to rush to judgment without having all of the facts in front of us. As a result, our fraternity was vandalized, our members ostracized based on false information.\\" Accuser scrutinized On December 8, 2014, ABC News reported that the person quoted by Erdely as alleging a rape at Phi Kappa Psi had retained an attorney. Quoting its legal consultant Mark Eiglarsh, the network reported that if Jackie \\"allegedly lied and that perpetrator suffered injury as a result, she could be sued for damages\\". On December 10, 2014, The Washington Post published an updated account of its inquiry into the Rolling Stone article. Slate reported that the Post account strongly implied Jackie's tale of rape had been fabricated in an attempt to win over \\"Randall\\", who had previously rebuffed her romantic advances. Writing in Slate, Hannah Rosin described the new The Washington Post investigation as close \\"to calling the UVA gang rape story a fabrication\\". Emily Renda, who was a University of Virginia student at the time of the alleged attack and in whom Jackie also confided, said that she had become suspicious as to the veracity of Jackie's story prior to the Rolling Stone report, commenting to a The Washington Post editor: \\"I don't even know what I believe.\\" In the aftermath, Jackie was characterized as \\"a really expert fabulist storyteller\\" by Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner in an April 5, 2015 interview. At the subsequent trial, one of Jackie's friends the night of the alleged attack testified that their friendships eventually dwindled because of Jackie's \\"tendency to fabricate things\\" =Key discrepancies according to The Washington Times= In Erdely's story, Jackie is lured into an alleged seven-man rape by U. Va. upperclassman \\"Drew\\". Prior to the alleged event, Jackie provided evidence of her relationship with \\"Drew\\" to her friends by supplying a phone number for \\"Drew\\", with whom Jackie's friends subsequently exchanged messages. The Washington Times determined \\"Drew\\"'s \\"telephone\\" and \\"Blackberry\\" numbers were in fact \\"Internet phone numbers that enable the user to make calls or send SMS text messages to telephones from a computer or iPad while creating the appearance that they are coming from a real phone\\". \\"Drew\\" eventually sent a photo of \\"himself\\" to Jackie's friends, but \\"the man depicted in that photograph never attended U. Va\\" and was a high-school classmate of Jackie. =Key discrepancies according to ABC News= In Erdely's story, Jackie sank into depression after the alleged rape and was holed up in her dorm room for a while. Her friends, however, told ABC News that she seemed fine after the alleged assault, contradicting Jackie's former roommate, Rachel Soltis, who claimed that Jackie \\"was depressed, withdrawn, and couldn't wake up in the mornings\\" following the alleged rape. In Erdely's story, Jackie tells her three friends the night of the alleged event that she was raped by seven men over a three-hour period while rolling on a mat of broken glass. The three friends disclosed to ABC News their actual names – Alex Stock's pseudonym was \\"Andy\\", Kathryn Hendley's was \\"Cindy\\", Ryan (Duffin) was \\"Randall\\" – and went on record that on the night of the alleged event Jackie told the two men that she was forced to fellate five men while a sixth stood by. =Key discrepancies according to The Washington Post= In Erdely's story, the rape was supposed to have occurred during a party at Phi Kappa Psi as part of a pledging ritual. Phi Kappa Psi countered by noting that there had been no party held on the night of the alleged attack and no pledges resided in the house at that time of year. In response to those revelations, Jackie's father declared that Phi Kappa Psi had been misidentified and the attack had occurred at a different fraternity, though he did not elaborate as to which one. However, that statement seemed to contradict an earlier assertion the accuser had made to The Washington Post, in which she stated: \\"I know it was Phi [Kappa] Psi, because a year afterward, my friend pointed out the building to me.\\" In Erdely's story, Jackie disclosed to friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall the identity of her date to the fraternity party and said that he was the ringleader of the rape. Later media analysis of photos Jackie showed her friends of her date demonstrated that they were pictures taken from the public social media profile of a former high-school classmate of Jackie, who was not a student of the University of Virginia, did not live in the Charlottesville area, and was out of state at an athletic competition the day of the alleged attack. Jackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall had become suspicious as to whether Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was a real person. Prior to the date, they attempted to locate him in a student directory and were unable to find evidence that he existed. The trio also sent text messages to a phone number Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were surprised that the owner of the phone number responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom Jackie was romantically interested in. In 2012 Jackie told her friends that she had been accosted by five men, though she later testified to Erdely that she had been attacked by seven, with two more directing and encouraging the rape. Erdely said that Jackie regained consciousness alone in the fraternity after 3 a.m. and fled the building blood-spattered and bruised, phoning three friends for help. They arrived \\"minutes later\\" and found her on the corner next to the building. However, The Washington Post stated that the three friends reported getting called at 1 a.m. and meeting Jackie a mile away from the fraternities, and that they saw \\"no blood or visible injuries\\". The Post did report, however, that Jackie appeared distraught after the rape allegedly took place. =Key discrepancies according to The Philadelphia Inquirer= Inquirer media columnist Michael Smerconish recounted that when he interviewed Erdely about the story on Sirius XM radio, she told him: \\"I talked to all of her friends, all the people that she confided in along the way.\\" But as Smerconish wrote, \\"[S]he did not talk to all of Jackie's friends. In fact, her failure to speak to the three friends in whom Jackie supposedly confided immediately after the alleged incident was perhaps the most egregious of a string of journalistic failures.\\" Investigations =Police investigation= On January 12, 2015, the University of Virginia reinstated the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity after the police investigation concluded that no incident had occurred at the fraternity. According to Charlottesville Police Capt. Gary Pleasants, Phi Kappa Psi has been cleared; \\"We found no basis to believe that an incident occurred at that fraternity, so there's no reason to keep them suspended.\\" On March 23, 2015, police noted that Jackie refused to cooperate with law enforcement during the investigation. Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo explained, \\"We would've loved to have had Jackie come in ... and tell us what happened so we can obtain justice ... even if the facts were different.\\"Couric, Katie, \\"UVA rape investigation: Police say no evidence to support allegations reported by Rolling Stone \\", Yahoo! News, March 23, 2014 Over the course of 4 months, the Charlottesville Police spoke to 70 people, including Jackie's friends, Phi Kappa Psi fraternity brothers, and employees at the UVa Aquatic Center, where Jackie worked. No one supplied evidence to corroborate Jackie's accusations of a gang rape happening or that the accused rapist, supposedly named \\"Drew\\" or \\"Haven Monahan\\", even existed. The police were also unable to corroborate Jackie's allegations that two other sexual assaults had taken place at the fraternity house or that she had been assaulted and struck to the face with a bottle in a separate incident. Therefore, the criminal investigation was suspended on March 23. =Columbia University School of Journalism's investigation= After the details in \\"A Rape on Campus\\" began to unravel, Rolling Stone's publisher Jann Wenner commissioned Columbia University's School of Journalism to investigate the failures behind the publication of the article. On April 5, 2015, Columbia's 12,000-word review of \\"A Rape on Campus\\" was published on both Rolling Stone's and the journalism school's websites. It was prepared by Steve Coll, the dean of Columbia's journalism school; Sheila Coronel, the dean of academic affairs; and Derek Kravitz, a graduate school researcher. The Columbia report stated that \\"At Rolling Stone, every story is assigned to a fact-checker.\\" Assistant editor Elisabeth Garber-Paul provided fact-checking. The fact-checker concluded that Ryan – \\"Randall\\" under pseudonym – had not been interviewed and that in \\"one of the story's many unfathomable deceits\\", as The Washington Post put it, the article pretended that he had been interviewed. The Columbia report cited the fact-checker: \\"I pushed. ... They came to the conclusion that they were comfortable\\" with not making it clear to readers that they had never contacted Ryan. Ultimately, the report determined that Rolling Stone had exhibited confirmation bias and failed to perform basic fact checking by relying excessively on the accuser's account without verifying it through other means. The Columbia report also found a failure in journalistic standards by either not making contact with the people they were publishing derogatory information about, or when they did, by not providing enough context for people to be able to offer a meaningful response. The report also states that the article misled readers with quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings. The report concluded, \\"Rolling Stone's repudiation of the main narrative in \\"A Rape on Campus\\" is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable. The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine's editors to reconsider publishing Jackie's narrative so prominently, if at all. The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from.\\" It points out that Rolling Stone staff were initially unwilling to recognize these deficiencies and denied a need for policy changes. =Reactions to investigations= Rolling Stones reaction Rolling Stone fully retracted \\"A Rape on Campus\\" and removed the article from its website. However, Coco McPherson, who is in charge of Rolling Stones fact-checking operation, said, \\"I one-hundred percent do not think that the policies that we have in place failed.\\" Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana was also cited on the Columbia report: \\"It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things.\\" Jill Geisler in the Columbia Journalism Review reacted to Dana's statement by saying, \\"At a time when humility should guide a leader's comments, that quote carries the aroma of arrogance.\\" Jann Wenner added that \\"Will Dana, the magazine's managing editor, and the editor of the article, Sean Woods, would keep their jobs.\\" Sabrina Erdely would also continue to write for Rolling Stone. Wenner laid blame for the magazine's failures on Jackie. In an interview with The New York Times, he called her, \\"a really expert fabulist storyteller\\", and added, \\"obviously there is something here that is untruthful, and something sits at her doorstep.\\" In response to these statements, Megan McArdle wrote in Bloomberg View, \\"Rolling Stone can't even apologize right.\\" Rolling Stone announced that Will Dana will leave his job at the magazine, effective August 7, 2015. When asked if Dana's departure was influenced by the debacle surrounding Erdely's article, the magazine's publisher responded that \\"many factors go into a decision like this\\". Erik Wemple of The Washington Post called Dana's departure \\"four months too late\\". Dana was replaced by Jason Fine, the managing editor of Men's Journal. Phi Kappa Psi's reaction After the Charlottesville Police concluded that there was no evidence of a crime having occurred at Phi Kappa Psi during their press conference on March 23, 2015, Stephen Scipione, the president of Phi Kappa Psi's UVa chapter, announced that his fraternity is \\"exploring its legal options to address the extensive damage caused by Rolling Stone\\", He added, \\"False accusations have been extremely damaging to our entire organization, but we can only begin to imagine the setback this must have dealt to survivors of sexual assault.\\" Phi Kappa Psi's national headquarters released the following statement: \\"That Rolling Stone sought to turn fiction into fact is shameful...The discredited article has done significant damage to the ability of the chapter's members to succeed in their educational pursuits and besmirched the character of undergraduate students at the University of Virginia who did not deserve the spotlight of the media.\\" They went on to call for Rolling Stone to \\"fully and unconditionally retract its story and immediately remove the story from its website\\". Phi Kappa Psi's national president Scott Noble stated that they are \\"now pursuing serious legal action toward Rolling Stone, the author and editor, and even Jackie\\". University of Virginia's reaction After both the Charlottesville Police press conference and Columbia University's investigative report, UVa President Teresa Sullivan released the following statement: Consequences The Washington Post reported that the members of Phi Kappa Psi \\"went into hiding for weeks after their home was vandalized with spray paint calling them rapists and bricks that broke their windows\\", and had to escape to hotels. The report indicated the college students suffered disgust, emotion, and confusion. Some students \\"actually had to leave the room while they were reading [the article] because they were so upset.\\" A former student who graduated in 2013 said \\"the day [the article] came out was the most emotionally grueling of my life.\\" Phi Kappa Psi members received death threats and the president of University postponed all events related to its fraternities and sororities until mid-January. One month after the publication of the Rolling Stone article, the Rector of the University of Virginia, George Keith Martin, accused the magazine of \\"drive-by journalism\\" when he stated, \\"Like a neighborhood thrown into chaos by drive-by violence, our tightly knit community has experienced the full fury of drive-by journalism in the 21st century.\\" According to the Columbia report, \\"Allen W. Groves, the University dean of students, and Nicole Eramo, an assistant dean of students, separately wrote to the authors of this report that the story's account of their actions was inaccurate.\\" Columbia published Groves' letter, where he contrasts video of his statements to the University of Virginia Board of Visitors in September 2014 with the text of Erdely's published article, which differ significantly, and concludes that Erdely's article contains \\"bias and malice\\". Erdely furthermore reported that Office for Civil Rights Assistant Secretary Catherine E. Lhamon called Grove's statements at the meeting (as misreported by Erdely) \\"deliberate and irresponsible\\". On January 30, 2015, Teresa Sullivan, the President of the University of Virginia, acknowledged that the Rolling Stone story was \\"discredited\\" in her State of the University Address. In her remarks, she said, \\"Before the Rolling Stone story was discredited, it seemed to resonate with some people simply because it confirmed their darkest suspicions about universities—that administrations are corrupt; that today's students are reckless and irresponsible; that fraternities are hot-beds of deviant behavior.\\" The Rolling Stone article had a negative effect on applications to the University of Virginia. For the first time since 2002, applications to the University dropped. Prior to the publication of the story, Early Action applications were up 7.5 percent with 16,187 applicants. However overall applications were down 0.7 percent to 31,107 in the aftermath of the publication. National sorority leaders ordered UVA sororities to not interact with fraternities during Boys Bid Night when fraternities admit new pledges. Virginia sorority members called the restrictions \\"unnecessary and patronizing\\". =Sexual assault skepticism= Due to increased social skepticism about the prevalence of sexual assault created by the unraveling of Erdely's Rolling Stone report, the Military Justice Improvement Act will be \\"much harder\\" to enact, according to Margaret Carlson. Lindy West said that female rape victims will probably be less likely to report sexual assaults for fear of being questioned by \\"some teenage 4Channer\\". Froma Harrop issued a call for media outlets to begin to publicly name rape accusers, explaining that \\"reporters and editors should expand their sensitivities to include the reputations of those accused, not always justly\\". Several commentators hypothesized that allegations of rape against Bill Cosby, which surfaced at the same time as the publication of \\"A Rape on Campus\\", would be less damaging to the comedian as a result of the seeming collapse of the Rolling Stone story. When Camille Cosby spoke about the rape allegations against her husband Bill, she said: \\"We all followed the story of the article in the Rolling Stone concerning allegations of rape at the University of Virginia. The story was heart-breaking, but ultimately appears to be proved untrue. Many in the media were quick to link that story to stories about my husband – until that story unwound.\\" Writing for Bloomberg, Zara Kessler observed that, \\"suddenly, every Cosby accuser is a potential 'Jackie'—although we don't yet know precisely what it means to be a 'Jackie.' How honest are the intentions of Cosby's accusers?\\" The North American Interfraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Council, meanwhile, have announced that they have retained the services of Squire Patton Boggs to lobby the U.S. Congress to take action to ensure that Greek-letter organizations are protected from future accusations of the kind leveled in Erdely's article. Media sources and commentators discussed the allegations in the context of the reported \\"rape culture\\" or a rampant sexual assault epidemic that activists had claimed existed on U.S. college campuses. The media commentators noted that the claims of a rape culture's existence on campuses was not supported by U.S. government statistics or other measures. Harvey A. Silverglate in The Boston Globe referenced the Rolling Stone article in opining that the college sexual assault \\"scare\\" follows a long tradition of runaway, exaggerated social epidemics that \\"have ruined innocent lives and corrupted justice. A return to sanity is called for before more wreckage occurs.\\" =Media criticism= The Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple stated that everyone connected to this story at Rolling Stone should be fired. After the Charlottesville Police made their official report, Wemple said: \\"What is left of the Rolling Stone piece? Very little. There's some reporting on the university's culture, which shouldn't be taken seriously in light of the fraud exposed by the police; there's some reporting on the university leadership's approach to the issue, which shouldn't be taken seriously in light of the fraud exposed by the police.\\" National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg has called for Phi Kappa Psi to sue Rolling Stone, while at least one legal expert has opined that there is a high likelihood of \\"civil lawsuits by the fraternity members or by the fraternity itself against the magazine and maybe even some university officials\\". ABC News has reported that the accuser, Jackie, herself might be sued. By December 5, 2014, Christopher Pivik, a former member of Phi Kappa Psi at the University of Virginia, had retained attorney Andrew Miltenberg. According to Miltenberg, he specializes in \\"defamation and complex internet and First Amendment issues\\". In the Columbia Journalism Review, Bill Grueskin called the story \\"a mess—thinly sourced, full of erroneous assumptions, and plagued by gaping holes in the reporting\\". The Columbia Journalism Review called the story \\"this year's media-fail sweepstakes\\". Additionally, the Poynter Institute named the story as the \\"Error of the Year\\" in journalism. =Lawsuits= On May 12, 2015, UVA associate dean Nicole Eramo, chief administrator for handling sexual assault issues at the school, filed a $7.5 million defamation lawsuit in Charlottesville Circuit Court against Rolling Stone and Erdely, claiming damage to her reputation and emotional distress. Said the filing: \\"Rolling Stone and Erdely's highly defamatory and false statements about Dean Eramo were not the result of an innocent mistake. They were the result of a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on American college campuses, and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic bottom line for its faltering magazine, than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts.\\" In February 2016, the judge in the lawsuit ordered Jackie to appear at a deposition on April 5, 2016. On March 30, 2016, The Washington Post reported that Jackie's lawyers have requested the April deposition be cancelled, to avoid having her \\"revisit her sexual assault\\". However, on April 2, 2016, the judge denied the motions and ordered Jackie to appear for a deposition on April 6, to be held at a secret location. On November 4, 2016, after 20 hours of deliberation, a jury consisting of eight women and two men found Rolling Stone, the magazine's publisher and Erdely liable for defaming Eramo. On November 7, 2016, the jury decided that Rolling Stone and Erdely were liable for $3 million in damages to Eramo. On November 9, 2015, Phi Kappa Psi filed a $25 million lawsuit against Rolling Stone in state court \\"to seek redress for the wanton destruction caused to Phi Kappa Psi by Rolling Stones intentional, reckless, and unethical behavior\\". Complaint, Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity v. Rolling Stone LLC, No. CL15-479 (Charlottesville, Va. Circuit Court filed November 9, 2015), available at The Washington Post . In September 2016, the magazine sought to have the lawsuit dismissed; however, a circuit court judge ruled that the suit could proceed. On June 13, 2017, the lawsuit was settled for $1.65 million. Fraternity chapter at U-Va. to settle suit against Rolling Stone for $1.65 million . A further lawsuit by a number of members of the fraternity was greenlighted by a court of appeals on September 19, 2017, after originally being dismissed by a lower court in June 2016. The lawsuit was settled on December 21, 2017. =Popular culture= Street artist Sabo papered Hollywood with posters styled like a Rolling Stone cover featuring the headline \\"Rape Fantasies and Why We Perpetuate Them\\". The poster featured an image of Lena Dunham, whose own allegations of rape had recently come under scrutiny, and included a sidebar reference to \\"A Rape on Campus\\" that read \\"Our UVA Rape Apology: Ooops, we did it AGAIN!!!\\" Law & Order: SVU featured an episode titled \\"Devastating Story\\" in its 16th season whose plot was based on the UVA case. It features a fictional character named Heather Manning who was based on Jackie. In the episode, Heather fabricates a gang rape at a fraternity in an attempt to further her feminist agenda.

The lake has no public access boat launch. It feeds into Bear Creek, which flows towards the Sammamish River at Redmond. Fish in the lake include cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, and sockeye salmon as well as rock bass, pumpkinseed, walleye, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike and yellow perch. A fishing license is required. The lake was formerly used to raise non-native bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) for the restaurant industry, and a high population of bullfrogs remains. The lake is also home to a very rare species of mollusk, Valvata mergella, collected by W. J. Eyerdam in 1941, B. R. Bales in 1958, and T. J. Frest and E. J. Johannes in 1995. Water quality in the lake was classified as eutrophic by the King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks in 2003. The water was monitored by volunteers between 1996 and 2008. The water temperature was found to vary between 4 °C and 22 °C and thermal stratification during the summer was found to be stable. Two significant peaks in the algae population were detected, predominantly Dinobryon and other chrysophytes, in late May and in late September. Other species detected include several cryptophyte species and the diatom Asterionella formosa. Phosphorus content was found to be significantly higher in the depths through sedimentary release.

The work was discovered shortly after World War II. Heinrich Tschuppik, who found the orchestral score of the work in the estate of Bruckner's pupil , attributed the authorship to Bruckner. Thirty years later, Mahler scholar Paul Banks, who knew only a four- stave reduction of the work, attributed the work to Mahler and requested its orchestration. While the exact circumstances of the composition of this Prelude have not been determined, it is certain to have been composed within the circle of Bruckner and his students at the Vienna Conservatory of Music. Based on the original orchestral score, it seems likely that the work was at least sketched by Bruckner, possibly as an exercise in orchestration for Krzyzanowski.Georg Tintner & the Symphonic Prelude  History  After World War II, Heinrich Tschuppik discovered a 43-page long manuscript of an unknown overture-like symphonic movement in C-minor in the estate of his uncle, Rudolf Krzyzanowski. The manuscript carried the inscription Rudolf Krzyzanowski cop. 1876 on the first page, and on the last page in large blue letters von Anton Bruckner (by Anton Bruckner). = An unknown work by Anton Bruckner? = Krzyzanowski was a pupil of Anton Bruckner, who, together with Gustav Mahler, prepared in 1877 the piano transcription of Bruckner's Third Symphony.C. van Zwol, pp. 737-738 Tschuppik reported his finding in the Schweizerische MusikzeitungHeinrich Tschuppik, Ein neu aufgefundenes Werk Anton Bruckners, in the Schweizerische Musikzeitung 88/1948, p. 391 and in the Süddeutsche Zeitung,Heinrich Tschuppik, Bruckners Sinfonisches Präludium, in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, 8 September 1949 prepared a clean copy of the score and handwritten orchestral parts, and arranged also a four-stave particello of it. A copy of the manuscript was also made for storing in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek. Tschuppik showed the piece to experts on Bruckner, and Franz Gräflinger, and conductor Volkmar Andreae. Andreae agreed to perform this unknown Sinfonisches Präludium with the Vienna Philharmonic.Benjamin- Gunnar Cohrs, Symphonisches Präludium – Composed by Anton Bruckner? However, the performance, which had been planned for 23 January 1949 did not take place,Helmut Albert Fiechtner, Verhinderte Bruckner-Uraufführung in Die Österreichische Furche, Vienna, 29 January 1949 because Nowak, who was asked for expertise, had not been able to come to a final conclusion about the authorship. The premiere was performed later by the Munich Philharmonic under Fritz Rieger on 7 September 1949. Shortly afterwards Tschuppik died and his clean copy, handwritten orchestral parts, and a photocopy of the four stave particello remained stored in the archive of the Munich Philharmonic. The photocopy of the original manuscript remained in Nowak's possession and was returned to the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek after his death in May 1991. Nowak had not included the Symphonisches Präludium in Bruckner's ' because he still doubted its authorship. = A youthful work by Gustav Mahler? = Tschuppik had also given a copy of his own particello arrangement of the Präludium to Gertrud Staub-Schläpfer in Zürich. After studying the piece, Staub-Schläpfer wrote on top of the particello: Könnte das nicht eine Arbeit f. Prüfung von Gustav Mahler sein? Krzyzanowski gab den Klavierauszug zur dritten Symphonie Bruckners (2. Fassung) heraus mit Mahler zusammen. (Could this perhaps be composed by Gustav Mahler for his examination? Krzyzanowski edited the piano arrangement of Bruckner's Third Symphony (second version) together with Mahler.) On 7 September 1949, on the same day as the first performance of the Präludium in Munich, she gave the particello to the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek. Thirty years later, Mahler scholar Paul Banks discovered in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek the particello annotated by Staub-Schläpfer and, following her suggestion, assumed that the piece could indeed be one of the lost works that Mahler had composed during his time at the Vienna Conservatory.Paul Banks, An Early Symphonic Prelude by Mahler? in 19th Century Music 3/1979, pp. 141-149 Since the particello was the only source he knew, Banks asked Albrecht Gürsching to complement the instrumentation. This \\"reconstruction\\"Mahler, Gustav – Sinfonisches Präludium für Orchester, Sikorski-Verlag, Berlin, SIK1431, 1981 – ISMN: 9790003013688 was first performed by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra under Lawrence Foster on 15 March 1981 as \\"Symphonisches Präludium by Gustav Mahler\\". A recording of Foster's performance and a few other not issued performances are put in the Bruckner archive. The Gürsching orchestration has been recorded by Neeme Järvi in 1992. = The truth? = The truth (?) came to the light in 1985 when Wolfgang Hiltl discovered the documents stored in the archive of the Munich Philharmonic.Wolfgang Hiltl, Ein vergessenes, unerkanntes Werk Anton Bruckners?, in Studien zur Musikwissenschaft / Beihefte der Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich, Vol. 36, Tutzing, 1985 He bought Krzyzanowski's original manuscript from Tschuppik's family and let it be published by Doblinger.Symphonic Prelude in C minor (transcription by Bruckner's Student Rudolf Krzyanowski), Wolfgang Hiltl (ed.), Doblinger,Vienna, 2002 – STP 704, ISMN 012-18981-7 Nevertheless, not everyone became convinced that the piece was originated by Bruckner and so the \\"controversial\\" piece remained rarely performed. The original orchestration was performed first by Gerhard Samuel with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in March 1997, and, in 2010, by Baldur Brönnimann with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and Markus Stenz with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, respectively. A recording of these three performances is put in the Bruckner archive. = Note = In 2008, Wolfgang Hiltl died unexpectedly and Krzyzanowski's original manuscript of the \\"Symphonic Prelude\\" ended up on the garbage slope of his apartment …  Music  Wolfgang Hiltl, who undertook a meticulous examination of the 293-bar long manuscript in the light of Bruckner's contemporary pieces, came to the conclusion that the most likely assumption would be that Bruckner had given a score to Krzyzanowski, perhaps as an exercise in instrumentation. It seemed clear that the entire musical substance was by Bruckner himself, most likely as an \\"emerging autograph score\\", with all string parts, some important lines for woodwind and brass, and perhaps a few passages already entirely completed.Wolfgang Hiltl, Einsichten zu einer Musik im Jahrhundertschlaf, in Studien & Berichte, Mitteilungsblatt 63 der IBG, December 2004, pp. 13–16 = Setting = Krzyzanowski's copy is laid out only for Bruckner's typical orchestra of double woodwind, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, bass- tuba, timpani, and strings, the orchestration used by Bruckner from his Fifth Symphony, composed in 1875/1876, revised in 1877/1878. The first theme, which contains the core of the main themes of the First and Second Symphony in C minor, is repeated in tutti (bar 43), leading into a dark chorale (bar 59), pre-shadowing the structure of that from the Finale of the Ninth Symphony, and even a significant epilogue (bar 73), which is used later in the development (bar 160). The second theme (bar 87) reflects ideas of the Third Symphony and the miserere of the D minor Mass. The closing theme is an energetic trumpet call with a repeated minor ninth, as at the beginning of the Adagio from the Ninth Symphony, which is also pre- shadowing the end of its first movement. The second part (bar 148) brings two elements from the main theme in variants, leading into a threefold outburst of it in the dominant (bar 195), tonic (bar 201) and subdominant (bar 207). The recapitulation of the second theme is a fugato (bar 221) with a development section, which again reflects the Third Symphony (bars 249), leading into a climax, in which both first and second themes appear simultaneously (bar 267). The rather short coda is merely a final cadence with almost no thematic material left, only reflecting the closing theme, as a repeated chain of minor seconds. One may assume that this elaboration by Krzyzanowski, which sounds rather provisional, may have been filled-up later with more concise motivic derivations. It seems indeed clear from Hiltl's stylistic examination that the musical material itself is all Bruckner's, because some of these ideas even anticipate some music from the Ninth Symphony, composed some 25 years later, which nobody can have known already in 1876. In all, this \\"Symphonic Prelude\\" constitutes an extremely advanced, \\"experimental\\" sonata movement, with a dramatic, almost radical second part combining development, recapitulation and coda to a unified and radical second part. The musical language and structure anticipate much of Bruckner's last composition, the symphonic choralwork Helgoland (1893).

He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 24th round of the 2013 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed with the Dodgers and made his professional debut with the Arizona League Dodgers.Former Southern pitcher De Leon signs, sent to rookie league He was later promoted to the Ogden Raptors. De León returned to Ogden to start the 2014 season. After recording a 2.65 earned run average (ERA) and 77 strikeouts in innings, he was promoted to the Great Lakes Loons. In his second start with the Loons, De León had 14 strikeouts, breaking Clayton Kershaw's team record of 12 set in 2007. In four starts with Great Lakes, he had a 1.19 ERA with 42 strikeouts in innings. After the season, he was named the Pioneer League Pitcher of the Year, for his performance that season with Ogden. De León was assigned to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the California League to start the 2015 season. In seven starts for the Quakes he was 4–1 with a 1.67 ERA and he was promoted to the AA Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League on May 18. He was selected to the California League mid-season all-star team but was unable to participate because of his promotion to AA. He was selected as a second team Baseball America minor league all-star after the season. He had a 2–6 record in AA with a 3.64 ERA and 105 strikeouts. He was given a non-roster invitation to Dodgers spring training. In 2016, he spent the season in AAA with the Oklahoma City Dodgers, where he was 7–1 with a 2.61 ERA in 16 starts. He also struck out 111 batters against only 20 walks. De León had his contract purchased by the Dodgers and was called up to the majors on September 3, 2016, making his debut as the starting pitcher for the Dodgers against the San Diego Padres on September 4. He allowed four runs in six innings in his debut to pick up the win. His nine strikeouts (with no walks) was the second most by an Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher in his debut, trailing only Pedro Astacio and Kazuhisa Ishii. In four starts for the Dodgers he was 2–0 with a 6.35 ERA. =Tampa Bay Rays= On January 23, 2017, the Dodgers traded De León to the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for second baseman Logan Forsythe. De León started the 2017 season ranked as the Rays' third best prospect and 28th overall by MLB Pipeline. He opened the season on the minor league disabled list due to discomfort in the flexor mass muscle in the forearm, which is a precursor to Tommy John Surgery. On May 29, De León got his first call-up by the Rays due to a depleted bullpen from a 15 inning victory against the Minnesota Twins the day before. In his Rays debut, he allowed three runs on four hits, two walks, and two strikeouts in 2 innings pitched, and took the win. He was sent back down the next day. On June 9, De León was put on the minor league disabled list with a mild lat strain. On August 14, De León was placed on the minor league disabled list for the third time in 2017, this time with elbow tendinitis. De León was diagnosed with a torn ulnar collateral ligament on March 7, 2018. One week later, Dr. James Andrews successfully performed Tommy John surgery, ending De León's 2018 season. De León returned to game action in May 2019. He returned to the Rays active roster on August 14. =Cincinnati Reds= On November 20, 2019, the Rays traded De León to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for cash considerations or a player to be named later.

Over the years the CDC has impacted the community through its involvement in local Latino politics, community organization, housing development, scholarship funding, and job creation and training. With a revenue stream stemming from its many for-profit businesses, government grants, and private donations, TELACU has recently expanded its services to the Latino community outside of East Los Angeles, in some cases outside the state of California. Fueled by the notion of self-determination in the Chicano movement and aided by federal assistance derived from the War on Poverty, TELACU was born after the United Auto Workers union allocated manpower and funding to set up a committee, which later morphed into TELACU, in February 1968. Initially created to combat the high levels of poverty and unemployment faced by local residents, TELACU currently owns and operates several companies all of which are driven by a self-proclaimed double-bottom line that is composed of both profitability and social service. As far as social services, TELACU believes that \\"providing tools to others in the form of jobs, affordable housing, loans, new community assets and scholarships is the most effective means to empowering people to build a legacy for themselves and for their families.\\" During the course of its evolution, TELACU has developed an approach that emphasizes economic development based on the notion that this approach is a more effective means of impacting the community compared to its initial approach dedicated to community organization. In 2006 the Hispanic Business Magazine named TELACU the fifth largest Hispanic-owned business in California. Origins Upon its founding in 1968, East Los Angeles suffered from disproportionately high rates of poverty and unemployment. Men ages 16–24 had an unemployment rate of 30% and 45% of families were on some form of federal assistance. Median family income in surrounding suburbs was $13,000 while in East L.A. it was just $4,000. Along with a high school dropout rate of 51%, these problems led many to worry about social unrest in light of the fact that residents had so little economic and political power to address their issues. TELACU initially came into existence after the creation of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee (WLCAC) in 1965 prompted UAW member Glenn O’Loanne to advocate for a similar organization in East Los Angeles. Having been largely responsible for creating WLCAC, UAW heeded O’Loanne's suggestion and agreed to create another community union on the Eastside. While WLCAC was to serve poor, disadvantaged blacks in Watts, CA, TELACU was to serve poor, disadvantaged Latinos, mostly Mexican-Americans, in East Los Angeles. With the intent of bringing economic development and labor organization to the area, UAW established what was initially called The East Los Angeles Labor Community Action Committee (ELALCAC) after providing its first donation of $150. Together with activists and union members from the Eastside, the committee, led by Esteban Torres, began working on the goal of building “a community organization that could harness its own economic and social power.” Funding from the federal government started with a grant by the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), the leading agency in the War on Poverty, in 1971. Then in November 1972 the OEO officially designated the organization as a community development corporation (CDC). The presidency of Jimmy Carter marked TELACU's biggest expansion as the federal government increased assistance to CDC's to over $2 billion a year. Along with federal assistance, TELACU received donations from private contributors including the likes of the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. With a significantly expanded budget during the mid-1970s, TELACU began establishing for-profit businesses that eventually served as its main source of revenue. Vision TELACU's vision is rooted in the popular anti-colonial discourse during the mid-1960s among racial minorities, and the Chicano movement itself. East Los Angeles, being a predominantly Mexican-American community, was often seen as a hub of Mexican-American culture. Esteban Torres, TELACU's first executive director believed East L.A. was treated like an internal colony by the greater L.A political and economic structure. In the eyes of Torres and many others involved with TELACU, East L.A. was akin to a third world country, dependent on outside forces who “owned and controlled the flow of economic resources ultimately rendering the community helpless to affect the social and political institutions about them.” This situation led to the development of self-determination as a central goal via control of economic and political resources. But also rooted in this anti-colonial vision lies the idea of cultural power and assertion and a greater goal of colonial liberation. In line with ideals of cultural assertion, TELACU's headquarters contains a large mural referred to as The Pride of Our Heritage, or El Orgullo de Nuestra Herencia in Spanish, that commemorates Mexican-American history. Tamayo restaurant also contains similar artwork along with other TELACU projects have intentionally emphasized imagery in line with symbolism of cultural identity. The overall aspiration towards liberation and self-determination ultimately shaped TELACU's operations towards that of economic development. Suggesting that no one was really dealing with the underlying economic problems East L.A. faced, current executive director David Lizarraga began embarking on a quest to create what he called “an independent economy that will make the community self-sufficient. ” This shift, occurring during the mid-1970s marked TELACU's shift from community organizing, which often resulted in mixed outcomes, to the more effective method centered around economic development. With a newfound direction, president David Lizarraga created a master plan with intentions of creating a financial center to meet community needs. This plan, stemming from the colonial analogy whereby capital had consistently been taken out of the community by financial institutions, called for the creation of local financial institutions to prevent capital from escaping. The master plan consisted of four principal components: the TELACU investment company, a business development office, a bank investment strategy, and the TELACU Community Credit Corporation and Community Thrift and Loan. The overall shift towards financial and economic development eventually led executive director David Lizarraga to create the double-bottom line which it currently utilizes as its main operating philosophy. In his words, \\"we formed the \\"nonprofit organization TELACU as an umbrella for the for-profit holding companies that have the assets, income and employees, which give us economic clout.\\" In recent years TELACU has expanded its economic development to Latino communities outside of the Eastside at times expanding to communities out of state. Operations =Maravilla Housing Projects= With a grant from the Economic Development Administration (EDA), TELACU created the Barrio Housing Plan in the early 70's marking shift in overall focus towards housing development. Upon finding out that the L.A. County Housing Authority planned to reconstruct the Maravilla Public Housing Complex, TELACU initiated an effort to include participation from local residents. Through the usage of community-block and town-hall meetings, along with a gang coalition known as the Federation of Barrios Unidos which helped to prevent vandalism and graffiti, TELACU helped ensure completion of the project with community input and support. TELACU also helped increase funding for the project by getting social service agencies to participate along with usage of funds from its EDA grant. The 500 unit complex was demolished starting in early 1973 and completely rebuilt in late 1974 with a new name, Nueva Maravilla. =Industrial Park= In 1977 TELACU purchased the vacant B.F. Goodrich tire manufacturing plant, a 46-acre lot that once employed 1,500 workers before closing. A year after purchase, TELACU opened Aaron Brothers Art Mart as an anchor business and also created a furniture and aquarium company. Today the industrial park employs over 2,000 individuals. =Tamayo= Deriving its name after the Mexican modernist artist Rufino Tamayo, TELACU created Tamayo restaurant in 1988 as part of a project by TELACU Development Company that began in 1984. Aid for the restaurant came in the form of $500,000 dollars from the Office of Community Services, $1 million from itself, and $1million from another partner. The restaurant employs local residents and includes many displays of Mexican pride and culture in the form of paintings from Rufino Tamayo along with others, serving as a landmark for East Los Angeles. =Attempt at Cityhood= In 1972, director Esteban Torres established the Ad Hoc Committee to Incorporate East Los Angeles (ACTIELA) in an effort to incorporate East Los Angeles as a city. The proposal did not pass with a vote consisting of 58% against and 42% in favor. Out of the eligible voters, only 15% participated in the measure. =Headquarters= Located in 5700 Olympic boulevard directly across Tamayo restaurant, the TELACU headquarters was mostly funded by $6 million in grants from the Economic Development Administration and the Community Service Administration. Serving as a landmark, the three story building contains a 40-foot mural known as El Orgullo de Nuestra Herencia.  Controversy  In 1982 TELACU faced several charges ranging from corruption to financial mismanagement from both the United States Department of Labor, the Los Angeles Times, and other government agencies. The controversy started when in 1980 a former employee alleged that TELACU had violated the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). This led to an audit by the Department of Labor that started in 1980 and ended in November 1982. Before the audit was completed the L.A. Times published a series of articles with dozens of allegations that ultimately challenged the very existence of TELACU, referring to it incorrectly as an “anti-poverty agency”. The allegations damaged the public image of TELACU severely, when the audit finally came out TELACU was partially vindicated as most allegations were ultimately dropped. In the end only Chairman Joe Gonzalez and his wife were convicted of violating CETA. Former TELACU employee and reputable local politician Gloria Molina has accused TELACU of “violating the trust of the communi ty” through its investments outside of East Los Angeles and for benefitting personally from such investments. She also called TELACU “greedy and self-serving” arguing that “money deteriorated their goals and their achievements are no longer beneficial to the community.” Overall much of the criticism against TELACU stems from its deviation from community organizing towards economic development. Such people feel that TELACU's methods of operation leave it disconnected from the residents of East Los Angeles. More recently, TELACU has received criticism for its involvement with the Centinella Valley School Board and what critics refer to as the creation of a “bond-passing machine.” TELACU backed candidates for the Centinela Valley School Board almost always win and starting in 2008, the TELACU backed candidates have been responsible for passing bond measures that amount to almost $200 million. Critics argue that the bonds are an inefficient way to use taxpayer money and that some of the large construction projects are unnecessary.

Life According to Daniele Farlati (1690–1773), during the Cretan War (1645–69), in November 1648, Archbishop Stefanović and two of his bishops, Vasilije and Isaija, and 80 (or 800) monks entered communion with the Catholic Church, thanks to a Franciscan. This has been refuted by the research of Nikodim Milaš (1845–1915), as, firstly, history knows of no such archbishop, and secondly, the Orthodox community at that time strongly resisted Catholic propaganda, supporting the Serbian Patriarch Maksim I through the emissary monk Kiril. According to Mile Bogović, the current Catholic bishop of Gospić-Senj, after the subsequent death of Stefanović, the monks turned against the Catholic Church, thus the Uniatism of these Dalmatian Serbs failed.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida The epithet is in reference to the irregular black spots or bands on the thallus branches. Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia tigrina is classified in the subgenus Cylindricaria in which it is distinguished from related species by a much-branched thallus 2.5–5 cm in length and in width, by the narrow tubular branches, 1–2 mm wide, by the development of apothecia instead of soredia, and by having lichen substances of one or more depsidones (hypoprotocetraric acid, salazinic acid, norstictic acid, psoromic acid), in addition to terpenoid compounds that characterize the genus. The terpenoid compounds are zeorin, (-)-16-hydroxykaurane, and an unknown (T3); bourgeanic acid also probably present. In Baja California, the species often hangs in mats with species of Ramalina from branches of Fouquieria diguetii. Taxonomic History Vermilacinia tigrina was first described by Gerhard Follmann in the genus Ramalina, based on a thallus growing on the ground among cacti in the Atacama Desert at 600 m elevation on Cerro Moreno in northern Chile. He distinguished the species by its lichen substance of psoromic acid, and by its habit of growing on earth (terricolous). This was in contrast to other species of Ramalina he recognized in a “Ceruchis” Group,Follmann, G. 1966. Eine neue Ramalina-Art uas der Ceruches-Gruppe. Willdenowia 4(2): 225–233. largely defined by the presence of (-)-16-hydroxykaurane (“ceruchinol”). Included were Ramalina “homalea” (data probably combined from Niebla homalea and Vermilacinia laevigata), Ramalina “ceruchis” (= Vermilacinia ceruchis), Ramalina “combeoides” (= Vermilacinia combeoides), Ramalina “tumidula” (included under V. ceruchis), Ramalina flaccescens (= Vermilacinia flaccescens), and unpublished name Ramalina “ceruchoides”. Follmann incorporated chemical data from other studiesBendz, G., J. Santesson and C. W. Wachtmeister. 1965. Studies on the chemistry of lichens. 20. The chemistry of the Ramalina ceruchis group.

Scand. 19:1185-1187. not based on type (biology) specimens; for example, Ramalina tumidula was indicated to have methyl 3,5 dichlorolecanorate (tumidulin), which is not present in the type specimen.) Nevertheless, none of these species had psoromic acid (except for V. tigrina). This “Ceruchis” group of species was subsequently included in the genus Desmazieria in 1969, based in part on a misconception that Niebla homalea included two chemotypes, one with the divaricatic acid and another without the depside but with (-)-16-hydroxykaurane.Follmann, G.and S. Huneck. 1969. Mitteilunge uber Flechteninhaltsstoffe. LXI. Zur Chemotaxonomie der Flechtenfamilie Ramalinaceae. Willdenowia 5:181-216. as previously indicated in 1965 by Bendz, Santesson and Wachtmeister. The genus Desmazieria was previously recognized to have only one species, D. homalea.Montagne, D.M. 1852.

Cortical diversity in the Ramalinaceae. Can. J. Bot. 59: 437–453.. recognized that: “Within Niebla two major evolutionary directions have influenced the anatomy of the cortex. The compressed species have strongly palisade outer cortices overlying mechanical tissue, while the terete species have tended to lose or have depauperate formations of mechanical tissue.” Richard Spjut in 1995 further recognized significant differences in their medulla (chondroid strands vs. no chondroid strands) and in their lichen substances (zeorin and (-)-16-hydroxykaurane vs. their absence). The two evolutionary lines thus became Niebla and Vermilacinia. Niebla tigrina, consequently, was transferred to Vermilacinia tigrina.Spjut R. W. 1995. Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae, Lecanorales), a new genus of lichens. In: Flechten Follmann; Contr. Lichen in honor of Gerhard Follmann; F. J. A. Daniels, M. Schulz & J. Peine, eds., Koeltz Scientific Books: Koenigstein, pp. 337-351. Follmann had distinguished Ramalina tumidula (basionym: Usnea tumidula) from his R. tigrina (= Vermilacinia tigrina) by having hypoprotocetraric acid instead of psoromic acid; however, Spjut broadened the species concept of Vermilacinia tigrina to include not only that chemotype but also other chemotypes, salazinic acid and norstictic acid chemotypes, which occur in central and southern Baja California and in the Channel Islands, while on the northern peninsula of Baja California, this is replaced by the acid deficient V. leopardina. The type specimen of Usnea tumidula was found to have the same chemistry as the type specimen for Vermilacinia ceruchis, and its cortical characteristics compared favorably with subgenus Vermilacinia but not with subgenus Cylindricaria. Vermilacinia tigrina was not mentioned in the Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert.Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. Niebla. ‘Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2’: 368–380.

Such reductions provide information about the hardness of approximating solutions to optimization problems. In short, a gap problem refers to one wherein the objective is to distinguish between cases where the best solution is above one threshold from cases where the best solution is below another threshold, such that the two thresholds have a gap in between. Gap reductions can be used to demonstrate inapproximability results, as if a problem may be approximated to a better factor than the size of gap, then the approximation algorithm can be used to solve the corresponding gap problem. c-gap problem We define a c-gap problem as follows: given an optimization (maximization or minimization) problem P, the equivalent c-gap problem distinguishes between two cases, for an input k and an instance x of problem P: : OPT_P(x) \\\\le k. Here, the best solution to instance x of problem P has a cost, or score, below k. : OPT_P(x) > c\\\\cdot k. Here, the best solution to instance x of problem P has a cost above c⋅k. The gap between the two thresholds is thus c. Note that whenever OPT falls between the thresholds, there is no requirement on what the output should be. A valid algorithm for the c-gap problem may answer anything if OPT is in the middle of the gap. The value c does not need to be constant; it can depend on the size of the instance of P. Note that c-approximating the solution to an instance of P is at least as hard as solving the c-gap version of P. One can define an (a,b)-gap problem similarly. The difference is that the thresholds do not depend on the input; instead, the lower threshold is a and the upper threshold is b. Gap-producing reduction A gap-producing reduction is a reduction from an optimization problem to a c-gap problem, so that solving the c-gap problem quickly would enable solving the optimization problem quickly. The term gap-producing arises from the nature of the reduction: the optimal solution in the optimization problem maps to the opposite side of the gap from every other solution via reduction. Thus, a gap is produced between the optimal solution and every other solution. A simple example of a gap-producing reduction is the nonmetric Traveling Salesman problem (i.e. where the graph's edge costs need not satisfy the conditions of a metric). We can reduce from the Hamiltonian path problem on a given graph G = (V, E) to this problem as follows: we construct a complete graph G' = (V, E'), for the traveling salesman problem. For each edge e ∈ G', we let the cost of traversing it be 1 if e is in the original graph G and ∞ otherwise. A Hamiltonian path in the original graph G exists if and only if there exists a traveling salesman solution with weight (V-1). However, if no such Hamiltonian path exists, then the best traveling salesman tour must have weight at least V. Thus, Hamiltonian Path reduces to V/(V-1)-gap nonmetric traveling salesman. Gap-preserving reduction A gap-preserving reduction is a reduction from a c-gap problem to a c'-gap problem. More specifically, we are given an instance x of a problem A with x = n and want to reduce it to an instance x' of a problem B with x' = n'. A gap-preserving reduction from A to B is a set of functions (k(n), k'(n'), c(n), c'(n')) such that For minimization problems: : OPTA(x) ≤ k ⇒ OPTB(x') ≤ k', and : OPTA(x) ≥ c⋅k ⇒ OPTB(x') ≥ c'⋅k' For maximization problems: : OPTA(x) ≥ k ⇒ OPTB(x') ≥ k', and : OPTA(x) ≤ k/c ⇒ OPTB(x') ≤ k'/c' If c' > c, then this is a gap- amplifying reduction. Examples =Max E3SAT= This problem is a form of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), where each clause contains three distinct literals and we want to maximize the number of clauses satisfied. Håstad showed that the (1/2+ε, 1-ε)-gap version of a similar problem, MAX E3-X(N)OR-SAT, is NP-hard. The MAX E3-X(N)OR-SAT problem is a form of SAT where each clause is the XOR of three distinct literals, exactly one of which is negated. We can reduce from MAX E3-X(N)OR-SAT to MAX E3SAT as follows: : A clause xi ⊕ xj ⊕ xk = 1 is converted to (xi ∨ xj ∨ xk) ∧ (¬xi ∨ ¬xj ∨ xk) ∧ (¬xi ∨ xj ∨ ¬xk) ∧ (xi ∨ ¬xj ∨ ¬xk) : A clause xi ⊕ xj ⊕ xk = 0 is converted to (¬xi ∨ ¬xj ∨ ¬xk) ∧ (¬xi ∨ xj ∨ xk) ∧ (xi ∨ ¬xj ∨ xk) ∧ (xi ∨ xj ∨ ¬xk) If a clause is not satisfied in the original instance of MAX E3-X(N)OR-SAT, then at most three of the four corresponding clauses in our MAX E3SAT instance can be satisfied. Using a gap argument, it follows that a YES instance of the problem has at least a (1-ε) fraction of the clauses satisfied, while a NO instance of the problem has at most a (1/2+ε)(1) + (1/2-ε)(3/4) = (7/8 + ε/4)-fraction of the clauses satisfied. Thus, it follows that (7/8 + ε, 1 - ε)-gap MAX E3SAT is NP-hard. Note that this bound is tight, as a random assignment of variables gives an expected 7/8 fraction of satisfied clauses. =Label Cover= The label cover problem is defined as follows: given a bipartite graph G = (A∪B, E), with : A = A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... ∪ Ak, A = n, and Ai = n/k : B = B1 ∪ B2 ∪ ... ∪ Bk, B = n, and Bi = n/k We define a \\"superedge\\" between Ai and Bj if at least one edge exists from Ai to Bj in G, and define the superedge to be covered if at least one edge from Ai to Bj is covered. In the max-rep version of the problem, we are allowed to choose one vertex from each Ai and each Bi, and we aim to maximize the number of covered superedges. In the min-rep version, we are required to cover every superedge in the graph, and want to minimize the number of vertices we choose. Manurangsi and Moshkovitz show that the (O(n1/4), 1)-gap version of both problems is solvable in polynomial time.

Sumatra  Formation  The Women's Vocal Orchestra came into being because of the collaborative efforts of Margaret Dryburgh and Norah Chambers. Chambers served as primary conductor for the Vocal Orchestra.Betty Jeffrey, White Coolies. (Sydney: Angus and Robertson, 1954), 86. Prior to life in the camp, Chambers attended school at the Royal Academy of Music in London. At the school, she played in the orchestra and learned many of the skills which enabled her to arrange the pieces of music for 4-part women's chorus.Helen Colijn, Song of Survival: Women Interred. (Ashland, OR: White Cloud Press, 1995), 134. She is also credited with the idea for performing and learning pieces originally scored for piano and orchestra.Helen Colijn, Song of Survival: Women Interred, (Ashland, OR: White Cloud Press, (1995), 144. While Chambers acted as arranger and conductor, Margaret Dryburgh, a missionary POW, would write down the piano and orchestral scores from memory.Andy Priestner, \\"The History of the Vocal Orchestra\\", www.singingtosurvive.com, accessed November 2014. It is not inherently clear where Dryburgh obtained the ability to recall large works from memory. She studied piano as a small child and received a Bachelor of Arts at Newcastle College, then a part of Durham University. She also spent a great deal of time teaching music to small churches during the course of her missionary work.Helen Colijn, Song of Survival: Women Interred, (Ashland, OR: White Cloud Press, (1995), 199. After Dryburgh penned the entire work(s), Chambers and Dryburgh focused on condensing the scores into 4-part harmony. They divided the group into four separate sections (1,2,3,4 as opposed to the typical ssaa formation). Each group would meet sometime during the day to practice separately and then at night Chambers and Dryburgh would lead the entire group in the Dutch kitchen.Betty Jeffrey, White Coolies, (Sydney: Angus and Robertson, 1954), 86. However, a singer or two would be missing from rehearsal because of illness.Helen Colijn, Song of Survival: Women Interred, (Ashland, OR: White Cloud Press, (1995), 146.  Music  = Compositional style = Dryburgh and Chambers did not attempt to imitate instruments but instead used humming for sounds and consonants to obtain a sense of rhythm.Andy Priestner, \\"The History of the Vocal Orchestra\\", www.singingtosurvive.com, accessed November 2014. In other words, the voices had to “feel like certain instruments” or they might be asked to “acquire instrumental agility, articulating phrases that are idiomatic to strings or winds.”Patricia F. Hennings, \\"'Song of Survival': Performing Instrumental Music Vocally,\\" The Choral Journal 27 (1987): 28. However, Chambers and Dryburgh did not write down many of the syllables used while they were in Sumatra prison camp. The syllables are now known thanks in large part to later interviews with Norah Chambers. The syllables varied to express mood and to change the quality of the voices. For instance, in the introduction of Dvorak's “Largo”, the syllable “nuh” was used to create an ethereal breathless quality. This shifted to “leh” at the entrance of the main theme in order to add focus to the voices. It again changes to “neh” in order to add intensity during the middle section.Patricia F. Hennings, \\"'Song of Survival': Performing Instrumental Music Vocally,\\" The Choral Journal 27 (1987): 27. In addition to the impact of the 30 vocal scores, the Women's Vocal Orchestra of Sumatra has come to be affiliated with Dryburgh's \\"The Captives' Hymn\\". The piece came to be performed at Sunday church services at the camp.K. Marie Stolba, Professor of Music, Emerita, at Indiana University-Purdue University, after studying piece phrase by phrase and believes it to fragments of hymn melodies Dryburgh knew.Helen Colijn, Song of Survival: Women Interred, (Ashland, OR: White Cloud Press, (1995), 200.

The Ending of The Vocal Orchestra  The Women's Vocal Orchestra continued as long as there existed enough women to sing.

Chambers died in June 1989.Andy Priestner, \\"The History of the Vocal Orchestra\\", www.singingtosurvive.com, accessed November 2014. = Impact = The Women's Vocal Orchestra of Sumatra has inspired two major motion pictures: Paradise Road (1997 film) and Song of Survival (1985). The latter of which was a documentary. While these films were well-received, they do contain some historical inaccuracies. Some historians argue that some errors emerge from the desire to avoid the issues of race. Additionally, presenting the effects gender played in the prison camps seemed difficult in a politically correct mindset.Christian Twomey, \\"Problems in Paradise: Gender, Race, and Historical 'Truth' in Paradise Road\\", Journal of Interdisciplinary Gender Studies 10 (January 2006): 30-52. However, other historians argue that in the films focusing on the Women's Vocal Orchestra problems arise because of theme. Historian Hank Nelson asserts that filming the death by machine gun fire which immediately followed some of the women's capture, would be impossible to set the tone the filmmakers desired.Hank Nelson. \\"A Map to Paradise Road: A Guide for Historians.\\" Journal of the Australian War Memorial. Canberra, Australia: Australia War Memorial. The music has been performed by numerous choirs across the world. Most recently, in October 2013 a 70th anniversary concert was performed by a British choir. The concert also featured accounts of the lives of Norah Chambers and Margaret Dryburgh.

She soon switched to writing feature films and is best known for her work on the films Don't Change Your Husband and Why Change Your Wife?. Cowan worked closely with director Cecil B. DeMille throughout her career. Early life Sada Louise Cowan was born on September 8, 1882 in Boston, Massachusetts. She attended a private boarding school in the Boston area. However, as a teenager Cowan moved to Germany to study music. After finding that writing music was not fulfilling enough for her she switched to writing plays. In Frankfurt, Germany she wrote her first hit play from start to finish in two hours titled, Sintram of Skagerrak. Cowan's inspiration for writing this play was hearing Frederick Lamond’s piano recital of Chopin. She started to write plays that got her name on the map. These were titled The State Forbids, In the Morgue, Playing the Game, The Moonlit Way, The Wonder of the Age, The Honor of America and Pomp, respectively. Silent film After success writing plays, Cowan switched over to writing full length silent films. In 1919, at thirty-six years old, her first film, The Woman Under Cover, starring Fritzi Brunette, was completed. The film was described by the Exhibitors Herald as heavily dramatic but with frequent and smartly placed bits of humor dispersed within it. This successful film led to Cowan’s writing of numerous others, in which she worked with directors such as Harry Garson and Cecil B. DeMille. Some of Cowan’s most popular films include The Reckless Lady and The Charmer. Why Change Your Wife? Why Change Your Wife?, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, was one of Cowan’s most successful films. This film blazed a trail of “light and merry” films to follow it and included the wealth, clothing, and romance for which the 1920s are remembered. The film starred Gloria Swanson and Bebe Daniels and depicted the story of a man's marriage trials and tribulations between his first and second wives. The film cost $130,000 to produce and made $1,000,000. This was Cowan's first film that she wrote under director Cecil B. DeMille. At the time she was making only $25 a week, which was eventually raised to $60 per week. At first, DeMille dismissed her as a “failed writer” and believed her to be not capable of success. However, after the success of this film, and the many others she worked on with DeMille, she became one of his top writers and highest-paid staff members. Themes in film and Impact on the Industry The majority of Cowan's films revolve around the themes of marriage, divorce, love and infidelity. Cowan was a pioneer for women's writers in film. She was joined in her time by two other prominent women writers in the industry, Frances Marion and June Mathis. Cowan was one of the first American writers to travel abroad to Europe and work with foreign directors. She has written and received writing credit on numerous famous films from the 1920s and '30s.

Charles François Gand (1787–1845) was one of the foremost violin makers/ luthier and dealers of his time. Known as Gand Père, Charles François Gand was the son and pupil of Charles Michel Gand, a violin maker who was living in Mirecourt around 1750, before coming to Versailles in 1780. Charles Francois first worked with Nicolas Lupot from 1802 to 1810, then joined his father's workshop (some of the instruments from this period are labeled as made between 1807 and 1816). At the death of his father in 1820, Charles François Gand took over the workshop of Jean Gabriel Koliker at 24 rue Croix-des-Petits-Champs in Paris. He married Nicolas Lupot's adopted daughter and succeeded LUPOT in 1824. Charles François Gand is considered as one of the important French violin makers. His instruments are typical of the French school of this period and the finest examples are very much influenced by LUPOT. They are bold and powerful, coated with a rich red-brown or orange- brown varnish on a golden/yellow ground. His collaborators in the shop included: Auguste Sebastien Bernardel, Georges Chanot (1821), Joseph Louis Germain (1840–1845) and Pierre Silvestre (1824–1829) At Charles François GAND's death in 1845, his son and pupil, Charles Adolphe GAND, succeeded him. Appointed luthier to the Royal Court of France and Paris Conservatoire. He completed a set of instruments begun by Lupot for the Royal Orchestra, but much to its demise it was destroyed in a fire at the Tuileries in 1871. Charles Francois Gand is ranked as a serious rival to both Nicolas Lupot and Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume as a luthier. His work is superb and mainly on the Stradivari models.

He has been president of the State Electoral Institute of Baja California, comptroller general of the government of Mexico City, citizen advisor for the Federal Electoral Institute and congressmen for the National Action Party (PAN) in the LXI Legislature of the Mexican Congress. In 2016, he was the first independent candidate to run for mayor of Tijuana. Life Luken Garza was born in Monterrey in 1959 to businessman Gaston Luken Aguilar and his wife Alejandra Garza. He grew up in Baja California, where he currently lives in Tijuana with his wife Alicia Luna Alvarado. He has three children Analicia, Gaston and Alvaro. Luken has a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (1981) and has postgraduate studies in upper management in Ipade (1985). He is fluent in English and Spanish. Political career Luken worked as a citizen advisor to election institutes at the state and federal levels from 1995 to 2003. This included positions as president of the Electoral Institute of Baja California for the 1995 elections and as board member of the Federal Electoral Institute from 2001 to 2003. From 2000 to 2003, he was special advisor to the government of Mexico City, overseeing the city budget and anticorruption efforts regarding public servants. Luken was also an advisor to the Mexican-American Studies Center of the UC San Diego and to Pronatura in Baja California. In 2009, Luken was elected as a federal deputy with the National Action Party, representing the fifth district in Tijuana. He presided over a congressional commission for accountability and was vice chairman of the Governing Congressional Commission. In 2014, Mexico changed the law which allowed for more independent candidates. He was the first independent to announce a run for mayor of Tijuana in 2015. In 2016, he was the first independent to get enough signatures to be on the ballot for the same position. He was able to get 32,263 validated signatures, enough to meet the 2.5% of eligible voters, one of only six independent candidates to be able to do so in the entire state. Luken sought to take advantage of widespread voter mistrust of the established political parties. This campaign compared their efforts to Obama's presidential runs, calling it the first grassroots campaign in Tijuana. They even made their own versions of Obama's Hope posters. Emulating the highly popular independent governor of Chihuahua, he used curse words and colloquialisms in his campaign. However, he was criticized as taking advantage of the new system and not really an independent because of his connections to the National Action Party, which Luken stated during his run that he was never officially affiliated with. In 2013, he registered with the National Action Party. Business career Son of a prominent businessman, Luken's first foray into business was the establishment of the bakery chain La Baguette de Mexicali, when he was 23 years old. He served as the company's general director from 1982 to 1997. He has since founded and advised various types of businesses in the construction, industrial and finance sectors. He ran Proxima with his father before 2009 which partnered with Sempra Energy in San Diego to bring natural gas into Mexicali in the 2000s. Luken was general director of Dunor (1985-2000) and Panatec (1985-2009). Luken was named Businessman of the Year by various publications and organizations as well as Man of the Year by Semanario ZETA.

The Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program is a report compiled by the bipartisan United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) about the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)'s Detention and Interrogation Program and its use of torture during interrogation in U.S. government communiqués on detainees in CIA custody. The report covers CIA activities before, during, and after the \\"War on Terror\\". The initial report was approved on December 13, 2012, by a vote of 9–6, with seven Democrats, one Independent, and one Republican voting in favor of the report and six Republicans voting in opposition. The more-than 6,700-page report (including 38,000 footnotes) details the history of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program and the Committee's 20 findings and conclusions. On December 9, 2014, the SSCI released a 525-page portion that consisted of key findings and an executive summary of the full report. It took five years and the CIA spent $40 million in connection with the Senate investigation. The full unredacted report remains classified. The report details actions by CIA officials, including torturing prisoners, providing misleading or false information about classified CIA programs to the President, Department of Justice, Congress, and the media, impeding government oversight and internal criticism, and mismanaging the program. It also revealed the existence of previously unknown detainees, that more detainees were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques than was previously disclosed, and that more techniques were used without Department of Justice approval. It concluded that the use of enhanced interrogation techniques did not yield unique intelligence that saved lives (as the CIA claimed), nor was it useful in gaining cooperation from detainees, and that the program damaged the United States' international standing. Some people, including some CIA officials and U.S. Republicans, disputed the report's conclusions and said it provided an incomplete picture of the program. Others criticized the publishing of the report, citing its potential for damage to the U.S. and the contentious history of its development. Former Republican presidential nominee John McCain praised the release of the report. Upon the report’s release, then-President Barack Obama stated, \\"One of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better.\\" In the wake of the release of the report's Executive Summary, a large number of individuals and organizations called for the prosecution of the CIA and government officials who perpetrated, approved, or provided legal cover for the torture of detainees; however, prosecutions are considered unlikely. The U.S. has also passed legislation, sponsored by Senators McCain and Dianne Feinstein, to prevent U.S. agencies from using many of the torture techniques described in the report. The film The Report covers the decade-long time period that led to the final creation and publication of the report and was released in the United States on November 15, 2019.  History  = Impetus for the report = Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) was the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 2009 to early 2015 California Senator Dianne Feinstein said that the initial investigation began after press reports emerged stating that in 2005, CIA Director of the National Clandestine Service Jose Rodriguez destroyed almost 100 video recordings of interrogations over objections from CIA and White House legal staff. The tapes showed CIA officers and contractors using torture techniques such as waterboarding on detainees Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. The CIA did not inform the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) that Rodriguez had destroyed the tapes, and the committee had not known they had existed. SSCI believed that Rodriguez was covering up illegal activities by the CIA, although the committee had initially been told by CIA officials that Rodriguez was not engaging in \\"destruction of evidence\\". Rodriguez preemptively criticized the report in an op-ed for The Washington Post on December 5, 2014. In addition to destroying the torture tapes, the Committee's report shows that Rodriguez was heavily involved in the CIA's use of torture, including overseeing black sites where torture took place, preventing CIA Counterterrorism Center (CTC) legal staff from implementing vetting processes for interrogators, provided misleading information to the Department of Defense about a detainee's identity, and participated in the payment of millions of dollars to a country hosting a black site. CIA Director Michael Hayden told the Committee on December 11, 2007, that if the Committee had asked for the videos, the CIA would have provided them, and offered the Committee written summaries of the interrogation sessions depicted on the destroyed tapes. CIA records show that the decision to destroy the tapes came shortly after CIA attorneys raised concerns about Congress discovering the tapes' existence. Jane Mayer's book The Dark Side stated that the CIA also neglected to inform the 9/11 Commission that these tapes existed: \\"In a meeting on December 23, 2003, [Commission executive director Philip D.] Zelikow demanded that the CIA at the very least provide any and all documents responsive to its requests, even if the Commission had not specifically asked for them. [CIA Director George] Tenet replied by alluding to several documents he thought would be helpful. But in an omission that would later become part of a criminal investigation, neither Tenet nor anyone else from the CIA in the meeting mentioned that, in fact, the Agency had in its possession at that point hundreds of hours of videotapes of the interrogations of Abu Zubayda and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, both of whom were waterboarded.\\" In December 2007, the committee opened an investigation into the tape destruction and designated four staffers to conduct the investigation, which they completed around early 2009. = Development of the report = On February 11, 2009, the committee began considering a broader review of the CIA's detention and interrogation practices after committee staff presented a summary of the operational cables detailing the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. On March 5, 2009, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 14–1 to open an investigation into the CIA detention and interrogation program. In August 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder announced a parallel preliminary criminal investigation into the use of unauthorized interrogation techniques by CIA officials. As a result of the Attorney General's investigation, the Republican minority on the SSCI concluded that many witnesses were unlikely to participate in the investigation for fear of criminal liability. Citing the Attorney General investigation as their reason, the Republican minority of the SSCI withdrew their participation from the investigation in September 2009. The Senate investigation was led by Committee staffer and former FBI investigator Daniel J. Jones, and was prepared following a review of more than 6.3 million pages of documents, cables, emails, and other materials principally provided by the CIA. The document production phase lasted more than three years and was completed in July 2012. As described in the Senate report, an additional 9,400 classified documents repeatedly requested by the SSCI were withheld by the White House under a claim of executive privilege. Despite the initial expectation that interviews would be used, no formal interviews or hearings were conducted in the preparation of the report. The lack of interviews and hearings was one of the chief complaints of the Republican minority on SSCI. However, the report included CIA officials' on- the-record statements in classified committee hearings, written statements, and interviews conducted through the CIA Inspector General's office and the Agency's oral history program, as well as through the formal response to the committee in June 2013 after reading the report. These statements and interviews included those from CIA director George Tenet, CTC director Jose Rodriguez, CIA general counsel Scott Muller, CIA deputy director of operations James Pavitt, CIA acting general counsel John Rizzo, CIA deputy director John McLaughlin, and a variety of interrogators, lawyers, medical personnel, senior counterterrorism analysts and managers of the detention and interrogation program. The CIA estimated that approximately $40 million in personnel time and resources was spent assisting the investigation, but this was largely because of the CIA's insistence on hiring Centra Technology contractors to review documents prior to presenting them to the Committee and establishing a separate secure facility and computer network for CIA and Committee staff to use during the review. This deviated from the standard document-sharing process, in which the CIA provides documents for Committee staff to review in Committee offices. The final report was approved on December 13, 2012, by a vote of 9–6, with eight Democrats and one Republican (Olympia Snowe) voting in favor of publication and six Republicans voting in opposition, and the published minority views of Senator Chambliss were joined by Senators Burr, Risch, Coats, Rubio, and Coburn. Republican Senator John McCain, a member of the Committee ex officio, did not have a vote, but he supported approval alongside Snowe. On April 3, 2014, the SSCI voted 11–3 to submit a revised version of the executive summary, findings, and recommendations of the report for declassification analysis in preparation for future public release. Independent Senator Angus King and Republican Senator Susan Collins supported the release of the report. After eight months, involving contentious negotiations about what details should remain classified, the revised executive summary, findings, and recommendations were made public with many redactions on December 9, 2014. The CIA had demanded that the Committee redact the names of all detainees, all CIA officer's pseudonyms, and the names of all countries that hosted black sites. Committee staffer Daniel J. Jones told The Guardian that the Agency wanted to redact other material, such as references to Allah. The CIA conceded that pseudonyms could be used for contractors and interrogators James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, despite the fact that they had both been identified publicly prior to the report's release. The report ended up including detainee names, and used pseudonyms (such as \\"CIA OFFICER 1\\") for several Agency officers, but redacted the names of almost all others, as well as black site host countries. Information about the cooperation of foreign agencies with the CIA has been redacted from the report. The British chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee stated they would request access to anything taken out of the report at the request of British agencies.  Panetta Review and CIA Hacking incident  On December 17, 2013, Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO) revealed the existence of a secret internal review (the \\"Panetta Review\\") conducted by the CIA that was consistent with the Senate's report but conflicted with the CIA's official response to the report. In January 2014, CIA officials claimed that the Intelligence Committee had accessed portions of the \\"Panetta Review\\" and removed them from CIA facilities in 2010 without CIA authorization. In March 2014, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, confirmed that a portion of the \\"Panetta Review\\" had been copied and transferred to a safe in the Senate's Hart Office Building. She stated that the action was necessary to protect the documents from the CIA, which had destroyed videotapes depicting brutal interrogation methods in 2005. Additionally, during the review process, the CIA had removed hundreds of pages of documents from the Committee staff's CIA-provided computer network (called \\"RDINet\\" for \\"rendition, detention, and interrogation\\") without informing Committee staff. According to Senator Feinstein, when Committee staff inquired about the missing documents, CIA staff initially denied the files had been removed, then blamed IT contractors, and finally falsely claimed that the White House had requested their removal. When negotiating the review process, the Committee and the CIA came to an agreement that the CIA would establish \\"a walled-off network share-drive\\" accessible only to Committee staff, and that \\"CIA access to the walled off network shared drive will be limited to CIA information technology staff, except as authorized by the committee or its staff.\\" During an \\"extraordinary\\" 45-minute speech on March 11, 2014, Feinstein said the CIA unlawfully searched the Intelligence Committee's computers to determine how the committee staff obtained the \\"Panetta Review\\" documents. Feinstein also said that the CIA's acting general counsel, later identified as Robert Eatinger, requested the FBI conduct a criminal inquiry into the committee staff who had accessed and relocated the \\"Panetta Review\\" documents. She said she believed that the request was \\"a potential effort to intimidate [Intelligence Committee] staff.\\" Eatinger had been involved in the destruction of video tapes in 2005 (which started the Senate investigation), and Feinstein added that Eatinger was mentioned by name over 1,600 times in the Committee's full report. The same day that Feinstein made the allegations, CIA director John O. Brennan denied that the CIA searched the Senate computers, stating, \\"As far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean we wouldn't do that. I mean that's just beyond the – you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do... When the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong.\\" However, on July 31, 2014, the CIA's Inspector General confirmed that the CIA had improperly gained access to and searched the Senate Intelligence Committee's computer network, including that CIA employees accessed the Committee's computers, read Committee staff's email, and sent a criminal referral to the Department of Justice based on false information. A Justice Department spokesman later announced that they would not be pursuing charges in the hacking incident. An internal review panel appointed by Brennan contended that the searches \\"were lawful and in some cases done at the behest of John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director.\\"  Findings  = Findings listed in the report = The more-than 6,700-page report produced 20 key findings. They are, verbatim from the unclassified Executive Summary report: # The CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees. # The CIA's justification for the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques rested on inaccurate claims of their effectiveness. # The interrogations of CIA detainees were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others. # The conditions of confinement for CIA detainees were harsher than the CIA had represented to policymakers and others. # The CIA repeatedly provided inaccurate information to the Department of Justice (DOJ), impeding a proper legal analysis of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. # The CIA has actively avoided or impeded congressional oversight of the program. # The CIA impeded effective White House oversight and decision-making. # The CIA's operation and management of the program complicated, and in some cases impeded, the national security missions of other Executive Branch agencies. # The CIA impeded oversight by the CIA's Office of Inspector General. # The CIA coordinated the release of classified information to the media, including inaccurate information concerning the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. # The CIA was unprepared as it began operating its Detention and Interrogation Program more than six months after being granted detention authorities. # The CIA's management and operation of its Detention and Interrogation Program was deeply flawed throughout the program's duration, particularly so in 2002 and early 2003. # Two contract psychologists devised the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and played a central role in the operation, assessments, and management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. By 2005, the CIA had overwhelmingly outsourced operations related to the program. # CIA detainees were subjected to coercive interrogation techniques that had not been approved by the Department of Justice or had not been authorized by CIA Headquarters. # The CIA did not conduct a comprehensive or accurate accounting of the number of individuals it detained, and held individuals who did not meet the legal standard for detention. The CIA's claims about the number of detainees held and subjected to its enhanced interrogation techniques were inaccurate. # The CIA failed to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of its enhanced interrogation techniques. # The CIA rarely reprimanded or held personnel accountable for serious or significant violations, inappropriate activities, and systematic and individual management failures. # The CIA marginalized and ignored numerous internal critiques, criticisms, and objections concerning the operation and management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. # The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program was inherently unsustainable and had effectively ended by 2006 due to unauthorized press disclosures, reduced cooperation from other nations, and legal and oversight concerns. # The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program damaged the United States' standing in the world, and resulted in other significant monetary and non-monetary costs. = Findings as reported by media outlets =  Examples of torture and abuse of prisoners  *The CIA had force-fed some prisoners orally and/or anally in order to establish \\"total control over the detainee.\\" The report notes that CIA documents indicate \\"Chief of Interrogations [redacted] also ordered the rectal rehydration of KSM without a determination of medical need, a procedure that the chief of interrogations would later characterize as illustrative of the interrogator’s 'total control over the detainee.'\\" * The Committee found that \\"[a]t least five CIA detainees were subjected to 'rectal rehydration' or rectal feeding without documented medical necessity.\\" These detainees are listed as Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Shaykh Mohammad, Majid Khan, and Marwan al- Jabbur. * At least one prisoner was \\"diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure and symptomatic rectal prolapse,\\" symptoms normally associated with a violent rape. The report identified this detainee as Mustafa al- Hawsawi. * CIA officials, including general counsel Scott Miller and deputy director of operations James Pavitt, were told that rectal exams of at least two prisoners had been conducted with \\"excessive force.\\" A CIA attorney was asked to follow up on these incidents, but the report states that \\"CIA records do not indicate any resolution of the inquiry.\\" * CIA interrogators threatened to rape and murder children and/or family members of prisoners. For example, according to the CIA's Inspector General, a CIA interrogator told Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri that if he did not provide information, \\"We could get your mother in here,\\" and \\"We can bring your family in here.\\" The interrogator also led al-Nashiri to believe that he was being held in a Middle Eastern country whose interrogators sexually abused female family members in front of detainees. * In November 2002 the CIA killed Gul Rahman during interrogation by hypothermia. The detainee, Gul Rahman, was tortured by CIA officers and contractors, and left wearing only a sweatshirt, chained to a wall in a seating position on a cold floor. No CIA employees were disciplined as a result of his death, and the CIA officer who managed the black site where Rahman died, who was not a trained interrogator and had a history of behavioral issues, was recommended for a cash award of $2,500 for \\"consistently superior work\\" and continued to interrogate detainees. * At least four prisoners with injuries to their legs (two with broken feet, one with a sprained ankle and one with an amputated leg) were forced to stand on their injuries. Interrogators subjected these detainees to extended periods of standing sleep deprivation without prior headquarters approval. * Interrogators told prisoners that they would be killed. For example: one prisoner, Abu Zubaydah, was told \\"We can never let the world know what I have done to you\\", another was told that the only way he would be allowed to leave the prison would be in a coffin-shaped confinement box. * One CIA interrogator who was subsequently sent home early threatened prisoner Abd al-Rahim al- Nashiri with a gun and power drill, racking a handgun and revving the drill next to al-Nashiri's hooded head. The interrogator had not sought Headquarters approval for these unauthorized actions. * At least two prisoners were victims of \\"mock executions.\\" According to the CIA's Inspector General, the same debriefer who used the gun and drill on al-Nashiri claimed that he had witnessed other CIA interrogators stage an execution to scare a detainee, and several other CIA officers also said that they had witnessed or participated in mock executions. * Several prisoners almost died and became completely unresponsive or nearly drowned during waterboarding. Multiple CIA communications described CIA interrogators waterboarding Abu Zubaydah and in one session, Zubaydah \\"becoming completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.\\" He remained unresponsive until given medical attention, when he regained consciousness and expelled \\"copious amounts of liquid.\\" * Abu Zubaydah's eye was so badly damaged during his time in prison that it was surgically removed. * The CIA kept some prisoners awake for over one week (180 hours), as well as shorter extended periods of time. This included the use of sitting or standing stress positions that prevented sleep. Sleep deprivation caused at least five to experience \\"disturbing\\" hallucinations. The CIA claimed in its 2013 response that when detainees experienced hallucinations during sleep deprivation, medical staff intervened and allowed the detainee to sleep. However, CIA records indicate that this was not always true. * After more than a month of torture, including loud music, dietary and temperature manipulation, sleep and sensory deprivation, and shackling, prisoner Ridha al-Najjar was psychologically traumatized to the point of being described as \\"a broken man.\\" * Prisoners were forced to use buckets for toilets. As punishment, interrogators could remove the waste bucket from a prisoner's cell. In one case, CIA interrogators told a detainee that he could earn a bucket by cooperating, and those undergoing standing sleep deprivation were routinely put in diapers. This contradicts CIA Director Michael Hayden's assertion that \\"Detainees have never been denied the means – at a minimum, they've always had a bucket – to dispose of their human waste.\\" * On visiting one of the CIA black sites, CIA records indicate that Federal Bureau of Prisons representatives stated \\"they [had] never been in a facility where individuals were so sensory deprived i.e., constant white noise, no talking, everyone in the dark, with the guards wearing a light on their head when they collected and escorted a detainee to an interrogation cell, detainees constantly being shackled to the wall or floor, and the starkness of each cell (concrete and bars). There is nothing like this in the Federal Bureau of Prisons. They then explained that they understood the mission and it was their collective assessment that in spite of all this sensory deprivation, the detainees were not being treated in humanely [sic].\\" This evaluation was of the same black site where Gul Rahman died after CIA interrogators beat him and left him shackled half nude on a cold floor. * Janat Gul was tortured for months based on false accusations made by an informant known as Asset Y. According to CIA documents, senior CIA officers had expressed doubt about the source's credibility and Gul denied having information about imminent threats to the United States, but interrogators proceeded to subject Gul to numerous torture techniques. Even after CIA staff at the site stated that they believed Gul was not withholding information, CIA Headquarters ordered continued use of torture tactics. Gul never provided the information the CIA thought he possessed, and Asset Y admitted to fabricating the accusations against him. * CIA interrogators forced detainee Abu Zubaydah into a box the size of a coffin for a total of 266 hours (over 11 days) and also forced him to stay for 29 hours in a box measuring wide, deep and high. Interrogators told him that the only way he was leaving the facility was in a coffin-shaped box. * CIA interrogators used unauthorized forms of torture, or used authorized techniques for more time or in more extreme ways than were approved, and usually faced no disciplinary action. These unauthorized techniques included forcing detainee Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri to stand with his hands shackled over his head for 2 1/2 days, racking a handgun next to his head and operating a power drill near his body. Other unauthorized techniques and divergence from authorized applications of techniques included improvised stress positions, longer sleep deprivation than approved, punitive water dousing and nudity, temperature, dietary manipulation, application of the waterboard that differed from the approved methods. CIA interrogators also subjected multiple detainees to unauthorized torture techniques that Headquarters later retroactively approved. * CIA interrogators subjected one detainee, Abu Hudhaifa, to \\"ice water baths\\" and 66 hours of standing sleep deprivation, as well as forced nudity and dietary manipulation. He was later released as the CIA had mistaken his identity. According to CIA records, Hudhaifa was one of dozens of individuals whom the CIA detained who were cases of mistaken identity or otherwise did not meet the requirements for detention. *Torture of prisoners led to serious mental harm (e.g. dementia, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm [including suicide]) *Of the 119 known detainees, at least 39 were tortured by the CIA. The report notes that this is likely a conservative estimate. The CIA also used torture on several detainees before evaluating whether they would be willing to cooperate, despite later CIA claims to the Committee that detainees were always provided the opportunity to cooperate before enhanced interrogation techniques. In 2003, CIA interrogators subjected at least six detainees to shackled nudity, sleep deprivation, or other torture techniques before any questioning took place.  Misleading information provided by the CIA  * The CIA's directors (George Tenet, Porter Goss and Michael Hayden) provided inaccurate and misleading information to members of the U.S. Congress, the White House and the Director of National Intelligence about the program's effectiveness and the number of prisoners that the CIA held. For example, on December 23, 2005, Goss wrote, inaccurately, to National Security advisor Stephen Hadley, Homeland Security advisor Frances Townsend, and Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte that the CIA's interrogation program thwarting an attack on Heathrow Airport \\"has allowed the U.S. to save hundreds, if not thousands, of lives,\\" and that \\"only 29 [detainees] have undergone interrogation that used one or more of the 13 enhanced interrogation techniques.\\" * The CIA provided inaccurate information regarding the interrogation program to members of the media, including journalists Douglas Jehl of the New York Times and Ronald Kessler, as well as Dateline NBC. This information misrepresented the interrogation program's effectiveness and the sources of specific intelligence. * The CIA provided inaccurate information in official documents to government officials about the value of information extracted from prisoners subjected to torture (e.g. stating that information extracted from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed during torture had allowed for the capture of Riduan Isamuddin, aka Hambali). CIA communications and records revealed that the information that led to Hambali's capture came from signals intelligence, a CIA source, and Thai authorities' investigations, not the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. * Despite contrary statements made by the CIA's Director, Michael V. Hayden, that \\"all those involved in the questioning of detainees are carefully chosen and screened for demonstrated professional judgment and maturity,\\" the CIA did employ individuals as interrogators who \\"had engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had workplace anger management issues, and had reportedly admitted to sexual assault.\\" * The CIA provided false information to the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel about the methods of interrogation it was using against prisoners. * CIA Deputy Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Philip Mudd, discussed outreach to the media to thwart Congress, stating, \\"We either get out and sell, or we get hammered, which has implications beyond the media. [C]ongress reads it, cuts our authorities, mess up our budget.\\" *The report found that the CIA held at least 119 detainees during the course of the interrogation program, more than the 98 previously reported to Congress. *An email cited in the report and prepared by a subordinate indicates that CIA Director Michael Hayden knew that the CIA had detained at least 112 detainees, but told CIA personnel to report 98, the number that had been provided to Congress. A CIA officer stated, \\"DCIA instructed me to keep the detainee number at 98 – pick whatever date i [sic] needed to make that happen but the number is 98.\\" * The director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center testified to the Committee on August 2, 2007 that detainees \\"are given ample opportunity to provide the information without the use of EITs.\\" This was false, as CIA interrogators subjected numerous detainees to enhanced interrogation techniques before giving them the opportunity to provide information through traditional interrogation. * Several times throughout the program, CIA officers identified inaccuracies in CIA representations to other U.S. government offices and the public about the program's effectiveness. The CIA did not correct these inaccuracies, and allowed inaccurate information to remain as the CIA's official position.  Innocent people imprisoned by the CIA  At least 26 of the 119 prisoners (22%) held by the CIA were subsequently found by the CIA to have been improperly detained, many having also experienced torture. Under the Memorandum of Notification (MON) signed by President George W. Bush to establish the CIA detention program, only persons who \\"pose a continuing, serious threat of violence or death to U.S. persons and interests or planning terrorist activities\\" were eligible for detention. The MON also did not reference interrogation. Two innocent people were jailed and tortured based solely on allegations from another prisoner who fabricated information after having been tortured himself. Two former intelligence sources were jailed and tortured by accident. One mentally challenged man was held by the CIA in order to persuade family members to provide information. Among the 26 individuals who the CIA acknowledged had been improperly detained, only three were released after less than one month in CIA custody, while most were confined for several months. There is only one example in CIA records of the Agency holding personnel accountable for wrongfully detaining individuals who they themselves determined did not fit MON criteria.  Other  * The report noted a November 2001 memorandum circulated within the CIA by its attorneys titled \\"Hostile Interrogations: Legal Considerations for C.I.A. Officers\\". In it, the lawyers argued that prosecution for torture could be avoided if said torture \\"resulted in saving thousands of lives.\\" * Despite CIA assertions that there were no objections to the interrogation program, some CIA personnel found the torture revolting and asked to be transferred from facilities where torture was being conducted. Some also questioned whether such activities could continue and were told that the senior officials in the CIA had approved these techniques. * The report suggests torture was the source of a false confession by Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi linking Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda that was cited in Colin Powell's address to the UN in advance of the 2003 Iraq War. *The CIA kept incomplete records of their detainees, so it is unclear if 119 is a complete count. *The report's scope is limited to the abuse of detainees directly in CIA custody and does not include detainees tortured at the behest of the CIA after being extraordinarily rendered. *In 2008, 85% of the CIA's Rendition, Detention and Interrogation Group consisted of outside contractors. = Contractors = The two CIA contractors who developed the \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" (John \\"Bruce\\" Jessen and James Mitchell, who are referred to as \\"Hammond Dunbar\\" and \\"Grayson Swigert\\" in the report, respectively), received 81 million for their services, out of an original contract worth more than 180 million. NBC News identified the contractors' company as Mitchell, Jessen & Associates. Mitchell and Jessen were psychologists at the Defense Department who taught special forces how to resist and endure torture in a program called (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE), based on Communist torture techniques. Neither man had specialized knowledge of Al Qaeda, nor were they practised interrogators. \\"They had never carried out a real interrogation, only mock sessions in the military training they had overseen,\\" The New York Times reported in 2009. \\"They had no relevant scholarship; their Ph.D. dissertations were on high blood pressure and family therapy. They had no language skills and no expertise on Al Qaeda.\\" The CIA nevertheless hired them for the interrogation program, for which they reverse-engineered SERE tactics and \\"developed the list of enhanced interrogation techniques and personally conducted interrogations of some of the CIA's most significant detainees using those techniques. The contractors also evaluated whether the detainees' psychological state allowed for continued use of the techniques, even for some detainees they themselves were interrogating or had interrogated.\\" The two personally waterboarded detainees Abu Zubaydah, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and swore by the technique's effectiveness, despite having \\"no direct experience with the waterboard\\" (as it was not a SERE technique) other than testing it on each other. The contractors developed a list of 12 forms of torture for use against detainees. The list included: 1) the attention grasp, 2) walling, 3) facial hold, 4) facial slap, 5) cramped confinement, 6) wall standing, 7) stress positions, 8) sleep deprivation, 9) waterboarding, 10) use of diapers, 11) use of insects, and 12) mock burials. John Rizzo, the CIA acting general counsel who met with the contractors, described them as \\"sadistic and terrifying\\" in his book Company Man. During Mitchell and Jessen's time participating in the CIA's interrogation program, CIA personnel lodged a number of complaints against them. These included concerns about the possible conflict of interest of the two administering enhanced interrogation techniques on detainees, then psychologically evaluating the same detainees to determine the success of the interrogations. One internal CIA communication said that \\"no professional in the field would credit their later judgments as psychologists assessing the subjects of their enhanced measures,\\" and another noted, \\"Jim and Bob have shown blatant disregard for the ethics shared by almost all of their colleagues.\\" The CIA's contract with Mitchell and Jessen's company was terminated in 2009, but included a $5 million dollar indemnification agreement that covered the costs associated with any possible criminal prosecution. According to the report and CIA documents obtained by journalist Jason Leopold, Mitchell and Jessen's company billed the CIA $1.1 million for legal services from 2007 to 2012, and the CIA is obligated to pay for their legal expenses until 2021. In October 2015, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Mitchell and Jessen on behalf of three detainees who had been tortured in the CIA's interrogation program, including Gul Rahman, who died of hypothermia after CIA interrogators beat him and chained him half naked to the wall of a freezing cell. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. = Financial aspects = According to the report, the Detention and Interrogation Program cost well over $300 million in non-personnel costs. This included funding for the CIA to construct and maintain detention facilities, including two facilities costing millions of dollars that were never used, in part due to host country political concerns. \\"To encourage governments to clandestinely host CIA detention sites, or to increase support for existing sites, the CIA provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign government officials.\\" Jose Rodriguez was personally involved in at least one of these payments to a foreign government. According to an unnamed CIA official, \\"In one case, we gave [Redacted] $[Redacted],000,000 ... Myself and Jose [Rodriguez] [Redacted] ... We never counted it. I'm not about to count that kind of money for a receipt.\\" The report states that in 2006, the value of the CIA's base contract with psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen's company with all options exercised was in excess of $180 million; \\"the contractors received $81 million prior to the contract's termination in 2009. In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year indemnification agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement.\\" = CIA internal objections = Numerous CIA officials and personnel objected to various aspects of the program. According to journalist Jane Mayer, as the CIA formulated the interrogation regime, several top CIA officers, including R. Scott Shumate (chief operational psychologist for the Counterterrorism Center), left the CIA, reportedly related to disagreements over using the proposed techniques. During the interrogation of detainee Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the CIA's Chief of Interrogation announced his resignation due to his misgivings about the program, stating that it was a \\"train wreak [sic] waiting to happen.\\" The same individual drafted a cable for CIA Headquarters that voiced his opinion that al-Nashiri was not withholding information, that continued use of enhanced interrogation techniques \\"is excessive and may cause him to cease cooperation on any level,\\" and noted that multiple CIA personnel believed that it \\"may push [al-Nashiri] over the edge psychologically.\\" Multiple CIA personnel also objected to contractors Mitchell and Jessen both acting as interrogators and psychologically evaluating detainees, as this was a conflict of interest. The CIA's Office of Medical Services noted that the CIA paid Mitchell and Jessen to apply enhanced interrogation techniques, and then \\"[judge] both [the technique's] effectiveness and detainee resilience, and implicitly [propose] continued use of the technique at a daily compensation reported to be $1,800/day.\\" Personnel at the black site called \\"Detention Site GREEN\\" in the report also raised concerns that enhanced interrogation technique application at the site was \\"approach[ing] the legal limit.\\" Jose Rodriguez responded to these concerns by stating: \\"Strongly urge that any speculative language as to the legality of given activities or, more precisely, judgment calls as to their legality vis-a-vis operational guidelines for this activity agreed upon and vetted at the most senior levels of the agency, be refrained from in written traffic (email or cable traffic). Such language is not helpful.\\" In late 2002 and early 2003 Charlie Wise was the CIA's Director of Interrogation, and, with Mitchell and Jessen, one of the three individuals officially authorized to use Waterboarding. Wise joined the psychologists after they had begun using Waterboarding, and there was a personality clash. Wise said the torture program the psychologists set up was a “train [wreck] waiting to happen”, and “I intend to get the hell off the train before it happens.” In 2004, when the report summary was released, the Washington Post described his subsequent resignation as voluntary. Executive branch response  =Response from Obama administration= President Barack Obama said the report had revealed a \\"troubling program\\" and that \\"We will rely on all elements of our national power, including the power and example of our founding ideals. That is why I have consistently supported the declassification of today's report. No nation is perfect. But one of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better.\\" The Obama administration consistently worked through White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. According to press reports, during the negotiations over redactions in the Executive Summary, McDonough actively negotiated on behalf of the CIA for more redactions. During the run-up to the Executive Summary's release, Secretary of State John Kerry also reportedly urged Feinstein to delay the release, citing concerns about the coalition against ISIS and American lives and property abroad. John Brennan was the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from March 2013 until January 2017 CIA Director John O. Brennan agreed with the current administration's policy prohibiting enhanced interrogation techniques and admitted that the program had had \\"shortcomings.\\" He disagreed with the Committee's conclusion that information obtained through torture could have been obtained by other means, and said it is unknowable whether other interrogation approaches would have yielded the same information. In supporting his views, Brennan also released a 136-page declassified version of an official CIA response and critique of the torture report written in June 2013.However, the CIA also released a document in December 2014 titled \\"Note to Readers of The Central Intelligence Agency's Response to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program,\\" in which the CIA admitted that many of its objections were incorrect, including that the State Department may not actually have been aware of CIA black sites in some countries, that CIA personnel had in fact used enhanced interrogation techniques without prior approval, and that some of the information the CIA claimed came from these techniques had not. The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that they would not be pursuing bringing any charges against anyone who might have been involved in the use of torture, noting that they \\"did not find any new information that they had not previously considered in reaching their determination.\\" The Department of Justice had launched two investigations overseen by John Durham in 2009 that also did not result in charges. The rationale for the absence of charges has not been disclosed, but Mr. Durham did say that the full record of the possible evidence of criminal conduct and possible defenses that might be offered by any of those accused were contained in the pages of the Senate committee report that he was not going to release. Thus, it remains impossible for anyone to offer an independent evaluation of whether anyone involved was or was not guilty of criminal conduct. In response to a FOIA lawsuit seeking access to the full report, the Obama administration argued that the rationale for not releasing all the pages of the committee report was that \\"disclosing them could affect the candor of law enforcement deliberations about whether to bring criminal charges.\\" Given the apparent absence of those public deliberations, such a rationale seems almost incredibly obtuse, especially since, after the release of the Senate's report, several news outlets noted that \\"the only CIA employee connected to its interrogation program to go to prison\\" was John Kiriakou, the whistle-blower who was \\"prosecuted for providing information to reporters.\\" =Response from Bush administration= Three former CIA directors—George Tenet, Porter Goss and Michael V. Hayden—as well as three former CIA deputy directors, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in response to the release of the Senate Intelligence Committee report. They criticized the report as \\"a partisan attack on the agency that has done the most to protect America after the 9/11 attacks.\\" They said that the CIA's interrogation program was invaluable to the capture of al Qaeda operatives and the disruption of al Qaeda's efforts and also stated that, contrary to the Senate Intelligence Committee's findings, \\"there is no doubt that information provided by the totality of detainees in CIA custody […] was essential to bringing bin Laden to justice.\\" Additionally, they wrote that the CIA remained within the interrogation techniques authorized by the DOJ; that the CIA did not mislead the DOJ, White House or Congress; and that the threat of a \\"'ticking time bomb' scenario\\" context was critical to understanding the program. Additionally, they established a website to defend the actions of the CIA. The report's Executive Summary shows that Tenet, Goss, and Hayden all provided inaccurate information to the White House, Congress, and the public about the program, including regarding its effectiveness. It contains over 35 pages of Hayden's testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee in which he provided inaccurate or misleading information. Additionally, contrary to these officials' claim, there is no evidence that the CIA's interrogation program produced evidence that led to Osama bin Laden. CIA records show that the information came from numerous sources, including CIA-collected signals intelligence, intelligence obtained by foreign governments, and non-coercive CIA interrogation. Also, despite the claim that the CIA remained within DOJ interrogation guidelines, there are numerous examples of interrogators exceeding guidelines, including using interrogation techniques in unauthorized ways, for longer periods of time or in a more extreme way than they were intended to be used. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was in office during the events discussed in the report and participated in numerous meetings regarding enhanced interrogation techniques, said the report's criticisms of the CIA were \\"a bunch of hooey\\" and that harsh interrogation tactics were \\"absolutely, totally justified.\\" He further said that he did not feel that the CIA misled him about the techniques used or the value of the information obtained from them, and that \\"if I had to do it over again, I would.\\" The report notes that in multiple CIA briefings and documents for Cheney, the Agency repeatedly misrepresented the program's results and effectiveness. John Yoo, author of the Torture Memos, criticized the report as a partisan attack on American intelligence agencies and defended his belief that the CIA was legally allowed to use interrogation techniques that did not cause injury. Yoo's legal justification, which included the \\"necessity defense\\" (that using torture would be legal if necessary in emergency situations), is contrary to both international and domestic law. He also stated that \\"if the facts on which [he] based [his] advice were wrong, [he] would be willing to change [his] opinion of the interrogation methods.\\" In an interview in CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS, Yoo said that the harsh treatments outlined in the report could violate anti-torture laws, stating that \\"[i]f these things happened as described in the report [...] they were not supposed to be done.\\" He voiced a similar opinion in a C-SPAN interview, saying that using the techniques cumulatively could violate anti-torture statute.  Reception  = Minority response = Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, opposed the study saying that they believe \\"it will present serious consequences for U.S. national security\\" and that the study was ideologically motivated. They also asserted that the program \\"developed significant intelligence that helped us identify and capture important al- Qa'ida terrorists, disrupt their ongoing plotting, and take down Usama Bin Ladin.\\" Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, stated that the report was a \\"partisan effort\\" by Democrats that \\"could endanger the lives of Americans overseas\\" and was not \\"serious or constructive.\\" Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, himself a victim of torture while a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said in a speech following Feinstein's presentation on the Senate floor that he supported the release of the report, and that those responsible for the interrogation policy had \\"stained our national honor, did much harm and little practical good.\\" = Organizations = The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argued that the attorney general should appoint a special prosecutor to conduct a full investigation, with its director Anthony Romero saying the report showed the CIA had committed human rights violations. The Center for Constitutional Rights called for prosecutions of those responsible for the torture and joined a criminal complaint filed in Germany by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights. Kenneth Roth from Human Rights Watch called for prosecutions of senior Bush officials who authorized torture and oversaw its use. Roth stated that failure to prosecute was \\"more than just a failure of justice\\" and \\"means that torture effectively remains a policy option rather than a criminal offense.\\" Steven W. Hawkins, the USA executive director of Amnesty International, called for justice saying, \\"Under the UN convention against torture, no exceptional circumstances whatsoever can be invoked to justify torture, and all those responsible for authorizing or carrying out torture or other ill-treatment must be fully investigated.\\" The United Nations's special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights, Ben Emmerson, called for the prosecution of those responsible. He said that the CIA had \\"commit[ed] systematic crimes and gross violations of international human rights law.\\" Juan E. Méndez, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture, said in a statement that many governments have used the American use of torture to justify their own abuses, saying \\"If the U.S. tortures, why can't we do it?\\" Mendez called the release of the report only the first step and called for \\"the investigation and prosecution of those who were responsible for ordering, planning or implementing the C.I.A. torture program.\\" Speaking on December 10, the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, commended the government's release of the report saying, \\"Few countries will admit that their state apparatus has been practicing torture, and many continue shamelessly to deny it—even when it is well documented...\\" Zeid called for accountability saying, \\"In all countries, if someone commits murder, they are prosecuted and jailed. If they commit rape or armed robbery, they are prosecuted and jailed. If they order, enable or commit torture—recognized as a serious international crime—they cannot simply be granted immunity because of political expediency. When that happens, we undermine this exceptional Convention, and – as a number of U.S. political leaders clearly acknowledged yesterday – we undermine our own claims to be civilized societies rooted in the rule of law.\\" The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute designed a course around the report, investigating the balance between national security and the civil liberties of every individual. = International governments = Afghan president Ashraf Ghani called the report \\"shocking\\" and said that the actions detailed in the report \\"violated all accepted norms of human rights in the world.\\" Lithuanian Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius called on the U.S. to say whether the CIA used sites in his country to interrogate prisoners. Former President of Poland Aleksander Kwasniewski said that he put pressure in 2003 on American officials to end interrogations at a secret CIA prison his country hosted, saying, \\"I told Bush that this cooperation must end and it did end.\\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said the \\"shocking report shows violence, extremism, and secrecy as institutionalized in the US security system.\\" The North Korean government called on the United Nations Security Council to investigate the \\"most brutal medieval forms\\" of torture practiced by the CIA at \\"black sites\\" around the world. =Attempts to preserve copies of the Report= The CIA's Inspector General's office told Congress in May 2016 that it had accidentally deleted its only copy of the full report, both in electronic and hard disk forms. The acting Inspector General reportedly uploaded the report to the CIA's internal computer network, followed protocol and destroyed the hard copy. Another staff member then apparently misinterpreted instructions from the Justice Department not to open the file and deleted it from the server. Only a limited number of copies of the full report were made, and human rights workers are concerned that the CIA might succeed in destroying all copies of this report they found so embarrassing. On December 29, 2016, less than a month before the end of the Obama administration, District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the preservation of the full classified report, in case it was needed during the prosecution or appeal of senior suspects during their Guantanamo Military Commissions. Also in December 2016, President Obama announced that he would include the report in his presidential archive. After 12 years, a request could be made for the declassification process to start for the full report's release. In June 2017, Senator Richard Burr, then chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, ordered that Executive Branch agencies return their copies of the report to the committee. The copies preserved for the Guantanamo Bay cases and for Obama's presidential archive would not be returned. =McCain-Feinstein amendment= Following the release of the Executive Summary, on November 25, 2015, President Barack Obama signed into law the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which included an amendment sponsored by Senators John McCain and Dianne Feinstein to codify into law the ban enhanced interrogation techniques laid out in President Obama's Executive Order 13491. The amendment restricts national security interrogation to techniques in the Army Field Manual, which the amendment mandated would be reviewed to eliminate any potential abuses the manual allowed. The Senate passed the amendment with a bipartisan vote of 78 to 21. = Media = *Al-Ba'ath – official newspaper of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region said the U.S. \\"resorted to violent and ineffective measures.\\" *The report was the lead story on El País. *Folha de S.

It had a magnitude of 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale and caused 4 deaths and 36 injuries. The epicenter was near Machaze in Manica Province of southern Mozambique, just north of the Save River. It was the largest historical earthquake in Mozambique and the first earthquake in southern Africa to have an identified surface rupture. Tectonic setting Southern Mozambique is at the southern end of the East Africa Rift system, where the African Plate appears to be breaking into several smaller plates. The Somali Plate is moving westward relative to the Nubian Plate at a rate of several millimetres a year at the latitude of this earthquake. Most earthquakes in this zone are a result of either normal or strike-slip faulting. Earthquake Focal mechanism diagram for the earthquake The earthquake was felt throughout Mozambique and over a wide area of eastern southern Africa, including South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Close to the epicentre the shaking reached VIII in intensity on the Mercalli intensity scale. In the cities of Beira, Inhambane and Maputo the intensity reached V. The focal mechanism of the earthquake is consistent with normal faulting on a westerly dipping fault plane. Field investigations identified 15 km of surface rupture in the form of a west-facing scarp, with up to 2.05 m of vertical displacement, although it was not possible to prove the full extent of surface faulting due to lack of time and the presence of minefields. Investigations using Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), combined with field and seismological observations, have identified two fault segments with slightly differing strikes, with the hypocenter and most of the displacement being on the more southerly of the segments. Damage USGS Shakemap for the earthquake Little damage was recorded, with only 294 buildings reported as damaged in the area between Espungabera, Beira and Chimoio. A total of four deaths were recorded, one in Espungabera, one in Machaze and two in Beira, with a further thirty-six injured.
