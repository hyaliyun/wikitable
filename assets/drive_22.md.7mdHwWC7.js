Author of The Language of the Gods and two other reputed texts on Sanskrit, she was the founder and guiding spirit of the East-West Cultural Center in Los Angeles, California, a major pioneering door through which now-celebrated Indian yogis and spiritual teachers of many Eastern and mystical traditions were first introduced to America and the West. Judith Tyberg  Early life as a theosophist at Point Loma  Judith Marjorie Tyberg was born on May 16, 1902, at Point Loma, the \\"California Utopia\\", which was the new world headquarters of the Theosophical Society. Katherine Tingley, world president, founded \\"Lomaland\\" in 1898 and Tyberg's Danish theosophist parents, Marjorie and Olaf Tyberg, were among the first joiners. In 1900, Tingley founded the Raja Yoga School. Tyberg recalled how, as young children, they were instructed in the works of the world's great religious and spiritual traditions and were inspired to seek \\"Truth, Justice, Wisdom ... more knowledge, more light\\". Early on, Tyberg displayed a serious and philosophical nature and a vocation for education. Madame Tingley called her \\"one of my true raja yogis\\". Tyberg grew up, studied, lived and taught at Point Loma until its closing in 1942, and it was in this context that she knew orientalist Walter Evans-Wentz and Paul Brunton. She received all her educational degrees from the Theosophical University: a B.A. degree in Higher Mathematics and Languages (Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Danish and Swedish); an M.A. in Religion and Philosophy with a specialization in Oriental Thought; and a B.Th and M.Th in Sacred Scriptures and Ancient Civilizations, with a focus on the Bible and Kabbalah. Tyberg began her study of Sanskrit in 1930 with Gottfried de Purucker and received a Ph.D. in Sanskritic studies. She became a member of the American Oriental Society. While still a teenager, Tyberg began her teaching career at the Raja Yoga School. She held the post of Assistant Principal of the Raja Yoga School from 1932 to 1935, became head of its Sanskrit and Oriental Division in 1940, and served as Dean of Studies as well as Trustee of the Theosophical University from 1935 to 1945. Starting in the late 1930s, she authored numerous articles on spirituality and consciousness for The Theosophical Forum magazine, including The Sacred Texts of the Gupta- Vidya, Possibilities of the Kali Yuga, Hinduism & Buddhism, Where are your haunts of Consciousness? In 1934, Tyberg joined the team set up by de Purucker to create an encyclopedia of spiritual vocabulary used in theosophy, drawing from Greek, Chinese, Kabbalist, Zoroastrian, Hindu, and Buddhist texts. Tyberg's contribution was the exposition of over 2,000 terms.  First Sanskrit works  Tyberg translated the Hymn to the Origin of the World from the Rig Veda and collated, edited and prefaced Charles Johnston's 1946 translation of Shankaracharya's Crest-Jewel of Wisdom. In 1940, Tyberg published Sanskrit Keys to the Wisdom Religion, an exposition of over 500 Sanskrit terms used in religious, occult and theosophical literature. This was a groundbreaking work by virtue of its content and its innovative printing technology, as it was the first time anywhere, including India, that the ancient form of Sanskrit was linotyped. Tyberg, in collaboration with Geoffrey Baborka, chief linotype operator at the Theosophical University Press, transformed a modern Sanskrit keyboard into a keyboard for the ancient form of the Devanagari alphabet, composed of dozens of matrices. Tyberg's view of Sanskrit's importance was quoted by the Los Angeles Times: \\"Not only are the languages used on the European and American continents deficient in words dealing with spirit, but many of the English words that do have spiritual connotations are so weighty with false and dogmatic beliefs that it is difficult to convey an exact meaning to all ... while Sanskrit expresses the inner mysteries of the soul and spirit, the many after-death states, the origin and destiny of worlds and men and human psychology.\\" In 1941, Tyberg continued using her linotype innovation for the publication of the first edition of her First Lessons in Sanskrit Grammar. This was a revision of James R. Ballantyne's 1851 grammar, which Tyberg prepared in conjunction with Lawrence A. Ware of Iowa State University. Throughout her life, she reworked this text several times, subsequently republishing it in 1950, 1961, and 1977.  India and meeting with Sri Aurobindo  In 1946, due to a schism within the California theosophical movement, Tyberg resigned from her dean and trustee positions at Point Loma. After a brief period of teaching at the University of Southern California, she went out on her own and opened a Sanskrit center and bookshop in Glendale, California. There, she taught Indian philosophy, religion, languages and culture. She continued lecturing at universities and associations, thus developing both her reputation as well as a large network of contacts with other orientalists. In 1946, Tyberg attended a lecture at the University of Southern California given by S. Radhakrishnan, then Vice- Chancellor of Benares Hindu University, following which Tyberg applied for a Sanskrit research scholarship at BHU. In her application letter and scholarship request she stated: \\"I have decided to give my life to the spreading of the beautiful teachings and religious philosophy as found in Sanskrit scriptures ... and I would have the West illumined by its perfect philosophy.\\" Explaining the \\"small means\\" earned from her teaching and lecturing, and her \\"simple way of living\\", she also expressed her belief that \\"when one dares and goes ahead with an unselfish heart and is convinced that the work is for the progress of humanity, help does come.\\" The response was a three-year scholarship at the Oriental Division of Benares Hindu University, and Tyberg was made an honorary member of the All India Arya Dharma Seva Sangha. Jyoti-Reading Sri Aurobindo Jyoti Mantras-From Gita Chp 4 Jyoti Mantras-From The Rig Veda Tyberg arrived at BHU in June 1947. At her first meeting, Tyberg chose the Vedic religious hymns for her Master's thesis topic. After a twenty-five-year study of humanity's sacred scriptures and seventeen years of Sanskrit, she was convinced that a deep but undiscovered spiritual secret was encrypted in the Vedas' archaic, complex language and that Western explanations of the texts were \\"nonsense\\". But, while the Vedas were accepted as the fount of India's spiritual culture, the current view, including in India, held that they were an interesting but \\"obscure, confused and barbarous hymnal\\". Tyberg's surprise and disappointment was great when she was thus informed that even the scholars at BHU knew of no one who could help her find this secret, if it even existed. She was advised to change her research topic. Professor Arabinda Basu, then a young lecturer, overheard this exchange. He followed a crestfallen Tyberg into the corridor, quietly told her that there was someone who could help her and then gave her an as-yet unpublished manuscript of The Secret of the Veda by Sri Aurobindo, the revolutionary who, after a series of mystical experiences, renounced politics and founded an ashram in Pondicherry. Tyberg stayed up all night reading, and the next morning, told Basu that she'd found the object of her lifelong search for truth. On his advice, she wrote to Sri Aurobindo, asking for permission to come to see him. The invitation that followed led Tyberg to spend two months in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Autumn 1947. On November 24, one of the four days annually when Sri Aurobindo broke his seclusion, Tyberg did her reverence to Sri Aurobindo and to his spiritual collaborator Mirra Alfassa, a Frenchwoman known as \\"The Mother\\". Tyberg's diary recorded her experience: \\"I just felt God\\", \\"electric forces\\", \\"stretched out to infinity\\", and \\"I really knew what was my soul.\\" In a private audience with The Mother, Judith Tyberg asked to receive a spiritual name, which was chosen by Sri Aurobindo himself: \\"Jyotipriya, the lover of Light\\". Back in Benares, Tyberg continued her studies in Sanskrit, Hindi, Pali, the Gita, the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, the Vedantic systems of philosophy and modern Indian thought, leading to an M.A. in Indian Religion and Philosophy. In March 1949, she wrote to Sri Aurobindo and The Mother: \\"I received the news that I had passed First Class in the M.A. examinations and had made a record for the university.... For the question 'State clearly and briefly the philosophical and religious views of Sri Aurobindo', I answered fully and enjoyed pouring out my soul in it.\\" Many eminent Indians, political leaders and yoga masters alike, were impressed with Tyberg's scholarship and her feeling for Indian culture: Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Azad, V. K. Gokak, B. L. Atreya, Anandamayi Ma, Ramana Maharshi, Sri Ramdas, and Krishna Prem, and at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram: Kapali Shastri, Indra Sen, Sisir Mitra, Prithvi Singh, and former freedom fighters-turned- yogis Nolini Kanta Gupta and A.B. Purani, friends she referred to as \\"the cream of Hindu culture\\". Tyberg spent a week with the sage Ramana Maharshi at his Arunachala ashram where he told her \\"You're already realized, you just don't know it.\\" Another lifelong friend was Swami Sivananda alongside whom Tyberg served as India's representative to the 1948 World University Round Table. Tyberg was the first President of the International Students Union, founded by S. Radhakrishnan, who called her \\"a real force in international understanding\\". Professor T.R.V. Murti declared \\"I am convinced that you are destined to play an important role in bringing the West and the East together on a spiritual plane.\\" In Autumn 1949, Tyberg went back to Pondicherry for a six-month stay as a disciple at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. During her two years in India, Tyberg had kept up regular correspondence with an extensive network of American seekers. When certain people criticized this as unyogic, Tyberg asked The Mother for her view. Her reply was \\"How do you think the Divine works if he doesn't work through people like you?\\" and she repeated what she'd told Tyberg at their very first meeting: \\"You have chosen it, to serve, long ago.\\" After a final reverence to Sri Aurobindo on February 21, 1950, Tyberg recorded her impressions: \\"Vast deep calm with a mighty wisdom ... his consciousness seemed infinite ... such currents!\\"  The American Academy of Asian Studies  In April 1950, Tyberg took the boat from Calcutta to California, which included a stop in Hawaii. There she met her old Benares friend Charles Moore and discussed the results of his 1949 East‚ÄìWest Convention of Philosophers. From this, she gathered ideas for an approach to Sri Aurobindo that might readily appeal to the Western mind. Her arrival in Los Angeles was met with enthusiasm, and in just the first two weeks, she gave over ten lectures to more than 1,000 attendees. A similarly packed schedule was organized in San Francisco, where she received an enthusiastic reception at Stanford University. America was eager for \\"the uncensored truth about India\\" and, in Tyberg's words, California was \\"just teeming with interest in Sri Aurobindo\\". Then, in 1951, Tyberg was invited to join the faculty of the newly founded American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. The AAAS was the first graduate university devoted to Asian culture, and was considered one of the \\"principal roots\\" of the 1960s' \\"San Francisco Renaissance\\". Tyberg held the professorship of Sanskrit alongside an international group of colleagues that included Alan Watts, Haridas Chaudhuri, and Dilipkumar Roy. Chaudhuri and Roy were fellow \\"ardent Aurobindonians\\" as was Director of Studies, Frederic Spiegelberg, who held Sri Aurobindo to be \\"the prophet of our age\\". Spiegelberg highly regarded Tyberg for her teaching approach, which took \\"Sanscrit as a life force underlying Indian thinking, past and present\\", and praised her \\"superior teaching abilities ... the way in which she understood to make every single class meeting a vitally interesting one\\". As an instructor in a Summer 1952 seminar on Modern India at San Francisco State College, Tyberg's teaching was noted as \\"exceptionally effective\\": \\"It is perfectly clear that she commands a tremendous range of knowledge and insight into the workings of modern Indian society based on both direct experience and extensive study.\\" Tyberg also taught as a lecturer at Stanford University.  The East‚ÄìWest Cultural Center  Chant-Jyoti with Trudi King After two years at the AAAS, Tyberg returned to Los Angeles, where on May 1, 1953 she founded the East‚ÄìWest Cultural Center. In line with Sri Aurobindo's dictum \\"The Knowledge that unites is the true Knowledge.\\" Tyberg intended the EWCC to be a \\"broad and non-sectarian\\" forum for building cultural reciprocity between East and West as well as presenting a variety of aspects of spiritual life. She single-handedly conducted classes in Sanskrit, Hindi, Pali, and Greek, studies in comparative religion and sacred scriptures, and the yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. Tyberg organized guest lectures on Indian art and culture, dramatic readings from Indian literary classics, concerts and dance performances. She inaugurated an Oriental Library and bookshop with resources on India's many yogic paths. In the isolationist atmosphere of the Korean War, where \\"those interested in spiritual things are very much in the minority\\", her activities were pioneering. From 1953 to 1973, Tyberg also operated \\"The East West Cultural Center School for Creatively Gifted Children\\", which received full accreditation by the Los Angeles and California school boards. The school promised cultivating \\"aesthetic and studious habits\\". In an echo of her Raja Yoga school training, Tyberg aimed at inspiring children with \\"the highest ideals\\" by focusing on their \\"god-like qualities\\". Tyberg singlehandedly taught all school subjects, as well as music theory and piano. Many of her graduates were accepted by leading colleges as much as two years in advance of public school students, and Tyberg's school is remembered by them as \\"a wonderful and unique opportunity\\". When the Cold War Fifties gave way to the New Age Sixties, the many years of Tyberg's avant-garde efforts burst into bloom. With her \\"My Search for Universality\\" talks, she was hailed as \\"one of the South-land's great women leaders and lecturers\\". The East-West Cultural Center became known as the focal point for Southern California's spiritual activity and its auditorium on Sunday afternoons was the first US launching pad for yogis who went on to have \\"a huge impact on modern Yoga\\": Swamis Muktananda, Satchidananda, Chidananda, Ramdas and Mother Mirabai, Sikh, Sufi, and Buddhist masters from Sri Lanka, Japan, and Cambodia, as well as Indian cultural and political leaders. Tyberg invited noted Western mystics, occultists and astrologers such as Dane Rudhyar and Marie de Vrahnes from Lourdes as well as early health food proponents such as Bernard Jensen. Famed dancers Ruth St. Denis and Indira Devi performed on the EWCC's stage in those early years of America's spiritual flowering. It was Tyberg who arranged Swami Vishnudevananda's Los Angeles program during the time he was also a subject of the early medical research on the effects of meditation, conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles. American hatha yoga exponent Ganga White was one of the young seekers attracted to Tyberg's center. When, on February 28, 1968, The Mother inaugurated the new international spiritual township of Auroville, Tyberg was an ardent supporter of this spiritual adventure and served as an essential informational and connecting link. Tyberg was known for her \\"high ethical and spiritual ideals\\" and for her upright and \\"high-minded\\" character. Indian gurus sent their disciples to see her to \\"be benefited\\". However, if there was any insincerity or misrepresentation of India's spiritual light, Tyberg would be categorical and cut off all aid and connections immediately. \\"Never speaking against anyone, she would simply say 'I cannot disclose my reasons, but I assure you they are genuine.'\\" Part of her challenge and pedagogy was to lead seekers to be able to distinguish between low-level and often fraudulent \\"psychic phenomena\\" and the \\"true psychic\\" in Sri Aurobindo's description ‚Äì the conscious evolution godwards of the soul. Anandamayi Ma dictated a 1959 message to Tyberg saying \\"how very pleased\\" she was about Tyberg's activities. Swami Sivananda wrote: \\"I greatly admire the solid work that you do for the spiritual good of mankind in a silent manner. This is dynamic Yoga. The whole of America will be grateful to you.\\" For Tyberg, the high point of the week was her Thursday evening spiritual satsangs where the focus was the in-depth teachings of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother, in her words \\"the highest path offered\\". She wrote to The Mother: \\"You must know how happy I am to have something so genuine to offer those seeking truth.... I just must share my great happiness and blessing with others.\\" When she spoke, she said she felt a force that would come down in \\"great swirls\\" from above her head and get her \\"centralized to speak\\". A long- time devotee explained that Tyberg \\"did not interpret or ever become vague, or indulge in clich√©s, but seemed to identify so completely with Sri Aurobindo and The Mother that one felt continually their presence\\" and how during meditations with Tyberg \\"the force was so powerful' that his body would bend. In her private office, Tyberg kept a framed personal message from the Mother: \\"For you who have realised your soul and seek the integral yoga, to help the others is the best way of helping yourself. Indeed, if you are sincere you will soon discover that each of their failures is a sure sign of a corresponding deficiency in yourself, the proof that something in you is not perfect enough to be all-powerful.\\" There are strong indications in Tyberg's letter to the Mother of March 8, 1956 that she was one of the very few to have felt The Mother's February 29 Supramental Descent experience.  \\"The Language of the Gods\\" and the last years  One of Tyberg's last works was The Drama of Integral Self-Realization, an illuminating and stirring summary of Sri Aurobindo's spiritual epic poem, Savitri, which appeared as a chapter in the 1960 publication, The Integral Philosophy of Sri Aurobindo: A Commemorative Symposium, edited by Haridas Chaudhari and Frederic Spiegelberg. In 1970, Tyberg published The Language of the Gods, her culminating opus on Sanskrit's \\"wisdom-treasury\\". This, along with her accompanying Sanskrit pronunciation tapes, capped 45 years of Sanskrit teaching and scholarship. Tyberg dedicated it \\"In Reverent Memory of Sri Aurobindo\\" and wrote in her preface: \\"In this age when men are responding to a spiritual need for unity and brotherhood among all the nations of the world, we find a spiritual vocabulary being drawn from the rich treasury of Sanskrit terminology because these words are already ripe with truths divine.\\" In her \\"Plan of Study Recommended\\", Tyberg specified: \\"a stress has been given to the verb-roots of the words, for they are the essential carriers of the meaning of the words as originating in the spiritual element of the Universe\\" and in this way the student can \\"get at the real meaning of the word, free from the loaded implications that so many words have come to possess because of religious dogma and a misunderstanding due to lack of spiritual experience\\". The book had a double introduction, by both B. L. Atreya and V. K. Gokak. Atreya praised the unique combination of Sanskrit and Hinduism, while Gokak lauded Tyberg's \\"ceaseless search for Truth\\" and her \\"burning desire to communicate to other aspirants what vision of Reality she herself attained through her study\\" of the mystical and philosophical terms which \\"help us to map out precisely the realms of the superconscient in man\\". The work was widely reviewed in India: The Indian Libertarian wrote: \\"Dr. Tyberg has woven for us a magnificent fabric of primary source materials of the highest authority,\\" and The Indian Review hailed the \\"novel approach and sincerity of scholarship\\" ending with the words \\"Dr. Tyberg has laid all lovers of Sanskrit under a debt of gratitude.\\" In Mother India, Sanat K. Banerji admired Tyberg's \\"boldness and originality\\" and particularly commended three major innovations: \\"within a reasonable compass, practically all the important terms that a students of (India's) most valuable works is likely to come across\\", the relating of \\"technical terms to the verbal roots from which they are derived\\" and the \\"signal service\\" that he felt must be emphasized: \\"Vedic interpretation has long suffered at the hands of scholars wholly ignorant of the spiritual endeavours the Vedas were meant to enshrine. The author has a valuable chapter on the Vedas and their spiritual meaning ... compiled from Sri Aurobindo's monumental work on the subject.\\" The review finished with the words: \\"Dr. Tyberg has justified the name Jyotipriya given her by Sri Aurobindo.\\" In 1972, Tyberg's finances finally permitted a last trip to see The Mother on the occasion of the Sri Aurobindo Centenary celebrations. Despite the constant arthritic pain that afflicted her body, Tyberg kept \\"cheerfully going on\\" as she often said, managing the EWCC's rich diversity of activities while continuing to provide spiritual teaching and personal counselling, always for free. She accepted new professorships: at the College of Oriental Studies (1973), as Emeritus Staff Professor of Buddhist Studies at the Buddha Dharma University (1973), and as Professor of Sanskrit and Hinduism for the Goddard College Graduate Field Faculty (1975). One academic reference attested \\"Tyberg's lectures were distinguished by wide reading and research; and even more than this, she imparted to her students and hearers the spiritual aroma and inspiration of the great philosophical schools of the East.\\" Tyberg often said that it was in the joy of teaching that she transcended all pain. In 1978, Tyberg was able to make the ultimate mortgage repayment on the EWCC building and drew up a \\"guidance\\" letter of ideals and principles for EWCC's new Board of Directors \\"as the New Age unfolds\\": \\"This Center is not a business or a sect or a popular or social activity. It is a service to the Divine to share and unite the best aspects of the spiritual and religious, philosophical and cultural and healing arts of the East and West for uplifting and leading to a Divine Life on Earth.... May it continue to grow thus spontaneously with Divine backing with no catering to lower standards for attracting money.\\" Judith Tyberg expired on October 3, 1980. After a life where she sought \\"long service ... in search of truth, beauty and joy to share with all\\", her final aspiration was \\"the speedy return of my soul to the Divine ... so I may return again to serve the Light.\\" Her Sanskrit books continue to be used as basic texts in Sanskrit classes, and the East West Cultural Center, the child of Tyberg's decades of pioneering and dedicated service, continues to exist as the Sri Aurobindo Center of Los Angeles.

Pre-orders were made available on April 1, 2014, and the album was originally scheduled to be released on October 30, 2014. Due to issues during recording that prolonged its completion, the album's release date was postponed until November 24, 2014. Ixora was recorded and produced in Aaron Marsh's studio, The Vanguard Room, in Lakeland, Florida, and was mixed by Michael Brauer. In addition to the standard ten-track album, a twin, deluxe edition was also recorded and made available for purchase as part of a pre- order exclusive bundle. The twin edition is a double-disc set. Disc one is an extended version of Ixora that contains an additional bonus track, while disc two is an alternate version of the album. Like a remix album, it can be listened to on its own but it can also be played in sync with disc one. In theory, playing both discs at the same time will create a quadraphonic version of Ixora.http://www.thecopelandsite.com/ixora-twin Track listing Reception Ixora has been well received by critics, with Metacritic awarding the album an aggregate score of 77/100 based on four reviews.

It is located 1 km west of the 17th-century village of Armavir. History =Antiquity= The area of ancient Armavir was inhabited since the 6th millennium BC. Various obsidian instruments, bronze objects and pottery have been found from that period. Armavir was regarded as an ancient capital of Armenia, said to have been founded by King Aramais in 1980 BC. During the first half of the 8th century BC, King Argishti I of Urartu built a fortress in the area and named it Argishtikhinili. In 331 BC, when Armenia under the Orontid Dynasty asserted its independence from the Achaemenid Empire, Armavir was chosen as the capital of Armenia. Slabs of clay have been found from the Achaemenid period written in the Elamite language concerning episodes of the Gilgamesh epic. Various inscriptions in Hellenistic Greek carved around the third century BC, have been found, including poetry from Hesiod, lines from Euripides, a list of Macedonian months, and names of Orontid Kings.Inscriptions on a rock face at Armavir - in English translation at attalus.org. The remains at the archaeological site of ancient Armavir According to the 5th-century Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, Armavir was the first capital of the kingdom of Armenia (although, from a geographical standpoint, the first capital of Armenia was Van). Tirac'yan, Georg. \\"Armawir.\\" Translated from Armenian by Aida Tcharkhtchian and edited by Jean- Pierre Mah√©. Revue des √âtudes Arm√©niennes. vol. 27, 1998-2000, p. 137. Movses has preserved the tradition that when King Valarsace the Parthian settled in Armavir (ca. 149 BC), he built a temple there and asked prince aspet (knight) Smbat of the Bagratuni Dynasty to give up his religion and worship idols. Movses Khorenatsi. History of Armenia, 5th Century (’Ä’°’µ’∏÷Å ’ä’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂, ‘µ ‘¥’°÷Ä). Annotated translation and commentary by Stepan Malkhasyants. Gagik Kh. Sargsyan (ed.) Yerevan: Hayastan Publishing, 1997, 2.8, pp. 128-129. . But Smbat refused to comply. Movses also relates that when King Tigranes II (whom he places on the throne from 90-36 BC), in order to take revenge on Queen Cleopatra of Egypt, sent an expedition to Palestine, he carried a great number of Jews into captivity, and settled them in Armavir and in Vardges.Movses Khorenatsi. History of Armenia, 2.16, p. 136. Note that modern historians are not convinced that Tigranes II was still alive when Cleopatra became queen of Egypt. Movses goes on to state that later Jews were transferred from Armavir to Yervandashat; and under King Artashes I, were again transferred into the new capital Artashat.Movses Khorenatsi. History of Armenia, 2.49, p. 164. When King Sapor II of Persia invaded Armenia (360-370), he led away from Artashat 30,000 Armenian and 9,000 Jewish families, the latter brought by King Tigranes from Judea, and then completely destroyed the city.Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. 1, pp. 116-17. In 591 during the reign of emperor Maurice, Armavir (then called Armaouira) and much of Armenia came under Roman administration after the Romans defeated the Sassanid Persian Empire at the battle of the Blarathon. During Antiquity, Armavir was taken by the Seleucids, Parthians, Roman Empire, Sassanids and Byzantine Empire before it was taken over by the Arabs in 645. =Medieval Armavir= Arabic sovereignty lasted until the first quarter of the ninth century. The Sajids managed this region in the 9th century. After that, the Armenian Bagratuni Dynasty returned this city under Armenian control (Bagratuni Armenia). The Byzantine Empire reconquered this region in 1045 but this region passed to Seljuk Turks in 1064, who renamed the city Sardarabad. This region was passed among Armenians and Georgians, Eldiguzids and Khwarezmid Empire after Seljuk's decline. Mongols captured this region in 1239 and founded Ilkhanid state in 1256. This region was passed to Chupanids in 1353, Jalayirids in 1357 and Kara Koyunlu in 1388. Tamerlane captured this region in 1400. Qara Yusuf retook this region in 1407 from Timurid Empire. However Shah Rukh who was a Timurid ruler captured this region in 1421 and in 1429. Jahan Shah who was a Kara Koyunlu ruler captured it in 1447. =Ottoman-Persian rule= Kara Koyunlu's sovereignty lasted until Uzun Hasan, ruler of Ak Koyunlu, conquered it in 1468. Ak Koyunlu's sovereignty lasted until 1501, Ismail I's conquest. Ismail I was founder of Safavid Dynasty. This region was temporarily occupied by Ottoman Empire in 1514, in 1534, in 1548 and in 1553. It was then conquered by Ottoman Empire in 1585 but retaken by the Safavid ruler Abbas I of Persia in 1603. Under the rule of Abbas I, the Armenians of Armavir were resettled in Persia and ancient Armavir was finally abandoned. The settlement remained abandoned until 1613, when 7 Armenian families rebuilt a new village just 1 km east of the ancient site of Armavir. It was occupied by Ottomans between 1635‚Äì1636 and 1724‚Äì1736. At the fall of the Safavid Empire, Armavir became part of the Erivan Khanate. =Russian rule= The Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) began due to Persian demand to reconquer the territories lost to Russia between 1804 and 1813. At first, the Persians repulsed the Russians from the South Caucasus in 1826. However, Russian general and commander of the Russian army, Ivan Paskevich, reconquered South Caucasus and extended its territories to include the Erivan Khanate in 1827. This region formally passed from Persian to Russian sovereignty after the Treaty of Turkmenchay in 1828. Armavir became the Sardarabad uyezd of the Armenian Oblast, which itself became the Erivan Governorate in 1840. This situation lasted until the February Revolution in 1917. =1917 revolutions and Armenian-Ottoman War= After the February Revolution, the region was under the authority of Special Transcaucasian Committee of the Russian Provisional Government and subsequently the short- lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When the TDFR was dissolved in May 1918, this region passed to First Republic of Armenia, having a conspicuous role in Armenian history due to Battle of Sardarapat. There, the Armenian forces staved off extermination and repulsed the Ottoman Army whose campaign in the Caucasus was aimed at occupying Yerevan. However, the Ottomans did occupy most of the Erivan Governorate, forcing the Armenians to sign the Treaty of Batum in June 1918. The Ottoman Army retreated after signing Armistice of Mudros at the end of 1918 and so Armavir returned to Democratic Republic of Armenia in November 1918.

By follow-up of his patients over years he demonstrated that his radical approach resulted in better outcomes than those published by contemporaries. His experience in diagnosing and treating intracranial bleeding after head injury by directed trephine resulted in the best results published in the 18th century and represent an important landmark in the management of post-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage.

Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005. During Hill's apprenticeship there was no teaching hospital in Edinburgh. He later wrote \\"There was no infirmary in Edinburgh when I served my apprenticeship there, so that I never had an opportunity of seeing a cancerous breast extirpated or any other capital operation performed till I performed them myself.\\" The first teaching hospital (the \\"Little House\\") opened opposite the head of Robertson's Close on 6 July 1729. Hill joined the Royal Navy as a surgeon in 1730. At this time naval surgeons were certified for the purpose after an examination by the Court of Examiners of the London Company of Barbers and Surgeons and many naval surgeons of the day had no other formal qualifications. Surgical practice in Dumfries In 1732 Hill returned to Dumfries where he set up in surgical practice. On 28 January 1733 he married Anne McCartney,Scotlands people. OPR Marriages. Dumfries 1733 GROS 821/00 0040 0197. whose father John owned the Blacket (or Blaiket) estate, in the Parish of Urr and it was there that they established the family home. His practice was conducted from his town house in Amisfield's Lodging in the Fleshmarket, in Dumfries.Dumfries Archive Centre. Sasine to William Thomson and Jean Johnstone. 19 March 1748. There is no known portrait of James Hill but Murray provides this description: \\"... his height being about five feet eleven inches. He continued till his death to prefer that fashion of dress that had prevailed in his youth. He wore a full wig ; and used a large staff. He was a man of dignity both of appearance and manners.\\" Between 1742 and 1775, Hill trained sixteen surgical apprentices. Of these one, Benjamin Bell (1749-1806) was to achieve international fame largely through the success of his best selling textbook A System of Surgery first published in 1783.Macintyre IMC. doi:10.4997/JRCPE.2011.211 Scientific surgeon of the enlightenment or ‚Äòplagiarist in everything‚Äô: a reappraisal of Benjamin Bell (1749‚Äì1806). Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh 2011; 41: 174‚Äì181. Hill‚Äôs early writing Hill a number of articles for the medical journal Medical Essays and Observations which had been launched in 1733 by the Society for the Improvement of Medical Knowledge, which would eventually become the Royal Society of Edinburgh.Campbell, Neil; Smellie, R. Martin S. The Royal Society of Edinburgh (1783-1983): The first two hundred years. Edinburgh: Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1983. This was one of the earliest regular medical journals and it provided a vehicle for case reports and other types of article. Hill's articles give an insight into the range of conditions with which he dealt as a surgeon-apothecary, and his understanding of their causes and treatment. He contributed a case report about a patient who was temporarily ‚Äòcured‚Äô of syphilis by a ‚Äòmercurial suffumigation‚Äô.Hill J. Violent effects of a mercurial suffumigation. Medical Essays and Observations 1747; 3: 38‚Äì41. After various therapies including laudanum, tonics, claret and Dr Plummer's pills were unsuccessful, he resorted to mercury, a recognised treatment for syphilis and fumes were thought to be the fastest mode of delivery. The symptoms eventually and she survived for more than a year. This report demonstrates that surgeons in Scotland at this time truly acted as surgeon-apothecaries. His report on two cases of hydatid disease describes one patient discharging hydatid cysts via a chronic cutaneous fistula from the liver and the other discharging cysts in the sputum. Both recovered without active treatment. Although able to diagnose hydatid disease he thought the condition arose because ‚Äòsome people have hydatic constitutions.‚ÄôHill J. An account of singular appearances from affections of the liver in two cases. Medical and Philosophical Commentaries 1774; 2: 303‚Äì308. Cases in Surgery In 1772 Hill published Cases in Surgery a summary of his life's work as a surgeon. Cases deals with the infectious disease sibbens, with cancers and with ‚Äòdisorders of the head from external violence‚Äô. Sibbens Sibbens is now known to be endemic syphilis, a Treponemal infection spread by non-sexual social contact and seen in association with deprivation, especially overcrowded living conditions, poor sanitation and malnutrition.Morton RS. The Sibbens of Scotland. Medical History 1967; 11: 374‚Äì380. Hill's account is written ‚Äòto rectify the mistakes‚Äô in the MD thesis on the topic submitted to the University of Edinburgh on the topic by Adam Freer in 1767.Freer A. De syphilide venerea; nec non de morbo sibbens dicto Quam, annuente summo numine. MD thesis, University of Edinburgh, 1767. Hill concluded that syphilis and sibbens were the same disease and that sibbens, having been introduced into a family by sexual means, could then be transmitted around the family by close non-sexual contacts, giving his own family as an example of this mode of transmission. His apprentice Benjamin Bell, who was the first to show that syphilis and gonorrhoea were different diseases, also subscribed to this mode of transmission.Bell B. A treatise on gonorrhoea virulenta and lues venerea. Edinburgh: James Watson and Co., 1793. Hill, like Freer before him and Bell after him, believed that the most successful treatment was mercury, supplemented on occasion by Peruvian bark. Hill was clear that sibbens and what he termed West Indian yaws were distinct diseases. Subsequent writers credited Hill and his physician colleague and friend Dr Ebenezer Gilchrist (bap1708-1774) with providing the most precise description of the clinical features and natural history of the disease in Scotland.Hibbert S. Historical remarks on yaws and sibbens considered as identical diseases. Edinburgh Journal of Medical Science 1826; 1: 287. Hill and Gilchrist also appreciated that the condition could be prevented by improving personal hygiene and avoiding contact with sufferers, and both men advocated these and similar preventive measures.Hill J. (1772), p. 254.Gilchrist E. An account of a very infectious distemper prevailing in many places. Essays and Observations Physical and Literary 1771; 3: 154‚Äì177. Cancers Hill's views on cancer treatment were that cancers should be radically excised aiming for cure, an approach in contrast to the mainstream view of leading European surgeons such as Alexander Monro primus, Samuel Sharp (c1709‚Äì 1778) and Henri Fran√ßois Le Dran (1685‚Äì1770) that cancers should only be minimally excised to relieve symptoms. He was able to review the outcome of surgery in 88 patients, 86 of whom recovered from the procedure and 77 of these enjoyed a normal expectation of life ‚Äòaccording to the bills of mortality.‚Äô These outcomes were much superior to the documented results of, for example, Alexander Monro primus. The cancers concerned were mainly skin cancers and a few breast cancers and Hill acknowledges the difficulty in dierentiating some cancers from benign lesions in the era before histological examination. He concludes that his results justify his recommendation that tumours, including ‚Äòthe most trifling,‚Äô should be ‚Äòcut entirely out.‚ÄôHill J. (1772), p. 49. Head injuries It is Hill's chapter entitled ‚ÄòDisorders of the head from external violence‚Äô that marks him out as a careful clinician and an innovative surgeon able to achieve remarkable outcomes by the standards of the day. Hill recorded 18 cases of head injury which he had treated over 40 years. The cause of the injury, the clinical features, his treatment and the outcome in each case are all recorded in detail. Head injuries, he asserts, have been treated in ‚Äòa much more rational manner‚Äô in the previous 15 years as a result of discoveries and ‚Äòvaluable publications‚Äô over that period. He describes the rationale for his treatment and how this changed over time as his knowledge and understanding of the problems progressively increased. He gives ‚Äòa historical view of the gradual progress of the improvements made by others as well as by myself.‚ÄôHill J. (1772), p. 85. His first patient, a five-year-old boy, sustained a depressed frontal fracture associated with an epidural haematoma (EDH). When the fracture was elevated and the haematoma drained by trepanning the skull, the boy ‚Äòimmediately recovered his senses‚Äô but after some days the ‚Äòstupor‚Äô returned, indicating that 'some matter was lodged under the meninges‚Äô. Hill made a cruciate incision in the meninges to drain the haematoma with beneficial effect. Ganz regarded this as the first ever description of a lucid interval associated with a subdural haematoma.Ganz JC. The lucid interval associated with epidural bleeding: evolving understanding. Journal of Neurosurgery 2013; 118: 739. This case also demonstrates Hill's understanding of the clinical features of cerebral compression: ‚ÄòThe smallest compression brought on a stupor, a low intermittent pulse, nausea, vomiting and sometimes convulsive twitches.‚Äô From case 3 onwards he avoided dressings which compressed the trepanned area.Hill J. (1772), p. 202. In case 3 he again relieved the features of cerebral compression by a trepan with drainage of an EDH. In case 5 drainage of a large EDH resulted in restoration of consciousness and resolution of a right sided weakness. His account of this case also shows that he appreciated the concept that paralysis on one side of the body indicated compression on the opposite side of the brain. This patient, who crucially did not have a fracture, demonstrates Hill's appreciation that it was injury to the brain that caused symptoms rather than the fracture itself. Percival Pott (1714‚Äì1788) by contrast would only operate if a fracture were present. Hill's understanding of concepts of cerebral compression is demonstrated further by his use of the word ‚Äòcompression‚Äô and by his recording of cerebral pulsation or tension in all but one of the operations described. Both of his patients who exhibited poor or absent cerebral pulsation had sustained primary cerebral damage and both died. Hill more than any other eighteenth century writer appreciated the importance of cerebral pulsation as an indicator of cerebral health. Further evidence of his understanding of the need to decompress where possible is shown by his use of the technique of relieving pressure by shaving off cerebral hernias caused by raised intracranial pressure, a technique he learned from the writing of Henri Francois Le Dran (1685‚Äì1770). Hill's outcomes in treating patients with head injury compares favourably with those of his contemporaries with a mortality rate of 25%, much lower than that of le Dran (57%) or Percival Pott (51%). This was the result of Hill's appreciation of the concept of cerebral compression and his better understanding of the indication for and location of the trephine. Hill's work was recognised and was cited by the influential Edinburgh physician John Abercrombie(1780‚Äì1844),Abercrombie J.

He advanced the understanding of the treatment of head injury by showing that epidural and subdural haematoma could be recognised from clinical features and successfully treated by trepan and surgical drainage to relieve compression. He appreciated the importance of cerebral compression and the significance of unilateral limb weakness in lateralising intracranial bleeding and determining on which side to operate.

He was originally from Ja√©n. Chronicler Antonio de Remesal recorded that de Vico studied theology in √öbeda and finished his studies in the San Esteban convent in Salamanca. Domingo de Vico set out from Spain on 9 July 1544 with a group led by Bartolom√© de las Casas in an effort to enforce the New Laws that had been issued in 1542 to protect the indigenous inhabitants of the Spanish colonies from overexploitation by the encomenderos. De Vico was the prior of Cob√°n from 1554 until his death in 1555. He was charged with the evangelisation of the Lakandon and Acala Ch'ol in the unconquered area that was then referred to by the Spanish as the Tierra de Guerra (\\"Land of War\\"), and also as Verapaz. Works In 1544, Francisco Marroqu√≠n, bishop of Guatemala, charged Domingo de Vico with producing a treatise upon Indian idolatry. The work contained instructions to Dominicans upon how to use indigenous beliefs in their sermons in Chiapas and Guatemala. It was entitled Tratado de √≠dolos (\\"Treatment of Idols\\"). His best known written work is his Theologia Indorum, of which eleven copies survive, divided between the Biblioth√®que nationale in Paris (5 copies) and the Firestone Library of Princeton University, New Jersey (6 copies). Among the copies in France are translations made in the Tzutuhil, K'iche' and Kaqchikel languages. During his short time in Guatemala before his death, he is believed to have compiled the Vocabulario de la lengua cakchiquel (\\"Vocabulary of the Kaqchikel language\\"). De Vico learnt the Ch‚Äôol language and was able to preach to the Lakandon and Acala in their own language. De Vico wrote some religious poems in Kaqchikel upon the Acts of the Apostles and the Passion of Christ. A work entitled Los Proverbios de Salom√≥n, las Ep√≠stolas y los Evangelios de todo el a√±o, en lengua mexicana (\\"The Proverbs of Solomon, the Epistles and Gospels for the whole year, in the Mexican tongue\\") was prevented from being published by the Spanish Inquisition. Death In 1555, Domingo de Vico and his companion Andr√©s L√≥pez were killed by the Acala and their Lakandon allies. De Vico, who had established a small missionary church in San Marcos (in what is now Alta Verapaz, Guatemala), had offended the local Maya ruler by repeatedly scolding him for taking several wives. The indigenous leader shot the friar through the throat with an arrow; the angry natives then sacrificed him by cutting open his chest and extracting his heart. His corpse was then decapitated; the natives carried off his head as a trophy, which was never recovered by the Spanish. In retaliation, the Spanish rounded up 260 Ch'ol in 1559, hanged 80 and branded the rest as slaves.

In the last few decades, drug addiction has increased exponentially in Pakistan. Most of the illegal drugs come from the neighbouring Afghanistan. According to the UN estimate few million people in the country are drug users. Cannabis is the most used drug. The rate of injection drug abuse has also increased significantly in Pakistan, sparking fears of an HIV epidemic. Although, the increase in the problem has been alarming, the government response has been minimal at best. Few programs are active in the country to help drug addicts and smuggling and availability of the drugs in the country has gone almost unchecked. Anti-Narcotics Force is the government agency responsible for tackling drug smuggling and use within Pakistan. Extent of the problem According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Pakistan has 6.7 million drug users. More than 4 million of these are addicts, amongst the highest number for any country in the world. Abuse of cannabis and heroin is rife in the country and the drugs are extremely cheap and easy to get. Most of the drugs come from Afghanistan, the country that is responsible for at least 75% of the world's heroin. UNODC calculates that more than 800,000 Pakistanis aged between 15 and 64 use heroin regularly. It is also estimated that up to 44 tons of processed heroin are consumed annually in Pakistan. A further 110 tons of heroin and morphine from neighboring Afghanistan are trafficked through Pakistan to international markets. Furthermore, Pakistan's illegal drug trade is believed to generate up to $2 billion a year. The number of drug (Cannabis) users is particularly high in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, which neighbors Afghanistan, where close to 11 percent of the population is hooked on drugs (mainly Cannabis) . In 2013, the number of drug users in Balochistan was 280,000. In Pakistan, the total number of drug addicts as per a UN report is 7.6 million, where 78% are male while the rest 22% are female. The number of these addicts is increasing at the rate of 40,000 per year making Pakistan one of the most drug affected countries in the world. Drug Usage Is Increasing day by day. In Pakistan more than 800,000 people are addicted to drugs. The number of injection drug users in Punjab has also increased sharply in the recent years. In 2007, Pakistan had an estimated 90,000 injecting drug users but the number had risen to around 500,000 by 2014. This increase has also been accompanied by an increase in HIV positivity. According to research, in 2005, about 11 percent of Pakistani drug users were HIV positive. That number had risen to 40 percent in 2011. Treatment and Specialist intervention According to the survey report, treatment and specialist interventions were in short supply. During the period under review, treatment was available to less than 30,000 drug users. The Anti-Narcotics Force is a federal executive bureau of the Government of Pakistan, tasked with combating the drug smuggling and use within Pakistan.

This article refers to the stained glass in the Anglican cathedral, rather than the Roman Catholic Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. West window of Liverpool Cathedral The stained glass in Liverpool Cathedral all dates from the 20th century. The designs were planned by a committee working in conjunction with the architect of the cathedral, Giles Gilbert Scott, with the intention of forming an integrated scheme throughout the cathedral. A number of stained glass designers were involved in the scheme, but the major contributors came from James Powell and Sons (Whitefriars Glass), in particular J. W. Brown, James Hogan, and Carl Edwards. The subjects portrayed in the windows are numerous and diverse. They include scenes and characters from the Old and New Testaments, evangelists, church fathers, saints, and laymen, some famous, others more humble. The windows in the Lady Chapel celebrate the part that women have played in Christianity. The designs in the windows at the ends of the cathedral are based on canticles, the east window on the Te Deum laudamus, and the west window on the Benedicite. The earlier designs are dark, but the later windows are much brighter and more colourful. Much of the glass was damaged by bombing in the Second World War. The windows replacing them were based on the originals, but often using simpler and more colourful designs. History The foundation stone of Liverpool Cathedral was laid on 19 July 1904, and it was completed in 1979. Giles Gilbert Scott won the competition to design the cathedral, and a Stained Glass Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Frederick Radcliffe was established to organise the design of the stained glass in the windows. The architect worked with the committee initially to decide on \\"the main lines on which the design of the window should be based and the extent to which is to be of clear glass or coloured\\".Sir Frederick Radcliffe quoted by Kennerley (1991) p. 123 The committee then decided on the subjects to be depicted and, in discussion with the stained glass artist, agreed on the details of the design; Scott was concerned from the outset that \\"the windows should not detract from the architecture\\". The committee continued to work during the construction of the cathedral under a series of chairmen, whose discussions were often very detailed. The oldest windows in the cathedral are dark in colour, but with changes in manufacturing techniques from the 1930s, the later windows are much brighter and more colourful. Description =Lady Chapel= \\"Noble Women\\" window The Lady Chapel was the earliest part of the cathedral to be built. There was a competition in 1907 to design the windows, which was won by James Powell and Sons, who commissioned J. W. Brown as designer. Brown had worked for Powell's until 1886 and then worked freelance, but from 1891 he was \\"the firm's preferred designer for prestigious projects\\". As the chapel is dedicated to St Mary, they are based on the role that women have played in the history of Christianity. Running through all the windows is a scroll containing the words of the Magnificat. On the north side are holy women from the British Isles, and on the south side are mainly saints commemorated in the Prayer Book. The Lady Chapel was damaged by bombing on 6 September 1940, and all the glass had to be replaced. The work was undertaken by James Hogan, who used simplified adaptations of the original designs. Following Hogan's death in 1948 the work was continued by Carl Edwards; the resulting windows are much brighter than the originals. The windows at the rear of the chapel and on the staircase were donated by the Girls' Friendly Society, and were designed by Brown. Known as the \\"Noble Women\\" windows, they depict women who have made major contributions to society, including Elizabeth Fry, Grace Darling, and Kitty Wilkinson. =Ambulatory and Chapter House= The four windows in the ambulatory are the only designs in the cathedral by Burlison and Grylls, each depicting two saints from a nation of the British Isles. On the steps leading to the Chapter House is the only window in the cathedral by C. E. Kempe and Company. It commemorates the Woodward family, who were local corn merchants between 1803 and 1915, and includes biblical references to corn and harvest. The Chapter House was donated by local Freemasons as a memorial to their members lost in the First World War. The windows were made by Morris & Co. and designed by Henry Dearle, reflecting the interests and traditions of the Freemasons. The windows were damaged in the Second World War and repaired by James Powell and Sons. =East window= East window The east window, designed by Brown, dominates the east end of the cathedral, rising above the reredos, and is based on the theme of the Te Deum laudamus. At the top of the window is the risen Christ, and around and below are members of the heavenly choir. Under this are four lancet windows, each representing one of the communities praising God. The left window represents 'the company of the apostles', with Saint Raphael at the top. Below are fourteen figures; the twelve apostles, excluding Judas Iscariot but including Saint Matthias, with Saint Paul and Saint Barnabas. The next window commemorates 'the goodly fellowship of the apostles'. At the top is Saint Michael, with fifteen figures below. These include Isaiah, Elijah, John the Baptist, Saint Athanasius, Saint Augustine, John Wycliffe, Thomas Cranmer, and John Wesley. The third window represents 'the noble army of martyrs', with Archangel Gabriel at the top. Below are fifteen Christian martyrs, starting with Saint Stephen. Underneath are Zechariah and the Holy Innocents, Saint Alban, Saint Oswald, and Saint Boniface. At the bottom are figures representing martyrs from Madagascar, Africa, Melanesia, and China. The lancet window on the right commemorates 'the holy church throughout all the world', with an angel, possibly Uriel, at the top. Underneath are various representations: King Alfred as a warrior, Dante as a poet, Fra Angelico as a painter, the musician J. S. Bach, the scientist Isaac Newton, and the physician Thomas Linacre. Other figures commemorate law, commerce, scholarship, and architecture. Also included are Christopher Columbus and Francis Drake. =Choir aisles= There are four main windows in the choir aisles, two on each side, and they are concerned with the four Gospels. The windows on the north side are original, but those on the south side were destroyed by bombing and were renewed. In the renewal, the central mullion of these windows was widened, and the design of the glass was simplified and made more vibrant. Each window, known by its predominant colour, shows the author of the gospel at the top with his symbol. Below are figures linked with the subject matter of the gospel. The windows on the north side are by Brown, the left window, the Sapphire window, represents Saint Matthew and shows a depiction of the Nativity on one side, and the Epiphany on the other. The 'Gold' window commemorates Saint Luke and shows the Feeding of the Five thousand, and the Raising of Jairus' daughter. The windows on the south side are by Hogan. The Ruby window represents Saint John and includes biblical scenes together with the Old Testament figures of Daniel, Ezekiel, Jonah, and Job. Saint Mark is in the Emerald window, with scenes of the Baptism of Jesus and the Transfiguration. Also included are the disciples Saint Simon and Saint Andrew, and the Old Testament figures, Noah, Zechariah, Enoch, and Malachi. At the east ends of the aisles are rose windows by Brown. The window in the north aisle relates to \\"journeys across the sea and undertaken in faith\\", namely Moses crossing the Red Sea, Saint Paul's journey to Rome, Saint Columba planting a cross on Iona, and missionaries of the Melanesian Mission landing in the Solomon Islands. The images in the rose window in the south aisle show instances of God's power being demonstrated through water, namely Noah holding a model of the ark, Jesus calming the disciples in a storm, Jesus walking on water, and Saint Paul after his shipwreck in Malta. =Central space= Window in the central space The windows on the north and south sides of the central space were designed by Hogan; each includes three tall lancet windows topped by a rose window. The area of glass in each window is , the sill is above the level of the floor, and the top of the rose window is above floor level. The north window shows figures and themes from the Old Testament, with Moses with the Ten Commandments in the rose window. Below the figures include Adam and Eve, Noah, Solomon, prophets, and important characters from Israelite history. The south window depicts characters and scenes from the New Testament. The Holy Trinity is depicted in the rose window, below which are depictions of events including the Crucifixion and the Ascension, together with a variety of saints. =Transepts= The War Memorial Chapel forming the northeast transept has as its themes the aftermath of the First World War, sacrifice and the risen life. The design of its window was started by Brown and completed by Hogan. It shows suffering and death, including a depiction of the Crucifixion. The original window by Brown was destroyed by bombing; the window replacing it shows Christ with his arms outstretched in welcome at the top. Below are scenes of acts of compassion, including figures such as Saint Francis. The southwest transept forms the baptistry, and its window by Herbert Hendrie of Whitefriars depicts salvation, particularly through water and healing. The window in the northwest transept has the theme of the Church and the State. =Nave aisles= The six windows in the nave aisles deal with historical subjects, all but one designed by Carl Edwards. The exception is the west window on the south side, designed by William Wilson. This is the Bishops' Window, and includes Nicholas Ridley, Hugh Latimer, and William Temple. The middle window is the Parsons' Window, and depicts notable clergymen including Thomas Arnold (with a rugby ball), Revd Peter Green, and Revd W. Farquhar Hook. The Layman's Window includes tradesmen who worked on building the cathedral, members of the committees responsible, and a depiction of Giles Gilbert Scott. The Musicians' Window contains composers, performers, and conductors who have played a part in the development of Anglican church music. The Hymnologists' Window includes hymn writers such as C. F. Alexander and Cecil Spring Rice. Finally there is the Scholars' Window, with theologians, philosophers, and biblical scholars. In the corner is the Very Revd Frederick Dwelly, the first dean of the cathedral. =West window= Following Scott's death in 1960 it was decided to change the design of the west end of the cathedral, which had consisted of a small rose window and an elaborate porch. Frederick Thomas and Roger Pinkney, who had both worked with Scott, produced a simplified design that gave the opportunity for a large west window. Created by Carl Edwards and based on the theme of the Benedicite, the window consists of a round-headed window at the top, and three tall lancet windows below. It covers an area of , each lancet window being more than high. Revd Noel Vincent, the former canon treasurer of the cathedral, states that the top part of the window represents \\"the risen Christ in glory looking down ... in compassion on the world\\", and the images beneath depict \\"all creation united in peace\\".

It is approximately west of Halls Creek and south of Warmun, and occupies an area of . It bisects the watershed of the Fitzroy River and Ord Rivers. Moola Bulla was established in 1910 as a government-run station for the punishment of Aboriginal people, and remains an area that indigenous peoples avoid. With increasingly bloody conflict between Aborigines and pastoralists, it was hoped that opening a ration station would reduce the need for Aborigines to kill livestock for food, and that they could instead be trained for work on other cattle stations. The station was acquired for ¬£18,061, and a manager and staff were appointed. The station was proclaimed a reserve and used as a camping ground for the local Aboriginal peoples, who were free to come and go as they pleased. The property's name is Aboriginal [which language?] for meat plenty. By 1912, the property carried a herd of approximately 12,000 head of cattle, and the following year turned off 650 head and slaughtered 400 head for their own consumption. In 1916, it occupied an area of , about long and wide. The homestead was stocked with 13,000 head of cattle and 500 head of horses in 1916. In 1917 the property recorded over rain, far above the average of the previous few years and guaranteeing a good next season. By 1920 the property occupied an area of and was stocked with 14,000 cattle. Employees of the station numbered close to 260, of which seven were of European descent. Aboriginal people such as young artist Daisy Andrews and her family, originally from the Walmajarri desert tribe, were sent to work at the station by authorities to prevent them from returning to their former tribal lands. In 1955, the state government sold the station to Queensland pastoralist Allan Goldman for ¬£100,000. When Goldman bought Moola Bulla station, its 200 Aboriginal residents were given 24 hours to leave, and Moola Bulla sent truckloads of them to United Aborigines Mission at Fitzroy Crossing.Westralian gems for Christ's crown by S Preston Walker, 2001, p.61 Goldman sold the station two years later, for ¬£150,000, to a syndicate of investors including Northern Territory grazier H. J. Mortimer. Peter Camm had been poised to buy the station, but the deal fell through when he was charged with cattle theft. The property was then acquired in 2001 by a syndicate of investors, including Andrew Cranswick, for 18 million. In 2006, the syndicate sold it to agribusiness company Great Southern Group for an estimated 30 million. Following Great Southern Group's 2009 collapse, Moola Bulla was sold in 2010 to its former part-owner, the South African Western Australian Pastoral Company (also owner of Beefwood Park) for 20 million, with 25,000 head of cattle. In December 2014, the pastoral lease, along with Mt. Amhurst, Beefwood Park and Shamrock Stations, was to become part of Gina Rinehart's Liveringa Station Beef company, pending approval of higher stock numbers by the Western Australian Pastoral Board. However, the deal fell through and the property is still owned by SAWA.

Native materials were used in construction, such as wood, stone and copper. The largest room in the venue is the \\"Espacio Tronador\\", which can seat almost 1,200 spectators. The auditorium is made completely of wood, and the spaces are outlined by the curved lines of the stage, rows of seats and high balconies.

The name of the city is derived from Iranian languages and means the \\"joy of Arta\\". Founded by King Artaxias I in 176 BC, Artaxata served as the capital of the Kingdom of Armenia from 185 BC until 120 AD, and was known as the \\"Vostan Hayots\\" (\\"court/seal of the Armenians\\"). History =Antiquity= King Artashes I founded Artashat in 176 BC in the Vostan Hayots canton within the historical province of Ayrarat, at the point where Araks river was joined by Metsamor river during that ancient eras, near the heights of Khor Virap. The story of the foundation is given by the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi of the fifth century: \\"Artashes traveled to the location of the confluence of the Yeraskh and Metsamor [rivers] and taking a liking to the position of the hills [adjacent to Mount Ararat], he chose it as the location of his new city, naming it after himself.\\" Movses Khorenatsi. ’Ä’°’µ’∏÷Å ’ä’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂, ‘µ ‘¥’°÷Ä [History of Armenia, Fifth Century]. Annotated translation and commentary by Stepan Malkhasyants. Gagik Sargsyan (ed.) Yerevan: Hayastan Publishing, 1997, 2.49, p. 164. . According to the accounts given by Greek historians Plutarch and Strabo, Artashat is said to have been chosen and developed on the advice of the Carthaginian general Hannibal: However, modern historians argue that there is no direct evidence to support the above.Bournoutian, George A. (2006). A Concise History of the Armenian People: From Ancient Times to the Present. Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda, p. 29. . Some sources have also indicated that Artashes built his city upon the remains of an old Urartian settlement. Strabo and Plutarch describe Artashat as a large and beautiful city and call it the \\"Armenian Carthage\\". A focal point of Hellenistic culture, Armenia's first theatre was built here. Movses Khorenatsi points that in addition to numerous copper pagan statues of the gods and goddesses of Anahit, Artemis and Tir brought from the religious center of Bagaran and other regions to the city, Jews from the former Armenian capital of Armavir were relocated to Artashat.Movses Khorenatsi. History of Armenia, 2.49, p. 164. Artashes also built a citadel (which was later named Khor Virap and gained prominence as the location where Gregory the Illuminator was to be imprisoned by Tiridates III of Armenia) and added other fortifications, including a moat.Garso√Øan, Nina. \\"The Emergence of Armenia\\" in The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I, The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1997, p. 49. . Given the city's strategic position on the Araks valley, Artashat soon became a center of bustling economic activity and thriving international trade, linking Persia and Mesopotamia with the Caucasus and Asia Minor. Its economic wealth can be gauged in the numerous bathhouses, markets, workshops administrative buildings that sprang up during the reign of Artashes I. The city had its own treasury and customs. The amphitheater of Artashat was built during the reign of king Artavasdes II (55-34 BC). The remains of the huge walls surrounding the city built by King Artashes I could be found in the area. =Wars against Romans and Persians= Model of the Acropolis of Artaxata Aras river During the reign of Tigranes II, the Armenian kingdom expanded and conquered many territories in the south and west, ultimately reaching the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the remoteness of Artashat in the greater context of the empire, Tigranes built a new capital called Tigranocerta. However, in 69 the Roman general Lucullus invaded Armenia, defeated Tigranes' forces at the outskirts of Tigranocerta, and sacked the new capital. As the harassed Roman forces continued to move northeast in pursuit of the Armenian king, a second prominent battle took place, this time at Artashat where, according to Roman sources, Tigranes II was defeated once again. Artashat was restored as capital of Armenia in 60 B.C. However, the city remained a hotly contested military target for the next two centuries. It was occupied by Capadocian legions under the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, who razed it to the ground in 59 AD as part of the first, short- lived, Roman conquest of Armenia. After Emperor Nero recognized Tiridates I as king of Armenia in 66, he granted him 50 million sesterces and sent architects and construction experts to help in the reconstruction of the ruined city. The city was temporarily renamed Neronia, in honor of its sponsor, Nero. thumb Artashat remained the capital of Armenia until 120 when the see of power was moved to Vagharshapat during the reign of Vologases I (Vagharsh I) 117/8‚Äì144. After his death, the Romans led by Statius Priscus invaded Armenia and destroyed Artashat in 162 A.D. Archaeological excavations conducted during the Soviet era uncovered a Latin inscription bearing the full titles of the Emperor Trajan that was probably inscribed upon the governor's palace, dating back to the first quarter of the second century. Artashat remained one of the principal political and cultural centres of Armenia until 369 when it was thoroughly destroyed by the Sassanid Persian invading army of king Shapur II. In 449, just prior to the Battle of Avarayr, the city witnessed the gathering of the Artashat Council, where the political and religious leaders of Christian Armenia gathered to discuss the threats of the Sassanid king Yazdegerd II. However, after losing its status as a capital to Vagharshapat and later Dvin, Artashat gradually lost its significance, though it continued to be a notable settlement for centuries. In 587 during the reign of emperor Maurice, Artashat and much of Armenia came under Roman administration after the Romans defeated the Sassanid Persian Empire at the battle of the Blarathon. The exact location of ancient Artashat was identified during the 1920s, with archaeological excavations beginning in 1970. The archaeological site is south of the modern city of Artashat, near the monastery of Khor Virap. =Soviet period and independence= The modern town of Artashat was founded by the Soviet government in 1945, 8 km northwest of the ancient city, within the Armenian SSR. It was given the status of an urban community with the merger of three villages, Upper Ghamarlu, Lower Ghamarlu, and Narvezlu. The town grew gradually as an industrial hub during the Soviet period, mainly in the sphere of food-processing and building materials production. In 1995, with the new law of the territorial administration of the Republic of Armenia, Artashat became the provincial centre of the newly created Ararat Province.

In general, it exists in contrast to an acceptance of the necessity of war for national defense. Pacifist ideas In early America religious groups such as the Brethren, Mennonites, and Quakers disseminated \\"antiwar sentiments...fostered by a growing colonial aversion to the carnage of the European imperial wars.\\" In the 1930s influential theologian Reinhold Niebuhr rejected overly idealist pacifism as \\"perverse sentimentality,\\" in favor of just war. In contrast to pacifism based on religious beliefs, some in the U.S. have opposed violent conflict on economic grounds, or for other practical, non-religious reasons.

Two future Admirals, John Reynolds and Hugh Palliser, served aboard Aldborough as midshipmen at the commencement of their naval careers.  Naval career Aldborough was commissioned in March 1727 and assigned to survey work in the British West Indies. Her first captain was Edward Baker, who remained in command until early 1729 when he was replaced by John Gascoigne. The future Admiral John Reynolds served under Gascoigne's command as one of Aldboroughs midshipmen from 1729 to 1734. After seven years in the West Indies the ship was returned to Deptford Dockyard in 1734 for refit and repair. Aboard as passengers for this voyage were James Oglethorpe, the founder of the colony of Georgia, and a delegation of Cherokee sent to meet with the British Government. Aldboroughs years in tropical waters had taken their toll with extensive work required to restore her hull and timbers. Refitting continued until June 1735 at a cost of ¬£5,417, more than two thirds of her original construction expense of ¬£7,461.Winfield 2007, p. 249 Temporarily restored to seaworthiness, Aldborough was assigned to the command of Captain Nicholas Robinson and transferred to coastal patrol in the English Channel and North Sea. Robinson's 11-year-old nephew Hugh Palliser was also signed aboard as a midshipman from 1735. The ship remained in poor condition despite her recent refit, and was paid off for further repair in 1736. Aldborough was refitted in 1737 as a fireship of 8 guns and 55 crew. In 1738 this designation was reversed, with Aldborough restored to the Navy lists as a 20-gun sixth rate and assigned to Mediterranean service under Captain George Pocock. She was immediately deployed as a privateer hunter, capturing a Spanish barque on 28 January 1739 and taking part in the capture of two more vessels in June. She was less successful in 1740, cruising for several weeks off the coast of Malta without encountering enemy craft. In January 1741 she was part of the British fleet at Port Mahon off the coast of Spain. Fate Aldborough was broken up at Deptford Dockyard on 31 March 1742, in accordance with Admiralty orders that another ship of the same name be constructed in her place.

In 2013 she won the award of \\"Sex Worker of the Year\\" at the Sexual Freedom Awards where she is now a resident judge. In 2014 she took up politics, campaigning for sexual freedom as an independent candidate in the Clacton and Rochester and Strood by-elections. Career Rose began her career in the sex industry at the age of 17 where she took part in a dominatrix-themed photoshoot. Rose married and became the mother of two children, one elder son and one younger daughter. She became a teacher, but after separating from her partner she moved to Exeter, Devon in 2003 and decided to become an escort. She became a vocal supporter of the sex industry. Rose also said that she wants to become Britain's number one sex guru. In 2013 she won the \\"British Erotic Award for Sex Worker of the Year\\". In 2014 she appeared in the Channel 4 documentary Love for Sale, a series presented by Rupert Everett. Following this appearance Rose claimed she was the victim of a hate campaign, which resulted in her landlord evicting her and having to move to London. Rose claimed: \\"What other reason would it be apart from my profession? I don't do any harm, I don't make noise and I am just normal.\\" In 2015 she appeared on an edition of BBC Two's The Daily Politics in which she argued for the decriminalisation of brothels in the United Kingdom. In 2017 she took part in Things Sex Workers are Tired of Hearing, a sketch for the online BBC channel BBC Three, believing it would help viewers understand the reality of being a sex worker. However, the programme led to criticism from some viewers, who accused Rose of \\"glamourizing\\" her profession. It also led to accusations on social media against Rose's partner, a builder and author of erotic literature, that he was profiting from her earnings. Rose and her partner both refuted these allegations. In 2015 Rose performed in a run of The Sex Workers' Opera at London's Pleasance Theatre. The show, which included elements of opera, hip hop and poetry to tell women's stories, went on its first UK tour in 2017. Politics In 2014 Rose began to stand in political elections, campaigning for sexual freedom. She has stood as an independent candidate, but the Sexual Freedom Coalition lists her as standing for the \\"Sexual Freedom Party\\". Rose first stood in the Clacton by-election on 9 October 2014. Out of eight candidates she finished last, taking 56 votes (0.16% of the vote). Rose then stood in the Rochester and Strood by-election. Out of thirteen candidates Rose finished eleventh, taking 43 votes (0.11%). On 12 December 2014, Rose organised a protest against the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 amendment to the Communications Act 2003. One of the practices banned was facesitting, so part of the protest was a mass facesitting with people singing \\"Sit on My Face\\" by Monty Python. On 1 March 2015 she organised a public spanking event at Manchester's Sackville Gardens, also as a protest against the legislation. In 2016 Rose gave evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, which was looking at the way sex work is treated by legislation. The Committee backed calls to change the rules regarding brothel-keeping and completely decriminalise sex work, though no legislation has been brought before Parliament to act on their recommendations.

He held the world record in the 440 yd hurdles from 1915 to 1920, and he won the event the first two times it was contested at the United States championships. Biography Meanix became a track athlete at the English High School in Boston, Massachusetts. He subsequently studied at Colby College and Harvard. At first, he did not specialize in any one event, but competed in the sprints, hurdles and the shot put. Representing the Boston A. A., Meanix won the hurdles at the 1914 United States championships, becoming the inaugural champion; while the championships had been held since 1876, this was the first time the 440 yd hurdles had been contested. His winning time of 57.8 seconds was a new American record, although Charles Bacon had run the slightly shorter 400 m hurdles in 55.0, equivalent to 55.3‚Äì55.4 for the imperial distance; the world record for the imperial hurdles was 56.8, held by Britain's G. R. L. Anderson. On July 16, 1915 Meanix ran the 440 yd hurdles in 54.6 at Cambridge, Massachusetts, improving Anderson's world record by more than two seconds and also breaking Bacon's time. He set his record in the same meet where Norman Taber surpassed Walter George's mile world record from 1886. This time would remain Meanix's best, and stood as a world record until John Norton ran 54.2 in 1920. Meanix won the 1915 national championship in an even faster time, 52.6, but that race was held on a straight track and was wind-aided, making the time statistically invalid. His most serious rival in that race was August Muenter, who had earlier run 53.6 in similar conditions, but he fell at the ninth hurdle while trailing Meanix. In 1916 Meanix was challenged as the leading American by Walter Hummel, who defeated him by two yards at the national championships in the meeting record time of 54.8. The following week Meanix beat him in a rematch, running 55.0, but Hummel was still selected for the AAU's top All-American team of the year. At the 1917 Penn Relays Meanix was defeated by another newcomer, Floyd Smart, in 55.2; the Harvard Crimson felt the use of 2 ft 6 in (76.2 cm) hurdles, instead of the usual hurdles, had favored Smart, but he beat Meanix again at the national championships, where regular hurdles were used. Meanix took second, ahead of Hummel. With America entering World War I, Meanix enlisted in the United States Army in November 1917. He was discharged as a 1st Lieutenant in May 1919 and resumed hurdling, taking second behind Smart at the 1919 national championships. Meanix competed in the 1920 United States Olympic Trials, but was eliminated in the semi-finals and failed to qualify for the Olympic team; instead, he (and Smart, who had also failed to qualify) represented the United States in post-Olympic meets against teams from France, Sweden and the British Empire. In 1923 Meanix was appointed as Tufts College's track and field coach. He later returned to his former high school, the English High School, and had a long career there as a military drill instructor. During World War II Meanix returned to active Army service, now with the rank of major, and commanded an Army Specialized Training Unit at Northwestern University. He retired from the Army in 1946 as a lieutenant colonel. Legacy Meanix was inducted in the English High School's Hall of Fame in 1987.

Dawn Lerner is a fictional character from the American television series The Walking Dead portrayed by Christine Woods. She is an original character to the show and has no counterpart in the comic book series of the same name. Television series =Fictional character biography= Season 5 In the episode \\"Slabtown\\", officer Dawn Lerner and doctor Steven Edwards introduce themselves to Beth when she wakes up in Grady Memorial Hospital. Dawn explains that her officers found Beth unconscious on the side of a road, surrounded by \\"rotters\\", and they saved her life. Dawn tells Beth that as a rule of the hospital, she must repay them with labor, and assigns Beth to Dr. Edwards as a nurse. She and Dr. Edwards are called to tend to a new patient, Gavin. Dr. Edwards immediately writes Gavin off as a lost cause, but Dawn insists he try to save him. Later, Beth and Dr. Edwards must treat a worker, Joan, who was bitten while attempting to escape the hospital. Despite Joan's pleas to be allowed to die, Dawn orders Dr. Edwards to amputate Joan's arm to prevent the infection from spreading. Dr. Edwards tells Beth to give Gavin a dose of Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, which kills him. An angry Dawn demands to know what happened, and Noah lies and takes the blame. Dawn has Noah beaten as a punishment. Dawn later warns Beth that she knew Noah was lying, but was forced to make an example of him for the greater good. Dawn later confronts Beth after the escape of Noah and the deaths of Joan and Gorman. Beth tells Dawn that the two deaths were the result of the hospital's corrupt regime, and that nobody is coming to rescue them. Dawn strikes Beth in anger. In the episode \\"Crossed\\", Dawn is in a heated discussion with officer O'Donnell over their inability to find Noah. Beth listens in as the subject turns to Carol, who had been hit by a car and brought to the hospital. O'Donnell feels she is a lost cause, and keeping her alive is waste of resources. Beth intervenes, and an angry Dawn instructs the O'Donnell to take Carol off life support. When O'Donnell leaves, Dawn chastises Beth for forcing her hand, but gives her the key to the drug locker so she can save Carol. Dawn admits that she respects her, as Beth shows a strength Dawn didn't think she possessed. In the episode \\"Coda\\", order starts to break down when officers Lamson, Shepherd, and Licari (who have been taken captive by Rick's group) fail to respond to Dawn's attempts to communicate with them, and others soon begin to lose faith in Dawn's leadership. Officer O'Donnell confronts Dawn, threatening to remove her as leader. The two get into a fight, resulting in O'Donnell's death when Beth pushes him down the elevator shaft. Beth later accuses Dawn of manipulating her into eliminating Gorman and O'Donnell, who were threats to Dawn's position, and again vows to escape. Dawn denies the accusation, and promises to remember Beth's support. After Rick proposes the trade of Shepherd and Licari for Beth and Carol to two other officers, Rick's group meets Dawn and her officers at the hospital. As Beth packs up, she hides a pair of scissors in her cast. The trade initially goes smoothly, but Dawn adds a condition at the last second, demanding Rick to hand over Noah. Rick and Beth are reluctant, but Noah agrees so as to prevent bloodshed. Beth goes to give him a hug, but as she does so, Dawn makes a gloating comment in reference to her earlier conversation with Beth. Angered, Beth faces Dawn and icily tells her \\"I get it now.\\" With that, she stabs Dawn in the shoulder with the scissors. Caught off guard, Dawn reflexively fires her gun straight into Beth's head, killing her instantly. Despite her own shock and pleas for mercy, a distraught Daryl immediately pulls out his own gun and shoots Dawn in the head, killing her as well. Development and reception Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club found Dawn \\"irritating\\", and said, \\"nothing in the performance or script stops her from being a one-note irritant.\\" Kelsea Stahler of Bustle felt that killing Dawn in the episode \\"Coda\\" wasted \\"a perfectly good season 5 villain\\", which represented a \\"missed opportunity\\" to have a female character be the \\"big bad\\" and to have the narrative for the rest of the season be based on a conflict between two women (Dawn and Beth). Rob Bricken of io9, in addition to calling the plot one of the \\"worst of season 5\\" and the story \\"more laughable than moving\\", also criticized the deaths of Dawn and Beth as a \\"wasted opportunity\\". He cited the \\"childish, ridiculous logic\\" Dawn had for demanding Noah back even though she had \\"zero leverage\\" and Beth's \\"inexplicable, dumb decision\\" to stab Dawn in the shoulder. He wondered: > So what the hell was [Beth] trying to do? Get Dawn killed indirectly? Free > the hospital from her idiotic non-control? Commit suicide by idiot? Whatever > she was trying to accomplish ‚Äî presumably getting rid of Dawn in some manner > ‚Äî weren't there many, many other ways to do it that didn't involve her > almost certainly getting shot or potentially turning the hostage trade into > a bloodbath? We'll never know, because Beth is dead.

She was named Catharina, but came to prefer Toto, her childhood nickname after her father's favourite horse. Her only sibling, Henry, nicknamed Ody Koopman (1902‚Äì1949), became a successful tennis player. Koopman left Java in 1920 to attend a boarding school in the Netherlands where she developed a talent for languages and became fluent in English, French, German and Italian. After a year at an English finishing school, she moved to Paris to work as a model. In Paris, Koopman worked as a house model for Coco Chanel but quit after only six months. She worked for the designers Rochas, Mainbocher and Madeleine Vionnet, appeared regularly in Vogue Paris and was photographed by Edward Steichen and George Hoyningen-Huene. Koopman had a small part in the film The Private Life of Don Juan and although this was cut from the final production she still attended the film's premiere with Tallulah Bankhead, who introduced her to Lord Beaverbrook. Although Beaverbrook was married and thirty years her senior, he and Koopman began, in 1934, an affair that lasted some years. He was happy to pay for her travels throughout Europe in the 1930s and she often attended opera performances in Germany and Italy. When Beaverbrook discovered that Koopman was also in a relationship with his son, Max Aitken, he ran a series of stories in the newspapers he owned, including the Daily Express and the London Evening Standard, that made Koopman an outcast in London high- society. Koopman and the younger Aitken lived together for four years but he ended the relationship when she refused to marry him. In fact Koopman had signed an agreement with Beaverbrook which granted her a pension for life from him provided she did not marry his son. World War II Koopman left London in 1939 to live in Italy. There she began a relationship with a leader of the anti-Mussolini resistance. When World War II broke out, she agreed to use her contacts and language skills to spy for the Italian Resistance. She infiltrated meetings of the Black Shirts but was captured. After spells in prisons in Milan and Lazio she was sent to the Massa Martina detention camp but escaped and hid in the mountains around Perugia, where she worked with a local resistance group. She was recaptured, promptly escaped again and made her way to Venice. There, in October 1944, Koopman was caught spying on high- ranking German officers in the Danieli Hotel and quickly deported to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Very shortly before the camp was liberated in April 1945, the Nazi authorities released several hundred prisoners, including Koopman, to the care of the Red Cross in Sweden. A former boyfriend, Randolph Churchill went to Gothenburg and helped the emaciated Koopman obtain new clothes, a new passport and a wig for her shaved head. Later years and death While recuperating in Ascona in 1945, Koopman met the art dealer Erica Brausen. The two became lovers and would remain together for the rest of their lives. Brausen was about to open her own commercial gallery in London and the two women worked to get the Hanover Gallery established. In due course the Hanover became one of the most influential galleries in Europe, most notably by nurturing the early career of Francis Bacon. During the 1950s Koopman studied at the University of London and took part in several archaeological excavations. She made a donation of books to the Institute of Archaeology in London.\\"The Institute of Archaeology Library 1937-1986: Collections, Communities and Networks\\", Katie Meheux, Archaeology International, No. 18 (2015), pp. 67-83. In 1959 Koopman and Brausen bought a property on the island of Panarea where they built six villas amongst extensive gardens and entertained very lavishly. They continued to live together until Koopman's death in August 1991, eighteen months before Brausen's death.

In 1942, Gordon Lynn Walls described this concept which states that placental mammals were mainly or even exclusively nocturnal through most of their evolutionary story, starting with their origin 225 million years ago, and only ending with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago.Gerkema MP, Davies WI, Foster RG, Menaker M, Hut RA. The nocturnal bottleneck and the evolution of activity patterns in mammals. Proc Biol Sci. 2013 Jul 3;280(1765):20130508. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2013.0508 While some mammal groups have later evolved to fill diurnal niches, the approximately 160 million years spent as nocturnal animals has left a lasting legacy on basal anatomy and physiology, and most mammals are still nocturnal. Evolution of mammals Brasilitherium, a very advanced near-mammalian cynodont, were probably nocturnal burrowers Mammals evolved from cynodonts, a group of superficially dog-like synapsids in the wake of the Permian‚ÄìTriassic mass extinction. The emerging archosaurian groups that flourished after the extinction, including crocodiles and dinosaurs and their ancestors, drove the remaining larger cynodonts into extinction, leaving only the smaller forms. The surviving cynodonts could only succeed in niches with minimal competition from the diurnal dinosaurs, evolving into the typical small-bodied insectivorous dwellers of the nocturnal undergrowth. While the early mammals continued to develop into several probably quite common groups of animals during the Mesozoic, they all remained relatively small and nocturnal. Only with the massive extinction at the end of the Cretaceous did the dinosaurs leave the stage open for the establishment of a new fauna of mammals. Despite this, mammals continued to be small-bodied for millions of years. While all the largest animals alive today are mammals, the majority of mammals are still small nocturnal animals. Mammalian nocturnal adaptions The whiskers on a shrew, used in finding prey, navigation and socialization Several different features of mammalian physiology appear to be adaptations to a nocturnal lifestyle, mainly related to the sensory organs. These include: =Senses= * Acute sense of hearing, including external pinnae and auditory ossicles. * Very good sense of smell, well developed nasal turbinates. * Well developed sense of touch, and particularly the whiskers. * With the exception of higher primates, very large cornea, giving a less acute visual image compared to birds and reptiles. * Limited colour vision. =Physiology= * Unique type of brown adipose tissue, allowing mammals to generate heat quickly. * Mitochondria with five to seven times higher respiration rates compared to reptiles of similar sizes. * Fur to assist in thermo-regulation in a cold (night) environment. * Lack of shielding mechanism against (diurnal) ultraviolet light. (This is not actually true, as fur is good for shielding from ultraviolet radiation.) * The photolyase DNA mechanism, which relies on visible light, does not work in the placental mammals, despite being present and functional in bacteria, fungi, and most other animals. =Behaviour= * Circadian rhythm and behaviour patterns in all basal groups are nocturnal, at least in placentals. * Burrowing lifestyle allowing sheltering from climate and diurnal predators appear to be a basal mammalian trait.

Two companies, referred to collectively as Mr Fluffy (a nickname coined in the 1990s for Asbestosfluf Insulations, and its successor J&H; Insulation, the former run by Canberra businessman Dirk Jansen, the latter owned by a relative of his), imported and installed fibrous, loose-fill amphibole asbestos (in most cases brown amosite, though instances of blue crocidolite have been recorded) as an insulation by blowing the product into roof spaces of homes during the 1960s and 1970s.CAUSE AND EFFECT: THE LEGACY OF MR FLUFFYMr Fluffy: the cancerous legacy hidden in hundreds of Canberra homesSon of man known as Mr Fluffy 'so sorry' for residents caught up in loose-fill asbestos scandal Additionally, the companies are believed to have sold sacks of asbestos fibre direct to homeowners to insulate their own homes, and other operators may have also used the hazardous material trying to copy Jansen's business model. Medical dangers At the time, there was little knowledge by the public about the dangers of exposure to asbestos. Subsequently, cases of mesothelioma, lung cancer and other asbestos-related diseases have become well publicised. Testing in these homes has revealed the ongoing possibility of exposure to the loose asbestos fibres, with the loose-fill amosite asbestos used by Mr Fluffy especially hazardous due to its lack of a bonding agent causing it to easily migrate to hidden corners and cracks inside a residence. Affected areas In 2015 the Government of the Australian Capital Territory released a list of areas affected by Mr Fluffy insulation contamination totalling 1,022 properties.Mr Fluffy: Full list of asbestos-contaminated homes in Canberra released by ACT Government It is believed that up to 30,000 people may have been affected over the years. A significant number of the houses were developed in the Radburn scheme suburbs, Charnwood, Curtin and Garran, and a small part of Hughes. In 2014, with plans for demolition of houses under the Mr Fluffy asbestos home demolition scheme being developed, it was realised that a significant number of the houses treated with loose asbestos, and thus affected, were in the Radburn areas. This was recognised as having the potential to degrade the remaining legacy of the Radburn scheme.Experimental Radburn town planning disappearing from Canberra, Clarissa Thorpe, ABC News Online, 24 November 2014 Loose Fill Asbestos has also been found in locations far removed from Canberra, such as three confirmed locations in Lithgow, which is approximately 200 kilometres away from Canberra. The New South Wales Government has announced a buyback scheme for affected properties. Jansen, who ran Mr Fluffy from his family home, himself stored bags of asbestos fluff under his house. Investigation and clean-up Jansen started using asbestos as an insulation as early as 1967, and began using it in loose form in 1968, prompting a Commonwealth Government investigation within months. However, despite a subsequent report that indicated community exposure to asbestos was potentially \\"undesirable\\", he kept working until 1978. Jansen died in 2001. Prompted by growing public concern about the hazards of asbestos in general and Mr Fluffy's product, a Commonwealth audit in 1988 identified most of the homes in the ACT containing the insulation. A clean-up program was conducted by the new ACT Government between 1989 and 1993 and was thought to have fixed the problem in those homes identified in the audit, but residual asbestos has since been found in some houses. This led to the creation of a community action group by affected homeowners that campaigned for a shift in policy concerning the future of their residences. In response a home demolition scheme was negotiated between the Government of the Australian Capital Territory and the Government of Australia in 2014. It involves a loan of about A$1 billion from the Australian Government to the ACT Government that will fund the purchase of houses treated with loose-fill asbestos fibre insulation in the 1960s and 1970s, the demolition of those houses, and the sale of the land for redevelopment, with the proceeds of the sales being used to assist the repayment of the loan.New start for owners of Mr Fluffy asbestos home in Kambah, Emma Macdonald, The Canberra Times, 21 November 2014 The first demolitions under the scheme began in July 2015.Mr Fluffy asbestos: First house demolished by ACT Government as part of buyback scheme A number of heritage homes have also been affected and will be lost, including Deasland, one of Canberra's most important historic homesteads, which was built by George Harcourt in 1893.The Canberra Times, 25 June 2015, p. 1.

Typically, a major landowner provided a contiguous area near the town which was subdivided into multiple townparks, each rented on a short-term lease, for a higher rent than that paid by a full-time resident farmer. Townlands The Boundary Survey of 1825‚Äì44, associated with Griffith's Valuation and the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, set down the names and denominations of subdivisions of land. Griffith often erected a contiguous block of townparks into a single townland named \\"Town Parks\\" or \\"Town Parks of [name of town]\\". The 1901 townland index recorded such townlands by the following towns: Ballycastle, Larne, Ballymena, Antrim, Ballymoney, Ballyhaise, Cavan, Cloyne, Midleton, Lifford, Ballyshannon, Newtownards, Skerries (Holmpatrick civil parish), Swords, Ballinasloe, Galway, Portumna, Castledermot, Athy, Birr, Daingean (then Philipstown), Carrick on Shannon, Longford, Newtown Forbes, Ardee, Dundalk, Navan, Athboy, Kells, Borris-in-Ossory, Mountmellick, Roscrea, Carrick-on-Suir, Cahir, Lismore, Delvin, Wexford, Lismore, Tallow, Tuam, Donaghadee, and Killeshandra. There were also \\"Town Fields\\" (Borrisokane), \\"Town Lands\\" (Clonakilty), \\"Town Lot\\" (Tipperary), \\"Town Lots\\" (Bantry), and \\"Townplots\\" (Kinsale and Killala). Town Parks was also the townland containing the centre of Belfast; it is listed in the 1861 index, but was entirely within the county borough boundary by 1901. Thurles Townparks is the townland, now almost entirely urbanised, around the historic centre of Thurles. Land Acts The Irish Land Acts of 1870 and 1881, which were designed to enable tenant farmers to purchase their holdings from landlords, specifically excluded townparks from their terms. This led to case law interpreting the Acts' definition of \\"townpark\\", which had three components: # That they adjoin or are near a city or town; # That they bear an increased value as accommodation land beyond their ordinary letting value for merely farming purposes # That they are occupied by a person living in a city or town or its suburbs A \\"town\\" need not be a municipality with town commissioners or other government, and conversely a place within the municipal boundary might yet be too far from the built-up area to be considered a townpark. Population was suggestive but not definitive: Portglenone with 800 people was held not to be a \\"town\\", whereas Timoleague was, with only 366.

His best known role is probably playing the recurring character of Naval Commander Don Winslow in Universal Pictures serials of the early 1940s, including Don Winslow of the Navy (1942) and Don Winslow of the Coast Guard (1943). Early life and background Terry was born Donald Loker (though some sources give Locher) in Natick, Massachusetts in 1902. He was a 1925 graduate of Harvard. Terry was discovered while visiting Los Angeles as a tourist. During the visit, he hoped to see some film stars, but had been disappointed. Nearing the end of his trip, he decided to have lunch at Hollywood's Caf√© Montmartre since it was a favorite of many in the film industry. Terry thought he might finally see a film star while having lunch, but found only other tourists who had the same hope. However, Fox screenwriter Charles Francis Coe was at the restaurant and happened to see Terry and thought of the screenplay he had just completed, based on his 1927 novel. Coe introduced himself and asked Terry if he was in the film industry. He gave Terry his business card and invited him to the Fox lot for a screen test. Terry went to the lot expecting only to be able to see some film stars. When Terry's screen test came out of the film laboratory, he was signed as the lead in the 1928 film Me, Gangster, the screenplay Coe had just written. Film career Don Terry on his film debut in Me, Gangster (1928), opposite Anders Randolph Known for his \\"typical clean-cut American hero roles\\", it was also noted that Terry was \\"not the most facile of actors\\". He was a contemporary of Victor Jory, Paul Kelly, and Charles Quigley, who all portrayed \\"bare-knuckled, sleeves-rolled-up hard hats\\" in various films. In the late 1930s, he appeared in several films directed by Charles C. Coleman, including A Fight to the Finish (1937), Paid to Dance (1937), Who Killed Gail Preston? (1937), When G-Men Step In (1938), and Squadron of Honor (1938). His best known role is probably playing the recurring character of Naval Commander Don Winslow in Universal Pictures serials of the early 1940s, including Don Winslow of the Navy (1942) and Don Winslow of the Coast Guard (1943), co- starring Elyse Knox. Knox previously worked with Terry in Top Sergeant (1942). Terry appeared in Danger in the Pacific (1942) as a scientist, co-starring Louise Allbritton. Other credits include Fugitives (1929), Border Romance (1929), The Secret of Treasure Island (1938), Barnacle Bill (1941), Overland Mail (1942), Sherlock Holmes in Washington (1943) and White Savage (1943), his last screen appearance before enlisting in the U.S. Navy. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was awarded the Purple Heart. He left the Navy in 1946 and never returned to film. Post-film life and career In 1941, Terry married Katherine Bogdanovich, a daughter of the founder of StarKist tuna. Bogdanovich, a 1940 graduate of University of Southern California (USC), shared an interest in Olympic competition with her husband. She tried out for the 1932 Olympics as a sprinter. The couple had two daughters, and after completing his World War II service, Terry dropped his screen name and went to work for StarKist as vice president of public and industrial relations. Loker retired from the company in 1965, and the couple then devoted their time and energies to various philanthropic projects by establishing the Donald and Katherine Loker Foundation. The Foundation supported many projects, with a special emphasis on the colleges that were the Lokers' alma maters. They supported USC as board members of long standing, and with financial gifts of more than $30 million over a period of time. The Lokers were long-time friends of Richard and Pat Nixon and were also supporters of the Nixon Library. Despite the Lokers' lack of experience in chemistry, Carl Franklin, who was at the time USC's legal vice president, referred them to the university's hydrocarbon research institute, which was established in 1978 with the Lokers' financial aid. In 1983, it was renamed Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute in their honor. He died at Oceanside, California on October 6, 1988, aged 86. After his death, his widow continued the couple's philanthropic efforts until her death in 2008.

A noted scholar, she compiled and edited a major reference work on folklore and was the author or editor of thirteen books for adults, young people, and children. Early life, education, and marriage Born in New York City, Maria Leach was the former Alice-Mary Doane, daughter of Benjamin H. Doane and Mary (Davis) Doane.Mrs. Maria Doane Leach\\" (obituary), Cape Breton Post, Sydney, Nova Scotia, 30 May 1977. Her father was a native of Nova Scotia, one of Canada's three Maritime provinces. Born in Barrington, in Shelburne County, he was a descendant of the venerable family called Doane (an Anglicized form of a Gaelic name common in southern Ireland since the 1500s).Patrick Hanks, Dictionary of American Family Names, vol. 1 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003). In Nova Scotia he had connections to seafaring through his own father, a ship's captain. In the late 1870s or early 1880s, Benjamin Doane and his wife Mary, a native of South Carolina and an unreconstructed Rebel, moved to New York and established a home in Manhattan, where they lived for some years and raised their children. Alice- Mary Doane spent her youth and received her early education in New York City. Upon graduation from high school she went to Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, whose curriculum was shaped by the perspective of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). She then went on to study for a master's degree in anthropology at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. There she met MacEdward Leach, a student of medieval literature and philology with a strong interest in folklore. His fascination with the oral tradition of medieval folk tales was shared by Alice-Mary, who by then was known as Maria (pronounced \\"Ma-RYE-uh\\" in the British fashion), which she had adopted as a pen name. After MacEdward Leach earned a bachelor's degree in 1916 and completed his military service in World War I, he and Maria married in 1917 and moved to Baltimore, where both of them pursued graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University. MacEdward Leach earned a master's degree at Johns Hopkings that same year, 1917.\\"Personal Life\\", MacEdward Leach and the Songs of Atlantic Canada (www.mun.ca/folklore/leach), a website produced at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Maria continued her studies toward a doctorate in folklore in 1918‚Äì19. In 1920 he entered the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and began teaching as an instructor of English. Not long after, in 1924, the Leaches became the parents of a son, Macdonald, their only child. As a young father, MacEdward Leach obtained his doctorate in English in 1930 and joined the faculty of the university in 1931 as an assistant professor of English. Later life and professional career In 1936, Maria Leach found employment in the Philadelphia offices of Funk & Wagnalls, a scholarly publishing firm. As working parents, the Leaches then set up house in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and some years later, once their son was away at boarding school, decided to follow mostly independent pathways. While he remained in Pennsylvania, she moved back to New York, returning to their home in Bucks County for occasional weekends. MacEdward Leach would subsequently devote his entire career to teaching and working at the university, where, among other accomplishments, he founded the program in folklore.Rosina S. Miller, \\"Of Politics, Disciplines, and Scholars: MacEdward Leach and the Founding of the Folklore Program at the University of Pennsylvania\\", The Folklore Historian, 20 (2003): 18. Maria Leach also continued to work in the burgeoning field of folklore. Having resettled in Manhattan, in Greenwich Village, she worked in the New York offices of Funk & Wagnalls as a dictionary editor. There, after her amicable divorce from MacEdward Leach in the mid-1940s, she compiled and edited the major reference work on folklore, mythology, and legend for which she is best known. From 1953 to 1958 she was a textbook editor at McGraw-Hill Book Company. During this time, in 1954, she wrote the first of what would become a substantial list of published works. In the late 1950s, she decided to retire and move to Nova Scotia. Her connection to the people of Cape Breton led her to establish residence in Shelburne County, at first in Barrington, in the Doane's family home, and then, finally, at Coffinscroft. A folklorist of international renown, she was still actively engaged in writing at the time of her death in 1977. During her lifetime, Maria Leach was a prominent member of the American Folklore Society, for which she served as councilor. She also held memberships in the American Anthropological Association, the American Dialect Society, the Northeast Folklore Society, the Society for Ethnomusicology, the American Indian Ethnohistoric Conference, and the Religious Society of Friends.

Early years  Charles Hinman was born in 1932, in Syracuse, New York. He initiated his artistic education at the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts, now the Everson Museum of Art, where he attended classes. He went on to complete his BFA in 1955 at Syracuse University. Alongside his artistic talent, Charles Hinman was also dedicated to sports. While studying at university he was a professional baseball player for the Milwaukee Braves in the minor league. He moved to New York to study at the Arts Student League before serving two years in the army. Upon his return he was a mechanical drawing teacher at the Staten Island Academy from 1960 to 1962 and a carpentry shop instructor at the Woodmere Academy on Long Island.  New York art scene  In the early 1960s Hinman lived on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan where he shared an abandoned sail-making loft with James Rosenquist. It was an ideal art studio offering large open spaces to work at an affordable rent. Along with Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Jack Youngerman and Agnes Martin who resided in the neighbouring buildings, they formed a small artistic community away from the Upper-East side and the Abstract Expressionists from whom they wished to differentiate themselves. They did not constitute an art movement as such, but rather a \\"support and critique family that helped each other go on their individual paths.\\" Throughout the 1960s they produced works that prefigured Pop, Minimal and Feminist Art. In 1965, Charles Hinman and Robert Indiana left Coenties Slip for the Bowery where they shared a building at 2 Spring Street. In 1971, he moved a block away on the Bowery where he settled in an 8000 sq/ft studio where he has remained ever since. Below Hinman's studio was that of Tom Wesselmann and above worked Will Insley, across the street were the studios of Adolph Gottlieb and Roy Lichtenstein. In 2002, the New Museum became his neighbor when it was built on the adjacent lot.  Shaped canvas  In the 1960s Charles Hinman played a significant role in redefining the physical shape of paintings. The shaped canvas was born from the desire to break away from the traditional square or rectangular frame of painting. Rather than a formalized medium or window that contained the subject, the contours of the painting became part of the subject itself. In the mid-1960s several abstract minimalist painters were experimenting with its possibilities, the most famous of which is Frank Stella. Charles Hinman drove the concept further by pushing the canvas out from the wall; his works were a form of hybrid between painting and sculpture. This type of painting is known as a three-dimensional shaped canvas. As early as 1963-64 Charles Hinman created sculptural paintings with protruding geometric and undulating forms. While Sven Lukin and Richard Smith were also experimenting with the use of the three-dimensional canvas around the same time, Charles Hinman's defining particularity was his focus on the illusion of space and subtly suggested volume, embracing the use of color, shadow and reflection. He was influenced by Ellsworth Kelly in his flat and contrasting Hard-edge use of color but with the objective of generating and accentuating a perception of volume. In the subsequent years until the early 1970s, Hinman examined the possibilities offered by this new medium: strongly protruding canvases, geometric and sensual profiles, color contrasts, color reflections on the adjacent wall, shadows, monochrome canvases.  Early recognition  It was through James Rosenquist, that Charles Hinman caught the attention of prominent New York gallery owners and museum directors who visited the studio they shared. Two exhibitions in 1964-65 introduced Hinman's work to the grand public and to critical attention; \\"Seven New Artists\\" at the Sidney Janis Gallery and a solo exhibition at the Richard Feigen Gallery. In 1965 Frank Stella and Henry Geldzahler included Hinman's work in their group show \\"Shape and Structure\\" at Tibor de Nagy, alongside Donald Judd, Larry Bell, Sol LeWitt, Carl Andre and Will Insley. His work was shown at the Whitney Museum's landmark show \\"Young America 1965\\" and the following year in \\"United States 1670-1966\\". Hinman was represented by Richard Feigen who showed his work at his New York and Chicago galleries. While major museums such as the MOMA, the Whitney Museum and the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery soon bought his work for their permanent collections, his paintings also found a home in the collection of Nelson Rockefeller. From 1971 to 1973 the Parisian gallerist Denise Ren√© showed his work at her Paris and New York galleries.  Artistic concepts  = Process = Throughout his career, Charles Hinman has developed a methodical process by which he creates his works. First, he draws sketches of the final shape he wishes to create. He then designs a minute blueprint of the frameworks he needs to construct to achieve this shape, comprising all the angles and lengths of the frame. His works are often composed of a juxtaposition of shaped canvases, which he bolts together into an integral form. He adds the third dimension to his paintings by fixing protuberant forms to the underpinnings. These shapes push the canvas out from the wall and create the volume in his paintings. He then paints various planes of his work in order to create volume and to play with the eye of the viewer. He sometimes paints the reverse side of the canvas which sits off the wall, so as to produce a halo effect around his work. The use of light and shadows as well as contrasting colors and reflections play an important role in his creations. = 6 dimensions = Hinman's work focuses on the perception of volume as opposed to literal space. He uses an array of techniques to create volume in the eye of the viewer. It is a form of trompe l'oeil that constantly evolves depending on the spectator's vantage point. Hinman describes his concept as \\"My concept of my work is dynamic---never static. I think of my paintings as occupying a 6-dimensionnal space(‚Ä¶) the three dimensions of space and one each of time, light and color.\\" According to him, space and time imply movement and the change of light: \\"As light moves across the object, the forms and the color appear to change with the rearrangement of the shadows. (‚Ä¶)The brightness causes a surface to move forward‚Äîthe darkness causes the surface to recede. Further, the choice of adjacent colors causes a sensation of motion of the surfaces\\" = Series = Throughout his career, Hinman has continuously created works in series. His early works from the mid-1960s are voluptuous and organic with strongly contrasting hard-edge colors and projecting forms. He then moved to a two-dimensional, minimalist and geometric style in the early 1970s. By the late 1970s he was exploring the potential of arched \\"double curved\\" profiles to shape his canvases. These structures became increasingly complex throughout the 1980s, reaching for scale and color in leaf-like arrangements. Since 2000, he has returned to a pure and minimal style working with light as much as with color. \\"A single facet or canvas may have its own color, or the shadow across it may serve as color (‚Ä¶) Sometimes the color solely belongs to the edge of a work, or so it seems, until one notices that Hinman has painted the back (‚Ä¶) He is not just shaping an object, but also taking it out from the wall.\\" The Shaped Canvas revisited In 1964, the Guggenheim Museum organised the show \\"The Shaped Canvas\\". Laurence Alloway, the curator of the exhibition decided to focus on two-dimensional Minimal works only, de facto excluding three dimensional as well as Pop art works from this movement. This initial selection has been questioned and broadened over the years by several retrospective group shows that hosted a wider variety of shaped canvases. Frank Stella's 1965 group show \\"Shape and Structure\\" immediately refuted Olloway's position by including Charles Hinman's paintings. In 1979, The Visual Arts Museum in New York organised a show named \\"Shaped Paintings\\". It opened the scope of the shaped canvas to Pop Art works as well as to three-dimensional shaped canvases. Charles Hinman's work was presented alongside that of Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Mangold, Bernard Venet and Tom Wesselmann. In 2014, Charles Hinman was included in the group show \\"Shaped Canvas Revisited\\" at the Luxembourg and Dayan Gallery in New York. This exhibition, which celebrated the fifty years of the original Guggenheim show, places Hinman among the fathers of the shaped canvas movement alongside artists such as Lucio Fontana, Kenneth Noland, Frank Stella and Tom Wesselmann.  Reception  In recent years, Charles Hinman's work has garnered increasing attention both for his contemporary as for his \\"modern\\" (historic) works. According to some critics, his latest series of \\"Gems\\" and \\"Black Paintings\\" are arguably amongst his most interesting works. In 2013, the Marc Straus Gallery in New York organized a retrospective covering the six decades of his career.

H. Holmes, one of America's first serial killers. Geyer was a longtime city employee of the Philadelphia Police Department, and in 1894 was assigned to investigate the Holmes-Pitezel Case. He published the story in his book The Holmes-Pitezel Case: a history of the greatest crime of the century and of the search for the missing Pitezel children. Son of Reuben K. Geyer and Camilla Buck, Frank Geyer died at the age of 65 due to La Grippe (Spanish Flu) and his funeral was attended by hundreds of policemen and detectives. The Holmes‚ÄìPitezel Case H H Holmes's recorded crimes began in Chicago in 1893 when he opened a hotel called The World's Fair Hotel for the World's Columbian Exposition. The structure, built by Holmes, would later be known as the 'Murder Castle' because of the labyrinthine constructions on the top two floors, which he used to torture and kill many of his victims. In a 1937 article, the Chicago Tribune described: \\"There were rooms that had no doors. There were doors that had no rooms. A mysterious house it was indeed -- a crooked house, a reflex of the builder's own distorted mind. In that house occurred dark and eerie deeds.\\" H. H. Holmes \\"Murder Castle\\" Boston police inspectors and a Pinkerton detective apprehended Holmes in 1894 in Boston on a coroner's warrant for insurance fraud perpetrated in Philadelphia; however, Boston officials did not find the warrant sufficient to hold Holmes so they contacted Fort Worth, Texas for an outstanding warrant of horse theft. Holmes volunteered to be extradited to Philadelphia for the insurance fraud as he felt he would receive a much lighter sentence. Texas was notorious for rendering harsh sentences to horse thieves. The City of Philadelphia Police Department sent Detective Thomas Crawford to Boston to bring H. H. Holmes and his accomplice, Mrs. Carrie Pitezel, to Philadelphia for a trial. Philadelphia city detective Frank Geyer was tasked with investigating and the trail led him through the Mid West and Toronto, Canada, where he found the remains of two of the Pitezel children. They were the children of Benjamin Pitezel, Holmes's former partner in crime, whom he had murdered to commit life insurance fraud. Pitezel, however, was only involved in fraud and had no knowledge of the murders. The initial investigation was concerned with the insurance fraud but it soon became apparent that Holmes had killed Pitezel. In June 1895 Frank Geyer left Philadelphia to retrace Holmes's steps. His findings in Toronto led to further investigations of Holmes's Chicago property, which sealed his fate. Geyer used information from the unsent letters written by the Pitezel children which, for an unknown reason, were kept by Holmes. In Toronto, he found the bodies of Alice and Nellie Pitezel. He continued his search and found the burnt remains of Howard Pitezel, the third child, in a house Holmes had rented in Irvington, Indianapolis. Holmes was found guilty of four counts of murder in the first degree and six counts of attempted murder and executed in May 1896 at the age of 34. His total number of victims has been estimated at around 200. However Erik Larson, who wrote extensively about Holmes in The Devil in the White City (2003), thought this was a gross exaggeration. Holmes himself confessed to 27 murders, unquestionably he killed nine times.Erik Larson, The Devil in the White City, Vintage Books, 2003, p 385). That same year Frank Geyer published his book detailing the case. In the book George S. Graham, District Attorney of Philadelphia, described the story as \\"one of the most marvellous [sic] stories of modern times\\". False Claims of Geyer's Family Dying in Fire Several popular books falsely claimed Detective Geyer's wife and twelve-year-old daughter died in a fire shortly after he was assigned to investigate H. H. Holmes and the three missing Pitezel children. However, Geyer's beloved wife and daughter never died in a fire and continued to live well past his death in 1918. Other Work by Detective Geyer  In 1896, Detective Geyer became an author and inventor. He authored the Holmes-Pitezel case: a history of the greatest crime of the century and of the search for the missing Pitezel children, which became an instant best seller. Shortly after its release, his \\"Shutter or Door Fastener\\" patent application was approved by the United States Patent Office on March 10, 1896, Patent No. 556,141. After 27 years with the City of Philadelphia Police Department, Geyer opened the Frank P. Geyer Detective Agency, located at 1328 Arch Street in Philadelphia and investigated high profile cases, mostly in the Pennsylvania and New Jersey areas. In 1907, he invented the \\"Safety-Lock for Pocket Books and Hand Bags, which was approved by the Patent Office December 3, 1907, Patent No. 872,619. Detective Frank P.

History  Essentially the work of Viglius van Aytta, it represents a first step towards the emergence of the Netherlands as an independent territory. It was made possible politically by the French loss of Artois and Flanders. Administratively, a chancellery and tribunal was established at Mechelen which for the first time had as its jurisdiction \\"the Netherlands\\" exclusively. The treaty resulted in a significant shift of territories from the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle to the Burgundian Circle. The newly formed administrative division of the empire now united all Burgundian territories, which were no longer subject to the Reichskammergericht. To compensate for its territorial gain, the Burgundian Circle was now obliged to pay taxes equivalent to those of two prince- electorates, and in war taxes towards the Turkish Wars even equivalent to three prince-electorates. To ensure that the Burgundian territory now united in the Burgundian Circle would remain under a single administration, Charles V in the following year promulgated the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 which declared the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands a single indivisible possession not to be divided in future inheritance. The consequence of these attempts at reducing the fragmentation of the government of the Holy Roman Empire was the separation of the Netherlands as an entity apart from the remaining empire, forming an important step towards the formation of the Dutch Republic in 1581.  Territories  The treaty, written in New Latin, stipulates in Article 15 that the territories mentioned are to become a single unit that will be passed on undivided to the next generations after Charles V (speaking in majestic plural) through hereditary succession: > (original text) Nimirum, nos veros, haereditarios & supremos Dominos > dictarum nostrarum provinciarum Patrimonialium Belgicarum, pro Nobis, > nostris haeredibus & successoribus, simul dictae nostrae Provinciae > Patrimoniales Belgicae, nominatim Ducatus Lotharingiae, Brabantiae, > Limburgi, Luxemburgi, Geldriae; Comitatus Flandriae, Artesiae, Burgundiae, > Hannoniae, Hollandiae, Selandiae, Namurci, Zutphaniae; Marchionatus S.

It was founded in the late 1960s as a platform for advancing the social and cultural interests of Pakistani expatriates residing in Dubai and more broadly, the United Arab Emirates. History The Pakistani diaspora in the UAE is the third largest overseas Pakistani community, and also one of the oldest expatriate groups in the UAE. There are currently over 1.2 million Pakistanis in the United Arab Emirates, out of which over 400,000 are based in Dubai alone. Pakistanis collectively comprise around 13% of Dubai's population and are the third largest ethnic group in the emirate (after Indians and native Emiratis). When PAD was founded in the late 1960s by members of the early community, it was initially based at a small rented office space in Murshid Bazar in Deira, where the Pakistan Education Academy now exists. By the early 1990s, the office was shifted to the Astoria Hotel in Bur Dubai. Later, the centre where the association is now headquartered was built on Oud Metha Road in Bur Dubai. The objectives of PAD include promoting relations between Pakistan and the UAE, providing community support and welfare, promoting Pakistani culture, organising recreational community events, and enhancing the interests of the Pakistani expatriate community in the UAE. Structure The association elects a president who formally heads the organisation, typically for a tenure of two to three years. A vice-president, general-secretary and joint-secretary are also elected as part of the executive body. Membership is required to register and participate in the association. PAD works closely with the Consulate-General of Pakistan in Dubai. There are multiple community wings operating under PAD. These include the medical, engineering, journalist, professional, accounting and ladies wings, among others. Events and activities PAD arranges numerous cultural events and gatherings in the community, such as Independence Day, Pakistan Day and UAE National Day celebrations, literary events including mushairas, iftar dinners during Ramadan, chaand raat events, meena bazaars, fundraising dinners and awareness events, award ceremonies, art exhibitions, sport and leisurely events, as well as workshops and language classes.

The parish church, under the protection of its patron saints, the Virgin of the Pillar and Saint Peter, is under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando. History and Architecture The convent of San Simon was established by the Augustinians on April 20, 1771 and was placed under the patronage of Apostle Simon Peter. The town was formerly named after its secondary patron, Our Lady of the Pillar, and was purportedly named after its founder Mariano del Pilar de los Reyes. It was later renamed San Simon by Governor-general Simon de Anda y Salazar who named the town from his namesake upon the recommendation of his close allies, the Augustinian Friars. Governor General Anda moved the capital of the colony to Pampanga a few years before the founding of the town due to the 1762 British Invasion. Not much historical records are available regarding the construction of the current church other than that a stone edifice was constructed by Father Benito Ubierna in 1870. A certain Father Bernabe built the convent in 1889. Both structures were razed by fire by Filipino revolutionaries on May 5, 1898. Much of the stone walls of the church are intact while the fa√ßade and bell tower has been remodeled.

After working for one year in 1982 at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures in Baarn, Netherlands, he moved to Sweden in 1984. He was hired at the Institute for Systematic Botany at the University of Uppsala. Because of his vast knowledge and expertise about members of the order Peronosporales, he began the university's culture collection, known as Mykoteket. Constantinescu dedicated the next 20 years building up the collection for the university. He remained in Sweden at Uppsala University for the rest of his life working on members of the family Peronosporaceae, describing six new genera to add to the family after none had been added for over 30 years. Constantinescu compiled and published an annotated list of over 500 species in the genus Peronospora in 1991. He is also known for describing new species of and working on downy mildew pathogens.

Broidy (born 1956/1957) is an American venture capitalist, businessman, and Republican fundraiser. From 2005 to 2008, he served as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). In 2009, he was convicted in a public corruption and bribery case in New York. From 2017 to April 2018 he was a deputy finance chairman of the RNC, resigning after The Wall Street Journal reported that he had been a party to a non-disclosure agreement with former Playboy Playmate Shera Bechard, under which he paid $1.6 million for her silence about a sexual affair between them. As of May 2019, the United States Department of Justice was investigating Broidy's business and political dealings. In October 2020, Broidy pled guilty to acting as an unregistered foreign agent. He had been charged as part of a federal probe into efforts to influence the Trump administration to stop investigations about a 1MDB Malaysian state fund fraud. Early life Broidy is the son of Sherman G. Broidy (1924‚Äì2014), an educator and property developer, and Dorothy Horowitz. He is Jewish. Broidy says he put himself through the University of Southern California \\"working as a commercial salmon fisherman\\" and that he \\"saved $10,000 and bought an East Los Angeles laundromat that he visited almost every day.\\"Finnegan, Michael; A tale of two scandals, with a rich Trump donor, kickbacks and a Playboy playmate; LA Times; August 11, 2018; Broidy graduated from USC where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting and Finance. He was a Certified Public Accountant from 1982 to 1993. Career =Business= Broidy began his career in finance at Arthur Andersen. One of his clients, Glen Bell, the founder of Taco Bell, hired him to manage his personal investments. He was managing director at Bell Enterprises from 1982 to 1991. In 1991, he founded Broidy Capital Management, an investment firm, serving as its chairman and chief executive officer. Broidy served as chairman of ESI Holdings, an event management firm. He served as commissioner and chairman of the Alternative Investment Committee of the Los Angeles City Fire and Police Pension Fund from 2002 to 2009. In 2002, Broidy founded Markstone Capital Partners, a private equity firm which invested in companies in Israel. The lead investor was the New York State Common Pension Fund. The pension fund invested $250 million with Markstone. In 2009, Broidy entered a guilty plea to a single felony count of attempting to provide excess gratuity to former New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi. The charge was later reduced to a misdemeanor in exchange for cooperation that helped lead to the conviction of Hevesi and six other pension officials. Broidy had provided $1 million in illegal gifts to New York State pension authorities. The gifts included luxury trips to Israel, payouts, and an undisclosed investment in a film produced by the brother of the chief investment officer of the New York State Retirement Fund. In exchange for the gifts, the state pension fund had invested $250 million with Markstone Capital Partners. As part of the plea deal, Broidy paid $18 million in restitution of management fees paid by the pension fund to Markstone. Broidy owns the private security company Circinus LLC, which provides services to the United States and other governments. The company has hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts with the United Arab Emirates. In 2018, Broidy intended to take a business trip with George Nader to meet with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, in order to sell the prince a $650 million contract with Circinus. The plan fell apart when F.B.I. agents took Nader in for questioning upon his arrival at Dulles Airport. In addition to his other activities, Broidy was the executive producer of two independent films: Sugar and Snake and Mongoose (both 2013). =George W. Bush administration= Becoming interested in politics after the 9/11 attacks, he joined the Republican Jewish Coalition and ultimately became a member of the board of directors, a position he still holds as of 2019. Between 2002 and 2004 he became a ‚ÄúSuper Ranger\\", donating more than $300,000 to the George W. Bush 2004 presidential campaign. From 2004 to 2006 he raised campaign funds for many Republican candidates. In October 2006, he hosted a fundraiser for Bush, where $1 million was raised. Later that year, he was appointed by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to the Homeland Security Advisory Council as well as the Terrorism Task Force and New Technology Task Force. From 2006 to 2008, he served as finance chairman for the Republican National Committee (RNC). =Donald Trump administration= In 2016, Broidy served as a vice chairman of the Trump Victory Committee, a joint fundraising committee between the Donald Trump campaign and the RNC. In addition, he served as a vice-chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee. In April 2017, Broidy was named one of three national deputy finance chairmen of the RNC, along with Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen and the businessman Louis DeJoy. After Trump won the election, Broidy used his connections to the president to recruit international clients for his security business Circinus, promising that he could arrange meetings with Trump or other high government officials. He obtained defense contracts worth more than $200 million from the United Arab Emirates. Many of his clients had unsavory records. Broidy offered inauguration tickets to Denis Sassou-Nguesso, a Congolese strongman whose lavish lifestyle was paid by public funds. He arranged for an Angolan politician to meet with Republican senators and offered him a trip to Mar-A-Lago. Liviu Dragnea, a Romanian parliamentarian jailed for corruption in May 2019, got to attend an inauguration party and pose for pictures with the president. In October 2017, in a private meeting with president Donald Trump, Broidy praised a paramilitary force his company Circinus was creating for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He urged the president to meet with the UAE's military commander Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, to support the UAE's hawkish policies in the Middle East, and to fire United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He was also harshly critical of Qatar, an American ally at odds with the UAE. In March 2018, The New York Times reported that Lebanese-American businessman George Nader \\"worked for more than a year to turn Broidy into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to interviews and previously undisclosed documents. ...High on the agenda of the two men...was pushing the White House to remove Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, backing confrontational approaches to Iran and Qatar and repeatedly pressing the president to meet privately outside the White House with the leader of the U.A.E.\\" In March 2018, Broidy filed a lawsuit against Qatar, alleging that Qatar's government stole and leaked his emails in order to discredit him because he was viewed \\"as an impediment to their plan to improve the country's standing in Washington.\\" In May 2018, the lawsuit named Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, brother of the Emir of Qatar, and his associate Ahmed Al-Rumaihi, as allegedly orchestrating Qatar's cyber warfare campaign against Broidy. On April 13, 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Broidy had a sexual relationship with Playboy Playmate Shera Bechard, resulting in a pregnancy in late 2017. The model later had an abortion. Donald Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer Michael Cohen negotiated for Broidy to pay $1.6 million for the woman's silence. The settlement was falsely characterized at the time as a personal injury settlement. In response to the Journal article, Broidy issued a statement acknowledging that he had had a \\"consensual relationship with a Playboy Playmate\\", that Cohen had contacted him after being approached by the woman's attorney, Keith M. Davidson, and that Broidy had then hired Cohen to work out a non-disclosure agreement. Broidy resigned his post at the RNC the same day the article appeared. A few days later Cohen confirmed in court that Broidy was one of the three clients he had given legal advice to in the previous year. Some columnists have since speculated that Donald Trump was really the person who had the affair with Bechard, with Broidy agreeing to provide cover for Trump. Broidy's lawyer, Chris Clark, stated that Broidy will withhold forthcoming payments to Bechard due to an alleged breach of the non-disclosure agreement on her part. On July 6, 2018, Bechard filed a lawsuit against Broidy and the attorney Michael Avenatti, in relation to the cessation of the settlement payments. Bechard has alleged in a complaint that Broidy was physically, sexually, and emotionally abusive of her, and that he exposed her to herpes. Broidy has denied the allegations. On September 7, 2018, California Superior Court Judge Elizabeth White granted Broidy‚Äôs request to strike allegations from the case going forward that were not relevant to the breach-of-contract dispute.Petterssen, Edvard (September 7, 2018).

In March 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Broidy had been in negotiations to earn tens of millions of dollars by lobbying the U.S. Justice Department to drop its investigation into a multibillion-dollar graft 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal involving a Malaysian state investment fund, 1MDB, according to emails reviewed by the Journal. One email showed a proposal that would have given Broidy and his wife $75 million if they got the Justice Department to drop its probe into 1MDB. Broidy also prepared talking points for Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to tell Trump during his 2017 visit to Washington, D.C. This included playing up Malaysia's relationship with the U.S. in fighting North Korea and arguing against pursuing legal action against 1MDB. Razak would eventually be convicted of corruption by a Malaysian court. The Department of Justice is investigating whether the Trump Victory Committee took a $100,000 donation from Malaysian businessman and international fugitive Jho Low, who is accused of being the mastermind of the 1MDB fraud. In November 2018, The New York Times reported that Federal prosecutors accused him of involvement in a scheme to launder millions of dollars into the United States to help Malaysian financier Jho Low end a Justice Department investigation into the embezzlement of billions of dollars from 1MDB. In June 2020, a 112-page legal filing was submitted by Broidy in a federal court in New York, in which he accused Qatar of paying tens of millions of dollars to Global Risk Advisors (GRA), including its chief executive Kevin Chalker, for years to hack, surveil, and silence American citizens who criticized Qatar. In August 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that Broidy was hired by Sun Lijun, the former deputy head of China's Ministry of Public Security, to lobby the Trump administration to extradite Guo Wengui. Philanthropic and nonprofit activities In 2006, Bush appointed Broidy to the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Broidy served on the board of governors and the endowment committee of Hebrew Union College and the board of trustees of the Hillel Foundation, as well as the Center for Investment Studies at the Marshall School of Business at his alma mater, the University of Southern California. He served on the board of governors of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the board of trustees of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. He was the 2008 recipient of the Raoul Wallenberg Award by the Raoul Wallenberg Committee of the United States for his Jewish philanthropy. Personal life Broidy is married to Robin Rosenzweig, a former senior executive of 20th Century Fox. After residing in Holmby Hills, they moved to Bel Air in 2005. The couple have three children.

Kildare, Ireland. He was named after Cardinal Newman, who was a friend of his mother. In later years, Craig added Noel to his name by Deed Poll. He was given the nickname \\"Bungo\\" by his older brother George, because he thought his little brother's bright and intelligent eyes resembled the famous elephant in Dublin Zoo, Bungo, who used to gaze at visitors at length as though he wanted to have a friendly conversation.

On the southern outskirts of the historical city center Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe passes through the Martinstor gate and continues on to Kaiserbr√ºcke, which crosses the Dreisam. Like many other streets in downtown Freiburg, Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe has a B√§chle. Most of the buildings between Siegesdenkmal and Martinstor were completely destroyed in World War II during an air raid on 27 November 1944. Because of the tram, which opened in 1901, the people in charge had to build arcades into the buildings on either side of the street in order to create more space for pedestrian and other traffic, so the tram could continue passing through the Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe. Traffic was regulated by traffic lights located at Bertoldsbrunnen.badische-seiten.de:\\"Die gro√üe Ga√ü\\" Retrieved on 26 November 2014 In November 1972,Gre√ü, Gerhard: \\"Verkehrsknoten Freiburg und seine Umgebung in den f√ºnfziger und sechziger Jahren\\", p. 49.

These restrictions do not affect the part of Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe which is located south of Martinstor.  History  The Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe was originally called the \\"Gro√üe Gass\\" (big alley), where a weekly market was held in medieval times. This is the reason for the great width compared to other streets in historic downtown. In the 15th century the weekly market was relocated to the area in front of the Freiburg Minster.Schadek, Hans: \\"Freiburg, ehemals - gestern - heute, Die Stadt im Wandel der letzten 100 Jahre\\", p.68. Steinkopf Verlag, 2004. The Albrecht-Ludwig-Brunnen in front of the Siegesdenkmal, 1868 The connection between the \\"Gro√üe Gass\\" and the settlements outside the city walls ‚Äì in the form of the Martinstor ‚Äì was severed in the 17th century when S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban had the city fortified and the settlements outside the city walls leveled. Salzstra√üe was then used as an access road from H√∂llental. For the bridal procession of the future French Queen Marie Antoinette, consisting of 235 people, 57 wagons and 250 draft and saddle horses, however, the street was not wide enough. In order to give her a welcome which befitted her social status in spite of this, it was decided that she was to enter the city through the gateway called Breisacher Tor via Gartenstra√üe on 4 May 1770. For this reason two new streets, \\"Dreisamstra√üe\\" and \\"Schreiberstra√üe\\", were built on the northern bank of the Dreisam. Three arcs of triumph were constructed in honor of the Dauphin of France by three of the city‚Äôs greater organisations: one by the City of Freiburg erected at the \\"Karlskaserne\\", barracks near the town; one by the University where what is today the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus) and one by the representation of the estates of the realm on \\"Gro√üe Gass\\". The latter was the biggest of them, measuring 24 meters in height and 18 meters in width. The arc was constructed by Johann Christian Wentzinger, using only wood and plaster. Marie Antoinette stayed at the Kageneckschen House, a locally well- known landmark, on Salzstra√üe, right before moving on to Schuttern Abbey on the morning of May 6.badische-zeitung.de:\\"Triumphbogen in der Kaiserstra√üe\\" Retrieved on 26 November 2014 Sketch of the construction plans for the Kaiserbr√ºcke After a visit from Joseph II in 1777, the thoroughfare was renamed \\"Kaiserstra√üe\\" in his honor. Around 1840, the thoroughfare was extended southwards, starting from the Martinstor down to the Dreisam. This section was initially named \\"Stephanienstra√üe\\" in honor of St√©phanie de Beauharnais, Grand Duchess of Baden. As a result, the new quarter built in this context was named \\"Stephanien-Vorstadt\\". At the turn of the century, there were two wells on the thoroughfare: the \\"Fischbrunnen\\" (German for \\"Fish Well\\") from the 16th century, which was superseded by the Bertoldsbrunnen in 1806, and the Albert-Ludwig-Brunnen by Alois Knittel from 1868. It was located close to the Siegesdenkmal on the former Kaiser-Wilhelms-Platz.Kempf, Friedrich: \\"Oeffentliche Brunnen und Denkm√§ler\\", in: Freiburg im Breisgau. Die Stadt und ihre Bauten, H. M. Poppen & Sohn, Freiburg 1898, S. 483 ff. During the time of National Socialism the entirety of the Kaiserstra√üe, including its extensions to the north (Z√§hringerstra√üe) and to the south (G√ºnterstalstra√üe), was renamed Adolf-Hitler-Stra√üe. After the Second World War the part that led from the city center to the Dreisam was called Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe, while the northern part of the former Adolf-Hitler-Stra√üe was given the name of Habsburgerstra√üe, in reference to the Habsburg descent of the emperor. In order to keep the established house numbers, however, today they start at 143 on the east side and at 166 on the west side of the Kaiser-Joseph- Stra√üe.Kalchthaler, Peter: \\"Freiburger Wege. Stra√üennamen mit Geschichte\\", p. 103 ff. Freiburg im Breisgau, 1998. . Numerous branches of big trading companies own offices on this street. In the 1970s there were five department stores here, at the beginning of the 21st century only two remained. Basler Hof, which was built by Konrad St√ºrtzel as a residence in the 15th century, is the only building without any commercial use nowadays. It is one of the most important secular buildings in Freiburg. The name derives from the Basel cathedral chapter who used the residence from 1587 to 1677 when they were forced to relocate to Freiburg as a result of the Reformation in their home town. It currently serves as the representative official residence of Freiburg's district president. The Kaiser Bridge, which originates from the turn of the century and is located at the other end of the Kaiser-Joseph- Stra√üe, used to be decorated with bronze statues of the Salian Henry V. and Frederick Barbarossa of the House of Hohenstaufen, created by Julius Seitz, as well as statues of Rudolf of Habsburg and Maximilian I., by Fridolin Dietsche. In 1942 they were dismantled and taken to Hamburg to be melted down. Although this did not happen until the war had ended, the municipal council voted down a potential recall of the statues in 1950 because of the potentially substantial transport costs. The statues' foundations can still be seen today.

It is not known if the series had a sponsor (surviving kinescopes of DuMont and WABD series suggest that, if it had a sponsor, the running time was about 24‚Äì25 minutes excluding commercials). It debuted February 4 and ran into May. The series featured dance numbers performed by children enrolled in various dancing schools in New York City. The program is likely lost, as most \\"local\\" shows of the 1950s are lost.

Its mission is to include their contributions in the canon of American art history through acquisitions from its collection by major museums, as well as through exhibitions, programs, and publications. The foundation derives its name from a 1921 poem by Langston Hughes (1902‚Äì1967) titled \\"The Negro Speaks of Rivers,\\" the last line of which is \\"My soul has grown deep like the rivers. The foundation is led by Maxwell L. Anderson, who serves as its president, and a member of its board of trustees. Anderson was previously director of the Dallas Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Collection The Souls Grown Deep Foundation Collection contains over 1,100 works by more than 160 artists, two-thirds of whom are women. Ranging from large-scale assemblages to works on paper, the foundation is particularly strong in works dating from the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. to the end of the twentieth century. The roots of these works can be traced to slave cemeteries and secluded woods. Following the Civil War, when the southern agrarian economy collapsed and rural African American sharecroppers and tenant farmers were forced to migrate for survival to major population centers‚Äîparticularly in and around Birmingham, Alabama, where iron and steel production created jobs‚Äîa new and more public language of quilts, funerary, and yard arts arose. Beyond painting, sculpture, assemblage, drawing, and textile-making, this tradition also included music, dance, oral literature, informal theater, culinary arts, and more. Much like jazz musicians, the artists of this tradition reflect the rich, symbolic world of the black rural South through highly charged works that address a wide range of revelatory social and political subjects. Among the artists represented are Thornton Dial, Lonnie Holley, Mary T. Smith, Joe Minter, Nellie Mae Rowe, Purvis Young, Emmer Sewell, Ronald Lockett, Joe Light, and the quiltmakers of Gee‚Äôs Bend.  Origins  Souls Grown Deep Foundation was founded in 2010, but traces its roots to the mid-1980s, when William S. Arnett, an art historian and collector, began to collect the artworks of largely undiscovered African American artists across nine southeastern states. Developed outside of the structure of schools, galleries, and museums, these rich yet largely unknown African American visual art traditions present a distinct post‚ÄìCivil Rights phenomenon that offers powerful insight and fresh perspectives into the most compelling political and social issues of our time. The majority of the works and ephemeral documents held by the foundation were compiled by Arnett and his sons over three decades, with the goal of creating a collection that could serve as a record and legacy of this culture. By the mid-1990s Arnett's efforts culminated in an ambitious survey exhibition of this tradition titled Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South, presented in conjunction with the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and in partnership with the City of Atlanta and the Michael C. Carlos Museum of Emory University. The subsequent two-volume publication Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South, remains the most in-depth examination of the movement. Several exhibitions in recent years have drawn works primarily from the collection today in the care of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, including The Quilts of Gee‚Äôs Bend, organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2002, which traveled to the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Cleveland Museum of Art, Chrysler Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, High Museum of Art, and four other museums; Thornton Dial in the 21st Century at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in 2006; Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial, organized by the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 2011, which traveled to the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Mint Museum, and the High Museum of Art; and Fever Within: The Art of Ronald Lockett, organized by the Ackland Art Museum in 2016, which traveled to the American Folk Art Museum and the High Museum of Art.  Transfer of collection  In 2014 the Souls Grown Deep Foundation began a multi-year program to transfer the majority of works in its care to the permanent collections of leading American and international art museums. To date, this program has led to the acquisition of over 350 works by more than 100 artists from the foundation's collection by 16 museums including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the High Museum of Art, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Ackland Art Museum, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the Brooklyn Museum, The Morgan Library & Museum, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Clark Atlanta University Art Museum, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, and The Phillips Collection. Exhibitions of acquisitions from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation include Revelations: Art from the African American South at the de Young Museum in San Francisco, History Refused to Die: Highlights from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation Gift at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Cosmologies from the Tree of Life: Art from the African American South at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and Souls Grown Deep: Artists from the African American South at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

A midfielder, Coghlan played in the Football League for Darlington and in non-league football for numerous clubs in the north-east of England. Football career Sunderland-born Coghlan began his football career with Darlington. As a 16-year-old, he was playing for their reserve team, and was included in the travelling squad, though not among the matchday 16, for Darlington's League Cup visit to Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2003. A week later, he was an unused substitute for the Third Division match at home to Southend United, and on 11 October, as a member of \\"one of the youngest and smallest squads in the Third Division\\"Coghlan himself had been dubbed \\"pint-sized\\"he made his debut in the Football League. He entered the match as a second-half substitute with his team already two goals down at home to Bristol Rovers; it finished as a 4‚Äì0 defeat. In the Football League Trophy, against a Hull City side with eleven changes from their previous league match, Coghlan's \\"low, fierce shot\\" was blocked, rebounding to Mark Sheeran who scored to reduce Hull's lead to 2‚Äì1, but Darlington were eliminated. He played twice more in the league in December, before joining Northern Premier League club Harrogate Town on loan in March 2004. The manager thought he \\"maybe struggled with the pace of the game\\" in his first appearance, in a defeat at Alfreton Town, and he was back with Darlington a few days later. He played regularly for the reserves in 2004‚Äì05according to his 2004 profile on the club's website, he had \\"shown he is a good passer of the ball with plenty to offer in midfield\\"but in November was one of seven players with contracts due to expire at the end of the season whom manager David Hodgson listed for transfer or loan and told to prove their worth to the club. After spending time with Bishop Auckland, another Northern Premier League club, on loan, Coghlan finished the season with Darlington's reserves, and was released when his contract expired. He then went on a tour of non-league football in the north-east of England, playing for clubs including Ryhope CA, Durham City, Crook Town, another spell at Bishop Auckland, Sunderland RCA, Jarrow Roofing, Chester-le-Street Town, Seaham Red Star, and most recently Washington. He also captained Humbledon Plains Farm, a Sunderland-based team, to victory in the 2014 FA Sunday Cup.

It is named after an Englishman, Frederic Eden, who designed the garden in 1884 and owned the property for a long time. From 1927 it was owned by Princess Aspasia Manos and her daughter Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia. Between 1979 and 2000, it was owned by the Austrian painter and architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who abandoned the garden to nature. History In 1884, Frederic Eden, a great-uncle of the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, and his wife Caroline, sister of the garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, bought an area of six acres on the Venetian island of Giudecca. It contained a former outbuilding of the convent of the Sisters of Santa Croce. The property was later expanded by two acres when the Venetian authorities enlarged the island. The couple created Venice's largest private garden, an English landscape garden symbolic of the British presence in Venice, containing statues, roses and animals. It was frequented by many figures from the world of the arts, including Marcel Proust, Rainer Maria Rilke, Walter Sickert, Henry James, Eleonora Duse and Baron Corvo. The garden featured a large number of willow pergolas covered in roses, and extensive plantings of Madonna lily as well as other English flowers. Paths around the garden were surfaced with local seashells. There were lawns, courts and a walk lined with cypresses.Ottewill (1989), p. 145. In 1903, Eden published A Garden in Venice, a short book describing his creation of the garden. Frederic Eden died in 1916 and his wife Caroline survived him until 1928. A year before her death, she sold the Garden of Eden to Princess Aspasia Manos, the widow of King Alexander of Greece. She acquired the villa thanks to the financial support of her friend Sir James Horlick. The Princess lived in the villa with her daughter Alexandra until 1940, when the Greco-Italian war erupted. Damaged during World War II, the villa was rebuilt by Aspasia when peace returned. In 1945, the Garden of Eden was designated a Monumento Nazionale. Aspasia lived in the villa until her death in 1972 and the Garden of Eden passed to her daughter. Alexandra made some suicide attempts on the property. In 1979, she sold it to the Austrian painter Friedensreich Hundertwasser. Hundertwasser allowed the flowering plants to die and encouraged wild vegetation. He died in 2000, leaving the property to the ownership of a foundation. It is not open to the public.

It has undergone moments of prosperity and was once noted as one of the most dominant world powers in the 17th Century. It was heavily involved in the Atlantic Trade that had a large impact on its economy and growth. There is no clear definition for the Atlantic Trade, but researchers have concluded it may be referred to as: Trade with the New World, and trade with Asia through the Atlantic including, but not limited to, imperialism and slavery based undertakings.(Acemoglu, 2005: 547) Among the most important of these traders were the Dutch and the British. It is noted that these two nations experienced a more rapid growth than most due to their non-absolutist political institutions. This is only one of many benefactors that played a large role in the shaping in the growth and economic change within the Netherlands that occurred throughout the 16th and 17th Centuries.  The Rise of Dutch Independence  The Dutch success in trade did not come without struggle and conflict. Studies show that the Dutch had several qualities that afforded their trade system to rise above other European states throughout the duration of Atlantic trade. Dutch merchants have always had access and opportunities providing a gateway to profitable trade. They also had autonomy. Before the Dutch Revolt, though, the Dutch were under the control of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Habsburg Empire limited the power of Dutch merchants and their influence on trade. The Empire had control and tried to gain even more over the fiscal revenues from the Netherlands. Conflict amongst the merchants and the empire began to grow and independence and political institutions were the result.(Acemoglu, 2005: 566) Amidst a revolt and a revolution, the Dutch were able to steadily improve their trading. Several important modifications were made to both Dutch military and commercial strategies. Before long, the Dutch had gained access to Asian and American trade centers. Leading this drive to independence was the merchants. The 15th Century marked the start of the expansion of the Dutch economy. Throughout this time the Dutch experienced growth in economic institutions that include agriculture, shipping, and public finance.(James D. Tracy, 1985; Jan Luiten van Zanden, 1993) In 1590, the beginning of divergence between the South and North of Europe as well as the ‚Äòexplosion‚Äô of Dutch commerce and the early stages of Amsterdam growing as a large financial capital. The growing Atlantic trade was edging out the once profitable Baltic route. With trade growing along this route and specialization prospering, the Dutch were ultimately victorious in their pursuits against the Habsburgs. Israel states: > From 1590, there was a dramatic improvement in the Republic's economic > circumstances. Commerce and shipping expanded enormously, as did the towns. > As a result, the financial power of the states rapidly grew, and it was > possible to improve the army vastly, both qualitatively, and quantitatively, > within a short space of time. The army in- creased from 20,000 men in 1588 > to 32,000 by 1595, and its artillery, methods of transportation, and > training were transformed. By 1629, the Dutch were able to field an army of > 77,000 men, 50 percent larger than the Spanish army of Flanders‚Ä≥(Israel, > 1995: 507) The Dutch prospered immensely during this time. The leading benefactor of this growth was trade and the means of which they manifested it. They did so particularly through conflict and specialization. Now we see the importance of competitive goods, the Dutch traded what was in demand and the strategy proved to be very favorable for them. They were long distance tradesmen and had some breathing space as far as trade regulations went which also contributed to their growth. This is in comparison with the previous Habsburg restrictions. In his article, Acemuglu uses this evidence to prove that Atlantic trade led to the enrichment of merchants, which resulted in the development of political institutions. Said institutions are responsible for constraining the power of the crown.(Acemoglu, 2005: 566-8)  War and Conflict  The Eighty Years' War also goes by the name: ‚ÄòThe War of Dutch Independence‚Äô (1568-1648). The war was a spurred by a revolt of the seventeen provinces within the Habsburg Empire.(Maanen, 2002: 68). Phillip II of Spain was leading the Habsburgs in the initial stages of the war. The war began due to high taxation within the Netherland regions. William of Orange, who had been exiled from the empire, led the revolting provinces to their first leg of success in the long war. Through the Dutch resistance and revolt, they had achieved the status of The Republic of the Seven United Netherlands in 1581 This declaration entered the Dutch and Habsburgs into a twelve-year truce, only to be disrupted once more by the start of a new war in 1619. The Thirty Years' War is known as one of the bloodiest wars in European history. It translated into a war of religions. It can also be recognized as a series of conflicts between feudalism and early capitalism (Evan, 2014: 36). The war ended with the Peace of Westphalia. The treated formally recognized the Dutch as an independent republic.(Glete, 2002: 106) =Fall of Antwerp= Antwerp was seized during the Eighty Wars' War from 1584 to 1585. Of the Seventeen Provinces and Northwestern Europe, Antwerp was the economic and financial center of these locations. Antwerp eventually became heavily involved in the rebellion against the Spanish Habsburgs. Ultimately, the city joined became the 'capital' of the Dutch Revolt. This status became official once they joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579. The Spanish held their ground against the defensive Dutch and because of their cannons and strong troops they proved to be successful in their siege of the land. Antwerp's Protestant population was forced to relocate or migrate from their once homeland. Many of the skilled craftsmen and merchants migrated northbound to ultimately provide the foundation for Dutch trade expansion and growth. Their new home formally became The United Provinces of the Netherlands or as previously mentioned: The Dutch Republic.Boxer, Charles Ralph, The Dutch Seaborne Empire, 1600-1800, p. 18, Taylor & Francis, 1977 Antwerp was also the home of the Shelde River Estuary Port. When the Spanish captured this port, it became a turning point in the war. Prior to the Fall of Antwerp, Portuguese had been sending gold, ivory, sugar, and other products from the Atlantic to the main port in Antwerp.(Postma 2003, 20)  Dutch Trade Specialization: Competitive Goods  The United Provinces of the Netherlands were growing quickly when the truce was established. Their colonies spanned across five continents and their growth can be considered as what was ‚Äòa new type of global trade and the formation of the world economy.‚Äô (Evan, 2014: 25). The Dutch trade differed from its rivals in many ways. They paid close attention to the relation between risk and profit. If the potential profit was greater than the imposed risk, they were willing (and managed to) trade with their wartime enemies. The middle class played a key role also; they had a large amount of capital accrued within. Due to the Netherlands deficiency in mineral affluence, they had to find another source of profit. They began specializing in competitive goods. Competitive goods are defined as: A production of goods that are not dependent on a particular climate, deposits, and can be produced anywhere in the world.(Evan, 2014: 25) These goods included, but were not limited to: Scandinavian wood, means for shipbuilding, iron, copper, wheat, rye, North Sea Fish, and English wool. The Dutch faced the pressure of competition with several growing competitors. The Dutch focused on their growing agriculture, their domination in continental trade markets, and their widely praised skills as seafarers.  16th Century Dutch Economy  Fishing and agriculture shaped the economy of the Dutch in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the early 15th century, Antwerp in modern-day Belgium was the commercial capital of Northern Europe. The Dutch Revolt against Spanish Habsburgs had a large impact on the Fall of Antwerp in 1585. Those who inhabited those lands were in need of a new home that offered security. These peoples included merchants and Calvinist craftsmen. They eventually went to the Northern Netherlands. Holland and Zeeland were growing in population. These two provinces were also heavily involved in maritime operations and productions. For most of the 16th century, these lands were considered more rural than those of the southern Netherlands. They focused on slaughter cattle as a large means of trade.(Herreld, 2004) At the end of the 16th century the Dutch had vastly expanded their maritime explorations. They spanned to Asia, the Mediterranean, and across the Atlantic. The Dutch were making their way to become a major world power. In 1595, Dutch voyages to Asia began with Cornelis de Houtman. The night before his voyage began, the Dutch had already established four trading networks within the Transatlantic. These networks included Spain with Spanish America and Portugal with their Brazilian colonial holding.(Postma 2003, 24)  Transition to Trade of Non-Competitive Goods  Non-competitive goods are referred to as: goods that are produced in only one spot. Non-competitive goods include: sugar and tobacco from the Caribbean, tea, pepper, camphor, spices, sandalwood and teak wood from Southeast Asia, cinnamon and cloves from Ceylon, and Chinese and Japanese porcelain and silk. The Netherlands were becoming a melting pot for religious acceptation and variation. The goods they produced were affected by the religions of those who had migrated into their lands. The Dutch were able to overcome their Portuguese rival by manifesting such effort into the trade of these particular goods.(Evan, 2014: 26) Some historians argue that sugar acted as the product that drove the expansion into the Atlantic by the Dutch. This trade pressured the Dutch to gain access to Brazil from South America. In 1585, Phillip II gave permission to Dutch rebels to take ships to Brazil in order to conduct business as a favor to Spanish Merchants. They originally sent three ships. A few years later, 14 Dutch ships continued sailing to Brazil, carrying cargo for these Spanish merchants. In between times of war, these ships frequently had to stop at a neutral country mid-trip and adopt a new nationality for the time being. By the late of the 1590s, approximately eighteen Dutch ships had gained access to Brazil. These ships would bring back mostly sugar, but also Brazilian wood, cotton, and ginger.(Postma 2003, 26)  17th Century Dutch Trade  A truce that occurred amongst the Dutch Republic and Spain in 1609 opened up trade access to the Mediterranean to the Dutch. This was the first time Dutch ships had gained such access since they had entered into trade with Asia.(De Vries, 2010: 717) The Dutch East India Company was established in 1602. It is also referred to as the VOC. This company was a crucial tool used to control Dutch colonial and commercial trade affairs. Investors within the company were granted an allotted percentage of profits depending on the sum of the capital invested. With the help of this company, the Dutch expanded their occupation to Cape Town, Ceylon, and Malacca. They also established posts for trading in the latter two places.(Evan, 2014: 25) VOC imports into Europe consisted largely of spices, tea, coffee, drugs, perfumes, dyestuffs, sugar, and saltpeter. Half to two-thirds of the worth of Asian goods imported into Europe were accounted for in Dutch exports of precious metals.(O‚ÄôRourke, Williamson, 2002-4: 423) It wasn‚Äôt long before other nations caught onto this business and followed the Dutch trend. In the beginning of the 17th century, A round-trip from Europe to the East Indies during this time cost between thirty and thirty-two Euros per ton. Halfway through the 17th century, though, prices dropped to between sixteen and twenty-three euros per ton. The fall in price was due to the Dutch having to deal with Asian revolts in their local waters, building forts, conferring agreements, displaying the flag, and often keeping away their fellow European competitors. All of these conflicts occurred leading up to 1640. In the time following, the Dutch East India Company developed a smaller fleet of ships to deal with these problems.O‚ÄôRourke, Williamson, 2002-4: 423-7) During the truce, the Dutch also began producing their own tobacco. They had originally 'bartered' with the Indians for tobacco, but after they expanded to the West Indies they began to produce their own. Before long, the Dutch were on par with the Spaniards in terms of how much tobacco they made. This product trade also established Dutch connections with Virginia. A huge segment of trade of Virginia tobacco fell into the Dutch realm. At the beginning of the 17th century, the center of Northern European tobacco trade was located in Zeeland.(Postma 2003, 30) Still in the midst of the Thirty Years War, Phillip III attempted to prevent the Dutch from furthering their growth into the West and East Indies. He did so by offering peace and independence in exchange. They declined, though, as they had already manifested a great deal of investors in the Dutch East India Company. In 1621, The Dutch West India Company was founded. This Company‚Äôs focus was primarily on trade with Latin America and Africa. The Dutch were prospering like never before from their newfound commerce and enterprise. The 17th Century was a time that the Dutch had experienced what was the highest standard of living in all of Europe. Their overseas trade within their two companies had afforded them to become the largest naval fleet in the world. This fleet was the means for the Dutch to patrol and dominate long-term trade routes. The fleet also allowed their colonial provisions and power to grow even further. Despite potential setbacks that fighting with the Portuguese could have caused the Dutch were successful in these battles in several aspects. They gained control over more territories in Southeast Asia. They included: Sumatra, Java, Malay Peninsula, southern region of Borneo, and the islands of the Moluccas and West New Guinea. They even expanded as far as a settlement in Australia; however it did not last due to lack of economic profit. The Dutch were so profit-focused that they even exchanged New Amsterdam for Archipelago with Britain. The small island in Moluccas was home to a large stock of spices.(Evan, 2014: 23)  Anglo-Dutch Conflict in the 17th Century  Relations with the British took a turn for the worst in the late 17th Century. In 1661, the British passed the Navigation Acts in order to prevent its colonies from trading with overseas merchants and/or vessels. This act was arguably passed as an offensive move towards the Dutch due to their triumph in global commerce. The passing of this act resulted in three separate Anglo-Dutch wars throughout 1652-1675.(Nettles, 1952-5: 6) The first war lasted throughout 1652-1654. The British won this war and took with them 1,000 Dutch merchant ships. The second of these wars was a result of two incidents. The first occurred when the English captured two Dutch posts located in West Africa and the latter incident being the taking of New Amsterdam. This was a rather detrimental war to both sides and ended due to exhaustion of materials and power. The war concluded, though, and both sides claimed victory in this war that lasted from 1664-1674.(Nelson-Burns, 2014) The third Anglo-Dutch War the British gave support to the French to invade the Dutch. Due to common concern in waging war with the Dutch, both the French and British signed the Treaty of Dover. The Dutch had since allied with the Spanish (Nelson-Burns). The war resulted in the defeat of the Dutch. The Dutch were forced to retreat from southern trade and the English ultimately gained their losses.(Nettles, 1952-5: 6)  Competing Nations  The Dutch had competed in trade industries with the British for a very long time. By the 18th century, the British had begun to catch up due to their mercantilist ideologies and practices. The fourth Anglo-Dutch war proved to be crucial in the downfall of the Dutch during their prosperous trading time. The British had sustained a blockade that proved to be impenetrable by the Dutch. Trading had come to a halt. Britain was on the verge of an industrial revolution and close to finally beating out its long time European competitors. Trade within the VOC was immensely affected by the loss of the Dutch in this war and they had maintained large amounts of public debts also. The company was of great importance to the Dutch and it was kept alive by the emergency aid coming from the States of Holland.

The coloring produces uses at most \\\\Delta+1 colors, where \\\\Delta is the maximum degree of the graph. This is optimal for some graphs, and by Vizing's theorem it uses at most one color more than the optimal for all others. It was first published by Jayadev Misra and David Gries in 1992. It is a simplification of a prior algorithm by B√©la Bollob√°s. This algorithm is the fastest known almost-optimal algorithm for edge coloring, executing in O(EV) time. A faster time bound of O(E\\\\sqrt{V\\\\logV}) was claimed in a 1985 technical report by Gabow et al., but this has never been published. In general, optimal edge coloring is NP-complete, so it is very unlikely that a polynomial time algorithm exists. There are however exponential time exact edge coloring algorithms that give an optimal solution. Fans A fan F=[x_1,x_2,x_3] of v (dashed edges are uncolored), (v,x_1),(v,x_2),(v,x_3) are the fan edges. F'=[x_1,x_2] is also a fan of v, but it is not maximal. A color x is said to be free of an edge (u,v) on u if c(u,z) ‚â† x for all (u,z) \\\\in E(G) : z‚â†v. A fan of a vertex u is a sequence of vertices F[1:k] that satisfies the following conditions: #F[1:k] is a non-empty sequence of distinct neighbors of u #(F[1],u) \\\\in E(G) is uncolored #The color of (F[i+1],u) is free on F[i] for 1 ‚â§ i < k Examples of cdx paths: ac,cg,gd is a red-green_c path and bd,dg is a red-oranged path. Given a fan F, any edge (F[i], X) for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k is a fan edge. Let c and d be colors. A cdX-path is an edge path that goes through vertex X, only contains edges colored c and d and is maximal (we cannot add any other edge as it would include edges with a color not in {c, d}). Note that only one such path exists for a vertex X, as at most one edge of each color can be adjacent to a given vertex. =Rotating a fan= Rotating the fan F = [x1, x2, x3] on the left results in the fan on the right Given a fan F[1:k] of a vertex X, the \\"rotate fan\\" operation does the following (in parallel): #c(F[i],X)=c(F[i+1],X) #Uncolor (F[k],X) This operation leaves the coloring valid, as for each i, c(F[i + 1], X) was free on (F[i], X). =Inverting a path= Inverting the red-greena path from the graph on the left results in the graph on the right. The operation \\"invert the cdX-path\\" switches every edge on the path colored c to d and every edge colored d to c. Inverting a path can be useful to free a color on X if X is one of the endpoints of the path: if X was adjacent to color c but not d, it will now be adjacent to color d, not c, freeing c for another edge adjacent to X. The flipping operation will not alter the validity of the coloring since for the endpoints, only one of {c, d} can be adjacent to the vertex, and for other members of the path, the operation only switches the color of edges, no new color is added. Algorithm algorithm Misra & Gries edge coloring algorithm is input: A graph G. output: A proper coloring c of the edges of G. Let U := E(G) while U ‚â† ‚àÖ do Let (u, v) be any edge in U. Let F[1:k] be a maximal fan of u starting at F[1] = v. Let c be a color that is free on u and d be a color that is free on F[k]. Invert the cdu path Let w ‚àà V(G) be such that w ‚àà F, F' = [F[1]...w] is a fan and d is free on w. Rotate F' and set c(u, w) = d. U := U ‚àí {(u, v)} end while Proof of correctness The correctness of the algorithm is proved in three parts. First, it is shown that the inversion of the cdu path guarantees a vertex w such that w ‚àà F, F' = [F[1]...w] is a fan and d is free on w. Then, it is shown that the edge coloring is proper and requires at most Œî + 1 colors. =Path inversion guarantee= Prior to the inversion, there are two cases: # The fan has no edge colored d. Since F is a maximal fan and d is free on F[k], this implies there is no edge with color d adjacent to u, otherwise, if there was, this edge would be after F[k], as d is free on F[k], but F was maximal, which is a contradiction. Thus, d is free on u, and since c is also free on u, the cdu path is empty and the inversion has no effect on the graph. Set w = F[k]. #The fan has one edge with color d. Let (u,F[x+1]) be this edge. Note that x + 1 ‚â† 1 since (u,F[1]) is uncolored. Thus, d is free on F[x]. Also, x ‚â† k since the fan has length k but there exists a F[x + 1]. We can now show that after the inversion, for each y ‚àà {1, ..., x ‚àí 1, x + 1, ..., k}, the color of (F[y + 1], u) is free on F[y]. Note that prior to the inversion, the color of (u, F[y + 1]) is not c or d, since c is free on u and (u, F[x + 1]) has color d and the coloring is valid. The inversion only affects edges that are colored c or d, so (1) holds. F[x] can either be in the cdu path or not. If it is not, then the inversion will not affect the set of free colors on F[x], and d will remain free on it. We can set w = F[x]. Otherwise, we can show that F is still a fan and d remains free on F[k]. Since d was free on F[x] before the inversion and F[x] is on the path, F[x] is an endpoint of the cdu path and c will be free on F[x] after the inversion. The inversion will change the color of (u, F[x + 1]) from d to c. Thus, since c is now free on F[x] and (1) holds, F remains a fan. Also, d remains free on F[k], since F[k] is not on the cdu path (suppose that it is; since d is free on F[k], then it would have to be an endpoint of the path, but u and F[x] are the endpoints). Select w = F[k]. In any case, the fan F' is a prefix of F, which implies F' is also a fan. =The edge coloring is proper= This can be shown by induction on the number of colored edges. Base case: no edge is colored, this is valid. Induction step: suppose this was true at the end of the previous iteration. In the current iteration, after inverting the path, d will be free on u, and by the previous result, it will also be free on w. Rotating F' does not compromises the validity of the coloring. Thus, after setting c(u,w) = d, the coloring is still valid. =The algorithm requires at most Œî + 1 colors= In a given step, only colors c and d are used. Since u is adjacent to at least one uncolored edge and its degree is bounded by Œî, at least one color in {1,...,Œî} is available for c. For d, F[k] may have degree Œî and no uncolored adjacent edge. Thus, a color Œî + 1 may be required. Complexity At each step, the rotation uncolors the edge (u,w) while coloring edges (u,F[1]) and (u,v) which was previously uncolored. Thus, one additional edge gets colored. Hence, the loop will run O(E) times. Finding the maximal fan, the colors c and d and invert the cdu path can be done in O(V) time. Finding w and rotating F' takes O(\\\\deg(u))\\\\in O(V) time. Finding and removing the edge (u,v) can be done using a stack in constant time (pop the last element) and this stack can be populated in O(E) time. Thus, each iteration of the loop takes O(V) time, and the total running time is O(E+EV)=O(EV).

He was also responsible for exhibits of the French colonies in various international expositions. Early years Georges Schwob d'H√©ricourt was born in Lure, Haute-Sa√¥ne on 21 January 1864, son of Eug√®ne Georges Schwob d'H√©ricourt (1830‚Äì1912) and Clarisse Anna Cahen (1836‚Äì1919). His family was Jewish, had been living in Alsace since 1681, and had established a major textile enterprise. His uncle √âdouard Schwob (1844‚Äì1929) had added \\"d'H√©ricourt\\" to the family name after the town of H√©ricourt of which he was mayor from 1879 until his death. Georges Schwob d'H√©ricourt graduated from the √âcole des hautes √©tudes commerciales (HEC). He married Emma Gradis, from an old Jewish family from Bordeaux who owned the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise pour le commerce avec les colonies et l‚Äô√©tranger, a trading enterprise. His wife was the younger sister of Raoul Gradis and aunt of Gaston Gradis. Pre-war enterprises Georges Schwob d'H√©ricourt started his career in small mining businesses. Charbonnages de Nikitowka was absorbed in 1905 by Soci√©t√© des sels gemmes et houill√®res de la Russie m√©ridionale. √âtains de Portugal was absorbed in 1907 by Soci√©t√© des √âtains et wolfram de Portugal. He was also involved in tramway companies and in the Soci√©t√© d‚Äô√©lectricit√© et d‚Äôautomobile Mors. The automobile business of this company was taken over in 1907 by Andr√© Citro√´n, and Schwob became involved in the Citroen businesses. By 1908 he was president of several mutual aid societies and treasurer of the Union des tramways de France. He was one of the heads of the Maison Gradis, which handled two thirds of the imports from Martinique, and sat on the board of several industrial companies. Colonial exhibitions From 1900 Schwob was involved in organizing colonial exhibitions. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour for the 1903 exhibition in Hanoi. He helped organize the French colonial exhibition at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, was in charge of the section of Commerce and Colonization at the 1905 Exposition Universelle et Internationale de Li√®ge and of the Trade and Industry section of the 1907 National Colonial Exhibition. He was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1908. At this time he was a member of the supreme council of the colonies and of the administrative council of the colonial office, vice-president of the national committee of colonial exhibitions, foreign trade adviser to France. He was in charge of the French colonies section at the Franco-British Exhibition (1908), and was appointed commissioner of the French colonies section of the International Exhibition of Brussels in 1910. Schwob was attacked by several parliamentary deputies who accused him of ignoring exhibition themes that needed special skills in favor of general themes and spectacular or decorative exhibits. He was also accused of promoting foreign interests due to his business interests in the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise des t√©l√©phones Berliner and the Brussels-based West African Fisheries company. In May 1925 Schwob was responsible for the colonial pavilions at the Exposition des Arts d√©coratifs in Paris. In 1928 he was named administrator of the general colonial agency, and was made president of the 1931 Vincennes Colonial Exhibition. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour in 1931 for his work for the exhibition in Vincennes. Financier and businessman In November 1915 Schwob was reappointed to the board of the Banque de l‚ÄôAfrique occidentale (BAO). At the end of World War I (1914‚Äì18) he introduced Adolphe K√©gresse, a specialist in caterpillar tracks, to Hinstin and Citro√´n. In December 1920 he became administrator of the Cie g√©n√©rale des colonies. He became president of the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise pour le Commerce avec les Colonies et l‚ÄôEtranger, the new name adopted by the Maison Gradis in 1921. In 1922 Schwob was president of the Soci√©t√© industrielle marocaine, involved in activities that ranged from iron foundries to lemonade manufacture. He was involved in various other colonial enterprises including gas in Morocco, sawmills in the C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, agriculture and sugar in Madagascar and distilleries in Indochina. In 1923 he was director of the Est-Asiatique fran√ßais company, extracting lumber in Siam and Laos for a sawmill in Saigon. In 1924 Schwob was president of the syndicate for trade in raw rubber, and in 1925 was president of the syndicate for rice trade on the commercial exchange on Paris. He represented the Maison Gradis on the board of the Soci√©t√© Agricole et Industrielle de Ben-Cui, a rubber production company. From January 1926 he represented the BAO in the new Banque de Madagascar. In December 1932 he succeeded Auguste-Rapha√´l Fontaine as president of Distilleries de l‚ÄôIndochine, holding this position until the start of the Japanese occupation in World War II (1939‚Äì45). He became vice- president of BAO in 1933. In the autumn of 1934 he was elected director of the Banque des produits alimentaires et coloniaux. He was president of La R√©union fran√ßaise in 1937, an insurance company, but in conformance with the anti- Jewish law of 1940 he resigned this position, although he remained a director until early in 1941. Schwob died in Aix-en-Provence on 30 August 1942.

Teach me prudently the correct order And admonish me to reach it! Reliably you come from Heaven And return as a messenger to it. Bring the offers, pains and tears To the King's court; Provide the Giver of talents With a small gift from the servant! Foster me, the unfortunate, embracing With the sweetest consolation! Prompt me, the dormant, To the works of salvation! Blame me, when I hesitate, Give me the strength, when I fall! Radiant of the pure light, Which floods out from God, I am in search of holiness. Deliver me from stain, So that the white lilies of chastity Be not sullied. By your powerful right repel The powers of the Devil to Hell; Destroy the pleasure of the flesh, Which arises from pride, So that, protected by your arms, I may be victorious. Break the inflexible obstinacy Of the merciless heart; I am oppressed by the burden of sin, Relieve it by your powerful hand And spare me the punishment of the guilty By your prayers. In storms let hurry the times The temporal life will assault! Let me disdain the ephemeral And always seek the eternal, So that my noble soul Would remain in Heaven. When mortal struggle is imminent, Assist me, quavering, firmly!

Historic  Founded in 1981 in Florence by Roberto Casamonti, Tornabuoni Art is specialised in Italian art of the second half of the 20th Century. It established exhibition spaces in Crans Montana in 1993, Milan in 1995, Forte Dei Marmi in 2004, Paris in 2009 and London in 2015. The ensemble of galleries is today run by his son Michele Casamonti. The Casamonti family owns the world's largest collection of works by Lucio Fontana. Tornabuoni Art Paris presents the work of artists such as Fontana, Burri, Castellani, Manzoni, Dorazio, Bonalumi, Dadamaino and Boetti, as well as those of major protagonists of the Italian Novecento, such as De Chirico, Morandi, Balla, Severeni and Sironi. The gallery also proposes works of essential artists of the 20th Century, such as Picasso, Mir√≤, Kandinsky, Hartung, Poliakoff, Dubuffet, Lam, Matta, Christo, Wesselmann, Warhol and Basquiat. Paris Since inaugurating its Parisian space in 2009, with an exhibition dedicated to Lucio Fontana, Tornabuoni Art has organized numerous monographic exhibitions, showing the works of Alighiero Boetti (2010), Arnaldo Pomodoro (2011), Enrico Castellani (2011), Mimmo Rotella (2012), Giuseppe Capogrossi (2013), Dadamaino (2013) and in 2014 presented an exceptional exhibition \\"Lucio Fontana, rediscovery of a masterpiece\\" in parallel with the retrospective at the Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the first exhibition in France of Turi Simeti and most recently retrospectives of Alberto Biasi (2015), Giuseppe Chiari (2015), Paolo Scheggi (2015) and Piero Dorazio (2016). In February 2017, the gallery inaugurated its new space in the Marais (9, Rue Charlot), with an exhibition dedicated to Alighiero Boetti, and organised the first solo exhibitions in France of Emilio Isgr√≤ and Francesca Pasquali. These solo-shows were followed by an exhibition on avant-garde artists in Post-War Rome \\"La Dolce Vita\\", a personal exhibition on the iconic 20th Century Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, and those of Afro (2018) and Alberto Burri (2018).

The film tells of the arrival and settlement in the Americas of Jewish-origin New Christians (Sephardic Jewish converts to Catholicism, also known as conversos in Spanish or anusim in Hebrew) in the sixteenth century, and the lives of the Sephardic Bnei Anusim (their assimilated descendants) today. The documentary's title is a pun on the Spanish term for Latin America (Am√©rica Latina), where \\"Ladina\\" is the feminine adjectival form of the noun \\"Ladino\\", a reference to the Ladino language, the traditional Judaeo-Spanish language of the Sephardic Jews. Content The Israeli filmmaker Yaron Avitov addresses on his film the context of the history of the arrival and settlement of Sephardic anusim to the Americas; and how their emigration from Spain and Portugal to the Iberian colonies in the New World in the sixteenth century was due largely to the unceasing religious persecution of Jewish-origin New Christians by the Inquisition back in Iberia, irrespective of whether they were sincere Christian converts or if they were indeed marranos (crypto-Jews secretly practicing their former Jewish faith as best they could behind closed doors). The film presses on the issue that how this Jewish-origin population emigrated to the Americas from the sixteenth century (during the time of the Inquisition) should be studied thoroughly again. Avitov is immersed in a multi-year investigation through South America and Central America in search of the motives, reasons and consequences of this immigration. As the film progresses, the viewer not only discovers the origins of the Jewish-descended population of Latin America, but also the places where one can find the presence of their descendants today, and their impact, past and present, of these Sephardic anusim migrants and their Sephardic Bnei anusim descendants in the cultural landscape of Latin America. Sephardic Bnei Anusim (descendants of these early immigrants) from 10 countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, and Peru in South America give their testimonials. Others from Mexico, Cuba, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama in Central America are also interviewed. The documentary takes us through time with the testimonies of these descendants, in remote places around Latin America where their Jewish anusim ancestors settled in the hope that it would give their children and later descendants the chance to live and prosper in a new free world, without fear from the persecution of the Inquisition, though the Inquisition eventually followed, resulting in an almost complete assimilation and absorption. Five centuries after the migratory mission of their Jewish anusim ancestors, the success of their journey for survival is assessed, if not in the maintaining of the Jewish faith and culture, then at least in the perpetuation of their living descendants, who are more alive and numerous today than ever. Avitov presents among other evidence of this historical episode facts and cultural vestiges which remain today, and which can be found embedded in the culture of the local peoples across the Americas, similar to traditional customs of the New Christian converts who came from Spain and Portugal fleeing the Inquisition. Today there are words, idioms, sayings (in Ladino) and even many customs that persist among these groups in the Americas, who practice these customs often unknowing that they originate in the traditions of their Jewish ancestors.

Date The date of the National day is traditionally determined by the reigning Prince. The previous Princes often chose the day of the saint they were named after. For instance the late Prince Rainier III chose 19 November, the day that celebrates St. Rainier. When Prince Albert II ascended the throne he ended this tradition by choosing the same day as his father, instead of the day of St. Albert, 15 November. The 19 November also happens to be the same day of Albert II's official ascension to the throne. Celebrations National day is typically celebrated with fireworks over the harbour the evening before and a mass in the St. Nicholas Cathedral the next morning. The people of Monaco may celebrate by displaying the Monegasque flag. It is an opportunity to see the pomp and circumstance of the Principality. Knights of Malta, distinguished ambassadors, consuls and state officials wear medal-laden uniforms as they congregate in the Saint Nicholas Cathedral after the mass. The Princely Family of Monaco is expected to show up on national day.

The base was located 14 km from the Laos border, 40 km south of Kh√¢m ƒê·ª©c and approximately 85 km northwest of Kon Tum. 5th Special Forces Detachment A-749 was based here in October 1963, Detachment A-5 was based here in December 1964, Detachment A-211 was based here in 1965 and Detachment A-242 from October 1966. The base was also used as a launch site for MACV-SOG operations into Laos. On 29 May 1968 a de Havilland Canada C-7 Caribou #62-4189 was hit by mortar fire as it landed at Dak Pek causing the right wing to separate, there were no casualties. On 12 April 1970 a People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) force estimated at two battalions attacked the camp. Sappers attacked many of the bunkers and the defenders were forced back to a small fighting position before air support forced the PAVN back. The siege of Dak Pek last until early May when the PAVN withdrew. Total losses were 34 CIDG and 420 PAVN killed. The PAVN simultaneously attacked the nearby Dak Seang Camp.

Smith's research has focused on how cells of the very early vertebrate embryo form the specialised tissues of muscle, skin, blood and bone. His discovery of a mesoderm-inducing factor secreted by a cell line and establishing its identity as activin transformed the study of induction in the early embryo. He also showed that activin specifies different cell types at different thresholds and that characteristic genes like Brachyury are turned on at specific concentrations. In other work he shed light on the molecular basis of gastrulation, and especially the role of non-canonical Wnt signalling. His earlier work demonstrated threshold responses in chick limb development and also showed that the mitogenic response to growth factors can be active when attached to the extracellular matrix.

This study is housed at the Boston VA and incorporates neuroimaging as well. In Religion, Neuroscience, and the Self, McNamara uses contemporary neuroscientific research on religious experience, the Self and personhood to deepen, enhance and interrogate the theological and philosophical set of ideas known as Personalism McNamara, Patrick. Religion, Neuroscience and the Self: A New Personalism. Routledge, 2019.. He proposes a new eschatological form of personalism that is consistent with current neuroscience models of relevant brain functions concerning the self and personhood and that can meet the catastrophic challenges of the 21st century. Eschatological Personalism, rooted in the philosophical tradition of ‚ÄúBoston Personalism‚Äù, takes as its starting point the personalist claim that the significance of a self and personality is not fully revealed until it has reached its endpoint, which from a theological perspective that end point can only occur within the eschatological realm. That realm is explored in the book along with implications for personalist theory and ethics. Topics covered include the agent intellect, dreams and the imagination, future-orientation and eschatology, phenomenology of Time, social ethics, Love, the challenge of AI, privacy and solitude, and the individual ethic of autarchy. This book is an innovative combination of the neuroscientific and theological insights provided by a Personalist viewpoint.

Haida Eddies are episodic, clockwise rotating ocean eddies that form during the winter off the west coast of British Columbia‚Äôs Haida Gwaii and Alaska‚Äôs Alexander Archipelago. These eddies are notable for their large size, persistence, and frequent recurrence. Rivers flowing off the North American continent supply the continental shelf in the Hecate Strait with warmer, fresher, and nutrient- enriched water. Haida eddies are formed every winter when this rapid outflow of water through the strait wraps around Cape St. James at the southern tip of Haida Gwaii, and meets with the cooler waters of the Alaska Current. This forms a series of plumes which can merge into large eddies that are shed into the northeast Pacific Ocean by late winter, and may persist for up to two years. Haida eddies can be more than 250 km in diameter, and transport a mass of coastal water approximately the volume of Lake Michigan over 1,000 km offshore into the lower nutrient waters of the northeast Pacific Ocean. These \\"warm-core rings\\" transport heat out to sea, supplying nutrients (particularly nitrate and iron) to nutrient depleted areas of lower productivity. Consequently, primary production in Haida eddies is up to three times higher than in ambient waters, supporting vast phytoplankton-based communities, as well as influencing zooplankton and icthyoplankton community compositions. The Haida name is derived from the Haida people native to the region, centered on the islands of Haida Gwaii (formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands).  Historical observations  SeaWIFS satellite, showing an anticyclonic Haida eddy in the Alaskan Current, southwest of Haida Gwaii. Due to their large size, it was not until the satellite era that scientists were able to observe the full scale and life cycles of Haida eddies. Their extent is such that an ocean liner can move through the eddy without observing its borders, so accurate records did not exist until the late 1980s. Between 1985-1990, the first US research mission to study changes in sea surface height using radar altimetry (an instrument used to measure the ocean surface height using a radar pulse in reference to a geoid), was conducted by the US Navy using the Geodetic/Geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT). The primary focus was to study fronts, eddies, winds, waves, and tides; each of these processes produce a change in sea surface height of several meters. In 1986, researchers Gower and Tabata observed clockwise eddies in the Gulf of Alaska using GEOSAT - the first satellite observation of Haida eddies. In 1987, the Ocean Storms program deployed 50 drifters to examine intertidal oscillations and mixing during fall storms and observed eddies propagating westward. Also in 1987, researchers Richard Thomson, Paul LeBlond, and William Emery observed that ocean drifters deployed in the Gulf of Alaska at 100‚Äì120 meters below the surface had stopped their eastward motion and actually began to move westward counter to the predominant current. The researchers attributed the unexpected motion to eddies dragging the buoys westward from their path at approximately 1.5 cm/s. In 1992, Haida eddies were observed by researchers Meyers and Basu as positive sea surface height anomalies using TOPEX-POSEIDON, an altimetry-based satellite platform (like GEOSAT). They specifically noted an increase in the number of Haida eddies during the 1997/1998 El Ni√±o winter. Haida eddy altimetry observations were further supplemented by European Remote Sensing satellites, ERS1 and ERS2. In 1995 Richard Thomson, together with James Gower at the Institute of Ocean Sciences in British Columbia, discovered the first clear evidence of eddies along the entire continental margin using temperature maps from infrared observations using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites. Satellite observations coupled with drifter observations have allowed scientists to resolve physical and biogeochemical structures of Haida eddies.  Formation  = General circulation = North Pacific Current splitting into southward California Current and northward Alaska Current (bifurcation in image occurring around 45¬∞N). Haida eddies occur within the subpolar Alaska Gyre to the north of the Pacific Current. Arrows indicate the direction of the current. Ocean circulation in the region begins with the transport of waters eastward along the North Pacific Current, also known as the \\"West Wind Drift\\", which forms the northern branch of the anticyclonic (clockwise rotation of fluids in Northern Hemisphere) North Pacific subtropical gyre. The North Pacific current approaches the continental US and bifurcates into the southward flowing California Current and the northward flowing Alaska Current. The latitude of this bifurcation is dependent on changes in the midlatitude (30-60¬∞ latitude) westerly atmospheric wind patterns, which is the primary forcing on the ocean's circulation in this region. These westerly winds oscillate around 45¬∞N and can have variable wind speeds. Changes in these winds are based on the large-scale atmospheric circulation which has seasonal (summer/winter), interannual (ENSO), and decadal (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO) variability. The northwestward Alaska Current then feeds into the westward Alaskan Coastal Current, and eventually into the Alaskan Stream; together these make up the cyclonic (counterclockwise rotating) subpolar Alaskan gyre, where Haida eddies are found. In winter, the location of the North Pacific Current bifurcation is approximately 45¬∞N, which is 5¬∞ south of where it bifurcates in the summer at approximately 50¬∞N. This has implications as to what water is moved into the Alaskan subpolar gyre. In winter, when the splitting of the current is more south, fresh, warmer waters from river input from the Columbia (47¬∞N) and Fraser (49¬∞N) rivers are transported north. This shift in the North Pacific current location leads to winter currents transporting relatively warmer water poleward from a lower latitude than in the summer. Although the northern branch of the subtropical gyre shifts south in the winter, the subpolar gyre does not shift location, but intensifies in its circulation. This intensification brings a greater volume of water from the south into the subpolar gyre, which again is dependent on the magnitude of atmospheric circulation. For example: the Aleutian Low is a persistent low pressure system over the Gulf of Alaska that can fluctuate on decadal timescales, producing the PDO. If this system is relatively strong during winter, there will be an increase in northward transport of waters along the Alaskan current from southerly winds. Haida eddies have been documented to form predominantly in the winter when bifurcation is south, and favorable atmospheric conditions are met to intensify the subpolar gyre. With these conditions, Haida eddy formation has also been documented to occur from baroclinic instabilities from alongshore wind reversals, equatorial Kelvin waves, and bottom topography. Baroclinic instabilities form when tilting or sloping of isopycnals (horizontal lines of constant density) form. Baroclinic instabilities from alongshore wind reversals occur when a persistent wind along the coast changes direction. For example: in the Gulf of Alaska average winds travel from the south, poleward (termed southerly winds), but during a wind reversal the winds will abruptly shift to a northwesterly wind (coming from the northwest), and the coastal current that was being pushed north will now be pushed south. This change in direction causes rotation in an originally northward flowing current, which results in tilting isopyncals. Kelvin waves that form along the equator are able to travel along the west coast of North America to the Gulf of Alaska, where their presence can cause disruptions in the poleward current and form baroclinic instabilities. Bottom topography, the third formation process of Haida eddies, can occur because the Alaska current will interact with hills or rock formations below the surface, and this can cause baroclinic instabilities. An idealized eddy in the Gulf of Alaska. \\"Isotherms\\" are lines connecting points of equal temperature. Warm, nutrient-rich coastal water spirals clockwise, forming the core of the eddy. Phytoplankton are concentrated in the edges of the eddy near the ocean surface, nourished by the nutrient-rich eddy water. = General physical attributes = Haida eddies possess common physical characteristics that are dependent on the attributes of the water that is being transported, and how that influences the overall structure. Haida eddies are characterized as relatively long-lived, transient (departure from the average ocean current along the coast), medium-sized (mesoscale) ocean eddies that rotate clockwise (anti-cyclonic), and possess a warm, less-saline core, relative to the surrounding waters. These warm waters within the eddy are attributed to the baroclinic clockwise motion that results in a piling up of water near the center, and a downward displacement of surface water to depth (downwelling). This phenomenon is referred to as Ekman pumping, resulting from a conservation of mass, vertical velocity, and the Coriolis force. Downwelling of water from convergence produces what is called 'dynamic height anomalies' between the center and the surrounding waters. The anomaly is calculated by taking the difference between the surface of interest, for example the middle of a Haida eddy, and a reference point (in oceanography it is in reference to the geopotential surface, or the geoid). Haida eddies are capable of producing dynamic height anomalies between the center and the surrounding waters of 0.12-0.35 m. Ekman pumping of surface waters, coupled with northward transport of warm waters (from location of bifurcation), dampens the temperature gradient from the surface down to 300 m, so that water temperature within the eddy is warmer below the surface than typical conditions. Stratification increases between these warmer, less-saline vortices and the surrounding waters by effectively depressing background lines of constant temperature (isotherms) and salinity (isohalines) (shown in figure). This makes them an ideal vehicle to transport coastal water properties into the Gulf of Alaska because of reduced mixing with surrounding waters. As Haida eddies break away from the coast into the subpolar gyre, they transport water properties such as temperature, salinity and kinetic energy. A common water mass in the area is the Pacific Subarctic Upper Water (PSUW) mass with conservative (constant through time and space) properties of salinity (32.6-33.6 psu) and temperature (3-15 ¬∞C). PSUW moves into the Alaska Current from the North Pacific Current and may be mixed via Haida eddies into the subpolar gyre. Fresh (low salinity) water from rivers are mixed into Haida eddies. They are also able to exchange potential energy and momentum from the coastal mean current, a process that takes energy away from the coastal current and advects it toward the middle of the gyre. On average, the Gulf of Alaska experiences 5.5 Haida eddies per year, with a typical eddy characterized by a dynamical height of approximately 0.179 m, propagation speed of 2 km per day, average core diameter of 97 km, total volume of approximately 3,000 to 6,000 km3, and a duration of 30 weeks.  Biogeochemical and nutrient dynamics  Biogeochemical dynamics in Haida eddies are typically characterized by highly productive, yet relatively nutrient depleted surface waters, that may be replenished by diffusion and mixing from nutrient abundant sub-surface core waters. This nutrient exchange is also often facilitated by seasonal fluctuations in the surface mixed layer depth (~20 m in winter, up to 100 m in summer), bringing the low-nutrient surface waters in contact with the nutrient-rich core waters as the mixed layer deepens. Upon eddy formation in winter, surface water concentrations are high in nutrients including nitrate, carbon, iron, and others that are important for biological production. However, they are quickly consumed by phytoplankton through spring and summer, until fall when the now reduced nutrient concentrations can be slowly replenished by mixing with the sub- surface core waters. The net effect of Haida eddies on macronutrients and trace metal micronutrients is that of offshore transport of materials from coastal waters to open ocean, increasing offshore primary productivity inside the eddy formation site. = Dissolved iron = The southeast and central Gulf of Alaska tends to be iron-limited, and Haida eddies deliver large quantities of iron-rich coastal waters into these regions. In High-Nutrient, Low- Chlorophyll (HNLC) areas, iron tends to limit phytoplankton growth more than macronutrients, so the delivery of iron plays an important role in stimulating biological activity. While surface waters within the eddy are similar to that of ambient HNLC waters, waters in the eddy core are highly iron-enriched. Iron is delivered upward to the surface from the eddy core as a result of physical transport properties as the eddy decays or interacts with other eddies. This iron flux into the photic zone (where light is abundant to support growth), is associated with an increase in spring and summer primary production, and drawdown of macronutrients as they are consumed by phytoplankton. Increased iron concentrations have been observed to persist in the core of the eddy up to 16 months after eddy formation. Physical transport properties retain a supply of iron to the surface from the still iron-rich eddy core for the lifetime of the eddy. Because of the large vertical iron transport, Haida eddies contribute a significant portion of the total iron available for biological use. Total dissolved iron concentrations in Haida eddies are approximately 28 times higher than open ocean waters of the Alaska gyre. The daily average supply of iron upwelled from the eddy core is 39 times higher than the iron introduced by average daily dust deposition in the northeast Pacific. Despite the fact that seasonal shallowing and strengthening of the thermocline may inhibit mixing between the surface layer and enriched waters below (reducing iron exchange between the two by as much as 73%), concentrations are still an order of magnitude higher than ambient waters, delivering an estimated 4.6 x 106 moles of iron annually to the Gulf of Alaska. This loading is comparable to the total iron delivery from atmospheric dust or major volcanic eruptions. Thus, the arrival of Haida eddies may introduce anywhere from 5‚Äì50% of the annual dissolved iron supply in the upper 1,000 m of the Gulf of Alaska. In the summer of 2012, an iron fertilization experiment deposited 100 tons of finely-ground iron oxides into a Haida eddy in an effort to increase salmon returns through an attempt to increase primary production. This resulted in the highest chlorophyll concentrations measured within an eddy, and the most intense phytoplankton bloom in the last ten years in the northeast Pacific. However, the impact of this bloom on higher trophic organisms such as zooplankton and fish is not known. = Carbon = Concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nitrate (NO3‚àí), which are important macronutrients for photosynthesis, are quickly depleted in Haida eddy surface waters through most of their first year due to uptake by biological primary production. This uptake of nutrients, which is largely carried out by phytoplankton, leads to observable increases in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations.Crawford, W.R., Brickley, P.J., Peterson, T.D., Thomas, A.C., Impact of Haida Eddies on chlorophyll distribution in the Eastern Gulf of Alaska, In Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, Volume 52, Issues 7√¢‚Ç¨\\"8, 2005, Pages 975-989, ISSN 0967-0645, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2005.02.011. In summer, a large portion of the DIC pool is consumed due to increased production of coccolithophores, which are phytoplankton that use bicarbonate ion to build their calcium carbonate (CaCO3) shells, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) in the process. This process also leads to a summertime reduction in total alkalinity, which is a measure of the capacity of seawater to neutralize acids, and is largely determined by bicarbonate and carbonate ion concentrations. Surrounding surface waters show similar, or even slightly higher concentrations of DIC, total alkalinity, and nitrates, and may at times exchange surface waters with Haida eddies, as witnessed when Haida-2000 merged with Haida-2001. Although some nutrient exchange takes place at the surface, export of organic carbon out of the eddy is not enhanced, and there is little change in organic carbon concentrations at depth, suggesting that the organic carbon formed through primary production is largely being recycled within the eddies. In February, surface concentrations of CO2 (as quantified by ∆íCO2), in the eddy center and edges start out relatively oversaturated relative to atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but quickly drop, partially due to biological production. By June, ∆íCO2 becomes undersaturated relative to atmospheric concentrations, but increases slightly again through summer, aided by warming temperatures. In the eddy center, ∆íCO2 usually reaches near equilibrium with the atmosphere by fall (depending on timing of the mixed layer deepening), when vertical entrainment and mixing from below can replenish ∆íCO2, as well as the now-depleted DIC and nitrate concentrations. Lower ∆íCO2 tends to persist through summer in edge waters however, most likely due to the presence of enhanced biological production, as suggested by the presence of higher Chl-a concentrations. Ambient waters typically reach parity with atmospheric CO2 by spring, after a smaller initial decrease early in the year. Net atmospheric CO2 removal by Haida eddies is estimated to be 0.8-1.2 x 106 tons per year, underscoring the important role they play in the Gulf of Alaska. = Other trace metals = Transport and delivery of other trace metals in the Gulf of Alaska are also enhanced by Haida eddies and may result in increased burial of trace metals in marine sediments where they can no longer be used to support biological growth. Evidence suggests Haida eddies may be an important source of dissolved silver ions, with eddy surface water concentrations three to four times higher compared to ambient waters. Silicate uptake rates by marine diatoms in Haida eddies are three times that observed in ambient waters, suggesting strong diatom population growth. Haida eddies are important sources of silver for diatom production, as silver is incorporated into the silicate shells of diatoms and the transport of silver associated with Haida eddies promotes diatom growth. Silver is sequestered by this production and eventually transported to depth by sinking particles of organic matter, linking silver to the marine silicate cycle. Large quantities of dissolved aluminum and manganese ions are also supplied to the Gulf of Alaska via eddy transport of coastal waters enriched from riverine inputs. The quantity transported is also comparable to that deposited by atmospheric dust. This supply of trace metals impacts the rate of dissolved iron removal because the particles tend to aggregate together and sink to the seafloor, a process which may account for 50-60% of dissolved aluminum and manganese removal. Additionally, there is evidence for enhanced delivery of cadmium and copper to the Gulf of Alaska by Haida eddies. = Macronutrients = Haida eddies can produce low silicate and high nitrate, chlorophyll, and sedimentation events offshore. Eddies that form nearshore in the Gulf of Alaska carry shelf nutrients west into the High- Nutrient, Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) and oligotrophic (low-nutrient) waters of the northeast Pacific, or south into seasonally nitrate-depleted waters. If eddies head southward from the Gulf of Alaska toward British Columbia, waters in the eddy become enriched in nutrients at the expense of the seawater they are capturing nutrients from, leaving coastal waters relatively nutrient poor. If eddies head west into the HNLC waters of the central Gulf of Alaska basin, they transport particulate matter and supply the photic zone with nitrate that is up to three times greater than typical seasonal transport, increasing spring productivity. The timing of advection from the eddy has important seasonal implications on the delivery of nutrients. The high-nutrient and high-iron coastal water is carried into the Gulf of Alaska from either the core of the eddy or the outer ring. The core of the eddy contains warm, fresh, nutrient-rich waters formed in winter, and with the addition of sunlight, produces strong spring blooms of primary productivity offshore. As the eddy drifts westward in late spring and summer, the outer ring mixes coastal and deep ocean waters in large arcs around the eddy edge. This process has an effect hundreds of kilometers offshore, and facilitates the exchange of nutrients between shelf to deep ocean from late winter to the following autumn. = Biology = Nutrients trapped and transported by Haida eddies support more biological growth compared to surrounding, low-nutrient ocean water. Elevated measurements of chlorophyll in eddy centers, as compared to surrounding water, indicate that eddies increase primary production, and can support multiple phytoplankton blooms within a single year. These blooms are not only caused by increased nutrients, but also the eddy's ability to transport biota from the coast into the eddy. Spring blooms are caused by sufficient light reaching the warm, nutrient-rich water contained in the middle of the eddy, due to anticyclonic rotation. A second bloom can occur once the eddy has moved closer to the deep ocean, when the outer reaches of the eddy can gather nutrient-rich water from either the coast or from an adjacent eddy. Coastal water transported by this outer ring advection can move from the coast into the eddy in six days which also allows for the rapid transport of coastal algae into the nutrient-rich eddy waters. A late summer bloom can occur if storms produce vertical convection of the mixed layer, causing it to deepen and trap nutrients from below into the region of primary production. High eddy kinetic energy (EKE) may also increase chlorophyll concentration in eddies. Northern Gulf of Alaska and Haida eddy regions have more chlorophyll when EKE was higher, which can be caused by storms, producing higher mixing of the mixed layer and introducing nutrients from below. Because of the correlation, research suggests that EKE could be used to predict chlorophyll blooms. Haida eddies affect zooplankton distribution by transporting nearshore species into the deep ocean. During the first summer that an eddy moves offshore, nearshore species often dominate zooplankton communities, but decline after one or two years as the eddy dissipates. Species that perform diel vertical migration can remain in the eddy core for longer periods of time. The influence of Haida eddies on larger organisms remains poorly understood. They are thought to influence winter feeding habits of northern fur seals by providing food at a low energy expense. Ichthyoplankton composition within eddies is significantly different than that of surrounding ocean water. The species composition is based on where an eddy forms, and thus what coastal species it acquired. Fish larval species richness correlates with distance from an eddy center, with higher richness closer to the core. The icthyoplankton communities also change depending on the age of the eddy.

Early Life Very little is known about the personal details of Playne's life, as she left little of her own documentary evidence.Oldfield, ODNBRichard Espley (2016) \\"Caroline Playne: The Activities and Absences of a Campaigning Author in First World War London\\", The London Journal, 41:3, 249-265, DOI: 10.1080/03058034.2016.1216692 She was born in Avening, Gloucestershire, one of two daughters of Margarettia Sara, a Dutchwoman, and her English husband, George Frederick Playne, a cloth manufacturer. Caroline was multilingual from childhood, speaking English and Dutch, while her later historical work suggests she also was familiar with French and German.Oldfield, ODNB Some time after her father's death in 1879, Playne moved with her mother to Hampstead, where she lived for the rest of her life.Oldfield, ODNB Margarettia died in 1905.Espley, 'Activities and Absences', p. 251 Playne's first foray into writing was as a romantic novelist. In 1904 she published The Romance of a Lonely Woman closely followed byThe Terror of the Macdurghotts in 1907, both novels published by T. Fisher Unwin under the name C.E. Playne.British Library catalogue records In 1908, Playne was elected an associate member of the University Women's Club.Oldfield, ODNB Peace and Humanitarian Work Caroline Playne formally approached pacifist work some time around 1905, and quickly became a committed activist and member of a wide range of organisations.Espley, 'Activities and Absences', p. 251 She was a representative of the National Peace Council (NPC), created to support the action of the international court in The Hague, and in 1910 was a founder member of the Church of England Peace League, a member organisation of the NPC dedicated to \\"keep[ing] before members of the Church of England ‚Äòthe duty of combating the war spirit‚Äô\\". Over the following years she also became a member of the Hampstead Peace Society, the League of Peace and Freedom, and the Peace Society.Espley, 'Activities and Absences', p. 251 Playne became a regular attendee and speaker at national and international peace conferences. In 1908 she took part in the International Congress for Peace in London, and on this occasion she met the Austrian pacifist Bertha von Suttner, of whom she later wrote a biography.Oldfield, ODNB Playne was present at an NPC meeting on 4 August 1914, which condemned the secret diplomacy of the British government in the years before the war.Laity, Peace Movement, p. 221 At the outbreak of the First World War, Playne immediately became a committee member of the Society of Friends' Emergency Committee for the Assistance of Germans, Austrians and Hungarians in Distress, an organisation set up to assist citizens of those countries in Britain, including prisoners of war.Espley, 'Activities and Absences', p. 255 She became heavily involved in this work, helping with accommodation and other needs for the thousands of 'enemy aliens' who appealed to the Committee for help, while also taking up detailed committee tasks and financial scrutiny. Alongside this humanitarian work, Playne joined the Union of Democratic Control when it was formed in 1914, hosting events for the organisation at her London home.Espley, 'Activities and Absences', p. 252 She was also involved in encouraging personal correspondence between the belligerent countries; the tracing of missing persons; and translating German newspaper articles for British audiences. Historical Writing During the war, Playne assembled a large mass of research on the conflict and events in London, including some 530 books and pamphlets. With the addition of her own voluminous diary observations, and encouraged by her friend, the writer Vernon Lee, this collection provided the material for her four major studies of the war and its causes: The Neuroses of the Nations (1925); The Pre-War Mind in Britain (1928); Society at War 1914‚Äî1916 (1931); Britain Holds On 1917-1918 (1933).Patrick Wright, Iron Curtain : from stage to Cold War.Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2013. (pg. 116-117) Both pioneering and idiosyncratic, Playne's historical work draws heavily on the emerging methodologies of social psychology to argue that the War represented a collective 'neurosis' of the European mind.Charles Chatfield and R.M. IliÔ∏†uÔ∏°khina, Peace/mir : An Anthology of Historic Alternatives to War. Syracuse, N.Y. : Syracuse University Press, 1994. (pp. 230-2, 238-40)Oldfield, ODNB Espley, 'Activities and Absences', p. 256 Preoccupied with 'the mind and the passions of the multitude', Playne deployed a vast array of sources and quotations to critique European culture before and during the War, especially its nationalism, imperialism and militarism. She argues that the technological and social developments of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 'disorientated' and 'disjointed' European societies, and was especially damaging to the 'mental calibre' of the cultural elite.Wright, Iron Curtain, p. 117 Her work is particularly notable for emphasising the influence of mass media in shaping and directing public opinion, anticipating media studies by fifty years.Oldfield, ODNB Taken together, argues the historian Richard Espley, the four books can be regarded as a single '2,500 page meditation on the neurotic, militaristic failure of western culture'.Espley, 'Activities and Absences', p. 250 Despite the originality of her approach to the study of the War, Playne has been neglected by later scholars. Where they are used, her books are largely drawn upon as sources for detail and reportage of the war years, rather than analyses in their own right.Espley, 'Activities and Absences, p. 250 Later Life and Death In 1938, Playne deposited her research collection in the library at Senate House, London. Playne never married, and left no children. She died at Hampstead in 1948. Works by Playne Fiction: * The Romance of a Lonely Woman, London, T.

The company has more than 100 patents and patent applications for the technology that can produce multiple chemicals such as ethylene glycol, propylene, isopropanol, methyl-methacrylate and acetic acid. Funding has been provided by VantagePoint Capital Partners, BP Ventures, Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital, Osage University Partners and Sustainable Conversion Ventures. Liquid Light‚Äôs technology can be used to produce more than 60 chemicals, but its first targeted process is for the production of monoethylene glycol (MEG) which has a $27 billion annual market. MEG is used to make a wide range of consumer products including plastic bottles, antifreeze and polyester fiber. Company history Liquid Light began operations in 2009 with seed capital from Redpoint Ventures after being co- founded by Kyle Teamey, Emily Cole, Andrew Bocarsly, Fouad Elnaggar and Nety Krishna. The company licensed technology developed by Bocarsly and Cole at Princeton University for electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to chemicals and subsequently began to develop additional technology for commercial implementation and to broaden the potential product offerings. After validating the technology at lab scale and beginning engineering scale- up, the company unveiled the first product, a process for making MEG, in March 2014 and subsequently won significant industry recognition including the CCEMC Grand Challenge, the CleanTech 100 Rising Star of the Year, and a #1 ranking in Biofuels Digest‚Äôs 40 Hottest Smaller Companies in the Advanced Bioeconomy.

Technology  Liquid Light‚Äôs core technology is based on the principles of electrochemistry and electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. The process under development for production of MEG first converts carbon dioxide into a two carbon intermediate called oxalate or oxalic acid. Oxalate is then converted to MEG in separate process steps that have potentially lower costs of production than petroleum-based processes.

They operate in the Midlothian, Scottish Borders and Edinburgh area of Scotland. Founding The Garvald School and Training Centre was founded near West Linton in 1944 by Dr Hans Schauder, his wife Lisl and others who decided to join him after having worked for some years at the Camphill community in Aberdeen. Dr Schauder himself was of Viennese origin and had fled Austria some years previously as he came from a Jewish family. Connected with Anthroposophy, the medical and therapeutic work of Rudolf Steiner and with the group around Dr Karl K√∂nig, he had been among the founders of Camphill. After working at Garvald for some years he opened his own practice in Edinburgh and developed his own method of counselling until meeting the Dominican friar, Lef√©bure, with whom he wrote his best known and pioneering work Conversations on Counselling. The Garvald school later became simply the Garvald Training Centre and continued to grow and expand over time into six independent communities: : Garvald West Linton, the original community established in 1944. : Garvald Edinburgh, established in 1969, runs a bakery and confectionery delivering to whole food shops, delicatessens and caf√©s and private customers, which was featured in the short film Breadmakers produced by Jim Hickey and Robin Mitchell and directed by Yasmin Fedda in 2007 and won several awards. The Mulberry Bush Shop sells artisan gifts produced in their workshops as well as books, art materials and craft produced by other suppliers. Craft workshops include a glass studio, joinery, pottery, puppetry, textiles and hand tool refurbishment. In 2007 it opened the Orwell Arts building in the city, where the former Dalry Primary School had been. : The Engine Shed, an extension of Garvald Edinburgh founded in the 1980s. : The Columcille Centre has a range of programmes like Edinburgh All, Columcille Esbank, Music for All, the Library project, Columcille Hall that is also available for rental and the Columcille Ceili Band, which featured in the documentary \\"About A Band\\" by Jim Hickey and Robin Mitchell. In addition it hosts the Makers Markets. : Garvald Glenesk, a residential care centre established in 1998. : Garvald Home Farm, a Biodynamic farm associated with Garvald West Linton established in 1987 Garvald social therapy The Centres draw their inspiration from the work of Rudolf Steiner, in particular his ideas on Social Therapy expressed through the type of opportunities provided, the approach and interdependence they try to create. It consists in giving structure and rhythm to member's lives, bringing people together to form a solid community through common activities or the celebration of events and by emphasising the quality of what the workshops produce so that everyone can take pride in achieving the best possible. The items produced should have a value or benefit to others rather than making things for their own sake. They provide creative working environments focusing mainly on craft, catering, artistic skills and agriculture. Craft offers a wide range of possibilities for people to express creativity and be connected to nature, so there is much focus on different craft activities. In addition they engage in approaches such as the Talking Points methodology, which focuses on outcomes for service- users and carers and have themselves produced Talking Points tools which have been designed specifically for people with learning disabilities. In this way there is an opportunity for anyone coming to one of the Garvald centres to affect their environment, and the local and often wider community. They become needed by others and relied upon to sustain the creativity and range of goods, art and craft work. A range of therapies like Eurythmy, Creative Speech, Massage and varies other therapeutic arts are also offered. In addition to providing structured and creative working environments the majority of their studios and workshops have an enterprise focus, returning income to offset running costs. The opportunities they provide help people to gain confidence, particularly school leavers making the transition into an adult environment. The workshops teach skills that apply in mainstream employment or help an individual develop creativity over a longer period. They have experience in supporting people with a range of needs and syndromes including Autism, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Epilepsy, Prader Willi Syndrome and Dual Diagnosis as well as physical and communication difficulties. Members‚Äô ages range from sixteen to the mid seventies.

As engineer to the East London Waterworks Company he was responsible for introducing the Cornish pumping engine. He oversaw many improvements, and was approached for advice by a number of water companies elsewhere in the country, later turning his attention to the efficient handling of sewage. Career Born in Shrewsbury, the fourth son of John Wicksteed, he was educated at Shrewsbury School, and at sixteen years of age he was sent to London, to reside with his father's old friend, Arthur Aikin, Secretary of the Society of Arts, with whom he lived. He was articled to a mechanical engineer in Smithfield, and at the end of his apprenticeship, became an assistant to Henry R. Palmer, Engineer to the London Docks, at a time when extensive additions were being made. In 1829, he became the Engineer to the East London Waterworks Company. It was a time when costly additions to the reservoirs and pumping-engines had to be made, but these were offset by the large saving he was able to make, particularly in the consumption of fuel. In 1835 his attention was directed to the Cornish engine as a replacement for the less economical condensing engine. He visited the Cornish mines, conducted experiments, and prevailed upon the directors of the company to invest in this new technology. In 1837 an engine from Cornwall was installed in the works at Old Ford. The savings were such that he carried out careful measurements for a year, and published his findings in 1841 in a paper entitled \\"An Experimental Inquiry concerning the relative power of, and useful effect produced by, the Cornish and Boulton and Watt pumping-engines, and cylindrical and waggon-head boilers\\" read to the Institution of Civil Engineers. Following this, several large engines were installed under his direction by various water companies about London. Meanwhile, he carried out various additions to the reservoirs and other works of the company. Among these was to transfer the source of the company‚Äôs supply from Old Ford to Lea Bridge up river from the tidal flow. Between 1838 and 1845, he was retained as Consulting Engineer to the Grand Junction, Vauxhall, Southwark, and Kent Waterwork Companies, while still Resident Engineer to the East London Water Works. He was thus, at one time, engineer to five out of the then nine London water companies. During this time, he constructed new waterworks at Hull and Wolverhampton, with extensions to those at Brighton and Scarborough. He was also consulted by the towns of Leeds, Liverpool, Dewsbury, Lichfield, Leamington, Cork, Kingston in Jamaica, Valparaiso, Boston, in the United States, the waterworks and sewerage of Berlin and consulted by the Pasha of Egypt in reference to the barrage of the Nile. His attention having been drawn to the sewerage of towns, and its disposal, he became the Engineer to the London Sewage Company in 1847. Plans for a sewer along the North bank of the Thames to a pumping station and reservoir at Barking Creek were prepared to put before Parliament on behalf of the company, but necessary investment was not forthcoming and the company was subsequently dissolved. His plan was similar to that which he had proposed for Berlin in 1841, and he then built a system at Leicester. With the aim of purifying the sewage of towns, and producing manure, he set up the Patent Solid Sewage Manure Company. At this point he resigned as Engineer to the East London Waterworks in 1851 and severed his connections with the other London companies. The Patent Solid Sewage Manure Company at Leicester was successful in purifying sewage, with a marked improvement to the River Soar but, though large quantities of manure were produced it could not compete with others on the market. In the end, the company failed and the corporation took over the sewage purifying. Besides carrying out a complete system of drainage for Leicester, he was consulted on the sewerage of Leeds, Leamington, Maidstone, and Scarborough ; and gave evidence before the Special Committee on the Sewage of the Metropolis. He was elected a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 7 February 1837 and contributed several papers on the Cornish engine, for which he received a Telford medal in 1839. He had a seat on the Council from 1840 to 1843, but for many years before his death he had ceased to attend the meetings and to take part in the discussions. In 1863 he was elected also to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Personal life On 20 July 1829 at St John, Hackney, he married Eliza, the third daughter of the late Mr. John Barton, of London, by whom he had six children - Bithia (1831-1874), Katharine (1833‚Äì1884), Mary (1834-1834), Mary Frances (1835-1906), Arthur Aikin (1840-1903) and Eliza Lucy (1845-1923). His health was adversely affected by his labours in Leicester, and in 1865, he had what was described at the time as a slight attack of paralysis, and retired. He died at Headingley, near Leeds, on 15 November 1871, aged 65. References Obituary. Thomas Wicksteed, 1806-1871.

Athar Ali (18 January 1925 ‚Äì 7 July 1998) was an Indian historian of Medieval Indian History. Throughout his career Ali was known to hold a strong stance against Hindu and Islamic extremism. He was a professor at the Centre for Advanced Studies in Medieval History at his Alma mater, Aligarh Muslim University.  Early life  M. Athar Ali was the son of Rehmat Ali. He was born in Pilakhna in Aligarh District, Uttar Pradesh, India. He was married to Feroza Kahtoon and had seven children. His oldest son, Taimur Athar is a renowned research scientist at the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology in Hyderabad, Telangana. Career Ali was educated at Aligarh Muslim University where he was a student of Mohammad Habib, Nurul Hasan, and S. A. Rashid. He earned his doctorate at AMU in 1961 under the supervision of Satish Chandra. He started his career in research and teaching when he joined AMU as a research assistant. He and fellow historian Irfan Habib joined AMU's Department of History at around the same time in 1953. He became Professor in 1978. Athar Ali retired in 1990 after a five-year period of re-employment. Ali wrote extensively on the Mughal Empire, comparative history of Islamic Empires, implications of secularism and early modern societies from Spain to Indonesia. Athar Ali's reputation for scholarship was firmly established in 1966, with the publishing of his book The Mughal Nobility Under Aurangazeb. A paper-back edition was brought out in 1970 and a second, revised, edition in 1997. Originally his doctoral thesis, it was soon acknowledged as the definitive study of India's late medieval ruling class. The book led to a reconsideration of many standard views of the ethnic composition of the Mughal ruling class and was widely regarded as a strong critique of communalist historiography in India and Pakistan. It also offered, for the first time, a more scientific and rational analysis of Aurangazeb the person, and the historical role of Aurangazeb, the last of the great Mughal emperors, whose reign between 1658 and 1707 hastened the disintegration of the empire. The theory, which still receives support from many quarters, that Aurangazeb's 'religious bias' generated a 'Hindu backlash' which brought about the downfall of the empire, was challenged by Athar Ali on the basis of hard evidence. \\"The evidence I assembled,\\" wrote Athar Ali in his introduction to the revised edition of the book, \\"did not in any sense exonerate Aurangazeb, but I think it did set different limits within which the Emperor's personal preferences and decisions had impact: and it suggested a number of other factors, besides the one of religious bias...\\" In 1985, Athar Ali published his second major work, The Apparatus of Empire: Awards of Ranks, Offices and Titles to the Mughal Nobility, 1574-1658. This is a crucial reference tool for historians concerned with that period. In his introduction to the work's extensive tables, Athar Ali demonstrated how the quantitative data obtained from them could tell the reader the internal processes of the Mughal polity. Athar Ali had largely completed his compilation of similar data on Aurangazeb's reign (1659-1707) for a second volume. Ali died of liver cancer on 7 July 1998.  Political views  Ali was a secularist with a communist leaning. He strongly opposed all forms of religious extremism. Athar Ali strenuously opposed the communal perception of history. He was one of the four distinguished authors (the others were R.S Sharma, D.N. Jha and Suraj Bhan) of theReport to the Nation on the Babri Masjid, Ayodhya, 1990, which was published in many Indian languages. Dismissing, on the basis of an examination of the written and archaeological evidence, the claim that the Babri Masjid occupied the site of Rama's birth or that a temple occupied the site and it was pulled down to construct the masjid, the Report ended with the impassioned appeal: \\"If, then, we have a care for historical facts, if we want to uphold the law, if we have love for our own cultural heritage, we must protect the Babri Masjid. A country is surely judged by how it treats its past.\\" To oppose what he thought was the source of a dangerous communalist subversion of the nation, Athar Ali did not disdain activist positions. His support for the well-known anti- communal organisation Sahmat (Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust) was firm and unqualified.

The three-story house was built in 1957 and was one of the three houses owned by the President of the Second Republic of the Philippines, Jos√© P. Laurel. In 1965, two historical markers were installed at the house entrance. The first marker was placed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in recognition of the building as the official residence of Jose P. Laurel. The second marker notes of the First Indonesian President Sukarno's stay in the mansion during a Manila Conference on August 5, 1963. History =Construction= Years after serving his term as president of the second republic from 1943 to 1945, Jose P. Laurel built a three-story house near the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club that occupied 1,000 square meters of the land once overrun with cogon. The house was named Villa Pacencia in honor of his wife, Pacencia Hidalgo y Valencia. =Site of Political Events= The house was the venue of several political events. In 1957, Laurel hosted a luncheon at the mansion in honor of James Langley, a New Hampshire newspaper publisher. Laurel and Langley signed the Laurel-Langley Agreement in 1954, which amended the Bell Trade Act of 1946 and provided for an increase in the duties imposed on U.S. products and a decrease in the duties imposed on Philippine goods. On August 5, 1963, the first Indonesian President Sukarno stayed at the mansion during his working visit in the Philippines for the Manila Summit Conference on Maphilindo. A marker with Filipino and Bahasa Indonesia text was installed at the house entrance on March 9, 1965 documenting this historical event. The mansion became the de facto Nacionalist Party headquarters when Jos√© Laurel, Jr. acquired the property after his father's death on November 1959. =Present= The Laurel family sold the property to former Senator and Nacionalista Party President, Manny Villar, and to his wife, Senator Cynthia Villar. Vista Shaw of Vista Land and Lifescapes, Inc., a real estate company owned by Manny Villar, plans on converting the mansion into a museum, housing various memorabilia from Jos√© P. Laurel.

The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine ‚Äì called Killing Us Softly: The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine in the United Kingdom ‚Äì is a 2013 book about alternative medicine by Paul Offit, an American expert of infectious diseases and vaccines. It was published in the United States by HarperCollins (255 pages) and in the UK by Fourth Estate (20 June 2013, 336 pages). Content The book criticizes alternative medical treatments as ineffective, particularly vitamins and dietary supplements. Among the supplements of which Offit is critical in the book is the use of Vitamin C to treat the common cold, which also leads him to criticize Linus Pauling for promoting vitamin C for this purpose. In the book, Offit also attributes much of alternative medicine's effectiveness to the placebo effect, which is the subject of one of the book's chapters. He also notes that alternative medical treatments can have serious side effects, such as paralysis resulting from chiropractic and viral infections caused by acupuncture. Among the individual doctors Offit criticizes in the book are Joseph Mercola and Rashid Buttar, as well as Andrew Weil and Deepak Chopra. Offit has said that he wrote the book as a result of an experience in which he had surgery on his left knee, and his doctor recommended that Offit take glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. Offit then looked for scientific studies on the efficacy of these supplements and found some that indicated they were no more effective than placebo. Reception Do You Believe in Magic? was reviewed in the Boston Globe by Suzanne Koven and by Gail Ross in Publishers Weekly. Ross concluded that the book was \\"a bravely unsentimental and dutifully researched guide for consumers to distinguish between quacks and a cure.\\" Another review appeared in The New Republic, where Jerome Groopman wrote that Offit \\"writes in a lucid and flowing style, and grounds a wealth of information within forceful and vivid narratives.\\" Victoria Maizes, the director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, criticized the book's claim that St. John's wort is not an effective treatment for depression, citing a 2008 review that found that it was more effective than placebo. Offit responded in an interview with NPR that the point he was trying to make in the book was only that St. John's wort was not effective for severe depression, and that there have been \\"some studies of value\\" with respect to treating moderate depression. In 2013 Offit was presented with the Robert B. Balles Prize in Critical Thinking by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) for Do You Believe in Magic?. \\"Offit is a literal lifesaver... educates the public about the dangers of alternative medicine, may save many, many more.\\" References Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:Alternative medicine publications Category:Books by Paul Offit Category:HarperCollins books ","title":"Do You Believe in Magic?

The First Hollywood: Florida and the Golden Age of Silent Filmmaking. Gainesville FL: University of Florida Press, 2008, p. 106. The video can also be found on YouTube. Synopsis A deacon, played by a white actor in blackface, is constantly stealing firewood from a white farmer. The farmer, with the help of a companion, places a stick of dynamite in one of the blocks, hoping to rid himself of the thievery in this way. When the deacon returns with an older man (also an actor in blackface) to steal wood he is fooled into taking the dynamite with him, hidden in one of the blocks he stole. He goes home where his wife (again played by a male actor in blackface) is cooking. He places three blocks in the fireplace, the last of which contains the dynamite. Shortly after, it explodes, but no one is killed. The farmer and his friend enter and haul off the old man. The film was shot in a studio in New York City. Analysis Writing about the film's racist content, in Migrating to the Movies: Cinema and Black Urban Modernity, author Jacqueline Najuma Stewart states that the blackfaced actors are \\"wearing costumes signifying their traditional racial \\"types\\": Mammy in apron and bandanna; an uppity \\"colored deacon,\\" striking a Zip Coon figure in top hat and tails: and his partner in crime, a harmless, shabbily dressed, white- haired Uncle Remus. The film depicts African Americans as habitual thieves,... And the film's \\"punitive\\" ending (a commonplace in early film comedies) functions to bring about narrative closure at the expense of the black transgressors.\\" See also * List of American films of 1904 References External links  Category:1904 films Category:1900s short films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1904 comedy films Category:Blackface minstrel shows and films Category:Comedy short films Category:American comedy films ","title":"A Nigger in the Woodpile"},{"id":"44499862","text":"Ja√Ør Karam is a French professional football player and manager.

DeLuca Biochemistry Building, originally known as the Agricultural Chemistry Building, is a historic structure on the campus of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. It was the site of the discovery of vitamins A and B, as well as the development of vitamin D processing. History The building was part of the expansion of the College of Agriculture undertaken by Edwin B. Hart. Hart assumed leadership of the department in 1906. The next year, Stephen Moulton Babcock and Elmer McCollum began the single-grain experiment, which fostered the development of agricultural chemistry at Wisconsin. The experiment continued in the Agricultural Chemistry Building when it was built in 1912 and was expended to identify the key elements in nutrition. In 1913, McCollum identified a molecule in egg yolks, vitamin A. The discovery was consistent with the nutrition element proposed by Frederick Gowland Hopkins a year before. The experiment continued, and in 1915, McCollum identified vitamin B in rice. McCollum left Wisconsin for Johns Hopkins University in 1917 and was succeeded by Harry Steenbock. He continued experimentation on the new molecules, isolating and naming vitamin A in 1920. Other research by Steenbock identified iron and copper as effective agents in the treatment of anemia. Steenbock made his most significant discovery in 1923, when he established a relationship between vitamin D and ultra-violet light on bone health. He then founded the \\"Steenbock Process\\" in 1928, a method of concentrating vitamin D by irradiating food. This method was employed on a large scale through his Wisconsin Alumni Research Fund. Conrad Elvehjem isolated nicotinic acid (niacin) at the Agricultural Chemistry Building in 1937, which cured pellagra. and Karl Paul Link identified the blood coagulant dicumarol here in 1941. On June 19, 1985, the building was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. A major renovation was completed in 2012 and the building was integrated into the Biochemical Sciences Complex. The building was named after Hector F. DeLuca in 2013. His research, which was all performed at UW-Madison, identified the active metabolites of vitamin D, and resulted in multiple patents benefiting the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. It is located within the Henry Mall Historic District. Architecture The building is generally Georgian Revival in style with its pediment, quoins, and balustrade. It was designed by Warren Powers Laird & Paul Philippe Cret, who also designed six other buildings on campus: the Central Heating Station, the Stock Pavilion, Lathrop Hall, the Home Economics Buildings, Wisconsin High School, and Sterling Hall.

Sidney Lee, 2nd ed., New York: Macmillan / London: Smith, Elder, 1906, , p. 259. In 1838 Cole's painting The Farm Yard was shown at the Society of British Artists. When he was 30 he changed his focus to landscapes and received instruction from John Wilson and started exhibiting in 1840.Robert Chignell, The Life and Paintings of Vicat Cole, R.A., 3 vols London / New York: Cassell, 1898, , Volume 1, pp. 40-42. One anecdote has him painting the portrait of a Dutch merchant in Portsmouth. After the sitter refused to pay him, saying it was a bad likeness, Cole added wings and put the painting in a shop window with the title The Flying Dutchman. The man's friends recognised him and laughed; he paid for the painting, and Cole painted out the wings. His career has been regarded as a good example of the Victorian self-made man: in 1831 he married Eliza Vicat, of an old French Huguenot family. In 1852 he moved to Fulham and in 1855 to Kensington, where he lived for the rest of his life. In the mid-1860s he purchased Coombe Lodge, a small estate in Hampshire.T. J. Barringer, The Cole Family: Painters of the English Landscape 1838-1975, Exhibition catalogue, Portsmouth: Portsmouth City Museums, 1988, , pp. 28, 52. By 1850 Cole had begun to concentrate on landscape, drawing on Dutch precedents for compositions such as London Road, Portsdown (1847, Portsmouth City Museum and Art Gallery). Working alongside him in the early 1850s was George Vicat Cole (1833‚Äì1893), the eldest of Cole's five children. In search of sketching grounds they visited the river valleys of the Wye, Teign, and Dart and, in 1851 or 1852, the Moselle. While the father undoubtedly instructed the son, it seems likely that the influence of Pre-Raphaelitism, absorbed more fully by the younger artist, was transmitted through his work to the father. After a temporary estrangement in 1855 the two never worked together again. George Cole's landscapes of the later 1850s are, however, less formulaic than his early works and are often a combination of rustic genre subjects with carefully observed landscape, as in Landscape and Cattle (1858, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth). In a series of richly coloured and detailed landscapes on large canvases executed during the 1860s and 1870s, Cole created an idealized version of the Hampshire moorlands and agricultural landscape; examples include Fern Carting, Harting Coombe (1873, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth). Cattle continued to play an important role in his compositions, and he specialized in the depiction of river scenery with cows watering, including, for example, Windsor Castle (1876, exh. RA, 1878; Anglesey Abbey). Reassuring in their presentation of a seemingly timeless Englishness, these images were eagerly purchased by Victorian collectors. Although he exhibited sixteen works at the Royal Academy, Cole's work formed a mainstay of the exhibitions of the Society of British Artists at Suffolk Street, where he exhibited 209 paintings from 1838 until his death in 1883. He was elected a member in 1850, became auditor in 1856, and vice-president in 1867. He was also awarded a medal for a harvesting scene in 1864 by the Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts. While, at his best, he was capable of sophisticated effects, the sheer volume of his production of smaller works, sold directly to dealers such as Thomas McLean and Arthur Tooth, inevitably led to a lowering of standards. His annual income rose from ¬£842 in 1858 to ¬£2580 in 1873. A collector of topographical literature and an autodidact, Cole was reputed to know the works of Shakespeare by heart. Robert Chignell, the biographer of George Vicat Cole, saw the older painter as an exemplar of self-help: ‚Äòone who began with nothing‚Äô, he had achieved success through ‚Äògreat capabilities and force of character‚Äô (Chignell, 40). George Cole died on 7 September 1883 at his home at 1 Kensington Crescent and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London. Of his other children, Alfred Benjamin Cole was also an artist.

It was a fortified outpost during the Kandyan Wars, named after Major General Hay MacDowall, the 6th Commander of British Troops in Ceylon. The fort was one of the few inland forts constructed by the British and was completed in 1803. During the Matale Rebellion, on 28 July 1848, the fort came under siege by approximately 400 rebels led by Weera Puran Appu and Gongalegoda Banda, but the British forces repulsed the attack. The rebels also burnt down a coffee storehouse and ransacked the Matale Kachcheri destroying the tax records. On 29 July 1848, the then British Governor, Viscount Torrington, declared martial law over the area. British troops (the Ceylon Rifle Regiment), under the command of Captain Albert Watson, were sent from Kandy, on 28 July 1848, together with the 19th Regiment, commanded by Captain Lillie. On 29 July 1848 the British attacked the rebels' stronghold on the Wariyapola Estate, massacring the peasants and subsequently recaptured and occupied Matale‚Äôs administrative centre. In the resultant suppression of the resident population, Captain Watson and Captain Lillie rounded up a number of rebel leaders in and around Matale, including Kudapola Sri Rahula Thero, Puran Appu and Gongalegoda Banda. The initial government reports indicated that only thirteen rebels were killed at Wariyapola and a further nine rebels executed and buried within Fort MacDowall. Governor Torrington later admitted \\"that the total number killed and wounded amounted to little less than two hundred\\", although unofficially the numbers are purportedly higher. The only physical remnants of the fort that exist today are the gateway and portion of the ramparts. The interior of the fort is currently used as the Matale cemetery, which includes a monument to the rebellion.

He was part of a panel of academics which contested the Vishva Hindu Parishad's claim that the Babri Masjid was built on top of a R√¢m temple.  Life and career  Suraj Bhan was born in March 1931 in Montgomery (now in Pakistan) to a peasant family of Haryana. He studied Economics and Sanskrit for a B.A. and M.A. at the Delhi University. Subsequently, he joined the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1956 as a technical assistant. He studied Archaeology and Culture for a second M.A. degree in 1960 and, in 1972 also received a Ph.D. degree from the M. S. University, Baroda. He went on to a teaching career first at the Punjab University and then in at Kurukshetra University, carrying out archaeology of prehistoric sites in Haryana. He rose to become the Dean of the Faculty of Indic Studies before retiring in 1991.  Archaeological work  Bhan's early research was on the archaeology of prehistoric sites along the old river channels of Sarsuti‚ÄìGhaggar and Chautang rivers in Haryana. In 1968, he excavated the Indus culture site of Mitathal. His thesis on the \\"Historic Archaeology of Saraswati and Drishadavati Valleys\\" earned him a PhD in 1972. In 1975, Bhan published his major report, Excavations at Mitathal and Other Explorations in the Sutlej-Yamuna Divide, which became a fundamental reference for the study of Indus and post-Indus cultures. In 1987, Bhan was invited to give the presidential address to the Archaeology section of the Indian History Congress, where he came out strongly against the tendency among some archaeologists to identify the Indus Valley Civilisation with the Vedic cultures. His paper in The Making of History volume (2002) countered arguments made by archaeologists, B. B. Lal, S. P. Gupta et al. for an Aryan link to the Indus Valley Civilization. In 1996, he was awarded a senior fellowship by the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) and a year later, he was appointed as a member of the ICHR council. Irfan Habib, in his obituary of Bhan, believed him to be a man of \\"impeccable personal ethics, which matched well with his professional probity.\\" His academic work was said to bear a deep imprint of Marxism. He was also involved with the work of Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Haryana and took particular interest in the People's Science movement.  Ayodhya dispute  Suraj Bhan played a significant role during the Ayodhya dispute, supporting the case for the Babri Masjid. He along with historians, Ram Sharan Sharma, Dwijendra Narayan Jha and M. Athar Ali, were a group of four academics who submitted a document titled Babari Mosque or Rama's Birth Place? Historians Report to the Nation to the Minister of Home Affairs in May 1991. Bhan contributed towards the archaeological component of the report. The authors claimed to have scrutinised the evidence provided by the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) and rejected outright the idea of the mosque being the site of Rama's birth or of the possibility of it having been built atop a pre-existing temple. The authors dismissed the claim by B. B. Lal, a former director of the ASI, that he had discovered pillar bases next to the Babri Masjid during his excavation in the 1970s. However, they did so while noting that they were not given access to Lal's excavation notes. Bhan would later testify in the Allahabad High Court that the report had been hurriedly compiled \\"under pressure\\" from BMAC. In October 1992, the four historians wrote in the CPI(M)'s weekly newspaper, People's Democracy, reacting to the booklet Ram Janmabhumi Ayodhya: New Archaeological Discoveries stating that the VHP protagonists had indulged in \\"indiscriminate PWD-like excavation.\\" Bhan had earlier also contested statements by S. P. Gupta that the black basalt pillars in the Babri Masjid were once part of a Hindu temple. He also maintained that the carvings on the pillars were similar to those in the Buddhist architecture. The Babri Masjid was demolished on 6 December 1992. Suraj Bhan deposed as an expert witness in the Allahabad High Court on behalf of the pro-mosque parties in 2000, 2002, and again in 2006. He was the only one of the four authors of the Historians Report to the Nation to do so. On 5 March 2003, the Allahabad High Court ordered the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to excavate the site of the Babri Masjid in order to determine whether a temple-like structure had been demolished before the construction of the mosque. Suraj Bhan joined Irfan Habib and others in issuing a press statement denouncing the move. The ASI proceeded with its excavations and submitted its findings to the court in September 2003. Its report revealed the presence of a circular shrine, dateable to 7‚Äì10th century and a \\"massive structure\\", 50 metres by 30 metres, built in three structural phases during the 11‚Äì12th century. Bhan who had visited the digs in June 2003 criticised the ASI for conducting extensive horizontal diggings which destroyed all the Mughal period remains at the site when limited vertical trenching was all that was required. Questioning the methodologies employed to date the underground structure, he accused the ASI report of being an attempt to push back the antiquity of Ayodhya and thereby the Ramayana to . He proclaimed with certainty, that the \\"massive structure\\" found by the ASI was not a temple and that it was likely a Sultanate period mosque. Bhan appeared in the Allahabad High Court to state his professional opinion that the conclusion of the ASI report regarding the existence of any temple beneath the Babri mosque was baseless. While he was present at the excavation for only three days, he claimed that the ASI did not properly record the glazed ware, glazed tiles and bones found at the site. He made other observations such as on the use of lime mortar which he believed dated the underground structure to the Sultanate period. He also claimed that the shortcomings of the report could not be made good and alleged that the ASI lacked objectivity, professional integrity, and scientific rigour. Under examination, Bhan admitted having an inadequate knowledge of the Vedas and Puranas and that he was not a historian of the medieval period. He also agreed that he was not a specialist in architecture and admitted to never having studied the construction of mosques built on top of temples. He admitted to having formed his opinion prior to the submission of the ASI report and that it was his opinion that there was no requirement of excavation to resolve the dispute. In its 2010 verdict on the Ayodhya dispute, the Allahabad High Court criticised the professionalism of the expert witnesses who had appeared on behalf of the pro-mosque parties. On Suraj Bhan, the court felt that he had made vague statements and had failed to provide a proper reason to challenge the conclusions of the ASI. It dismissed as baseless his technical observations on matters such as the use of lime mortar which had been established to have been in use in India from at least 600 BCE, well before the Sultanate period. The court noted that Bhan had a predetermined attitude against the ASI and believed that rather than being condemned, the Survey deserved commendation and appreciation.

History Geller was born in The Bronx in New York City in 1954, and moved to the state of Florida in 1965. He attended Northwestern University, but did not graduate, instead receiving his bachelor's degree in history from the Florida State University in 1975. After graduation, Geller then attended the Florida State University College of Law, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1979. In 1989, he was elected the Chairman of the Miami-Dade County Democratic Party, serving in that capacity in 2000. During the 2000 presidential election, he played a prominent role as an attorney for the Al Gore presidential campaign. During the recount, Geller, seeking to confirm a theory that some Gore voters had accidentally punched the wrong hole in their ballots, requested a sample ballot from the Supervisor of Elections' office. After receiving the ballot from a clerk, Geller was accused of stealing a ballot, was mobbed by protesters, and had to be escorted to safety by police. \\"I requested [the sample ballot], which I'm entitled to do,\\" Geller said. \\"It was clearly marked 'sample ballot for use by Democratic Party.' The whole transaction was out in the open and all very calmly done. This Republican observer ‚Äî a woman with blond hair, a suit and clipboard ‚Äî was watching the whole thing. But the moment I started to walk away, she sicced the crowd on me. She said I was stealing a ballot and they surrounded me. It was all orchestrated.\\" Geller ran for Mayor of North Bay Village, a small city in northeastern Miami-Dade County, in 2004. He faced Frank DiMaggio and was able to win narrowly, receiving 54% of the vote to DiMaggio's 46%.http://www.miamidade.gov/elections/results/ele110204/cumu110204.pdf Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Dan Gelber was unable to seek re-election due to term limits in 2008, Geller ran to succeed him in the 106th District, which stretched from Fisher Island to Golden Beach in eastern Miami-Dade County. He faced Richard L. Steinberg in the Democratic primary, and he lost to Steinberg handily, receiving only 31% of the vote to Steinberg's 69%. In 2014, incumbent State Representative Joseph Gibbons was unable to seek re-election in the 100th District, so Geller ran in the Democratic primary to replace him, declaring, \\"My style is to be a consensus builder to build bridges between people. I‚Äôm a progressive. And I make no bones about being a progressive. But I have also lived in other parts of the state. I think I can do some good up there. I think I can make a difference. I think I can make this a better state.\\" He faced teacher John Paul Alvarez and pastor Ben Sorenson in the Democratic primary, and earned the endorsement of the Miami Herald, which praised him as a candidate who \\"knows this bi-county district well,\\" and noted that the district \\"stands to benefit from his legislative priorities.\\" Ultimately, Geller defeated his opponents handily, receiving 62% of the vote to Sorensen's 20% and Alvarez's 18%. In the general election, Geller faced fellow attorney Marty Feigenbaum and once again earned the endorsement of the Herald, which said that he was \\"thoroughly familiar with the issues.\\" References External links *Florida House of Representatives - Joe Geller *Joseph S.

The aim of blended space design is to provide people with the experience of feeling a sense of presence in the blended space, acting directly on the content of the blended space. Examples of blended spaces include augmented reality devices such as the Microsoft Hololens and games such as Pokemon GO in addition to many smartphone tourism apps, smart meeting rooms and applications such as bus tracker systems.  History  The idea of blending comes from the ideas of conceptual integration, or conceptual blending introduced by Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner. Originally focused on understanding linguistic expressions, the simple but powerful ideas of blending have been applied to many areas as detailed on Mark Turner's website. Creative thought arises from bringing together concepts from two input spaces. These spaces have some correspondences with each other and share a structure with a more generic space. The blended space takes a partial mapping of the concepts and structure of the two input spaces to provide a new structure that demonstrates properties not possessed by either of the input spaces. Fauconnier and Turner provide many examples of blends in their book along with descriptions of different types of blend (reflecting different types of projections from the two input spaces). They also provide guidance for creating blends that are effective \\"at the human scale\\". Manuel Imaz and David Benyon introduced blending theory to look at concepts in software engineering and human-computer interaction.  Describing spaces  Conceptual Blending in Mixed Reality Spaces There are two main components to any space. They are: #Objects ‚Äì The actual distinct objects which make up the medium/space. The objects thus effectively describe the space. #Agents ‚Äì Correspondents/users inside the space who interact with it through the objects. For presence in a blended space, there must be a physical space and a digital space. In the context of blended space, the higher the communication between the physical and digital spaces, the richer the experience. This communication happens through the medium of correspondents which relay the state and nature of objects. For the purpose of looking at blended spaces, the nature and characteristics of any space can be represented by these factors: # Ontology ‚Äì Different types of objects present in the space the total number of objects and the relationships between objects and the space. # Topology ‚Äì The way objects are placed and positioned. # Volatility ‚Äì Frequency with which the objects change. # Agency ‚Äì Medium of communication between the objects, and between the objects and users. Agency also encompasses the users inside the space. Physical Space ‚Äì Physical spaces are spaces which afford spatial interaction. This kind of spatial interaction greatly impacts the user's cognitive model. Digital Space ‚Äì Digital space (also called the information space) consists of all the information content. This content can be in any form.  Structure  The simplest implementation of a blended space requires two features. The first required feature is input. The input can range from tactile, to changes in the environment. The next required feature is notifications received from the digital spaces. The correspondences between the physical and digital space have to be abstracted and exploited by the design of the blended space. Seamless integration of both the spaces is rare. Blended spaces need anchoring points or technologies to link the spaces. A well designed blended space advertises and conveys the digital content in a subtle and unobtrusive way. Presence can be measured using physiological, behavioral, and subjective measures derived from the space.

His wife, Sandra Wede, is the owner of Ultima Hora. He was arrested while covering a public protest on 9 December 2013 and charged with sedition under an anti-terrorism law. Su√°rez was 45 years old at the time of the arrest. Career He began working in 2007 for √öltima Hora, which is based in the city of Santiago del Estero, the capital of the province of the same name. Arrest and detention At shortly after 9 p.m. on the night of 9 December 2013, Su√°rez, who was at the newspaper's offices, became aware that a protest for higher wages for police officers was taking place in Leopoldo Lugones Square. There were no reporters available at the offices at that hour to cover the story, so Su√°rez took a microphone and went out into the streets with a cameraman. They filmed the arrest and the aggressive police treatment of a protesting police officer, Norberto Villagr√°n, who was who was taken into custody in the presence of his wife and their daughters, aged 8 and 11. According to Perfil, policemen were protesting across the country for higher salaries on that day, but Villagran was the only police officer who decided to demonstrate in the city of Santiago del Estero. Sandra Wede later said that Villagr√°n had been peacefully protesting when he was ‚Äúattacked‚Äù by a group of policemen who arrested him and pushed him into a police car. Villagr√°n had reportedly spent a week in prison the previous year for saying that there were irregularities in police funds. After filming Villagr√°n's arrest, Su√°rez returned directly to the offices of √öltima Hora, where he posted a video of the arrest on the newspaper's website. Only minutes later, at about 10 p.m., approximately 30 police officers wearing hoods entered the newspaper's offices and handled him brutally. They took him into custody without having any arrest warrant or detention order, although they told him they had oral permission from Judge Rosa Falco to arrest him. He did not resist arrest. The police seized two computers and a cell phone. ‚ÄúThey did not respect the chain of custody of seized items,‚Äù Su√°rez later maintained. ‚ÄúThey took my notebook, a CPU and a cellphone with all my sources,\\" Su√°rez said, accusing them of ‚Äúviolating professional confidentiality.‚Äù Wede later said that Falco had ordered her to hand over the video taken by Su√°rez in the square. Falco had also told Wede that she had the right to verbally authorise a raid and that she did not want the video of Villagr√°n to be used politically. √öltima Hora condemned the arrest and detention of Su√°rez and stated ‚Äúthat the real reason behind the raid and the arrest is to cover up violent police behaviour.‚Äù V√≠ctor Daniel Nazar, Su√°rez's lawyer, called the accusation against his client ‚Äúextremely grave....In all my years in this profession I have never seen such a serious violation of legal rights.‚Äù On 18 December 2013, the Committee to Protect Journalists called on Argentinian authorities to immediately release Su√°rez, who at that point had been detained for over a week. ‚ÄúIt is ludicrous that a journalist be accused of sedition and spend nine days in jail solely for filming a protest and arrest,‚Äù said Carlos Laur√≠a, CPJ's senior Americas program coordinator. ‚ÄúWe urge Argentine authorities to drop the absurd accusations against Juan Pablo Su√°rez and release him immediately.‚Äù Gabriel Levinas, a reporter with Radio Mitre and editor of the news website Plazademayo, told CPJ that he had seen Su√°rez's file and that there was no evidence to support allegations of sedition. Su√°rez was held in custody for ten days. It was reported on 19 December that Su√°rez had been released. Wede went to Buenos Aires to try to get national coverage for the case. She met with the head of the LED Foundation, Silvana Giudici, and with opposition representatives. The Argentinian Journalists Forum (FOPEA) expressed concern about the ‚Äúlegal technical framework‚Äù employed by the judge. The Association of Argentinian Journalism Entities (ADEPA) also expressed ‚Äúdeep concern‚Äù about the case. On 19 December, opposition MPs gathered to demand free-speech guarantees. Judge Falco called Su√°rez in for questioning but later declined jurisdiction and sent the case to the federal courts. He was released, but on 13 May 2014 faced federal Judge Guillermo Molinari and prosecutor Pedro Sim√≥n, the latter of whom called for him to be tried for sedition under the anti- terrorism act, a crime for which he could be imprisoned for 12 years. Other charges included ‚Äúinciting collective violence‚Äù and ‚Äúterrorizing the population.‚Äù La Naci√≥n compared the ‚Äúlabyrinthine judicial process‚Äù to which he was subjected to the trial of Joseph K. in Kafka's The Trial. On 14 May 2014, Reporters Without Borders condemned the charges against Su√°rez. ‚ÄúWe call for the immediate withdrawal of these absurd charges against Su√°rez,‚Äù said Camille Soulier, the head of the ROB Americas desk. ‚ÄúHow can filming an arrest be construed as a terrorist activity? By using the anti-terrorism law against a journalist for the first time, the Santiago del Estero authorities are sending a clear message that they will tolerate no criticism.‚Äù Su√°rez's lawyer, V√≠ctor Nazar, told Reporters Without Borders: ‚ÄúThere are no legal grounds for the sedition charge and still less for applying the anti-terrorism law because the only thing Su√°rez did was cover a protest for more pay. The reasons are political. He is the only journalist who firmly criticizes the government‚Äôs policies and the only one to cover all the pay demands.‚Äù On 20 May 2014, Su√°rez met with members of the national legislature at an open hearing about his case. At the meeting, Su√°rez said ‚ÄúI do not believe in justice.‚Äù He noted that the prosecutor in his case, Sim√≥n, was allegedly guilty of an ‚Äúillegal land grab.‚Äù He said it was better to go to jail ‚Äúthan to live on your knees.‚Äù Deputy Omar Ducl√≥s stated that it was undemocratic to persecute journalist in this way. ‚ÄúWe are facing a clear attack on the freedom of expression of a media worker performing his duties by an ally of the Kirchner provincial government.‚Äù Deputy Laura Alonso said that the parliamentary Committee on Freedom of Expression had traditionally defended journalists in such situations, but that this was no longer the case because such committees had been ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù and were now ‚Äúowned.‚Äù At the meeting with national legislators, Su√°rez said of the charges against him: ‚ÄúThis is not a message for me, but for all of independent journalism.‚Äù He maintained that his arrest and prosecution were connected to the fact that he had questioned the conduct of the provincial governor Zamora and Zamora's wife, Claudia Ledesma Abdala, provisional president of the Senate. Su√°rez described the news media in Santiago del Estero as being divided between those who fear the government and those that have deals with the government. He was detained with five criminals in a cell barely more than one square meter in size. He was in detention for ten days, during which was hospitalized for dehydration after beginning a hunger strike to protest his treatment. On 23 May, Guillermo Molinari stated he would prosecute Su√°rez not for terrorism and sedition but for incitement to commit a crime. According to one report, Molinari ‚Äúdecided to keep this accusation based on evidence allegedly found in the mobile phones of Su√°rez and Nelson Villagr√°n.‚Äù Molinari officially ruled on 28 May that Su√°rez and Villagran should be prosecuted for inciting violence, but he dismissed the request of prosecutor Pedro Sim√≥n that they be tied for sedition under the Terrorism Act.

That section of BIAP was home to numerous Engineer units, in particular the 389th Combat Engineers, a chow hall, and a convoy marshaling area. History On April 5, 2004, the radical young cleric Muqtada al Sadr called for a jihad against coalition forces and wanted to gain control of Al Kut, An Najaf and Sadr City. This led to widespread fighting throughout the Sunni Triangle. Since his militia were no match for the M1 Abrams tanks of the recently arrived 1st Cavalry Division, they knew the soft underbelly of the Abrams tanks were the trucks they depended upon for fuel and ammunition. On Thursday night, April 8, the militia dropped eight bridges and overpasses around Convoy Support Center Scania thus halting all northbound traffic into the Sunni Triangle. The coalition forces then had to survive on the few days of supply they had on hand in Iraq. That same evening, 2LT James McCormick's Humvee gun truck, Zebra, fought off an enemy ambush at the turn into BIAP for about 20 minutes with him and SPC Brandon Lawson seriously wounded. After medical treatment, both returned to their convoy. The next day, Good Friday and the anniversary of the fall of Baghdad, the Iraqis ambushed any and every convoy that tried to enter or leave Baghdad International Airport. This resulted in the worst convoy ambush of the war ‚Äì the ambush of the 724th Transportation Company (see 2004 Iraq KBR convoy ambush). The next day all roads were coded black meaning that any convoy expected imminent attack.Dr. Donald P. Wright, Colonel Timothy R. Reese with Contemporary Operations Study Team, On Point II, Transition to the New Campaign: The United States Army in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM May 2003-January 2005, Combat Studies Institute Press, 2008. With no more convoys venturing out, the militia decided to attack the trucks where they parked. By Easter Sunday, April 11, several hundred trucks parked behind the southwest wall of BIAP defended by the C Battery, 4-5 Air Defense Artillery. By then the 1st Cavalry Division was 48 hours from mission failure and required emergency resupply of fuel and ammunition. A fuel convoy of the 706th Transportation Company ventured out of BIAP and was ambushed. Around lunch the Madhi Militia launched an attack near the south gate at BIAP. The attack began with suppressive fire on the guard tower while three sappers approached the wall just as the Zebra happened to be passing by. 2LT McCormick ordered his driver, CPL Bryan Noble, to drive on the ramp in time to engage the three sappers. The five crew members then held off the rest of the Iraqi militants at the irrigation ditch 50 meters away for the next five to ten minutes while about a dozen more truck drivers and military police Soldiers of the 501st Military Police Company 1st Armored Division came running to their assistance. For approximately 45 minutes, the enemy concentrated their attack on the section of wall occupied by the Zebra, and a handful of truck drivers and military police (MP) Soldiers fought back against intense small arms fire and repeated volleys of rocket propelled grenades. The M6 Linebacker outside the gate and truck drivers on the dirt ramp a hundred meters along the wall provided flanking fire. Intermittent breaks in .50 Caliber M2HB fire from Zebra on the Abrams mound were halted to allow SGT Bryant, a 1AD 501st MP Sergeant, to fire three consecutive AT-4 rounds into the enemy location. Later four Humvees of F Battery, 202nd Air Defense Artillery returned to the gate and added their flanking fire to the fight. Late in the battle, a HET convoy hauling tanks from the 1st Armored Division arrived at the gate and a colonel climbed up in the guard tower. He instructed McCormick to back the Zebra off the ramp and bring up SGT Christopher M. Lehman‚Äôs Humvee gun truck with a Mk 19 grenade launcher because McCormick‚Äôs M2 Browning .50 caliber machinegun could not hit the enemy mortar position. Finally, CPT Peter Glass‚Äô C Troop, 3-8 Cavalry arrived and replaced the gun trucks on the ramps with his tanks which ended the enemy resistance after 45 minutes of fighting.Richard E. Killblane, ‚ÄúBattle of BIAP, Part I,‚Äù Soldier of Fortune, August 2007 and ‚ÄúBattle of BIAP, Part II,‚Äù Soldier of Fortune, September 2007 Aftermath Thirty minutes after having defeated the enemy attack, the crew of the Zebra fought through three more ambushes to escort convoys with critical ammunition to the Green Zone for the 1st Cavalry Division. All but one of the five crew members was wounded that weekend, but all remained with their gun truck. With other emergency convoys of fuel and ammunition, the 1st Cavalry Division was able to beat back the al Sadr April Uprising. Twelve Bronze Star Medals and four Army Commendation Medals were awarded to truck drivers for this battle. McCormick was finally awarded the Silver Star Medal in 2014 for his role in this battle and the three convoy ambushes immediately after it. The battle ranks as one of the great feats of heroism of the US Army Transportation Corps. References Further reading Convoy Ambush Case Studies Vol. II, Iraq and Afghanistan Richard E.

With his emphasis on quiet sustained sonorities and textures, Gaber is counted among the early American minimalist composers, and considered to be a forerunner of drone and spectralism. His best known recorded composition, The Winds Rise in the North, has been called by musician Keith Fullerton Whitman \\"one of the holy grails of minimalism in music in the 20th century.\\" In 1978, he stopped composing, moved from New York City to San Diego, California, and began creating photo-collages, mixed media collages, paintings, and pen-and-ink works he called graphic music. However, in 1993 he started work on Die Plage (The Plague), an art-historical narrative of Germany from the Weimar Republic to the end of World War II, completing it in 2002. It grew to become a massive work of approximately 4,200 photomontaged canvases measuring . In the final three years of his life Gaber composed two works: I Saw My Mother Ascending Mt Fuji and In Memoriam 2010. The album of his last work was released two weeks before Gaber committed suicide in June 2011.  Artistic and musical influences  = Artistic influences = German Expressionism and Dada are the artistic movements that most influenced him. The particular artists that critics cite as evident in Gaber's work are Otto Dix, George Grosz, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. The photomontage works of John Heartfield and Hannah H√∂ch influenced him greatly, as did their use of photographs to subvert and criticize their subject matter. = Musical influences = Horace Reisburg, Gaber's music teacher at New Trier High School from 1958 to 1961 in Winnetka, Illinois, encouraged him to continue his studies at the Aspen Institute with Darius Milhaud in the summer of 1961. Gaber enrolled that fall in the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, where he studied first with Lajaren Hiller. But the faculty member who influenced Gaber the most was Kenneth Gaburo. The two formed a life-long friendship in which they investigated and challenged each other's basic aesthetic assumptions. In 1963, he moved to Rome to pursue further studies in composition with Aldo Clementi, Franco Evangelisti, Boris Poorena and Giulio Rotoli. On concluding his studies in 1964, he returned to the U.S., settling in New York City. From 1964 to 1966, Gaber studied with William J. Sydeman, who was on the faculty of the Mannes College of Music. Gaber was influenced by the creative ferment among fellow composers in the minimalist music world of New York City, especially Morton Feldman.  Works  = Artistic works = Gaber's visual art work took many forms, including photography, pen and ink, collage, photomontage and drawings. His pen-and-ink drawings of graphic music were first exhibited in a group show in Bern, Switzerland, in 1974. By April 1976, his graphic music work was featured in a solo exhibition at Gallery 219 in Buffalo, New York. In September 1976, the Alternative Center for International Arts, now known as the Alternative Museum, mounted a solo show of his drawings and graphic music. After moving to San Diego in 1982, Gaber turned to photography as his favored medium. By 1985, his experiments with photomontage led to acquisition of one of his works and its inclusion in an exhibit by the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego's Balboa Park, California. In the late 1980s, he experimented with mixed media collage and wood constructions. Both the wood and mixed media works led to exhibits in San Diego, California and Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1990 and 1991. One of 4,200 panels from Die Plage (The Plague) by Harley Gaber. Canvases are photomontage and charcoal, black-and-white, . In 1993, Gaber started work on what would become his magnum opus, Die Plage (The Plague). This work soon became the center of Gaber's efforts, displacing his work in all other media. When he completed it in 2002, it was composed of about 4,200 canvases, each measuring . Gaber used xerography to modify photographs, and then combined them on canvas using photomontage and charcoal. The work is ordered in chronological sequence, starting with Weimar Republic and ending at the conclusion of World War II. When exhibited in its entirety, with canvases arranged in rows five high, the work runs nearly in length. In 1995, Southwestern College in Chula Vista, California, mounted an exhibit of the first 950 canvases‚Äîits first public showing. Art critic Jonathan Saville, writing for the San Diego Reader, wrote: This exhibition at Southwestern College in San Diego, California, in 1995, was the first public showing of Die Plage (The Plague) This panel measured about 10 feet high and about 20 feet long. From September23 to October21, 2000, The Lab in Los Angeles, California exhibited roughly 700 canvases from all sections of the work done to date.

Composer Eric Richards described Gaber's minimalist music as an effort to \\"get inside the music.\\" > He notated minute directions for the attack, dynamic changes, and other > physical characteristics of each and every note, in ways that, while they > might have superficially resembled some of the serial music of that time, > were really his attempt to get beyond appearances, and slow down the sense > of time in the music through a deeper investigation of the sound itself. His compositions in the 1970s were mainly for strings, and in these works, he strived to suspend time. The Winds Rise in the North: String Quintet (1974), Sovereign of the Centre (1972) and Indra's Net (1974) are considered to be his most significant compositions. These minimalist works reflected Gaber's study of Buddhism.\\" Harley Gaber resumed composing in 2008, after receiving a commission from William Hellerman of the Downtown Ensemble, resulting in Webern's Gambit, a multi-media work for film and cello. It associated film imagery, including old German footage and recordings, with a cello part derived from pitches in a movement of Anton Webern's Piano Variations. In 2009, Harley Gaber composed I Saw My Mother Ascending Mt. Fuji using GarageBand to assemble and rework existing acoustic sound sources, in a manner similar to his visual photomontage works. It was produced by Philip Blackburn, and released on Innova Recordings. In 2011, Innova Recordings also published In Memoriam 2010, a work commissioned by the Dan J. Epstein Family Foundation in memory of his mother. Gaber's contributions as a composer were described by Shane Mack, in the obituary which he wrote for the British music publication, The Wire: > he and his music shared the same complex personality, uncompromised by > marketing concerns or wanting to fit into any scene.... it is the high level > of perfectly-realised thoughts in sound, that could only have sprung from > his fragile life of outsider-dom, that ensures his stature as one of > America's most important artists. Major performances of his work were produced on May 13, 1977, by the New York Philharmonic Chamber Ensemble, conducted by Pierre Boulez; the Berlin Festival; the Tanglewood Music Festival; the Once Festival at the University of Michigan; the Kitchen in New York City; Evenings for New Music in Buffalo and New York City.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle and Sosthenes in Ephesus, composed between 52‚Äì55 CE, and sent to the church in Corinth. Text The first page of 1 Corinthians in Minuscule 223 (14th century) The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 31 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Codex Vaticanus (AD 325‚Äì350) * Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) * Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) * Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 3‚Äì31) * Papyrus 14 (6th century; extant verses 25‚Äì27) * Papyrus 11 (7th century; extant verses 17‚Äì22) =Old Testament references= * = Footnote in 1 Corinthians in RSV Second Catholic Edition 2006 * = Opening greeting (1:1‚Äì3) =Verse 1= :Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother. NKJV Most English translations refer to Sosthenes as \\"our brother\\", but the actual text reads , Sosthenes ho adelphos, which literally means \\"Sosthenes the brother\\". \\"The salutation with my own hand‚ÄîPaul‚Äôs\\" in 1 Corinthians 16:21 suggests that the majority of the letter may have actually been scribed by someone else, and therefore many interpreters suggest that Sosthenes was the amanuensis of the Epistle.Meyer's New Testament Commentary on 1 Corinthians, accessed 13 March 2017; cf. T. Teignmouth Shore in Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on 1 Corinthians, accessed 14 March 2017 The address and greeting which open the Epistle conclude with the words Grace be unto you, and peace. Thanksgiving for Christ's total sufficiency (1:4‚Äì9) In the section of thanksgiving, Paul usually signals the issues to be dealt later in the letter, but he can always give thanks because God's sufficiency can resolve all problem in the person of his Son, Jesus Christ. The divisiveness of idolizing Christian teachers (1:10‚Äì17a) The disciples or pupils of a secular teacher must give exclusive loyalty to the teacher, and the Corinthians who were converted and baptized through the ministry of different teachers also perceived themselves in the secular way, that they engaged in quarrels over the merits of those teachers. Paul states this loyalty as idolatrous and wants them to follow the Messiah, not His servants. =Verse 12= : Now I say this, that each of you says, \\"I am of Paul,\\" or \\"I am of Apollos,\\" or \\"I am of Cephas,\\" or \\"I am of Christ.\\" NKJV *\\"Each of you says\\": Gill notes that Paul may have gotten the report from \\"the house of Chloe\\" regarding the schism among the church members. *\\"I am of Paul\\": Paul had been instrumental in the conversion and baptism of some members of the Corinthian church, as he was the first to lay the foundation of a Gospel church in this city. *\\"I am of Apollos\\": Apollos came to Corinth after Paul left. As an eloquent man with good knowledge of the Scriptures, he may have attracted many church members with his way of preaching. *\\"I am of Cephas\\" (or Simon Peter): Unlike Paul and Apollos, Peter was with Christ from the beginning, witnessing His miracles, hearing His doctrines, and having the apostleship. On these accounts, the church members highly valued him and the converted Jews among them, who still retained a regard to the ceremonies of the law, may have fixed on Peter as their minister. *\\"I am of Christ\\": taking Paul's words, some may have declared that they should not \\"be called by any other name than that of Christ\\". These people were \\"for Christ\\", not of Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or any other ministers of the word, but could still be \\"blame worthy\\" when they use Christ's name to deceive men or divide His interest.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, ‚Äì 1 Corinthians 1:12 Some authorities to the contrary have suggested that the Christ of this passage is a copying error and for example the noted Jewish historian Graetz says that that person is really Chrestus of Suetonius in Claudius 25 who provoked a \\"tumult\\" in Rome near the 49th year of the Christian era.Graetz, Heinrich Geschichte der Juden, Institut zur F√∂rderung der Israelitischen Litteratur (1853-70) III ii5 423 n.3; cf. p. 371 n.4, and IV3 77 n. I in Joseph Klausner, Jesus of Nazareth, The Macmillan Company 1925, pp. 60-1. Cf Suetonius, Claudius 25. Boasting in the Lord and not in the educated elite (1:17b‚Äì31) Orators or public speakers in the first century generally produce carefully crafted speeches to draw the attention or bewitch the hearers, based on the performance only, not the content, but Paul used none of the tricks (\\"with words of human wisdom\\", lit. \\"by means of the wisdom of rhetoric\\") when he preach the gospel of Christ. Jesus Christ sent Paul to preach the gospel, with its content \\"the cross of Christ\\", not to secure a personal following. Paul asks the Corinthians to reflect on the secular status or class of the messengers of God's wisdom, who are 'the foolish', whom secular society regarded as 'nobodies' as opposed to the 'elite' who in the first century were described as 'wise, influential in political sphere and well-born'. =The power of God= Paul speaks of the power of God in this letter () and in his letter to the Romans (Romans 1:16), and in the gospels, Jesus debates the subject of the resurrection with the Sadducees, who he says \\"do not know the scriptures [or] the power of God\\" (; ). =Verse 31= :That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. KJV Other texts replace \\"glories\\" (KJV: \\"glorieth\\") with \\"boasts\\".Translations at BibleGateway.com, accessed 16 March 2017 Paul quotes from the Septuagint version of in the Old Testament, \\"abbreviating quite freely\\" Meyer's NT Commentary on 1 Corinthians 1, accessed 13 March 2017 from the longer text: :Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, and let not the strong man boast in his strength, and let not the rich man boast in his wealth; but let him that boasts boast in this, the understanding and knowing that I am the Lord that exercise mercy, and judgment, and righteousness, upon the earth; for in these things is my pleasure, saith the Lord.Jeremiah 9:23‚Äì24 in Brenton's English Translation of the Septuagint  See also  * Related Bible parts: Psalm 34, Psalm 44, Isaiah 29, Jeremiah 9, Acts 18, 2 Corinthians 10  References  Sources * *  External links  * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 01 ","title":"1 Corinthians 1"},{"id":"44500469","text":"Blake David Annen (born May 28, 1991) is an American football coach and former tight end.

The gesture, in which the forefinger and thumb of each hand are pressed together to form an \\"O\\" shape, is used to show support for the team. First used by University of Oregon band directors as a cue to indicate the song to be played, it gained its current meaning after a photograph of quarterback Joey Harrington appeared on the front page of The Oregonian making the \\"O\\" sign with his hands.  Origin  The \\"O\\" gesture was popularized by Oregon Ducks football quarterback Joey Harrington, who was photographed displaying it on the front page of The Oregonian in 2001 The gesture was first used by University of Oregon band directors, who relied on visual cues to direct the ensemble due to crowd noise. Steven Paul, who served as band director from 1983 to 1989, used the sign to prompt musicians to begin performing the fight song \\"Mighty Oregon\\". It was one of several gestures used by Paul and subsequent band directors, including Todd Zimbelman, who served as the band director from 1999 to 2005. It became popularized after a photograph of quarterback Joey Harrington making the \\"O\\" appeared on the front page of The Oregonian one day following the Civil War game in 2001. Harrington had made the gesture at the band, hoping to hear the fight song one more time. In 2014, Harrington recalled: The moment was photographed by Bruce Ely, photographer at The Oregonian, and Thomas Boyd, who worked for the Eugene Register-Guard at the time. Ely recalled, \\"I remember calling editors and telling them it would be a cool picture for the front page. It took off from there. I think Tom and I are the only two people that happened to be in position.\\" Harrington displayed the gesture again at the Fiesta Bowl.  Adoption  Fans continued displaying the \\"O\\" at sporting events following the 2001 game. Nike gloves and other merchandise have been produced showing the symbol. According to John Canzano, sports writer for The Oregonian, the gesture has become \\"a universal non-verbal rally cry for the university\\". The Winter 2014 edition of the Oregon Quarterly includes a photograph of Lady Gaga \\"throwing the O\\" with a UO alumna. Controversy As Oregon players began to use the gesture on the field after a good play, Fox Sports rules analyst Mike Pereira, a former NFL and college football official, indicated that he thought the use of the sign bordered on unsportsmanlike conduct, which could lead to a 15-yard penalty. Pereira later clarified his comments, indicating that the sign should be allowed, as long as it was not \\"prolonged\\" or \\"directed at an opponent.\\" Teachers in an American Sign Language class at Oregon have cautioned that since the gesture is made with a more spade-like than round shape, is the word \\"vagina\\" rather than the letter \\"O\\". Former Ducks player LaMichael James, who took the class, avoided making the sign for fear of being misinterpreted.

The term comes from Ritterfr√∂mmigkeit coined by Adolf Waas in his book Geschichte der Kreuzz√ºge. Many scholars debate the importance of knightly piety, however it is apparent as an important part of the chivalric ethos based on its appearance within the Geoffroi de Charny's \\"Book of Chivalry\\" as well as much of the popular literature of the time. Origins A relationship between Christ and warrior is first seen in secular sources dating back to Carolingian times. This is evident within the chansons de geste or songs of heroic deeds. Both the Chanson de Roland and the Chanson de Guillaume demonstrate Christian themes in their tales of the fight against the nonbeliever. Both have elements of an earthly as well as a spiritual fight. Thus by the time of the Chivalric Codes Christianity is already firmly entrenched within the warrior classes. Keen dedicates much of the credit to the effective teaching of the priesthood as well as the close relationship between the nobility and the monasteries. However, the Catholic Church traditionally had an uneasy relationship with secular warriors dating back to the time of the Roman Empire. It was generally accepted by the Church that warfare and killing was sinful. During the later period of the Empire, theologian Augustine of Hippo wrote of a Just War in the City of God. In this theory he claimed it would be sinful not to defend God if there was no other way to resolve a conflict.Augustine, Philip Schaff, Augustine: City of God During the late tenth and early eleventh centuries the Church involved itself more with warfare. First came the Peace and Truce of God movements. This was one way for the Church to attempt to Christianize society while at the same time protect non-combatants. The movement promised severe punishments to those who broke this law. However, it was met with mixed success. In 1095, Pope Urban II preached the First Crusade at Clermont. Here, the Church officially sanctioned lay knights fighting for the Faith when Urban said that any who fought would be absolved of their sins rather than tarnish their soul for killing. By this time knights were already concerned with their immortal soul enough to fight for the Church. By the time the Church began to accept warfare and create the idea of a holy war, piety had already become entrenched in the warfare of the lay knight. However, as the time of increasing church involvement was the formative period of the Chivalric Codes, it helped add another dynamic to the Ritterfr√∂mmigkeit. Ritterfr√∂mmigkeit Ritterfr√∂mmigkeit is the unique strand of piety held by knights which is more than just a belief in God or fighting in defense of God. Marcus Bull said, \\"One of the most important features of the piety of eleventh-century arms- bearers was that it was associative, passive to the extent that it was inspired and sustained by the spiritual resources of a monastic or clerical √©lite.\\" Bull's idea is that knights believed in God, and they supported the church not for personal worldly gain (this may have been a contributing factor but not the main factor) because of this belief and their desire for salvation. This is demonstrated in many ways. Knights demonstrated this by not only fighting for God, but many times they would give trophies of war to a major church or monastery as sign of support. Some Burgundian Knights who fought in Spain promised all of their plunder to St. Odilo of Cluny. Keen said, \\"The richness of the Cluniac ritual and of monastic vestments and ceremony clearly had a powerful impact on the imagination of secular nobles.\\" Many would also bring back relics from their fighting or even join a monastery themselves toward the end of their lives. In fact, it was common for a man to join a religious community he had supported in order to end his career as a way of retirement. Those who could afford it would even provide money or land for a church as an act of patronage or send their younger children to monasteries as an act of oblation. The patron of a church held much power because he had the right to appoint the local priest. This could be used politically to gain favor with certain people or to further one's own family within the church. Because of the political favor this could gain a person, the purpose has been highly debated among academics. Elizabeth Gemmil wrote, \\"The use or abuse of patronage...was the driver of social mobility.\\" Knights and the Crusades The Crusades are an important dynamic of Knightly Piety, and much of its historiography focuses on the Crusades and why knights were inspired to join them. A cleric of the church was expressly forbidden from killing and could not carry a weapon. As the Church became more militant, it needed a way to fight its battles. The preaching of the Crusade opened up the knighthood to be the tool of the Church. The Church attempted to command the warrior classes to do its bidding. While the call for warriors to defend the Church became popular, the idea of the Church having control for the most part did not. This demonstrates that while knights believed in the defense of the church and God, they were secular and not part of the church. It distinguishes this strand of piety from that of the clergy, and shows that knights had independent and different roots. However, there were some who did join the Church, and this led to the creation of a new type of order. These were the Christian military orders, like the Templars and Hospitaliers, separate from the regular knighthood. Members of these orders were knights who had taken vows to God and were part of the Church. However, they were also removed from the other aspects of chivalry so their devotion to God became the most important aspect of their life, and it focused less on the other chivalric virtues. Literature This view of knightly piety appears throughout the literature of the Middle Ages. While the details of the literature cannot be taken at face value, the appearance of Christianity in these works marks the importance piety to the warriors of the time. In Lohengrin, Christian prophesy and miracles are spread throughout the work which takes place during the Crusades. The Arthurian Legends are also full of references to God. In Chr√©tien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail, Perceval has two mentors: his mother and Gornemant. Both of them tell Perceval to make sure he always went to church when he could when telling him how to be a knight. His mother told him this before he left along with telling him how to treat women. Gornemant told him this while teaching him how to fight. This demonstrates the importance of piety as much as the values of prowess, franchise, and Courtoisie. The eight knightly virtues drawn from the code of Chivalry are devotions, courtly manners, fellowship, piety, fairness, service, bravery and justice. According to Shopenhaur in Parerga of his Aphorisms on the wisdom of life, he explains knightly honor as a code of honor distinct from Roman and Greek honor, which is specific to the upper-class, officers, service-men and military, and all those who closely imitate them to gain favor, he states the men of honor principles are; # Knightly honor consists not in other people's opinions of what we are worth, but in whether they express it or not. As soon as anyone utters something deprecatory of us, our honor is gone for ever unless we can gain honor. Honor is gained and renewed if title is bestowed by his service or deeds. # Honor rests, not on what a man does, but on what he suffers, the obstacles he encounters; differing from the honor which prevails in all else, in consisting, not in what he says or does himself, but in what another man says or does. # Honor has absolutely nothing to do with what a man may be in and for what in himself; or, again, with the question whether his moral character can ever become better or worse, and any such inquiries. If your honor happens to be attacked it can be restored in its entirety in a duel. # To receive an insult is disgraceful; to give one, honorable. Note: The inverse strongly promotes vice, giving way to vice-respect and further disincentive to collectivist action and welfare. # The highest court to which a man can appeal in any differences he may have with another on a point of honor is the court of physical force, that is, of brutality or might. Note: knights by this time tended towards lightness and warrior skill over armor. # The only word one may not break is the word of honor --upon my honor, as people say-- the presumption being that every other form of promise, oath or pact may be broken. Although one may even break one's word of honor and still remain honorable through a duel, fighting with those who maintain that we pledged our word. Military class The military class is a feudal society loose hierarchy, which evolved from a kingship to better serve the realm by formal religious, Catholic guidance or military tribunal. Examples include the Kshatriya or Martial castes in ancient and modern India, the Khalsa class of Sikhism in the Punjab, the samurai class in feudal Japan, the Timawa and Maharlika classes in pre-colonial Philippines and noble knights in feudal Europe.

Over time, various members of the Villiers family were made knights, baronets and peers. Peerages held by the Villiers family include the dukedoms of Buckingham (1623-1687) and Cleveland (1670-1709), as well as the earldoms of Anglesey (1623-1661), Jersey (since 1697) and Clarendon (since 1776). Perhaps the most prominent members of the family were those who received the two dukedoms: George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1592‚Äì1628) rose to fame and influence as favourite of King James I of England, while Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland (1640‚Äì1709) became a mistress of King Charles II of England, by whom she had five children. History George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1592‚Äì1628), the favourite of King James I of England, by Daniel Mytens the Elder. Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland (1640‚Äì1709), a mistress of King Charles II of England, by Sir Peter Lely. 7th (left) and 8th (right) Earls of Jersey in All Saints' parish churchyard, Middleton Stoney, Oxfordshire =Descent= The Villiers family had been settled at Brooksby, Leicestershire, since at least 1235. In the early 13th century the tenant of Brooksby, Gilbert de Seis, married a member of the Villiers family, a line of minor gentry of Norman descent. The estate remained in Villiers hands for the next 500 years. At this time, Brooksby consisted of the hall, the nearby Church of St Michael and All Angels, a small number of peasants' houses and a field system with common land. In the 16th century, the family was represented by George Villiers (‚Ä† 1606), a minor gentleman who is said to have been a \\"prosperous sheep farmer\\". He was High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1591, and a Knight of the Shire for the county from 1604 until his death. He was knighted in 1593. Sir George Villiers was married twice, and left nine surviving children. Among the children from his first marriage were the eldest son, Sir William Villiers, 1st Baronet (‚Ä† 1629), who became the ancestor of the Villiers baronets; Edward (‚Ä† 1626) who became Master of the Mint and President of Munster; while two daughters married into the Boteler and Washington families, respectively. Among the children from Sir George Villiers' second marriage to Mary (n√©e Beaumont, ‚Ä† 1632) were George (‚Ä† 1628), the favourite of King James I of England who was eventually created Duke of Buckingham, and his sister Susan (‚Ä† 1652), who married the 1st Earl of Denbigh. According to Thomson,Thomson, Gerald Malcolm. The Prime Ministers - From Robert Walpole to Margaret Thatcher. New York: William Morrow (1981), p. xxii; ; accessed 8 April 2014. Sir George Villiers is the ancestor of sixteen British prime ministers from the 3rd Duke of Grafton to David Cameron. =Rise to wealth and influence= In August 1614, then twenty-one-year-old George Villiers became the favourite of King James I of England and remained in this position until the king's death in 1625. Under James I's patronage Villers advanced rapidly through the ranks of the nobility. In 1615 he was knighted as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber and in 1616 elevated to the peerage as Baron Whaddon and Viscount Villiers. He was made Earl of Buckingham in 1617, then Marquess of Buckingham in 1618, and eventually Earl of Coventry and Duke of Buckingham in 1623.Wroughton p. 221 Buckingham was the king's constant companion and closest advisor. Even after James I's death, Buckingham remained at the height of royal favour under Charles I, until he was assassinated in 1628. Buckingham was buried in Westminster Abbey, while his titles passed to his son George (1628‚Äì1687), upon whose death they became extinct. =Continuing influence= As a royal favourite during the reigns of James I and Charles I, Buckingham used his enormous political influence to prodigiously enrich his relatives and advance their social positions, which soured public opinion towards him.Stewart p. 314 Under his influence, several members of his immediate family were made knights, baronets and peers. His half-brother Edward (‚Ä† 1626) was knighted in 1616, while his mother was created Countess of Buckingham in her own right in 1618 and his eldest half- brother William (‚Ä† 1629) was created a baronet in 1619. Two of Buckingham's other brothers were similarly honoured when John (‚Ä† 1658) was created Baron Villiers of Stoke and Viscount Purbeck in 1619, and Christopher (‚Ä† 1630) was created Baron Villiers of Daventry and Earl of Anglesey in 1623. Sir Edward Villiers (‚Ä† 1626) married Barbara St John, daughter of Sir John St John (‚Ä† 1594) of Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire, by whom he had ten children. Villiers' wife was the niece of Oliver St John, who was created Viscount Grandison in 1623. Grandison had no issue, so the Duke of Buckingham arranged for his half- brother's sons to inherit that title. Sir Edward Villiers's eldest son, William (‚Ä† 1643), thus succeeded as second Viscount Grandison in 1630. He was the father of Barbara Villiers (‚Ä† 1709), one of the mistresses of King Charles II, by whom she had five children, and who was created Duchess of Cleveland in 1670. Sir Edward Villiers's second and third sons, John (‚Ä† c.1661) and George (‚Ä† 1699), succeeded as 3rd and 4th Viscounts Grandison, while the fourth son, Sir Edward Villiers (‚Ä† 1689), was father of Edward Villiers (‚Ä† 1711), who was created both Baron Villiers and Viscount Villiers in 1691 as well as Earl of Jersey in 1697. The 1st Earl of Jersey's sister, Elizabeth Villiers (‚Ä† 1733), was the presumed mistress of King William III of England from 1680 until 1695. Thomas Villiers (‚Ä† 1786), the second son of the 2nd Earl of Jersey, was created Baron Hyde and Earl of Clarendon in 1776. On the death of the 4th Viscount Grandison in 1699, the title passed to his grandson, the 5th Viscount. He was the son of Brigadier-General the Hon. Edward Villiers (‚Ä† 1693), eldest son of the 4th Viscount. In 1721 the 5th Viscount Grandison was created Earl Grandison. Upon his death in 1766, the earldom became extinct while the viscountcy passed to his second cousin William Villiers, 3rd Earl of Jersey, who became the 6th Viscount Grandison. In 1746 Elizabeth Mason, daughter of the 1st Earl Grandison, was created Viscountess Grandison, and in 1767 she was made Viscountess Villiers and Countess Grandison. All three titles became extinct on the death of the 2nd Earl Grandison in 1800. Theresa Villiers (born 1968), the British Conservative Party politician and former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, is a descendant of Edward Ernest Villiers (1806‚Äì1843), a son of George Villiers (‚Ä† 1827) and brother of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon.

In 1871, he had his first public showing at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts and won First Prize there in 1878. He also opened a studio in Madrid and took part in decorating the Anglada and Mazarredo palaces, the ceilings of the Caf√© de Fornos (now gone) and the Cantina Americana. In 1885, after failing to receive a Professorship at the \\"School of Arts and Crafts\\", he applied for and received a fellowship to study at the \\"Academia de Espa√±a en Roma\\" but, two years later, was granted leave to study in Paris instead.Brief biography by Carmen Gracia @ the Carmen Thyssen Museum website. At the Exposition Universelle (1889) he presented his now-famous painting Expulsion of the Jews from Spain, only to discover that the French public apparently no longer appreciated historical works, so he presented it in Spain, where it was better received. In 1890, perhaps as a result of this experience, he abandoned that subject in favor of genre scenes, landscapes and illustrating. In 1896, he returned to Spain, where he married and reopened his studio. Many of his works appeared in the magazine Blanco y Negro. He also illustrated some of the Episodios Nacionales of Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s. and created decorations for the palace of the Infanta Isabella, which were highly praised. Overall, however, his portraits stand out. In 1906, he once again applied for an academic position, this time at the Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, and was rejected in favor of Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal. As compensation, the school created a chair in the \\"Theory and Esthetics of Color\\" especially for him. He held that post until his death from heart failure. Among his many honors are the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabel the Catholic and the Cross of the Order of St. Michael (Bavaria), presented at an exhibition in Munich in 1885.

Biography  = Early life = Born in Bilbao in 1954, Muro began painting from childhood. At age 22 he presented his first solo exhibition. At this time he was a pupil of the Basque painter Jos√© Luis Aldecoa,Jos√© Luis de Aldecoa Echebarria but his technical training influenced his painting framed in pop art with a tendency towards hyperrealism. He combined painting with artistic forms such as documentary cinema and photography, while working as an engineer. This economic independence made his passion for painting not contaminated by commercial purposes and passing trends. = Figurative painting = On the border of hyperrealism, natural landscapes, urban landscapes, portraits and other more classic framed within imaginative realism are some of his most outstanding works. He typically applies acrylic paint on wooden canvas and applies mixed techniques.  Exhibitions and painting competitions  Since 2010, he takes up his dedication with painting and his art is evolving, beginning then for him a period of prosperity, participating international competitions, art fair exhibitions and attending workshops with the most outstanding Spanish realist painters of this time.Jos√© Ram√≥n Muro presenta la exposici√≥n 'Las luces y las sombras'El ciclo de exposiciones temporales en los Centros Municipales de Distrito de Bilbao inaugurar√° el pr√≥ximo lunesExpodistrito 2016: Urtarrila- Martxoa / Enero-MarzoEstos son los 40 pintores seleccionados para el Certamen del Parlamento de La Rioja  Pictorial style trends  The stages of Jos√© Ram√≥n Muro's life are reflected in his works, particularly in the imaginative realism of classical touches, a genre that the artist cultivated throughout his career. He will be remenbered, especially for his masterful paintings on the border with hyperrealism, for the meticulous preparation of the chosen theme, a refined technique, a careful composition and the inclusion of nuances that enrich the perspective on the whole. The well-defined vanishing lines that emphasize the perspective in addition to great contrasts are a general style present in his paintings. In the creations of the last years, the painter raises all his achievements to the level of maturity, the style achieved through years and effort, and manifests an absolute mastery of pictorial techniques.Jos√© Ram√≥n Muro  References  Category:Living people Category:1954 births Category:People from Bilbao Category:21st-century Spanish painters Category:20th-century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters ","title":"Jos√© Ram√≥n Muro"},{"id":"44500746","text":"Big Idea in marketing and advertising is a term used to symbolize the foundation for a major undertaking in these areas - an attempt to communicate a brand, product, or concept to the general public, by creating a strong message that pushes brand boundaries and resonates with the consumers.Big Ideas: Research can make a big difference The term \\"Big Idea\\" has been used in the works of marketing gurus David Ogilvy and George Lois, and in a book authored by Thomas H.

The concept was reinforced in British culture by a scene in the Blackadder episode Nob and Nobility in which Edmund Blackadder kicks the cat when annoyed, and the cat bites the mouse, and the mouse bites Baldrick. In current usage, the name envisions a scenario where an angry or frustrated employee comes home from work looking for some way to take out his anger, but the only thing present is the cat. He physically abuses it as a means of relieving his frustration, despite the cat playing no part in causing it. Workplace or family dynamics Kicking the cat is commonly used to describe the behaviour of staff abusing coworkers or subordinates as a mechanism to relieve stress. This behaviour can result in a chain reaction, where a higher-ranking member of the company abuses their subordinate, who takes it out on their own subordinate, and so on down the line. This domino effect can also be seen in family dynamics, where the father yells at the mother who yells at the older child who yells at the younger child who yells at the pet.Cooney, Beth, Grumpy Ol' Dad, Sun-Sentinel, May 2, 1999. Retrieved 5 February 2015. Blaming others can lead to kicking the dog where individuals in a hierarchy blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the \\"dog\\"). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.Jeanna Bryner: Workplace Blame Is Contagious and Detrimental, LiveScience, 2010-01-19, citing the January 2010 issue of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.'. Psychological theories According to Psychology Today, \\"Anger and frustration in one part of life can lead us to lash out at innocent people (or pets) in another.\\" The technical term for this kind of behaviour is \\"displaced aggression\\". Kicking the cat is looked upon unfavourably and viewed as a sign of poor anger management. According to author Steve Sonderman, \\"Men funnel 90 percent of their emotions through anger\\" and may \\"kick the cat\\" as a substitute for grief, anxiety or other emotions. Psychology author Raj Persaud suggests that people \\"kick the cat\\" as a means of catharsis because they fear expressing their full emotions to the peers and colleagues.

The facility which includes the historic Holman Stadium was originally created as a Navy housing base, and was transformed into the home of spring training for Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, as well as the Vero Beach Dodgers from 1980 to 2006, and the Vero Beach Devil Rays from 2007 to 2008. It has since evolved into a multi-sport destination that includes an option of room and board via their on-site villas. History Historic Dodgertown was originally built as a Navy housing base for all of the members of the Navy and Marines that trained at the US Naval Air Station during World War II that was located directly across the street. When Branch Rickey began looking for a permanent spring training site in 1948 he was introduced to a large area of land in Vero Beach, Florida by Bud Holman, a local businessman, as the perfect place to host a fully contained training camp for the Major League club as well as the other 26 minor league teams. The Dodgers and the city of Vero Beach ended up coming to an initial five-year lease agreement that included the naming of the property as \\"Dodger Town\\". A stadium was completed in 1953. The Los Angeles Dodgers eventually left Vero Beach, Florida for a new spring training home in Arizona after the 2008 spring training season ended, Once the Los Angeles Dodgers departed, Historic Dodgertown closed its doors and shut down due to financial instability. Minor League Baseball reopened the facilities and renamed it Vero Beach Sports Village. That change did not last long as they were set to close again in 2012. Then Peter O'Malley with the help of his sister Terry O‚ÄôMalley Seidler and two ex- Dodgers pitchers Chan Ho Park and Hideo Nomo reinvested into Historic Dodgertown.

Studies  His father was a cabinetmaker for the Royal Court. He left school in 1886, after the loss of both of his parents left him with a nervous ailment, and became a student of the painter, . Although he also studied silviculture and law, he eventually decided to focus on art as a career. He was married in 1893 to the daughter of a local catechist.Brief biography @ the Vejen Kunstmuseum. He spent a year working with Jens Jensen- Egeberg, but his greatest inspiration came during a stay in Paris from 1896 to 1899, when he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian with Tony Robert-Fleury and became acquainted with his fellow Danish artists, Rudolph Tegner, Johannes Holbek and Niels Hansen Jacobsen.Biographical notes @ Kunstindeks Danmark. This was followed by a long series of travels; many in the company of Tegner. His trips included Italy (1901-1903 and 1905-1907), Greece (1902), Spain and Morocco (1905), Bruges (1909) and Gotland (1910). Throughout his work, he attempted to forge a connection between writing and graphic expression; publishing two works with text to advance his goal: Livets Skov (Living Forest) and Forvandlede Blomster (Transformed Flowers). Asger Jorn considered some of his early works to be forerunners of Surrealism. His later works were more naturalistic. In an unpublished memoir, Mindet og Nuet (Memories and the Present) from 1921, he described the life of the Danish art community in Paris and their attraction to Symbolism and Art Nouveau. He was president of the Graphic Arts Society from 1921 until his death.

The supporting cast includes Sean Bell and William MacDonald. The story is based on the missions of hurricane hunters who locate and track hurricanes.Kotsch 1983, pp. 18‚Äì19. Plot Meteorologist Leah Kaplan (Daryl Hannah) and her team of National Storm Center (NSC) scientists set out from Jacksonville, Florida on a routine tracking mission to gather data on Hurricane Josephine, forming up over the Atlantic Ocean. Along with Leah, technician Tommy Cramer (Terry Chen) and meteorologist Steve Pastor (Sean Bell) have been joined by a reporter, Ryan Stewart (Dylan Neal) gathering information on a feature article on the hurricane hunters. Both Leah and Tommy worry that Steve, recently furloughed because of a drinking problem, will be unreliable. Ryan also is an unnecessary complication to the flight as he continually probes for details about the mission and Leah's background and motivation. Leah reports back to her supervisor Eli Harder (William MacDonald) who is involved with a full-scale evacuation of Corpus Christi, Texas called by NSC Director James McCaffee (Mackenzie Gray), due to the proximity of Hurricane Ike. As Hurricane Hunters Flight 263 enters the hurricane outer wall at 1,500 ft where the winds and turbulence are at their greatest intensity, the data that is being returned from the launching of dropsondes indicates that the hurricane is gathering strength. Relaying the message back to headquarters does not bring an immediate response as the Director worries that Leah's past background in losing her parents in Hurricane Edna has clouded her judgment, a concern that Leah's psychiatrist Dr. Johnson (Gwynyth Walsh) has been exploring. The sudden pitching and turbulence pitches Steve headfirst into his control console, precipitating a fatal heart attack. For a brief period in the eye of the hurricane, Leah, Ryan and Tommy are able to deal with Steve's death. Leah again tries to alert the NSC that Hurricane Josephine has shifted and is headed directly to Jacksonville. Announcing a second evacuation is problematic, the NSC Director, despite Eli's pleas to look at the data Leah is sending, refuses to change the evacuation plans already in progress. The violent storm suddenly turns into a level 5 hurricane with winds at over battering Flight 263. Captain Henry Gersh (Barclay Hope) and co-pilot Ben Tillner (Chad Cole) on his first hurricane hunters flight, wrestle the aircraft through a climb that abruptly turns into an out-of-control dive to wavetop heights. After a fire in one of the engines is doused by the violent rain storm outside, electrical systems begin shorting out, with both Henry and Tommy blinded by the sparking equipment. Leah is abruptly hurled into the ceiling as the aircraft enters a parabolic maneuver. Turbulence increases with the rear exit door torn off, and the sudden depressurization sucks both Leah and Tommy out of the aircraft. Caught in the cargo netting, Leah is still alive but badly hurt. Ryan reacts quickly to haul Leah back inside, with the two crawling their way to the cockpit for safety. Leah has a dislocated shoulder that Ryan attempts to reset but with Henry blinded, she convinces Ryan that he has to help Ben fly the crippled aircraft. Receiving Flight 263's mayday distress message and on the ground reports of the hurricane already battering the coast, Eli finally convinces the Director that Hurricane Josephine is the greater danger. Ben and Ryan manage to bring the aircraft down safely at Jacksonville, and as Henry and Leah are brought out by emergency crews, all the surviving members of the flight find out that their loved ones are safe.

Principal photography under the working title of Hurricane Hunter took place in 2008 with location shooting at Maple Ridge and Vancouver, British Columbia. One of the important elements was in the use of a Nolinor Aviation Convair 580, tail number C-FTAP. The aircraft appeared as a \\"hurricane hunter\\", with its interior modified to accommodate computer and radar monitoring equipment.

Before the 2003 invasion, Al Kut was home to an Iraqi airfield and suspected chemical weapons plant,https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1048499781152966360 thus making it an important target during the invasion. Al Kut lay in the way of the planned Coalition advanced into Baghdad.  Battle of Al Kut  On April 3, 2003, the 1st Marine Division reached the outskirts of Al Kut, and broadcast a warning to the Iraqi defenders there, ordering them to surrender by 0700 GMT. The deadline passed with no response, and the US launched their assault on Al Kut. On April 3, several US military units advanced into Al Kut, meeting little resistance until they closed in within 1,000 yards of their objectives. At that point, Iraqi soldiers and irregulars opened fire with small arms and RPGs. Fearing a close-quartered urban battle, the US forces remained on the outskirts of the city, returning fire and killing many defenders. Numerous air strikes, including a B-52 strike, were launched on the Iraqi defenses. Numerous GBU-16 bombs were dropped from US warplanes, destroying many Iraqi T-62 tanks, BMPs, and support vehicles. On the ground, American soldiers were briefly pinned down by gunfire from an Iraqi bunker, where numerous Iraqi infantry had gathered. The gunfire was answered by numerous tank rounds and heavy machine gun fire, and after four hours the bunker's defenders had been killed, injured, or captured. One US soldier, Corporal Mark Evnin, was killed during the battle when he was mortally wounded by enemy machine gun fire. In a last attempt to drive off the attackers, Iraqi soldiers attempted to charge the American tanks with small arms and machine guns, but were cut down by American tank fire, and the 1st Marine Division advanced into Al Kut. After capturing the city and its bridges, Al Kut was effectively under US control. Several militants of the Fedayeen Saddam continued to hold out within isolated pockets in the city, but no major Iraqi forces now opposed the American drive into Baghdad. American losses during the battle numbered at least 1 dead, about a dozen wounded, and 1 ACE truck destroyed.

Accident In the early 2000s, a project was started to construct higher-speed rail lines in Turkey, at first between the highest-populated cities Istanbul and Ankara. At 19:45 EEST on July 22, 2004, a higher-speed train named \\"Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoƒülu\\", heading to Ankara from Haydarpa≈üa, Istanbul, derailed near Mekece village of Pamukova, Sakarya during one of its first journeys, away from Istanbul. Of the 234 passengers and nine crew on board, 41 were killed and 80 injured. The accident investigation revealed that the train ran into a curve with a radius of near Mekece railway station with a speed of , where the speed limit was . The speeding caused the left wheel of the second passenger car to spring off the track. The train's balance quickly deteriorated, and two following cars coupled to the derailed car drifted sideways. Four cars were overturned, while two cars were damaged heavily, having crashed into each other. The locomotive and the first car remained undamaged on the track, and were taken to Osmaneli railway station after the accident. Aftermath An analysis carried out by the railway simulation software Adams/Rail showed that a train running at would derail at the curve, while one at a speed of would pass the spot without derailing. There were no warning signs or signals available at the accident scene. The investigation commission reported that the total journey duration, which was 5 hours and 15 minutes, was too short for the route. The new suggested time was 6 hours. Finally, it was determined that the unsuitable railway infrastructure was one of the main factors that influenced the accident. At the time of the opening of the line one month before, experts had warned the government to modernize the infrastructure before putting higher-speed trains in service. Immediately after the accident, Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m, the Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication, was criticized harshly in the public square, and his resignation was demanded. However, he rejected the demands and remained in his office. Ten years after the accident, the court found the two engineers of the train guilty of negligence causing death. However, since the trial was ruled on over seven-and-half years following the date of the accident, the sentences could not be executed according to Turkish law.

Early life  Wilkerson was born February 9, 1926, in Chicago Heights, Illinois. He graduated from Bloom Township High School in 1944 and joined the United States Air Force.  Military career  He moved to Tuskegee, Alabama for training and was assigned to the 617th Bombardment Squadron. He became 2nd Lieutenant and earned his \\"wings\\" in 1946. Wilkerson completed his training after the end of the war, so he did not have the chance to fly in combat. Wilkerson faced significant racial discrimination while serving in the Air Force because of the segregation of the military at the time. ‚ÄúThe military had no intention of using black pilots. The real mission, the underlying mission, was for us to fail and prove their point,‚Äù Wilkerson said in an interview with the Southtown Star. Wilkerson faced segregation when he was required to sit in a different train car than white soldiers on his way to the Tuskegee base. When he arrived there, he found that blacks were forced to eat separately during meals and to sit apart from white soldiers while watching films. Along with the other Tuskegee Airmen, Wilkerson proved that blacks could perform military duties as capably as whites could. The Tuskegee Airmen had a direct impact on the integration of the armed services.  Civilian career  Following his military service, Wilkerson attended New York University to study photography. He also attended the Midwest Broadcasting School and graduated in 1960. He worked as a DJ for WBEE-AM in Harvey, Illinois and was known as \\"Weekend Wilkie.\\" He also hosted his own radio show, Wilk's World. He served as community relations director and later as program director for WBEE-AM. Later, he worked for the radio station WMAQ (AM) until his retirement.

Like the Criquet the GL.01 is a two-seat tractor configuration aircraft with side-by-side seating. The forward wing of the GL.01 is a one piece structure, mounted so that its angle of incidence can be varied from 2¬∞ to 14¬∞ by the pilot. The wing is held above the fuselage on two tall and slightly diverging faired struts, with pivots at their tops. Two further pivots are placed at the ends of lighter struts further out on the wing. Two vertical links from the cockpit to the rear of the wing are connected to the control column. The fixed rear wing is fabric covered and fitted with two metal flaps. Yaw stability and control are provided by a small fin and large, deep, balanced rudder, both entirely wooden and angular. Unusually, the rudder balance surface is below the fuselage. The GL.01 has a wooden fuselage with seats enclosed under a perspex canopy. It is powered by a Continental C90-8F flat four engine, driving a two blade propeller. It has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with spatted main wheels on arched, glass fibre, cantilever legs and a tailwheel semi-recessed into the bottom of the rudder. The GL.01 made its first flight in August 1976. It remains on the French civil aircraft register in 2014, having been based at Marennes since 2003.

It was designed by Romeo Lahey and built from 1920 to 1946. It is also known as Wonga Wallen. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Romeo Lahey Vida Lahey's house was originally built for Romeo Lahey above Canungra, on a spur of the Darlington Range and was completed in 1920. Later the house was moved from the outskirts to the Canungra township on the hill above the present Catholic Church and occupied by David and his wife, Jane Jemima Lahey n√©e Walmsley, and then moved again by Vida and Jayne Lahey in 1946 to its present block in Sir Fred Schonell Drive, St Lucia. Francis and Alicia Lahey, Vida and Romeo's grandparents, arrived in Australia with eleven children in 1862 from Ireland. They settled on land by Rocky Waterholes Creek, Salisbury, where they commenced farming but found the land unsuitable. In 1870 Francis, with his older sons and some employees, moved to Pimpama, where the rest of the family moved in 1872 after the sale of the first property. In the early 1880s, the sons of Francis Lahey began investigating the establishment of a timber mill on the Canungra Creek. In 1884, David, the youngest son of Francis and Alicia, father of Vida born in 1882 and later Romeo born in 1887, established a saw and planing mill (Lahey's Canungra Sawmill) in the sparsely populated Canungra area. The mill flourished for many years and provided employment for the local area which grew rapidly as a result. The Lahey family were responsible for the construction of many significant roads and railways in the Canungra area, sometimes contributing substantial proportions of the construction cost. Following the extension of the railway from Logan Village to Canungra in 1914, the Laheys' mill at Canungra grew into what was thought to be the largest and best-equipped softwood mill in the southern hemisphere. The Lahey family business continued until 1920 when the mill was bought by the War Service Home Commission who acquired timber mills all over the country to meet the vast housing needs of returned soldiers. The mill was operated only for a few years by the WSHC after which time another firm purchased it. David Lahey remained the manager for many years after the mill was sold. David Lahey and his wife, Jane, had twelve children, Vida being the first born and Romeo the fourth child. Jane and her children moved to Yeronga, Brisbane in 1899 when David sold the Pimpama property. This move allowed opportunities for further education for both the sons and daughters of the family, whilst David remained in Canungra travelling to Brisbane each weekend. The family is listed at addresses including Yeronglea, between Yeronga and Feez Streets and the Brisbane River at Yeronga, Sidney House, in River Road, Toowong and Greylands, Harts Road at Indooroopilly and then the house David Lahey built alongside Laheys' mill at Corinda, also called Wonga Wallen. Vida Lahey's house was constructed during a period when the Laheys' owned the mill and frequently built houses for employees in Canungra. The house which was originally positioned on the Darlington Spur was designed by Romeo Lahey, who had completed a town planning course at the University of London in 1919, following his service in the Great War. The house, which was to be known as the Wonga Wallen, was constructed using the family timber in 1920. His extensive experience with timber milling and natural resources interested Romeo Lahey in the conservation of forests and the need for national parks; following his father's example he initiated reafforestation in the Canungra district and successfully lobbied for suitable areas to be declared national parks. In 1930 Romeo became the founding president of the National Parks Association of Queensland and was instrumental in the declaration of the Lamington National Park. He bought and named Lone Pine on the Brisbane River, planning to live there after returning from the First World War. Subsequently, the property was sold to Mr Claude Alexander Miller Reid who developed it as a nature reserve. In 1946 Romeo was one of the founders for the Save the Tree campaign. Romeo and his wife Alice Sybil Lahey (n√©e Delpratt) remained living at Wonga Wallen for a short time after their marriage in 1920, after which David and Jemima Lahey moved the house into Canungra near the Catholic church for their own use. When David Lahey died in 1942, two years after the death of his wife, he left the house to his two unmarried daughters, Vida and Jayne. The sisters having bought a block of land in what is now Sir Fred Schonell Drive moved the house from Canungra to this site in 1946. Prior to its removal, another sister, Gladys, lived at the house after having nursed her father. The house was built in the Canungra township with a paved loggia extending along the front of the house, and a separate wing containing the laundry and bathroom facilities which extended along the rear of the house. On its removal to Brisbane, these two elements remained in Canungra and were standing in February 1995, on either side of a more recent house. When moved Wonga Wallen was turned on its side, making the original double front door a side entrance off a new balcony. Vida Lahey, ca. 1924 Vida Lahey, born in 1882, was a prominent Queensland artist who exhibited widely from 1902 until 1965, three years before her death. She was one of the first female artists in Queensland, and indeed, Australia, who regarded themselves as professionals and who sought to earn a living from practising their art. Vida pioneered art classes for both children and adults in Queensland; and she and Daphne Mayo were responsible for the foundation of the Queensland Art Fund in 1929, which helped to establish an art library and acquire works of art for the state. Vida was awarded the Society of Artists (NSW) Medal in 1945, in appreciation of good services for the advancement of Australian art, the Coronation Medal in 1953 and in 1958 honoured with an MBE for services to art. Vida is known to have painted at least two paintings of the house, Wonga Wallen, Canungra in the late 1930s and Wonga Wallen Loggia at Canungra in the 1940s both in the collection of Ms Shirley Lahey. Another painting, Bedroom at St Lucia with Dobell portrait, c.1961, was painted by Vida in her St Lucia bedroom. Vida remained at the house until her death in 1968 when the property was transferred to the sole ownership of her sister Jayne who remained there until a few years before her death in 1982 during which time another sister, Mavis Denholm n√©e Lahey lived in the house. The house was bought from the estate by Ms Iris Conroy in 1984 who subdivided the block and moved the house to one side causing it to be renumbered from 97 to 99 Sir Fred Schonell Drive. This most recent relocation saw the removal of a porch on the eastern side of the building and the house being raised. The ground floor has been filled in to form a garage.  Description  Vida Lahey's house is a two-storeyed timber building with a shallow gable roof of corrugated iron. The gable ends are clad with shingles and the external walls are clad with weatherboard. The building has a rectangular plan, with the short northern elevation forming the dominant facade, on which the centrally located entrance is defined by a small portico supported by curved side brackets and adorned with simple classical details. The outstanding quality of the clear finished timber joinery and fittings on the interior of Vida Lahey's house is particularly noteworthy. The internal walls are lined with vertically-jointed boards of first-grade timber. Timber boards lining the ceiling are raked to meet the underside of the ceiling joists on the east and west walls of the house. An outstanding feature of the interior is the joists of hoop pine running the full width of the house. Each joist was made from one piece of timber completely free from knots over its long expanse, a rarity today. Joinery, including a dado rail, architraves, windows and doors, is clear-finished timber darker than the lining timber. The bedrooms and bathroom are accessed from a central entrance hall and living room. The kitchen is within the living room, divided by fitted cupboards and shelving of the same high quality timber joinery combining pine and cedar. Other timber fittings designed for the interior include several concealed storage cupboards, a wardrobe and other smaller cupboards. The floor is white beech and the walls hoop pine.  Heritage listing  Vida and Jayne Lahey's House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The house is significant for its internal timber work, reflecting the involvement of the Lahey family in the timber industry in south east Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Both in workmanship and material, the clear finished timber is outstanding in its quality. It is significant that this timberwork has remained unpainted and in good repair since construction in 1920. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Vida Lahey's house is significant for its associations with members of the Lahey family who, for varied reasons were important in the history of Queensland. Romeo W. Lahey MBE, who designed the house and originally lived in it, was an early advocate of the Queensland National Parks movement. Romeo's sister Vida, who lived in the house for over twenty years, was an early female artist in Queensland and a key figure in the development of the Queensland Art Gallery and is considered to be one of the most interesting and influential figures in Queensland artistic development. Romeo and Vida's father, David Lahey, together with his brothers, pioneered the timber industry in Canungra encouraging unprecedented growth in the region.

The book contains a compilation of various stories, adapted by Pyle, regarding the legendary King Arthur of Britain and select Knights of the Round Table. Pyle's novel begins with King Arthur in his youth and continues through numerous tales of bravery, romance, battle, and knighthood. Pyle's writing was influenced by previous authors Arthurian writings, such as King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table and Le Morte d'Arthur. The Story of King Arthur and His Knights is an American adaption of traditionally English stories that was written and illustrated for children.  Plot  =The Book of King Arthur= The first two sections in Pyle‚Äôs The Story of King Arthur and His Knights, ‚ÄúThe Book of King Arthur,‚Äù contains three separate stories: ‚ÄúThe Winning of Kinghood,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Winning of a Sword,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Winning of a Queen.‚Äù The Winning of Kinghood Howard Pyle's version of the tales of King Arthur introduces the reader to Arthur as a child. Arthur, having been raised by foster parents, has no knowledge of his noble lineage. One day, young Arthur finds a sword and succeeds in pulling it out of an enchanted anvil, a task thought be impossible. Arthur, now bearing the magic sword, learns of his royal lineage and becomes King of Britain. The Winning of a Sword King Arthur loses to his enemy King Pellinore and suffers many wounds. Merlin, a wizard, advises Arthur to seek Excalibur, a powerful sword. With the instructions provided by the Lady of the Lake, Arthur takes Excalibur. He then meets Pellinore again and defeats the king with Excalibur's magic. The two, thereafter, make amends and become friends. The Winning of a Queen King Arthur is captivated by Lady Guinevere, the daughter of Arthur's friend King Leodegrance. In an attempt to win her love, Arthur visits Cameliard, the castle where Lady Guinevere lives. With Merlin's help, Arthur disguises himself as a peasant and works as a gardener below Lady Guinevere's tower. King Ryence threatens Leodegrance and demands that the Duke of North Umber be allowed to marry Guinevere. The Duke torments the people of Cameliard by parading in front of the castle, calling for someone to challenge him. Arthur accepts the challenge and defeats the Duke. After his victory, Arthur travels through the country and encounters Sir Geraint, Sir Gawaine, Sir Ewaine, and Sir Pellias. Arthur defeats the knights in battle and demands their servitude. Arthur, disguised as a peasant, returns to Cameliard, and is challenged again by the Duke. Arthur commands his new knights to obey to him and asks to be Guinevere's champion. Arthur and his knights defeat the Duke and his companions. After the battle, Arthur reveals himself to King Leodegrance and asks for the hand of his daughter. =The Book of Three Worthies= The second section of Pyle's novel is separated into three stories: \\"The Story of Merlin,\\" \\"The Story of Sir Pellias,\\" and \\"The Story of Sir Gawain.\\" The Story of Merlin Pyle \\"Excalibur and the Sword\\" illustration from the 1903 edition of The Story of King Arthur and His Knights, 1903 Merlin is bewitched by an aspiring young sorceress named Vivien, a friend of Queen Morgana le Fay, who is the sister of King Arthur. Morgana seeks revenge against Arthur because he did not choose her son Sir Baudemagus to be a member of the Round Table. Merlin teaches Vivien sorcery, but she uses Merlin's teachings to concoct a potion, which incapacitates Merlin. Merlin, shortly before his death, prophesizes that Arthur will encounter trouble, and the wizard's dying wish is for Vivien to save Arthur. Vivien proceeds to have Merlin buried alive but promises to aid King Arthur. As Vivien works against Merlin, King Arthur and Sir Accalon are lost while hunting. Searching for their way out, the two see a ship coming to shore. The ship is run by fairies, who offer Arthur and Accalon a feast and rooms for the night. Arthur wakes a prisoner in the dungeon of Sir Domas le Noir, and the only way to escape is to battle against Sir Ontzlake, Sir Domas's brother. Accalon awakes in a strange place with a fair maiden. She asks him to fight for Sir Ontzlake against Sir Domas and offers Excalibur as a reward if he accepts. Arthur and Accalon, not recognizing each other, fight a bloody and harsh battle. Near death, Vivien leads the men to a nunnery. Vivien is able to restore Arthur's health though he must rest for a while. When Arthur asks Vivien to treat Accalon, she lies, claiming she has no more of her concoction. Accalon dies from his wounds. Morgana steals the sheath of Excalibur while Arthur rests, and she drops the sheath back into the lake where it was found. Once Arthur wakes, he is outraged; he, Vivien, and his men search for Morgana. Morgana transforms herself into a rock, but Vivien recognizes her and begs Arthur to kill her. Arthur, however, forgives his sister, upsetting Vivien. The Story of Sir Pellias While the Queen, her court, and Sir Pellias are out maying, a damsel named Parcenet approaches them. The maiden explains that she comes to see if the Queen is more beautiful than her Lady Ettard, who is reputed in her area to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Sir Pellias agrees to go to Grantmesnle, the home of Lady Ettard, to settle the matter with her knight Sir Engamore of Malverat. As Parcenet and Sir Pellias journey to Grantmesnle, they venture into the legendary Forest of Adventure. There, the two find an old woman who asks for help crossing the stream. Sir Pellias helps the old woman onto his horse and passes through stream. The knight helps the old woman down from the horse, and she transforms into the Lady of the Lake. The Lady gives Pellias a beautiful magic necklace, which makes the wearer adored by all who see him. Under the spell of the necklace, Sir Pellias becomes deeply infatuated with Lady Ettard. However, Lady Ettard feels no love for Sir Pellias once he removes off the necklace. Sir Pellias humiliates himself with his unrequited affection. The Lady of the Lake tells Sir Gawain to go to Grantmesnle and bring sense to Sir Pellias. Sir Pellias accepts his help, and they devise a plan, but Sir Gawaine is charmed by Lady Ettard. Sir Pellias and Sir Gawaine fight, wherein Pellias, although victorious, is wounded by Gawaine. Pellias, near death, is brought to the chapel of a healing hermit. The Lady of the Lake comes, takes the charmed necklace, and revives Pellias with a potion. Although Pellias is revived, he is no longer fully mortal; the knight is half-mortal and half-fairy. The Lady of the Lake and Sir Pellias travel to their fairy city hidden on the lake where they are married. The Story of Sir Gawaine Pyle-Sir Gawain, illustration from the 1903 edition of The Story of King Arthur and His Knights, 1903 During a procession of King Arthur and his Court, the men see a dog pursuing a deer. Immediately after, the men see a knight and a lady attacked by another knight, who takes the woman captive. Upon King Arthur‚Äôs request, Sir Gawaine and his brother go to discover the meaning of these events. Gawaine and his brother arrive at a castle where they see the dog killed. In a rage, Gawaine pursues the deer into the castle courtyard and kills it, believing that the dog died because it pursued the deer. The lady of the castle is distressed over the deer's death, so Sir Ablamor, the lord of the castle, challenges Gawaine to a fight. Gawaine bests Ablamor but does not kill him. Because Gawaine shows him mercy, Ablamor invites Gawain to dine in his castle and explains the series of strange events. Sometime earlier, Ablamor‚Äôs sister-in-law went riding with Ablamor‚Äôs wife when the two women came across another woman: the sorceress Vivien. Vivien gave the two a dog and deer. The two animals created conflcit between Sir Ablamor and his brother. During the Court‚Äôs procession, Lord Ablamor saw the dog chasing his wife‚Äôs deer and became greatly angered. When Ablamor saw his brother and sister-in-law, Ablamor concluded that the pursuit of the deer was on purpose, struck his brother, and took his sister-in-law captive. Gawaine returns to King Arthur‚Äôs court and relates these events to him. Shortly after, King Arthur leaves, seeking adventure. Arthur and his esquire are lost in a forest and seek shelter in a castle. Arthur and his esquire meet an older knight who challenges King Arthur to see who could survive getting their head cut off. Arthur strikes first, and the older knight lives. The old knight says he will spare King Arthur‚Äôs life if, after a year and a day, Arthur returns and answers a riddle. A year and a day passes wherein King Arthur seeks in vain to an answer to the riddle, but he sets out to fulfill his promise. On the way, he meets an old woman who promises to tell him the answer to the riddle on the condition that she may marry a knight of his court. King Arthur agrees to the woman‚Äôs condition and defeats the old knight. To keep his promise, King Arthur brings the woman to his court and allows her to choose a knight to marry. She chose Sir Gawaine, which is upsets the knight. After they marry, the woman tests Gawaine. When he proves to be a worthy knight, she reveals herself as the Lady of the Lake.  Characters  King Arthur is the central character in Pyle's novel, but several other characters are focused on in the novel as well as the literary criticism on Pyle's work. Queen Guinevere, Vivien, and Morgana le Fay are the main female characters within the stories, and the Lady of the Lake is also a character central to the plot. King Arthur's knights Sir Gawain and Sir Pelias are the two most involved in the overall series of events, with Merlin being another central male character.  Literary Criticism  Julie Nelson Couch, in his article \\"Howard Pyle's The Story of King Arthur and His Knights and the Bourgeois Boy Reader\\" writes of how Pyle's novel and the author's use of social status and gender to perpetuate certain aspects of medieval literature as well as bourgeois society. Couch touches on Pyle's use of positive character traits, such as bravery and morality, and their links to characters of high social standing. Couch also writes of Pyle's use of language and how certain terms in Pyle's writing are used to engage middle class male readers. Reception Rather than retell the stories authored by Sidney Lanier and Sir Thomas Malory, Pyle creates new versions of the Arthurian tales, including different adventures and implementing his own imagination to embellish the tales.Lupack, p.82 Pyle's writing of the Arthurian stories \\"[used] text and illustrations to complement one another...in the presentation of natural description.\\"Lupack, p.83 Helmut Nickel, in his essay \\"Arms and Armor in Arthurian Films,\\" called Pyle's illustrations \\"glorious,\\" and worthy of use for inspiration for any Arthurian film.Nickel, p.236  Other Works  Pyle wrote several other concerning King Arthur and his knights, including: * The Story of the Champions of the Round Table * The Story of Sir Launcelot and His Companions * The Story of the Grail and the Passing of King Arthur References Sources Couch, Julie N.

The by- election arose following the death of the previous Liberal MP, John Lloyd Vaughan Watkins. Candidates Brecon had one of the smallest electorates in Wales and the political life of the borough had long been dominated by the Camden and Tredegar families. The Camden interest, which generally followed a Whig form of Liberalism had generally supported Watkins since 1832 but on two occasions he had been defeated when the Conservative influence of the Tredegar interest was brought to bear. Within days of the former member's death, the Earl of Brecknock, son and heir of the Marquees of Camden had issues an address. Although described as a Liberal-Conservative, it was apparent that Breaknock would take a Liberal view on party questions and the Tredegar interest sought a candidate. they soon settled upon Howel Gwyn of Dyffryn, Neath, a former MP for Penryn and Falmouth. The initial expectation, as described by one newspaper, was for a closely fought contest, for the two political factions in the town were thought to be fairly evenly matched. At the same time, in the shadow of the debate on parliamentary reform, there was a feeling that the Conservatives might prevail. Brecon, it was argued, 'like most small agricultural towns had a sympathy towards 'those who are averse to great organic changes in the constitution'. Brecknock's initial address was in many ways indistinguishable to that of Gwyn, and was lukewarm on the key issues of parliamentary reform and the rights of nonconformists. Within the week, Gwyn had officially declared his candidature and it was felt that this would compel Brecknock to ally himself more firmly with the official policies of the Liberal Party. When his father, the 2nd Marquis of Camden, was made Lord Lieutenant of the Brecknockshire in succession to the late Col. Watkins, Brecknock unequivocally declared his support for the Palmerston administration. Candidature of Thomas Price The radical wing of the Liberal Party watched these developments with concern. Thomas Savin, the railway contractor, was named at an early stage as a possible contender but would not split the Liberal camp. Breakneck, at one stage, was said to have implied that he would support the abolition of church rates, but no firm commitment was subsequently made. As a result, Thomas Price of Aberdare, a prominent Welsh nonconformist minister and a native of Brecon, offered himself as a Liberal candidate. This was first mooted in December, for example at a meeting of the Gwron Lodge of the Alfredian Order meeting at Aberdare. On 18 December, Price visited Brecon and issued an address the following day. Price had connections with Brecon since his younger days and he stated in his address: On 8 January, Brecknock issued a revised address, which was subsequently regarded as a response to Price's intervention. He alluded to the death of Palmerston and the formation of a new administration under Lord John Russell pledged to extending the franchise. Breakneck now declared himself in favour of reform as well as the abolition of church rates. On 24 January 1866, Price addressed a packed meeting held at the Town Hall, with hundreds reportedly failing to gain admittance. The speech he gave on this occasion was regarded as 'a very remarkable performance'. Outcome Price eventually withdrew, in view of Brecknock's second address, stating that he had achieved his objective of assisting 'the advanced Liberals in saving the borough from being quietly handed over unto stale Whigism on the one hand, or worn out Toryism on the other'. The failure of the Brecon Liberals to sustain the momentum, at a subsequent by-election some months later when Brecknock was elevated to the Lords upon the death of his father, convinced Price of the necessity of concentrating on the extension of the franchise and the abolition of small boroughs such as Brecon which were so heavily influenced by deference to a landed elite. Two years later, at the General Election of 1868, he played a central role in the contest in the Merthyr Tydfil constituency.

The concerto is scored for a small orchestra ‚Äì only strings, a flute and two clarinets. It is in five continuous movements: a prologue, two recitatives, an aria and an epilogue. Panufnik wrote of the movements: \\"I chose these operatic-sounding titles partly in order to emphasise the underlying drama of the work, and partly because they indicate the parlando character of the recitatives, as well as the singing quality required of the bassoon in the Aria.\\" The aria, marked \\"adagio lamentoso\\", is longer than the other movements combined.

Biography  Fiil was born in Hvidsten on 12 June 1920 to house proprietor and bicycle dealer Marius Fiil and wife Gudrun Fiil. In 1930 he lived in Hvidsten Inn with his 72-year-old grandfather as inn keeper, his parents and four sisters and a farm hand, a maid and a manager. He was confirmed in Spentrup church in 1934 on the first Sunday after Easter, while living in Hvidsten with his family. He received his confirmation with a waiver, since he had not yet turned 14. During the occupation the family and other locals formed a resistance group, the Hvidsten group. In addition to being a member of the Hvidsten group, Fiil was also a farmer while helping out at the inn. The group helped the British Special Operations Executive parachute weapons and supplies into Denmark for distribution to the resistance. In March 1944 the Gestapo made an \\"incredible number of arrests\\" including in the region of Randers Fiil, his father the \\"nationally known folklore collector and keeper of Hvidsten inn Marius Fiil\\", his 17-year-old sister Gerda, his sister Kirstine and her husband brewery worker Peter S√∏rensen. The following month De frie Danske reported that several arrestees from Hvidsten had been transferred from Randers to Vestre F√¶ngsel. On 29 June 1944 Fiil, his father Marius, his brother in law and five other members of the Hvidsten group were executed in Ryvangen.  After his death  On 15 July 1944 De frie Danske reported on the execution of Fiil, his father and brother son in law, the life sentence of his older sister and the two-year sentence of his younger sister and lamented the profound loss of Fiil's mother. Six months later the January 1945 issue of the resistance newspaper Frit Danmark (Free Denmark) reported that on 29 June the previous year Fiil and seven other named members of the Hvidsten group had been executed. On 2 July 1945 the remains and Fiil and his father were found in Ryvangen and transferred to the Department of Forensic Medicine of the university of Copenhagen. The remains of the six other executed members of the group were found in the same area three days later. The following day an inquest in the Department of Forensic Medicine of the university of Copenhagen showed that Fiil was executed with gunshot wounds to the chest. On 10 July he was together with the seven other executed group members cremated at Bispebjerg Cemetery. In 1945 a memorial stone over the eight executed members of the Hvidsten group was raised near Hvidsten kro.Memorial stone for the Hvidsten group in Hvidsten Similarly a larger memorial stone for resistance members including the eight executed members of the Hvidsten group has been laid down in Ryvangen Memorial Park.Memorial stone in Ryvangen for resistance members including the Hvidsten group Portrayal in the media * In the 2012 Danish drama film Hvidsten Gruppen (This Life) Niels Fiil is portrayed by Thomas Ernst.

Background ABQ Uptown opened in 2006 as an open air lifestyle center, and was developed by Dekker/Perich/Sabatini, a local architecture firm that specializes in southwest and green design. A Storefront and a statue =History= The brownfield site was a vacant 20 acre lot between Coronado and Winrock Malls, originally the site of St. Pius X High School. The school was razed in the late 1980s to make room for an ambitious mixed-use development called The Commons, which would have included two 22-story office towers and a 14-story hotel. However, this project fell apart and the land remained vacant. The lot was purchased and designed as a mixed-use development zone by Hunt Building Corporation, including a lifestyle center, housing, offices, and a grocery store. In November 2006, ABQ Uptown was opened, and brought more retail chains to the area, including several stores that previously did not serve Albuquerque or New Mexico, such as the state's only Apple Store. Below the infill site, a three level, 300 space parking garage was built to facilitate extra parking. =Today= ABQ Uptown opened in two phases. Phase one opened in November 2006, and included the shopping centers, parking garage, and the realignment of roads and utilities in the area. Phase two was the development and construction of multi-family housing, and opened in 2008. Simon Property Group, who used to own Cottonwood Mall (the fourth mall in the metropolitan area, and the only one not in the uptown area), purchased ABQ Uptown from Hunt Building Corporation in 2012.

He was a leading figure in the development of satellite technologies during the space-race era. He served as vice president, then President of Fairchild Industries Space and Electronics division, Vice President of Fairchild Industries (the parent corporation), and President of American Satellite Corporation, a Fairchild subsidiary. The technologies and projects he managed for Fairchild and NASA in the 1960s and 1970s were crucial to the advancement of satellite technology worldwide and pioneered satellite television broadcasting and orbital scientific experimentation. He was a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In 1974 he was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal for his success managing the ATS-6 satellite program.  Early life  Harry was born in Brooklyn on November 10, 1922 to a family of Jewish European immigrants. His father Morris had arrived on Ellis Island in 1890 from Rohatyn, in what was then Austria-Hungary. Like his father, Morris worked as a seasonal sweatshop operator, sewing pockets on vests in Lower Manhattan during the era of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Harry enrolled at City College as a student of engineering, and graduated in 1944 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. During his time at City College he worked as a paper boy, delivering The New York Times to buildings at the college. After graduating he enrolled in the United States Navy and was sent to the Moffett Field Naval Air Station to do research for NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. He published two technical research papers (listed here). While working his first civilian job after World War II, Dornbrand earned a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University in 1953. He married Mildred F. Bernstein, a graduate of Brooklyn College with a degree in Biology, and they had three children, Phyllis, Faith, and Carol Lynn.  Career  Photo taken of Harry Dornbrand during his time at Fairchild Space and Electronics. During his time in the United States Navy, Dornbrand specialized in heat transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid flow research with NACA, at the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. In 1946 he began work at Republic Aviation in Long Island, New York, where he was manager of space systems technology. During his 20 years there he held management positions on the FIRE system, Advanced Orbiting Solar Observatory, Synchronous Meteorological Satellite and Manned Orbital Laboratory programs. Republic was purchased by Fairchild Hiller in 1965 and Dornbrand moved to Fairchild's Germantown, Maryland facility. = Fairchild and American Satellite Corporation = In 1966, Dornbrand joined Fairchild Industries Space and Electronics and worked as a Project Manager until 1973, when then-President Wilbur Pritchard elevated him to the rank of Vice President. During his time at Fairchild he facilitated the design and launch of multiple aerospace projects, the most notable of which were satellites in the Applications Technology Satellite series commissioned by NASA. Following the success of the ATS-6, Dornbrand became President of Fairchild Space and Electronics in 1975. In 1976 he was appointed President of American Satellite Corporation, a subsidiary company of Fairchild. Harry Dornbrand receiving an unofficial award from colleagues at Fairchild Space and Electronics division after the team met the deadline for delivering the proposal for the ATS-6 satellite to NASA, in 1969. While Dornbrand was a Program Manager and Assistant General Manager of Fairchild Space and Electronics Division, NASA contracted Fairchild to oversee the creation of the ATS-6 and ATS-7 (also known as ATS-F and ATS-G) satellites, and he was appointed to be manager of both projects. The ATS-6 satellite was the most powerful telecommunications satellite of its time, the first Direct Broadcast Satellite, the first educational satellite, and the first 3-axis stabilized spacecraft in geostationary orbit, among other accolades. It received high praise from NASA, and in 1975, Dornbrand along with other chief Fairchild representatives including Wernher von Braun demonstrated its ability to aim broadcast signals at any part of the United States, a technological breakthrough at the time. NASA originally commissioned a seventh satellite in the ATS series, but despite the construction of an ATS-G prototype, the project was never completed. In a 1976 article of the Fairchild World journal, Dornbrand said that due to the success of ATS-6 and \\"because the ATS-6 satellite gives promise of lasting for many more years than originally expected, NASA cancelled the second spacecraft\\". ATS-G (the second satellite) sat for some years in a Fairchild lot, and was later donated to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

This village was the primary civic seat in the town, which is also the county seat of Oxford County, and was where county facilities were located until they were moved to South Paris in 1895. The district includes a collection of well-preserved residential, civic, and religious structures dating roughly from 1800 to 1860, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description The village of Paris Hill occupies the top of Paris Hill, which at above sea level provides commanding views of the White Mountains to the west. The main road through the district is Paris Hill Road, and its central point is the former county common, which is roughy circumscribed by Hannibal Hamlin Drive. The village extends for a short way along Lincoln and Tremont Streets; the total area of the district is about . Most of the houses built in the district were built between 1800 and 1860, with almost none coming after the relocation of the county facilities in 1895. The oldest house, the Lemuel Jackson, Jr. House, was built in 1789. Most of the buildings are either Federal or Greek Revival in their styling, although there are a fair number of Italianate houses, as well as one mansard-roofed Second Empire house. Only one commercial building has survived on the hill: it was built c. 1808 by Simeon Cummings, and converted to a residence by his sone. The buildings formerly associated with county functions have been well preserved. Arrayed around the common on Hannibal Hamlin Drive, these include a courthouse, brick office building, and stone jail, the latter now repurposed to house a library. Also on the common is the Baptist Church, a Greek Revival structure built in 1838. History Paris Hill was originally known as \\"Jackson Hill\\", after the owner of the land at its top. The Paris area was settled beginning about 1780, and the town was incorporated in 1793. Oxford County was established in 1805, and Paris was chosen as its county seat. As Paris Hill was then the civic center of the town, the county infrastructure was built there, as were the Baptist Church and the Paris Hill Academy (the latter in 1856). Because the village was not near any source of waterpower, needed for industrial activity, economic influence began to shift toward South Paris in the first half of the 19th century, and became more significant on the second half with the arrival of the railroad at South Paris in 1847. Although a number of smaller business flourished in Paris Hill, most of them eventually relocated to South Paris, and the county facilities were relocated there in 1895. The village is now maintained by the efforts of both year-round and summer residents. A number of politicians notable in Maine history are known to have lived in Paris Hill. The most famous is Hannibal Hamlin (1809-1891), who served as United States Vice President during Abraham Lincoln's first term; he was born in Paris Hill. Hamlin, along with Paris Hill residents Enoch Lincoln, Sidney Perham, and Albion Keith Parris, also served as Governor of Maine.

It is solely used for air ambulance services to Haukeland University Hospital. The heliport is owned and operated by Bergen Hospital Trust. It is the base for a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ operated by Norsk Luftambulanse (NLA) for the Norwegian Air Ambulance. Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren is also used by the Royal Norwegian Air Force's 330 Squadron's Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters. The landing pad measures . Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren is located from the hospital and patients must therefore be transported by ambulance to Haukeland. In cases where time is imperative, the helicopters can land at a helipad situated on-site at the hospital. When the air ambulance service commenced in Bergen in 1987, Bergen Heliport, Nyg√•rdstangen was built. With the lot being sold, the heliport relocated to Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren in 2002. Since 2012 it has been supplemented with the helipad at the hospital. There are plans to move the heliport to a new location at Nyg√•rdstangen. History Bergen received a helicopter air ambulance service in 1987. It was initially a private initiative operated by NLA, with some grants from the National Insurance Service. This service was initially based at the \\"Circus lot\\" at Nyg√•rdstangen. The service was taken over by Airlift in 1994. They started the process of considering Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren as a more suitable location. The original heliport lot was deemed a temporary solution. In 2002 the owner of the lot, Bergen Municipality, signed an option to allow Bergensia Badeland to build a swimming pool at the site. There was a three-month resignation clause in the rental agreement, and Bergen Heath Trust, which had taken over the ownership of the hospital that year, therefore decided that it would need to move the heliport to Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren. Also the new lot was municipal. The moving was complicated by the municipality using time on the planning permissions. The heliport moved from Nyg√•rdstangen to Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren in 2002, although this was also stated to be a temporary solution. The same year the ownership of the hospitals in Hordaland, including the base, was transferred to Bergen Hospital Trust. In July the responsibility for the medical staff on the helicopter was moved from NLA to Haukeland. Locating the heliport at Bergen Airport, Flesland was considered, but disregarded due to its remote location form the hospital. In August the municipality gave the go-ahead for the establishment at Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren. Haukeland was the only major hospital without a suitable heliport on-site. They had a temporary structure, although it did not allow good landing conditions and was considered hazardous for flight safety. Only in cases where saving a few minutes was imperative did helicopters call directly at the hospital. The facility lack authorization from the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway, and could only be used on a case-for-case basis when the physician declared necessity. When the central block was built during the 1980s, there were originally plans to place a helipad on the roof. However, there was uncertainty if there was sufficient support in the structure and the plans were therefore aborted. The Civil Aviation Authority approved the design and construction in 2004, but not until 2008 did Bergen Hospital Trust approve the plans. The official opening of the new pad took place on 12 April 2012. Originally the new helipad received a concession for 400 aircraft movements per year. Bergen Hospital Trust has applied to increase this to 1,600, after there had been more than 800 movements the first year. Facilities The heliport is situated at Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren on the southern shore of Store Lungeg√•rdsvannet in the √Örstad borough of Bergen. It is situated at an elevation of above mean sea level. The heliport is situated at M√∏llendalsveien 34. It features a single landing pad, which measures , a hangar, a fuel tank and offices. The aerodrome is owned by Bergen Health Trust on municipal land. The operation of the heliport is carried out by Norsk Luftambulanse. They have won the tender to operate the ambulances with the Norwegian Air Ambulance. They have a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ based at Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren. Bergen Health Trust has the medical responsibility and medical staff are provided by Haukeland University Hospital. The base is on around- the-clock standby. It is situated from the hospital, a distance which must be transported by ambulance. Bergen Heliport, Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren is exclusively used for air ambulance services. In addition to the helicopter based at the heliport, it serves other ambulance helicopters and search and rescue helicopters of the Royal Norwegian Air Force's 330 Squadron. About sixty percent of all air ambulance missions to Haukeland land at Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren, the remainder directly targeting the hospital. The ambulance ride increases travel time by ten to fifteen minutes and the physician on board will make the decision based on the condition of the patient. Because Haukeland is situated in a residential area, the noise pollution for landings is significant. The Civil Aviation Authority has in its concession limited the number of aircraft movements at the hospital to 400 per year, which forces Haukeland to revert the majority of flights to Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren. However, helicopters which arrive from Rogaland and Sogn og Fjordane normally need to refuel before returning and therefore have to also land at Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren before returning. Local helicopters need to return to base at Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren. There is some noise pollution at Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren, although it is significantly smaller than at the hospital.

One member of the UDR was killed instantly when the leading Land Rover was hit, while another died of wounds two days later. Two other soldiers were maimed for life. IRA improvised horizontal mortars According to author Tony Geraghty, British authorities learnt of the first horizontal mortar produced by the Provisional IRA, the Mark 12, in 1985. The weapon was recovered after an incident in which three IRA volunteers were killed by security forces. The launcher suffered from the limitation of a heavy recoil, which made the handling of the device difficult. One British intelligence report say that while the launcher was quite crude, the grenade was made of \\"a number of components which require a high standard of machine manufacturing.\\" The projectile had a warhead of 40 ounces (1.1 kg) of semtex and TNT. It was used basically as a standoff weapon, in which the grenade was lofted over the security bases' fences or against armoured vehicles.Geraghty 1998, p. 195 The mortar had an effective range of 70 yards, within which it could pierce an armour plate or destroy a sangar.Potter (2008), p. 350 Later in the conflict the IRA developed the Mark 16, a new version with improved armour-piercing capabilities, usually referred to as a \\"projected recoilless improvised grenade\\".Geraghty 1998, p. 196 The ambush On the evening of 1 March 1991, a two-vehicle mobile patrol belonging to the 2nd Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment was approaching the western outskirts of Armagh city on Killylea road. When driving along Mullacreevie housing estate,McKittrick (2000), p. 1227 the two Land Rovers were held by temporary traffic lights at roadworks. Unknown to them, the IRA had set a Mark 12 launcher on a hump of earth in the front garden of a house besides the lights. After the incident, IRA sources described the device as a \\"directional missile\\".Fortnight. Issues 291‚Äì301, p. 22 When the first Land Rover pulled off after the lights turned green, the mortar 's improvised grenade was fired by command-wire from the backyard of the house by IRA members concealed behind a digger. The projectile hit the coachwork, blowing away both sides and the roof of the military vehicle. Witnesses reported that the Land Rover was \\"ripped apart\\". The soldiers inside were immediately assisted by fellow UDR members, who helped to drag the wounded out of the shattered wreckage. Private Paul Sutcliffe, a 32-year-old Englishman who had served for four years with the Duke of Wellington's Regiment before becoming a UDR soldier in 1989, died on the spot. The driver, Private Roger Love, a 20-year-old from Portadown, succumbed to his injuries three days later. Two other servicemen were maimed by the explosion. One of them suffered severe chest wounds, and lost the use of one arm; the other had a leg amputated below the knee. The ambush at Mullacreevie was the first time that a Mark 12 mortar was used successfully. Aftermath Roger Love's family donated the deceased soldier's kidneys after they authorized the medical staff to disconnect the life-supporting machine. A UDR party attended Paul Sutcliffe's funeral at his hometown of Barrowford, Lancashire, the only UDR military funeral held outside Northern Ireland. His ashes were scattered in the Mourne Mountains. Another horizontal mortar attack on a UDR mobile patrol took place on 6 November, when Private Michael Boxall was killed in Bellaghy after the Land Rover he was riding on was hit by a Mark 12 grenade. A fellow soldier lost one eye in the attack.Potter (2008), p. 351 Incidentally, constable Erik Clarke, another Englishmen who had also served in the British Army in Northern Ireland from 1973 to 1978, was killed that year by the same kind of weapon while riding on a combined Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) ‚Äì British Army mobile patrol in an early Mark 12 attack. The incident took place on 17 September at Swatragh, County Londonderry. Clarke had married a local woman and later joined the RUC. The Mark 12 mortar was used by the IRA until 1993, when it was superseded by the Mark 16\\\\.

In roll bonding, two or more layers of different metals are passed through a pair of flat rollers under sufficient pressure to bond the layers. The pressure is high enough to deform the metals and reduce the combined thickness of the clad material. The mating surfaces must be previously prepared (scratched, cleaned, degreased) in order to increase their friction coefficient and remove any oxide layers. The process can be performed at room temperature or at warm conditions. In warm roll bonding, heat is applied to pre-heat the sheets just before rolling, in order to increase their ductility and improve the strength of the weld. The strength of the rolled bonds depends on the main process parameters, including the rolling conditions (entry temperature of the sheets, amount of thickness reduction, rolling speed, etc.), the pre-rolling treatment conditions (annealing temperature and time, surface preparation techniques, etc.) and the post-rolling heat treatments. Applications The applications of roll bonding can be used for cladding of metal sheets, or as a sub-step of the accumulative roll bonding. Bonding of the sheets can be controlled by painting a pattern on one sheet; only the bare metal surfaces bond, and the un-bonded portion can be inflated if the sheet is heated and the coating vaporizes. This is used to make heat exchangers for refrigeration equipment. Bralla, James G.

The lake was given its modern name by the British explorer, Matthew Flinders, on 26 February 1802. Since 1969, the lake has been part of the Sleaford Mere Conservation Park and since 2005, it has been listed as a nationally important wetland. The lake and its environs are notable as a venue for recreational pursuits such as canoeing. Description Sleaford Mere is a permanent salt lake with an area of . It is about to long in the north-south direction and about wide from west to east. It is reported as being ‚Äòa few feet deep‚Äô and as having ‚Äòsome small islands.‚Äô Since 2003, the lake has been located within the locality of Sleaford. Hydrology Sleaford Mere is supplied directly by local runoff and indirectly by groundwater sources. In respect to local runoff, the locality around the lake receives of rainfall per annum. As of 2005, it was reported that it was not known if groundwater was being supplied from a single basin or multiple basins. In respect to groundwater, the lake is part of a potable water administration area known as the Southern Basins Prescribed Wells Area which covers the area of Eyre Peninsula between the city of Port Lincoln and the town of Coffin Bay. Geology Sleaford Mere was formed within a depression in a limestone strata known as the Bridgewater Formation. Natural history =Flora= Stromatolites are present at the lake's edge. Land immediately adjoining the lake supports tall open shrubland dominated by dryland tea-tree and a sedgeland of Gahnia trifida. Species of conservation significance include the common spleenwort and Eyre Peninsula bitter-pea. As of 2009, Aleppo pine, an introduced species, was considered to an infestation risk. =Fauna= The lake is notable as a bird habitat. The northern end of the lake has been identified as being suitable habitat for southern emu-wren. The lake supports food sources such as fish species such as ‚Äòhardy heads‚Äô (sp: Atherinosoma) which are consumed by bird species such as Pacific gull, pied cormorant, pied oystercatcher, red-capped plover, silver gull and the two following species protected by the Japan‚ÄìAustralia Migratory Bird Agreement and the China‚ÄìAustralia Migratory Bird Agreement: sharp-tailed sandpiper and curlew sandpiper. Species of conservation significance known to visit the lake include fairy tern, hooded plover and musk duck. The lake is reported as containing marine species of fish, including ‚Äòa large, land-locked population of skates‚Äô. Western grey kangaroo is reported as being within the vicinity of the lake. The land surrounding the lake supports foxes, an introduced species which is the subject of ongoing pest animal control programs. History =Aboriginal use= The lake and adjoining land is reported in 2009 as being associated with the Barngala and Nauo peoples. As of 2009, there was no record of the lake or an object discovered in or near the lake being of ‚Äòsignificance according to Aboriginal tradition or of significance to Aboriginal archaeology, anthropology or history.‚Äô The native name for the lake was reported in 1908 as being Kuyabidni (also spelt as Kujabidni). =European use= The lake was seen by Matthew Flinders on Friday 26 February 1802 and named after a parish in Lincolnshire, England. Flinders visited the lake to investigate it as a source of water but found that its water was undrinkable. He described the lake as follows: Economy Economic activity is mainly associated with the use of the Sleaford Mere Conservation Park and the adjoining Lincoln National Park for recreational and leisure purpose by persons either resident in the lower Eyre Peninsula or visiting from elsewhere. As of 2007, a walking trail associated with the Lincoln National Park passes the east side of the lake. As of 2009, the lake was being used occasionally as a canoeing venue, particularly by school and holiday groups. Also, the lake can be used as a swimming venue, however this use may be discouraged by the lake‚Äôs relative shallow depth and high salinity. As of 1980, ‚Äòa holiday complex‚Äô was reported as being ‚Äòsituated on the southern shore of the Lake.‚Äô Protected area status Sleaford Mere and some adjoining land was proclaimed as a national park in January 1969 for the purpose of conserving ‚Äòconserve important lake feeding habitat for wader birds.‚Äò In 2005, Sleaford Mere was included in a non-statutory listing of nationally important wetlands located in South Australia as part of A Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia.

The search engine, which brands itself as ‚Äúmore of a discovery engine,‚Äù allows users to filter the top million websites on the internet out of their search, resulting in a unique set of results and placing an emphasis on content discovery. This approach to search is also designed to combat the impact that aggressive black and grey hat SEO practices have on mainstream search results. History Million Short was conceived in 2012 by Exponential Labs. The program gathers results like any other engine, then uses web rankings to exclude the most popular sites before producing its final results. More recently the company has continued to develop its own search technology and web crawling capacities, and uses proprietary data to help inform the Million Short search results. Upon its April 2012 launch, Million Short earned significant attention, first from online communities such as Reddit and Hacker News, and then from both blogs and mainstream publications. The months following Million Short's launch saw a number of updates to the engine, including international support, mobile and tablet optimization, browser search extensions, design updates, and voice search. Marketing and related projects Following the initial interest in Million Short, Exponential Labs launched a series of projects related to Million Short, both as marketing endeavors and expansions on the search engine's initial premise. =Million Tall= Billed as the ‚Äúinverse‚Äù of Million Short, Million Tall is another search engine created by Exponential Labs that indexes and displays results from only the top million sites on the internet (i.e., those that Million Short excludes). The project launched on July 2012, intended to highlight the frequency with which leading search engines display results from the same small number of websites. Its tagline asks: ‚ÄúImagine a search engine that only indexed the top 1 million sites on the web. Would you even notice?‚Äù =Million Short It On= In September 2012, Exponential Labs released Million Short It On, a site presenting a blind test between Million Short and Google search results. Users were presented with two sets of unbranded results for a given term, and instructed to determine which results were more useful. The project was based‚Äî both in name and concept‚Äî on Bing It On, a similar marketing campaign launched earlier that year, which, in turn, drew inspiration from the Pepsi Challenge in the 1970s. =Million Short DNS= December 2012 saw the release of Million Short DNS, a series of domain name system servers programmed to exclude specific domains on the internet, redirecting them instead to an error page. Servers are available to exclude either the top million, hundred thousand, ten thousand, thousand, or hundred sites on the internet. In addition to redirecting the URLs of excluded domains, the servers will not load any content hosted on these domains. In some cases this results in missing images, typefaces, or JavaScript files, lending a radically different browsing experience even to sites that are not excluded.

In July 2015, it decided to give up the hospital contract as uneconomic. Andrew George, MP for St Ives, and the local campaign group Health Initiative Cornwall criticised community hospitals being taken out of the NHS and welcomed the idea of merging the company with the NHS providers in Cornwall, Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust. In May 2013, it set up a new company, PCH Dental, to deliver community dental services in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. The ten beds at Poltair Hospital were closed in 2014. The local campaign group West Cornwall HealthWatch says the \\"service is almost at breaking point, with no sign of an early improvement\\", but according to the Clinical Commissioning Group \\"Beds continue to be available at Edward Hain and Helston community hospitals for anyone who needs one.\\" Campaigners claim \\"They are running at dangerously high 95 per cent occupancy levels, are unable to accept patients from the acute sector who need re-enablement, and are unable to discharge patients due to a lack of nursing home beds and care-at-home services.\\" A Care Quality Commission inspection in 2015 found good safe care was provided across community inpatient, adult, urgent care, and children and young people‚Äôs services, but end of life care services were rated ‚Äúrequires improvement‚Äù in relation to safety.

Characteristics No universally accepted criteria exist to define putative MHO, but definitions generally require the patient to be obese and to lack metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or metabolic syndrome. MHO individuals display less visceral adipose tissue, smaller adipocytes, and a reduced inflammatory profile relative to metabolically unhealthy obese individuals. As a result, it has been argued that cardiometabolic risk might not improve significantly as a result of weight loss interventions. Epidemiology Prevalence estimates of MHO have varied from 6 to 75 percent, and it has been argued that between 10 and 25 percent of obese individuals are metabolically healthy. One study found that 47.9% of obese people had MHO, while another found that 11% did. It seems to be more prevalent in women than men, and its prevalence decreases with age. Outcomes Some research suggests that metabolically healthy obese individuals are at an increased risk of several adverse outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, depressive symptoms, and cardiovascular events. Other research also suggests that although MHO individuals display a favorable metabolic profile, this does not necessarily translate into a decrease in mortality. Research to date has produced conflicting results with respect to cardiovascular disease and mortality. MHO individuals are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared to metabolically healthy non-obese individuals, but they are also at a lower risk thereof than individuals who are both unhealthy and obese. A 2016 meta-analysis found that MHO individuals were not at an increased risk of all-cause mortality (but were at an increased risk of cardiovascular events). The relatively low risk of cardiovascular disease among people with MHO relative to metabolically unhealthy obese people has been attributed to differences in white adipose tissue function between the two groups.

The pre-illness samples of students, who later developed infectious mononucleosis tested negative for EBV antibodies.

When Kai found out, he killed his four other siblings and was after Liv and Lucas too. Jo protected them with her magic and agreed to merge with him for the leadership to save their lives. Jo, though, hid her magic and Kai was not able to merge with her. Their father, with the help of Sheila Bennett, used the power of the eclipse to send him away in his prison of 1994. When Elena asks why Liv is so upset about being the leader of the coven, Jo and Luke clarify that after the merge, the weaker of the twins dies. In the meantime, Damon, Stefan and Alaric get to Portland to investigate about the Gemini coven. They find the house but no one seems to be there. Alaric finds pictures of Jo inside the house and in one of the pictures, Damon recognizes Kai. A man appears who introduces himself as the father of Kai, Joshua Parker (Christopher Cousins), and when he shakes hands with Damon, he makes them and the house disappear so Alaric and Stefan cannot see them. He uses his powers on Damon to knock him out and takes him into the house. When Damon wakes up, Joshua wants to know how Damon met Kai and if Kai can get himself out of his prison. Damon tells him everything and that they need the ascendant to get Bonnie out of there, but Joshua does not want to give it to him. Joshua realizes that since Kai has the ascendant and while being trapped with a Bennett witch, he will finally find his way out. To make sure that he will not merge with Jo, he casts a spell to kill her. Meanwhile, outside the house, Alaric is on the phone with Jo. She informs him that the ascendant is with her and that her father will not allow them to open Kai's world. While they are talking, Jo collapses due to her father's spell. Elena and Liam try to help her while she gives Stefan and Alaric directions how to get into the house. Stefan gets into the house in time to save Damon and Elena is forced to heal Jo by using her blood in front of Liam. Liam is confused and asks for explanations, Elena tells him the truth but she immediately compels him to forget everything about it. In 1994, Kai brings Bonnie to Portland and offers to cook Thanksgiving dinner to her. They make a deal that after that, everyone will take their separate ways. During the dinner Kai tells Bonnie the whole story about his family and how they locked him up there. He also reveals to her that all this time he was wondering where his sister's magic went when they tried to merge but he figured it out when Bonnie put her magic away for safety. He finds the knife where Jo put her magic and he consumes it. Bonnie reminds him that since she does not have her magic, he cannot do the spell since he needs a Bennett witch. Kai tells her that after seeing the spell twice, he knows that he only needs Bennett's blood so he stabs her with the knife. Later on, Bonnie wakes up to realize that Kai left to go back to Mystic Falls leaving her alone in Portland.

Stephanie Flasher from TV After Dark gave the episode a B rating saying that it was a rather satisfying one. \\"It brings some truths to light while leaving viewers intrigued so they're sure tune in for the next episode.\\" Flasher praised the writers, Nina Fiore and John Herrera, of the episode saying that they managed to say \\"four separate stories, in different locations and different decades altogether into one eye opening, question answering episode\\" as well as the director Joshua Butler, for whom she stated that he did a great job. Rebecca Serle of Vulture rated the episode with 5/5 saying that it was probably the darkest episode we've seen this show go but also straight-up delightful. \\"Just when you think you have The Vampire Diaries figured out, it goes in a direction so unforeseen, you find yourself checking your TV Guide to make sure you‚Äôre on the right channel.\\" Leigh Raines from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.5/5. \\"For the most part, it was all about the magic this week, something I've kind of noticed lately in the world of Julie Plec. This is not a complaint by any means; I find this whole storyline fascinating. It's just that from watching both The Vampire Diaries and The Originals, it feels like the witches have suddenly taken a much more central role.\\" Sara Ditta of Next Projection rated the episode with 6.4/10 saying that it was a plot-heavy episode with many reveals about characters the viewers are not invested in, but there were some solid moments on it. \\"Overall, it was an episode designed to reveal a lot of plot behind a storyline that we aren‚Äôt particularly invested in since there aren‚Äôt many direct connections to our main characters. While Alaric is dating Jo now and Bonnie is stuck with Kai, the narrative is mainly focused on drama within this family of witches.\\" Rebecca Jane Stokes from Den of Geek rated the episode with 3/5 saying that it had many cliches. \\"I was really, really into the whole Jo and Kai being twins deal, though it was hardly revelatory if you‚Äôve been paying attention and have read a book. The Gemini coven? Clearly there were going to be twins involved. Not sure how I feel about this whole twins-fusing together, strong one absorbing the weak one‚Äôs strength, but I‚Äôll go for it for now.\\" Jen of TV Overmind gave a good review to the episode saying that everything makes more sense now and the balance between the cheesy romances and the darker aspects has never been so right since the early seasons. \\"While it‚Äôs predictable that the new witches this season are all related, they have such a twisted family history that it could rival that of the Mikaelsons. Ever since we lost the Original family to their spin-off show, it‚Äôs a welcome change to introduce an equally troubled serial killer and his family‚Äôs complicated past.\\" References External links * * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 6) episodes Category:Thanksgiving television episodes ","title":"Fade into You (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"44501878","text":"1-Methylpsilocin is a tryptamine derivative which acts as a selective agonist for the 5-HT2C receptor (IC50 of 12 nM, vs 633 nM at 5-HT2A), and an inverse agonist at 5-HT2B (Ki of 38 nM). While 1-methylpsilocin does have higher affinity for 5-HT2C than 5-HT2A, it does produce a head-twitch response in mice that are dependent on 5-HT2A, so it is not entirely free of effects on 5-HT2A in vivo. In contrast to psilocin, 1-methylpsilocin did not activate 5-HT1A receptors in mice. 1-Methylpsilocin has been investigated for applications such as treatment of glaucoma, OCD, and cluster headaches, as these conditions are amenable to treatment with psychedelic drugs but are not generally treated with such agents due to the hallucinogenic side effects they produce, which are considered undesirable. 1-Methylpsilocin therefore represents a potential alternative treatment to psilocin that may be less likely to produce hallucinogenic effects.

Boca finished 8th in 1959 although the team won the two \\"Supercl√°sicos\\" (5‚Äì1 and 3‚Äì2 after being behind 2‚Äì0). On 9 December 1962, Boca won a legendary match defeating River Plate 1‚Äì0, with the highlight being goalkeeper Antonio Roma stopping a penalty shot by Delem when only 6 minutes were left till the end of the match. Boca finally won its first title of the decade in the next fixture with a great victory (4‚Äì0) over Estudiantes de La Plata, becoming new champion. During the 1960s, Boca Juniors won 5 championships. The team that won the Torneo Nacional in 1969. The following title obtained was in 1964, with Antonio Roma not conceding a goal for 742 minutes, and conceding only one goal in 14 matches. In 1965 Boca became successive champions for the 3rd time in the professional era. The key matches were the victory over River Plate (2‚Äì1) and Atlanta in the last fixture. In the 1968 Metropolitano championship during a Supercl√°sico that ended 0‚Äì0, seventy-one Boca Juniors supporters died after being squashed against an exit door at River Plate Stadium, which remained closed at the moment of the fans left the stadium. This is still remembered as The Tragedy of the Door No. 12 (La Tragedia de la Puerta 12). In 1969 an official tournament named Copa Argentina was disputed. Teams included were those playing the Metropolitano and others outside Buenos Aires. Boca Juniors proclaimed champion after defeating Atlanta by goal average (the matches ended 3‚Äì1 and 0‚Äì1). Boca Juniors played a total of 10 matches, winning 7, with 1 draw and only 1 loss. During the same year Boca played its last match of the Nacional championship visiting River Plate at the Monumental. The match ended 2‚Äì2 (Norberto Madurga scored twice) proclaiming Boca as the new champion. The Xeneizes totalized 29 points, winning 13, with 3 draws and only 1 defeat and were coached by Alfredo Di St√©fano. 1970s: the second \\"Golden Age\\" The Boca Juniors squad that played German team Borussia Moenchengladbach in La Bombonera, for the first leg of the Intercontinental Cup In 1970 Boca won another title defeating Rosario Central in the final match of the Nacional tournament. In 1976 Juan Carlos Lorenzo arrived at the club. He would become one of the most successful coaches in the history of Boca Juniors, winning 5 official titles within 3 years. First of them was the 1976 Metropolitano, which Boca obtained after defeating Uni√≥n de Santa Fe by 2‚Äì0, one round before the end of the tournament. The following tournament (1976 Nacional) Boca played a historic final match against arch-rival River Plate, winning 1‚Äì0 through a direct free kick goal scored by Rub√©n Su√±√©. Boca Juniors line-up was Gatti; Pern√≠a, S√°, Mouzo, Tarantini; Ribolzi, Su√±√©, Veglio; Mastr√°ngelo, Taverna, Felman.Argentina 1976 by Pablo Ciullini and Osvaldo Jos√© Gorgazzi at RSSSF It was the only final played by both Supercl√°sico teams up to present days.Boca y River: La noche inmortal on El Gr√°fico, December 2011 That championship qualified Boca Juniors to play the 1977 Copa Libertadores, having reached the final match against Cruzeiro. After a victory 1‚Äì0 in Buenos Aires and a defeat in Belo Horizonte by the same score, it was necessary to play a third game, hosted in Montevideo where Boca finally obtained the Libertadores for the first time, after a dramatic penalty shoot-out where Hugo Gatti stopped the last shot by Brazilian player Vanderley. The next title (and the most important of the decade) won by Boca Juniors was the 1977 edition of the Intercontinental Cup vs. German club Borussia M√∂nchengladbach (played one year later). The first leg played in Buenos Aires ended 2‚Äì2 but Boca won the second game 3‚Äì0 in Karlsruhe and brought the trophy back to Argentina. The line-up in Germany was Santos; Pern√≠a, S√°, Mouzo, Bord√≥n; Ben√≠tez, Su√±√©, Zanabria; Mastr√°ngelo, Pav√≥n, Salinas. To close a second part of the decade plenty of achievements, Boca Juniors won its second Copa Libertadores in 1978, after defeating Deportivo Cali (coached by Carlos Bilardo) 4‚Äì0 in the Bombonera (the first match played in Colombia had finished 0‚Äì0). 1980s: The Maradona revolution and few titles With the addition of superstar Diego Maradona (second from left, lower row) Boca Juniors won the Metropolitano championship in 1981 The highlight of the 1980s was the acquisition of the prodigious Diego Maradona, who came to the club along with Miguel Brindisi, Osvaldo Escudero, Marcelo Trobbiani, while former player Silvio Marzolini was appointed as coach. Boca won its first title of the decade, the 1981 Metropolitano championship after a 1‚Äì1 draw v. Racing in the round 17th. The Xeneizes totalized 50 points, with 20 wins, 10 draws and 4 losses.Argentina 1981 ‚Äì Campeonato Metropolitano by Osvaldo Gorgazzi on RSSSF.com Maradona and Brindisi were regarded as the most notable players of the squad.Boca '81 on El Gr√°fico The following year, Boca lost the young Maradona, who moved to Europe to play for FC Barcelona, owing also to Argentina's political problems. In 1984 Boca was near to a financial collapse, almost going bankrupt. The same year the team suffered their biggest defeat at the hands of FC Barcelona, losing 1‚Äì9 in a Joan Gamper Trophy match. After the departure of Marzolini in 1981, Boca Juniors hired several head coaches although the squad could not win any championship until 1989. The list of managers includes Vladislao Cap, Carmelo Faraone, Ra√∫l Rodr√≠guez Seoane, Ernesto Grillo, Miguel √Ångel L√≥pez, Dino Sani, Mario Zanabria, Alfredo Di St√©fano, C√©sar Luis Menotti, Roberto Saporiti, Juan C. Lorenzo and Jos√© Omar Pastoriza. In 1985, Antonio Alegre and Carlos Heller were elected president and vice-president, respectively. Under their command, Boca settled 153 lawsuits early in his tenure by mortgaging his business assets for US$250,000, and by lending Boca Juniors US$800,000. These and other measures enabled they to recover the club's finances. Boca also sold the land acquired earlier for US$21 million. The club's improved finances led to its revival, and Boca emerged victorious in a number of coveted tournaments in subsequent years, being the 1989 Supercopa Sudamericana the last title of the decade. The team, managed by Carlos Aimar, achieve its first international honour since the 1978 Copa Libertadores. Early 1990s The number of international titles won increased during the first part of the decade, with Boca Juniors winning the 1990 Recopa Sudamericana, the 1992 Copa Master de Supercopa and the 1993 Copa de Oro (named \\"Nicol√°s Leoz\\"). At domestic level, the squad won the celebrated 1992 Apertura, after eleven years without league titles and managed by Uruguayan √ìscar Tab√°rez, who had arrived to the club in 1991. Some of the most notable players of the late 1980s‚Äìearly 1990s were Carlos Navarro Montoya (ranked 5th among the footballers who played the most matches with the club), Diego Latorre, Gabriel Batistuta, Juan Sim√≥n, Carlos Mac Allister, Carlos Tapia, Blas Giunta, Claudio Marangoni, Sergio Mart√≠nez, Alberto M√°rcico, Roberto Caba√±as. In 1995, entrepreneur Mauricio Macri was elected as president of the club. One of his first actions was to refurbish La Bombonera, demolishing the old boxes to build new ones. The club also built a basketball, venue, Estadio Luis Conde (known as La Bombonerita) with a capacity of 2,000 spectators, inaugurated in 1996. Macri also created an investment fund for the purchase of football players.Boca ya est√° en la bolsa, Clar√≠n, 23 Sep 1997 Macri also hired Jorge Griffa to manage the youth divisions of the club with the purpose of promoting new talents from Boca Juniors instead buying players from other clubs. The first manager under Macri's presidency was former Argentina national team coach, Carlos Bilardo. His tenure lasted only one year, with no titles won despite the large number of players acquired, including Diego Maradona ‚Äìwho had returned to the clubHace 20 a√±os, Maradona volv√≠a a Boca, La Voz, 7 Oct 2015‚Äì Claudio Caniggia, Juan Ver√≥n, Kily Gonz√°lez, Fernando Gamboa and N√©stor Fabbri.Carlos Bilardo on Imborrable Boca, 17 Dec 2008 Bilardo resigned after Boca Juniors finished 10th. in the 1996‚Äì97 season.Arruabarrena: \\"En el 96 Boca trajo 15 jugadores y sali√≥ en la mitad\\", Ol√©, 14 Feb 2015 Bilardo's successor was H√©ctor Veira, but he could not win any title with a team that had its best performance in the 1997 Apertura, finishing runner-up. The Bianchi era: another Golden Age Former V√©lez S√°rsfield coach Carlos Bianchi arrived at the club in 1998 and under his command, the squad would achieve multiple local and international titles, breaking the record obtained with Juan Carlos Lorenzo in the 1970s. With Carlos Bianchi as coach, Boca won 9 titles. The first title obtained was the 1998 Apertura, which Boca won being undefeated for the first time. Mart√≠n Palermo was the top scorer with 20 goals in 19 matches played. Boca later won a new championship in the 1999 Clausura becoming successive champions. The team remained undefeated in 40 matches, breaking the record of 39 matches achieved by Racing Club in the 1960s. This mark is still a record in the professional era of Argentine football. The year 2000 was the most successful for Boca Juniors. The team won the Copa Libertadores after 22 years without winning that trophy, defeating Palmeiras in the finals by penalty-shots after two matches ended in a draw (2‚Äì2 and 0‚Äì0). Goalkeeper Oscar C√≥rdoba was the most notable player of the final disputed in S√£o Paulo. As the new South America champion, Boca went to Tokyo to play the 2000 Intercontinental Cup against Real Madrid, defeating the Merengue team 2‚Äì1 (goals by Palermo). The same year Boca won another local title, the Torneo Apertura, totaling 3 titles in 2000. In 2001 Boca were Copa Libertadores champion again, defeating Cruz Azul in a penalty-shootout. Boca won 1‚Äì0 the first final match in Mexico and lost the second game in La Bombonera by the same score. Oscar C√≥rdoba was the most notable player again. Bianchi left the club in 2002 due to a conflict with the chairman Mauricio Macri, so Oscar Tab√°rez was chosen as his replacement beginning his second run as team's coach. Nevertheless, Bianchi would return the following year to take care of the team again. In 2003, Boca obtained a new title winning the Copa Libertadores for the 3rd time in 4 years. The most notable player of that tournament was Carlos Tevez while Marcelo Delgado was the top scorer with 9 goals. In the finals played against Santos FC, Boca won 2‚Äì0 in Buenos Aires and 3‚Äì1 in S√£o Paulo. Boca Juniors completed another successful year winning the 2003 Intercontinental Cup against AC Milan by penalty-shot after a 1‚Äì1 draw. Mat√≠as Donnet, who tied the game in the 29th minute, was named the Man of the Match. Boca reached another Copa Libertadores final in 2004, but lost to Once Caldas from Manizales, Colombia in PK's. Once the Cup was over, Bianchi resigned, finishing one of the most successful periods in the club history. Basile's multi-champion After Bianchi's departure from the club, Miguel Brindisi (who had played for the club in the 1980s) was chosen as coach but he soon resigned at the end of the 2004 Apertura, when Boca finished 8th. The successor of Brindisi was Jorge Chino Ben√≠tez, another player for Boca in the 1970s and 1980s. Under his coaching Boca won the 2004 Copa Sudamericana defeating Club Bol√≠var in the finals. In 2005 (the year of Boca's 100th anniversary) the Xeneize contested another edition of the Copa Libertadores, being eliminated by Chivas de Guadalajara. In that match, Ben√≠tez spat at the Chiva's player Adolfo Bautista, causing a melee which resulted in the referee abandoning the match. Due to this act, Ben√≠tez was immediately dismissed by the club. After Ben√≠tez's dismissal, Boca hired Alfio Basile as its coach. With Basile as the coach, Boca won the Recopa Sudamericana (2005 edition), defeating Once Caldas, and the 2005 Copa Sudamericana, where the Xeneize won over Pumas from M√©xico by penalty-shots after two draws. Roberto Abbondanzieri was the MVP, stopping two shots and converting the decisive penalty kick. Boca would win two titles more: the 2005 Apertura and 2006 Clausura becoming successive champion of Argentine football. The squad also obtained the 2006 Recopa Sudamericana over S√£o Paulo. After the elimination of the Argentina national football team in the 2006 World Cup, Basile was called by the National Association to take over and left the club under a successful run. Under the coaching of Basile, Boca Juniors won five titles within two years (2005‚Äì06). More international success Ricardo Lavolpe was chosen to be the coach succeeding Basile. In the 2006 Apertura the team made a good campaign but at the end of the season finished with the same number of points as Estudiantes de La Plata, so both teams had to play a match in order to proclaim a new champion. Estudiantes defeated Boca 2‚Äì1 in V√©lez S√°rsfield stadium and Lavolpe resigned as the coach. The next coach was Miguel √Ångel Russo and Juan Rom√°n Riquelme returned to the club. Boca Juniors won the 2007 Copa Libertadores defeating Brazilian team Gremio in the finals (3‚Äì0 in Buenos Aires and 2‚Äì0 in Porto Alegre). Riquelme (who scored 8 goals) was considered to be the best player of the tournament by journalists and fans. As the South American champion, Boca went to Tokyo to dispute the FIFA Club World Cup but was defeated by Italian AC Milan by 4‚Äì2. Carlos Ischia was appointed as coach after Russo's departure. Under his coaching the club won the 2008 Recopa Sudamericana (against Arsenal de Sarand√≠). On the other hand, Boca was eliminated by Fluminense (which would be the runner up) in the 2008 Copa Libertadores semi-finals. At the end of that year Boca obtained a new title, the 2008 Apertura. That season ended with Boca, San Lorenzo and Tigre in equal 1st position so a play-off tournament had to be contested among those 3 teams in order to proclaim a new champion. Boca won that tournament and became new Argentine champion. That same season Boca's arch-rival River Plate finished the last for the first time in its history. Boca finished 14th (over 19 teams) in the 2009 Clausura and Ischia was dismissed by the club (although the managers said he had resigned)\\"Aceleraron el despido de Ischia\\", La Naci√≥n, 2009-05-24\\"Ischia blanque√≥ el despido\\", La Naci√≥n, 2009-05-30 and Basile was called to start his second run as coach. Nevertheless, after finishing 11th in the 2009 Apertura, Basile left the club.  2010s: local success continues  For the 2010 Clausura the team was coached firstly by Abel Alves and then by Roberto Pompei,\\"Roberto Pompei, el manotazo de ahogado de Ameal\\", Canchallena.com, 2010-04-09 who were working with the youth teams when they were appointed to coach the first division team. Boca finished 16th so the club decided to hire Claudio Borghi\\"Confirmado: Borghi ser√° el DT de Boca\\", Perfil.com, 2010-05-19 (who had won a title coaching Argentinos Juniors the last season) as team's new coach, but he left the club after 14 matches, due to the bad results obtained.\\"El decepcionante adi√≥s: Borghi cay√≥ preso de su propia inestabilidad\\", Canchallena.com, 2010-11-17 Roberto Pompei was designated to be the coach until the end of the Apertura.\\"Pompei de interino, y despu√©s?\\", Canchallena.com, 2010-11-17 Boca finished in 12th position. In January 2011, Boca hired Julio Falcioni who had won a title coaching Banfield in 2009. The team did not have a good campaign in the Clausura, although Boca won the Supercl√°sico (the last played before River was relegated to the second division) finishing 7th. In the last fixture (when Boca played against Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata) Mart√≠n Palermo, the all-time top scorer, retired.\\"Se retir√≥ Mart√≠n Palermo, el 'Tit√°n' del gol\\", Diario Perfil 2011-06-18 For the 2011 Apertura, Boca acquired goalkeeper Agust√≠n Ori√≥n and veteran centre back Rolando Schiavi, who returned after his tenure at Newell's Old Boys. After three years without any achievements, Boca won its 30th. league title when the squad defeated Banfield by 3‚Äì0 on round 17. The line-up was Orion; Roncaglia, Schiavi, Insaurralde, Clemente Rodr√≠guez; Rivero, Somoza, Erviti; Ch√°vez; Mouche, Cvitanich.Boca es otra vez campe√≥n del f√∫tbol argentino, Mundo D, 5 Dec 2011 Boca Juniors completed the tournament remaining unbeaten, with 12 wins and 7 draws. The team also conceded the fewest goals (only 6 in 19 matches disputed) which set a record for short tournaments in Argentina (after Clausura and Apertura championships were established in 1991).\\"El campe√≥n record\\", Clar√≠n, 2011-12-12\\"Boca es un campe√≥n record\\", Diario24, 2011-12-11Boca campe√≥n record\\", Dia a Dia, 2011-12-12 That same season, Boca also won the second edition of the relaunched Copa Argentina, after beating Racing Club at the final. Some changes in the line-up were goalkeeper Ustari, defender Caruzzo and forwards Viatri and Silva. In 2012, Boca reached the final of Copa Libertadores, five years after having won the 2007 final, but the squad lost to Brazilian Corinthians by 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. On the knockout stages, the squad had previously eliminated Uni√≥n Espa√±ola, Fluminense and Universidad de Chile. In 2013, it was confirmed that Carlos Bianchi, the most successful coach in Boca Juniors' history, would return to take care of the team again. On August 28, 2014, after 74 matches with only 45 percent effectiveness (26 wins and losses), having conceded 88 and scored 79 goals and without any championships, Bianchi was dismissed by the club.\\"Bianchau\\", Diario Ol√©, 2014-08-29\\"Bianchi en rojo\\", Diario Ol√©, 2014-08-29 After dismissing Bianchi, former player Rodolfo Arruabarrena was hired as manager of the club. With Arruabarrena as coach, Boca Juniors qualified to the semifinals of 2014 Copa Sudamericana but it was defeated by River Plate (0‚Äì1 on aggregate). The next year, Boca Juniors was disqualified from the 2015 Copa Libertadores by CONMEBOL following the incidents that occurred during the match against River Plate at La Bombonera. The sentence came after four River Plate players, Leonardo Ponzio, Leonel Vangioni, Ramiro Funes Mori and Mat√≠as Kranevitter suffered a \\"chemical kerititis\\", an inflammation of the cornea, as a result of the exposure to chemicals during the second leg match against Boca at La Bombonera.\\"Conmebol disqualifies Boca from Libertadores\\", The Buenos Aires Herald, 16 May 2015 Prior to those incidents, Boca Juniors had won all the games at group stage finishing with 18 points and only 2 goals conceded in 6 games played. After the frustration at Copa Libertadores, Boca would win its 31st league title in 2015 when the team defeated Tigre in the penultimate fixture of the championship with a goal scored by Fabi√°n Monz√≥n.\\"Boca se desahog√≥ y sali√≥ campe√≥n en una Bombonera que desbord√≥ de alegr√≠a\\", Cancha Llena, 1 Nov 2015 (Archived) The line-up for that match was Ori√≥n; Gino Peruzzi, Tobio, Rol√≠n, Monz√≥n; Pablo P√©rez, Cubas, Meli, Lodeiro; Tevez, Calleri. Tevez (who had left Juventus to join Boca Juniors at the beginning of that year) was the keyplayer of the team. Only three days after winning the Primera Divisi√≥n title, Boca Juniors won the 2014‚Äì15 Copa Argentina after beating Rosario Central by 2‚Äì0 in a match played at Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes of C√≥rdoba. The match became controversial due to referee Ceballos disallowed a Rosario Central goal and awarded Boca Juniors a penalty kick after the foul was committed outside the penalty area.En una final envuelta por las pol√©micas, Boca venci√≥ a Rosario Central y se consagr√≥ campe√≥n de la Copa Argentina, La Naci√≥n, 4 Nov 2015  The Barros Schelotto era  On February 29, 2016, Arruabarrena was dismissed as Boca Juniors manager.

On March 1, Guillermo Barros Schelotto was announced as the new manager, being his third time as manager in a professional football team. He returned to the club after his step as player between 1997 and 2007 where he won 16 titles. Boca Juniors' last achievement to date is the 2016‚Äì17 Primera Divisi√≥n title, where the team crowned champion before playing the 29th round v. Olimpo in Bah√≠a Blanca.

It can be distinguished by its more compact ear due to shorter rachis segments, giving it its common name. In the United States of America, nearly all T. compactum is grown in dry areas of the Pacific Northwest. T. compactum is a hexaploid with 21 chromosomes. T. compactum, like other club wheats, has been selectively bred for its lower protein content. Due to the process of selective breeding T. compactum has fewer HMW-glutenin genes than other species of wheat. Flour made from T. compactum is thus better suited for the production of cookies.

However analysis of adobe bricks in San Antonio, San Fernando, Soledad, San Jos√©, San Juan Bautista and Sonoma missions revealed that T. compactum was present in California by the year 1787 and was likely introduced by Spaniards through Mexico.George W. Hendry, and Margaret P. Kelly. December 1970. The Plant Content of Adobe Bricks: With a Note on Adobe Brick Making. California Historical Society Quarterly. p. 366T. compactum was farmed extensively during the beginning of California's agricultural history. Data even suggests that T. compactum was farmed more than the related T. aestivum during this time. T. compactum erinaceum, also called California Club Wheat, was a bearded, hairy rachis, red-chaffed subspecies of T. compactum that is thought to have disappeared before 1822.Davis, Horace. 1894. California Breadstuffs. (Chicago. The University of Chicago Press.) As production of American wheat drastically increased during the early twentieth century T. aestivum rose in popularity surpassing T. compactum. Today most T. compactum is grown alongside T. aestivum because of their similar nature. Identification Ears of T. compactum =Unfossilized specimen= T. compactum is small free-threshing club wheat with rounded grains. In T. compactum like other bread and club wheats there is a keel on the upper section of the otherwise flat glume.T. compactum characteristically has a smaller, crooked crease than other species of wheat and smaller cheek size at the brush end. T. compactum is identifiable from T. aestivum mainly by its shorter rachis segments and compact ear for which it is named. The now extinct subspecies of T. compactum, T. compactum erinaceum or California club wheat, can be distinguished from other subspecies by its red chaff and hairier rachides. The below chart indicates the physiological factors that can be used to distinguish between various subspecies and varieties of T. compactum:J. Allen Clark and B. B. Bayles. 1935. Classification of Wheat Varieties Grown In The United States. United States Department of Agriculture. =Fossilized specimen= Most ancient T. compactum was cultivated between the Neolithic era and the Bronze Age and thus the most common evidence of ancient T. compactum is carbonized. Although carbonized wheat may often resemble its unfossilized counterpart and can often be identified with the same methods described above it is sometimes difficult to distinguish carbonized wheat this way due to a damaged or incomplete specimen. As a general rule, if a naked wheat, wheat with round grains and irregularly broken rachis forming internodes, is uncovered in a European site, excluding all sites on the Italian or Balkan peninsulas, it should be considered a hexaploid club wheat (either T. aestivum or T. compactum ). If such wheat has short internodes it should be identified as T. compactum.M.E. Kislev. 1984. Emergence of Wheat Agriculture. Pal√©orient. Vol. 10, No. 2. p. 66.

Journalism and personal life  Hoben was born in Auckland, and after a few years in New South Wales, he spent his youth at Tauranga, where he was a prominent figure in local sports as captain of the rugby and boxing clubs, and noted as a walker and swimmer. After working at a bank in Tauranga, he started working in journalism, and subsequently moved to Wellington, where he worked for The Evening Post. During his career he worked for a number of newspapers throughout New Zealand and Australia, including The Sydney Daily Telegraph, The Sydney Mail, The New Zealand Times and the Manawatu Times. Hoben had just moved to Melbourne to take up a position at The Melbourne Herald, but he was hospitalised soon after his arrival, and died of a diabetes-related illness there.  Rugby union  Hoben was involved in rugby first in the Bay of Plenty and then in the Hawke's Bay. He helped establish the sport in the Bay of Plenty, and became friends with Joe Warbrick and his family; Warbrick went on to organise and captain the ground-breaking 1888‚Äì89 New Zealand Native football team. Hoben later served as secretary of the Hawke's Bay Rugby Union. By 1891 clubs in a number of regions throughout New Zealand had formed their own provincial Rugby Unions to govern the sport in their area. This started with the formation of the Canterbury Rugby Football Union (CRFU) and Wellington Rugby Football Union in 1879, and over the next decade over a dozen new provincial Unions were formed. Most of the provincial Unions were directly affiliated with the English Rugby Football Union, but having a governing body in New Zealand would help with inter- provincial disputes over scoring and other matters. At various times the Canterbury, Wellington, and Auckland Rugby Union's had each suggested the formation of a national union, but Hoben became the primary advocate for such a body, and spent 1891 travelling throughout the country and canvassing support from the various provincial unions. Hoben found widespread support for his proposal, with the Otago Rugby Union (ORU)a powerful province in the gamethe only significant opponent to the idea. On 7 November 1891 a conference with delegates from Auckland, Taranaki, Hawke's Bay, Wairarapa, Manawatu, Wellington and Otago met and discussed the text of a constitution. The draft constitution was distributed to the various provincial Unions to discuss, and by the time of a second meeting, at the Club Hotel in Wellington on 16 April 1892, most of the Unions endorsed a proposal to form the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (now the New Zealand Rugby Union, or NZRU). Hoben was elected secretary. Most notably, the three most powerful South Island Unions of Canterbury, Otago, and Southland declined to join. On the subject of those southern Unions not joining, Hoben said: Hoben was particularly surprised that Canterbury did not join as the CRFU management committee had previously voted to do so in 1891, but none of those that had voted in favour were re-elected for 1892. The CRFU were unhappy with the requirement that all NZRU executive committee members live in Wellington, something they felt would put New Zealand rugby \\"in the hands of Wellington men\\". Consequently, the 1893 New Zealand team that toured New South Wales was selected without any players from the three southern provinces. But by 1895 all three Unions had joined the NZRU and the 1897 New Zealand team that toured Australia was selected from players throughout the country. The NZRU's largest meeting room, the Ernest Hoben Room, is named in recognition of his services to rugby in New Zealand. The room's walls are decorated with photos of past All Black players and teams, as well as all 26 provincial rugby jerseys. As part of their 150th anniversary in 2013, The New Zealand Herald named Hoben as the most influential New Zealander of 1892 for his role in helping found the NZRU.

Weisman endowed the museum in 1992 with a gift of $1.5 million. Along with his gift, Weisman loaned the museum roughly $3 million of contemporary art from his personal collection. Weisman made his fortune as president of Hunt Foods and as a distributor for Toyota, and he donated to many artistic organizations and charities, including the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation in Los Angeles and the Weisman Art Museum at his alma mater, the University of Minnesota. The founding director of the museum was Nora Halpern, who had previously worked as the curator of Weisman's private collection. Following a disagreement with the administration concerning censorship of an exhibit at the museum, Halpern left the university in 1994. In 1995, Michael Zakian was named the new director of the museum, and served the Pepperdine art community for over 25 years before his passing on January 14th, 2020. Notable exhibits The museum has hosted a number of notable exhibits, including Rodin's Obsession: The Gates of Hell in 2001, which featured 30 sculptures by Auguste Rodin; Chuck Close: Face Forward in 2015, a retrospective that featured over 70 prints by Close; and Andy Warhol: Life and Legends in 2016, which featured some of Warhol's most famous works.

Education Barnes attended Market Bosworth High School and The Bosworth College. She then studied for a degree in music, specialising in voice, at the Birmingham Conservatoire and then completed her Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) at the faculty of Education at the University of Central England, now known as Birmingham City University.

Barnes completed an MA in school based explorations at Goldsmiths University. Early LGBT Work Barnes first job was as a peripatetic singing teacher in Hertfordshire and London. She then obtained a permanent teaching role at Stoke Newington School in North London becoming Head of Year in 2005. That year, she began working with Schools Out to initiate LGBT History Month at Stoke Newington School with the aim of eradicating homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic language and bullying by challenging young people's (and teachers, parents and governors) perceptions of LGBT+ people. The approach taken by LGBT History Month was to educate young people about different gender identities and sexual orientations by introducing recognisable symbols of the LGBT community, famous LGBT people and the history of the LGBT struggle. During these early years Barnes and her team created LGBT+Inclusive schemes of work for their year 7 including ICT lessons on Alan Turing, LGBT+ symbols, key rings, rainbow flag in Design & Technology and songs by queer artists in music. All the teachers in the year team contributed; the project developed over the next 7 years into a school-wide celebration of LGBT History Month with an integrated curriculum for which received ‚Äòbest practice‚Äô status from Ofsted in 2012 for successfully tackling homophobic bullying and ingrained attitudes in our schools stating that ‚ÄòThis approach has been highly successful.‚Äô Educate & Celebrate In 2010 Barnes developed her theory and practice into the ‚ÄòEducate & Celebrate‚Äô teacher training and resource programme to make educational institutions ‚ÄòLGBT+Friendly‚Äô through standardising and creating centres of 'best practice'.

Midland St in Bay City, Michigan. The library had its grand opening on January 16, 1884 and was constructed by Henry W. Sage as a gift to Bay City. It is operated as a public library by the Bay County Library System. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It is the oldest continually operated library building in the state of Michigan. History Sage Library, Henry W. Sage and his business partner, John McGraw, arrived in Bay City area in the early 1860s to open a sawmill and lumberyard. They platted a small settlement know then as Wenona, and later West Bay City. Henry Sage was also a generous philanthropist, donating significantly to Cornell University. In 1884, Sage contracted with the area's best known architectural firm, Pratt and Koeppe, to design this library, and hired Andrew Thomson as the contractor to construct it. When originally built, the library itself occupied only the second floor of the building, and contained 10,000 books. The first floor was used for school classes, and the third floor was used as an office for the Superintendent of Schools. The building also provided meeting space for several societies. When West Bay City and Bay City merged in 1903, the library was incorporated into the Bay City System. The collection housed in the building continued to grow, reaching over 110,000 volumes by the 1970s. The library underwent major renovations in 1982-84, and the slate roof was replaced in 1990. In 2002-04 an extensive renovation restored many historic features, converted the attic into a library area, and included an addition to the rear of building. The building is still operated as a public library. Description The Sage Library is a rectangular, 2-1/2-story, four bay wide red brick building with a multi-colored ashlar fieldstone foundation, and highlighted with pink Amherst stone. The building is designed in a revival version of French Ch√¢teauesque architecture, with asymmetrical massing and a steeply pitched hipped roof. The front facade has a projecting entryway covered with a gable roof two bays wide, with a rounded archway and double doors. Next to the entryway is a projecting bay reaching to the roofline; the final bay houses a tall double-hung window unit. On the second floor, the projecting bay holds a tri-sided arrangement of tall double hung window units; the remaining bays hold a simple double-hung sash each. At the roof level, the projecting bay is capped with a tri-sided roof while the remaining bays have dormers. Inside, the arrangement is the same as when the building first opened. The first floor has an entrance lobby and two large rooms originally serving as schoolrooms. The second floor, reached by a stair in the entry way, is also divided into two large rooms. One of these was the original reading room, and the other housed the collection. The third floor remains was originally unfinished, but has been converted into library space.

Biography  Halsey was born in Unadilla, New York to the physician Gaius Leonard Halsey, and Juliet Cartington Halsey. He was the younger brother of Francis Whiting Halsey (1851‚Äì1919), who became a noted American journalist, editor and historian. At the age of 22 in 1878 Frederick graduated from Cornell University with a degree in mechanical engineering. Halsey was editor of the American Machinist. In his famous 1891 paper \\"The Premium Plan of Paying for Labor,\\" he argued \\"against piecework payment and profit-sharing, and proposing an incentive wage system with an hourly wage, production requirements, and additional pay incentives for workers who exceed production goals -- had a major impact on the subsequent structure of labor pay in America and Britain.\\" In 1902 he was representative of the National Association of Manufacturers and successful opposed the metric system adoption in United States. In 1917 he was one of the founding members the American Institute of Weights and Measures to keep opposing the adoption of the metric system in the US. In 1922 he was awarded the ASME Medal by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for \\"eminently distinguished engineering achievement\\".  Work  = The Premium Plan of Paying for Labor, 1891 = The Premium Plan of Paying for Labor, 1891 At the June, 1891, meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Halsey presented a paper entitled \\"The Premium Plan of Paying for Labor.\\" In this paper Halsey presents four types of labor payment: * The day's-work plan : the workman is paid for and in proportion to the time spent upon his work.Halsey (1891, p. 75-81) * The piece-work plan : the workman is paid for and in proportion to the amount of work done. * The profit-sharing plan : in addition to regular wages, the employees are offered a certain percentage of the final profits of the business. * The premium plan : The time required to do a given piece of work is determined from previous experience, and the workman, in addition to his usual daily wages, is offered a premium for every hour by which he reduces that time on future work, the amount of the premium being less than his rate of wages. Hugo Diemer (1904) summarized: > Halsey briefly outlines the advantages and disadvantages of the day-work > plan, the piece-work plan, and the profit-sharing plan, and then describes > the premium plan as used by himself, citing specific instances illustrating > the working of the method. 'Under the day-work system, matters settle down > to an easy-going pace, and the employer pays extravagantly for his product.' > With regard to piece work, Halsey discusses at length the evils of rate- > cutting. He presents as an objection to the piece-work plan an argument that > may in many cases be a strong one in its favor, namely, that it requires a > knowledge and record of the cost of each piece of a complicated machine, and > oftentimes of each operation on each piece, thus limiting its application to > products which are produced in considerable quantities...Hugo Diemer. > \\"Bibliography of Works Management,\\" in: Engineering Magazine. New York, Vol. > 27. 1904. pp. 626-658. And furthermore: > ... With regard to profit-sharing, he objects that any system of profit > distribution based on collective rather than individual efforts is unfair, > that the remoteness of the reward is a disadvantage, that in bad business > years there will be no distribution, and that the workmen have no check on > the correctness of the employers' figures. With regard to the premium > system, he advocates varied hourly premium rates for time gained, depending > on the character of the work, a detail that deserves more attention than it > has generally received. In the discussion, Mr. William Kent attests to the > fact that Mr. Halsey spoke to him about the premium plan a year or so prior > to Mr. Towne's discussion on gain-sharing.

He explains that this ticket should be: > ...issued by the foreman, the blanks at the top being filled up by him. If > desired as a check he punches a hole on the line, indicating the hour when > the work is given out, repeating the same when the work and ticket are > returned. The record of the time is kept by drawing a line between various > hour marks, an operation which the most illiterate can perform.Halsey (1891, > p. 85-86) It was the intention, that the ticket should be used over several days' work, and is not returned until the work is completed, and contains the record of the entire job. As such the card has similarities with the Shop Order Card, presented by Captain Henry Metcalfe in his \\"Card system for cost accounting and production control\\", presented six years earlier. Halsey further explained, how his premium plan should work. In advance a standard time is set, and registered on the back of the ticket. On the back of the ticket was printed: > According to previous experience this work should require . . . hours. If > completed in less time than that a premium of . . . cents will be paid for > each hour saved. And furthermore Halsey explained, that \\"when the ticket is returned, a comparison of the back with the front shows the premium earned. This is entered opposite the workman's name, in a book kept for the purpose, which is a companion to the usual time book or payroll.\\"  Selected publications  * Frederick A.

He was able to employ a highly qualified assistant to research on his behalf but there is no evidence that Wilkinson traded as a full time art dealer. The number of auction sales required to dispose of his collection in the 1960s up to 1971, however, indicate that it was extensive and that he had a large and valuable library.

These strategies can be used to create aromatic systems from acyclic precursors in a single step, with many substituents already in place.Danheiser, R L., Brisbois, R G. James, J.

Reaction Development Polysubstituted benzenes were originally synthesized by substitution reactions on aromatic precursors. However, these reactions can have low regioselectivity and are prone to over substitution. Directed ortho metalation requires precursors that are often unstable to metallating reagents. Both these synthetic routes pose issues in total synthesis. In 1984 a new synthetic strategy was developed by Rick Danheiser to address these shortcomings.Chung, Won-jin. \\"Regioselective [4+2] Benzannulation: Synthesis of Polysubstituted Benzenes .\\" Chemistry Department.

Org. Chem. 1984, 49, 1672-1674. It is a thermal combination of a substituted cyclobutenones with heterosubstituted acetylenes to produce highly substituted aromatic compounds, specifically phenols or resorcinols (Scheme 1).Kowaiski, C.

This benzannulation reaction creates previously unaccessed aromatic substitution patterns. A variety of substituted aromatic rings can be prepared using this method including: phenols, naphthalenes, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, indoles, and carbazoles. center The modified Danheiser benzannulation allows the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic and heteroaromatic systems. This also includes napthalenes, benzofurans and indoles.K√ºrti L√°szl√≥, Barbara Czak√≥. Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis. Elsevier Inc.: Burlington, Massachusetts. This second generation aromatic annulation is achieved by irradiation of a solution of acetylene and a vinyl or aryl Œ±-diazo ketone in dichloroethane. This reaction utilizes the photochemical Wolff rearrangement of a diazoketone to generate an aryl or vinylketene. These ketene intermediates cannot be isolated due to their high reactivity to form diketenes. These rearrangements are performed in the presence of unsaturated compounds which undergo [2+2] cycloadditions with the in situ generated ketenes.\\"Wolff Rearrangement.\\" Organic-Chemistry. Organic Chemistry Portal, Web. 09 Nov. 2014. When ketenes are formed in the presence of alkynes they proceed through pericyclic reactions to generate a substituted aromatic ring (Scheme 2). Avoiding the use of the high energy cyclobutenone starting materials provides access to a wider variety of substituted aromatic compounds. This reaction is quite complementary to the Wulff‚ÄìD√∂tz reaction. This is a [2+1] cycloaddition of a carbene to an alkyne or alkene (more specifically in the D”ßtz reaction a carbene coordinated to a metal carbonyl group) to produce substituted aromatic phenols.D”ßtz, K. H. ‚ÄúSynthesis of Naphthol Skeleton from Pentacarbonyk [methoxy(phenyl)carbine]chromium(0) and Tolan.‚Äù Angew. Chem. Internat. Edit. 1975, 14, 644-645. =Mechanism= center center The reaction proceeds via a cascade of four subsequent pericyclic reactions (Scheme 3). Heating a cyclobutenone above 80 ¬∞C initiates a four- electron electrocyclic cleavage generating a vinyl ketene which reacts with an acetylene in a regiospecific [2+2] cycloaddition (Scheme 4). Reversible electrocyclic cleavage of the 2-vinylcyclobutenone yields a dienylketene. The dienylketene then undergoes a six-electron electrocyclization to give a hexadienone intermediate which rapidly tautomerizes to yield a highly substituted phenol or naphthol structures. In the case of the modified benzannulation reaction (Scheme 5); irradiation of the diazoketones induces the Wolff rearrangement yielding the vinyl ketene intermediate which reacts with the acetylene in a [2+2] cycloaddition then a four-electron cleavage of the resulting 4-substituted cyclobutenone produces a dienylketene which then undergoes a six-electron electrocyclization to give the 2,4-cyclohexanedione which tautomerizes to the final aromatic product. center center =Reaction conditions= A typical Danheiser benzannulation reaction is run with a 0.4-2.0 M solution of the cyclobutenone in toluene heated at 80-160 ¬∞C with a slight excess of the cyclobutenone. Upon addition of the alkyne a [2+2] cycloaddition occurs. The crude annulation product is treated with 10% potassium hydroxide in methanol to saponify the ester side product formed from the reaction of the phenolic product with excess vinylketene (Scheme 6). center For the second generation reaction starting with the diazoketone, the reaction is performed by irradiation of a 0.7 M solution of the ketone with 1.0-1.2 equivalents of acetylene. A low-pressure mercury-vapor lamp at 254 nm in a photochemical reactor is used for 5‚Äì8 hours until all the diazoketone has been consumed as determined by TLC analysis. Dichloromethane, chloroform, and 1,2-dichloroethane, are all appropriate solvents for the annulation reaction. Reagent Preparations Cyclobutenone was originally synthesized from the 3-bromocyclobutanone and 3-chlorocyclobutanone precursors which were prepared from an allene and a ketene via two independent routes. Scheme 7 shows the preparation from cyclobutenone from an allene.Sieja, J. B. ‚ÄúSynthesis of Cyclobutenone.‚Äù J. Am. Chem. Soc.1971, 93, 2481-2483. center Activated alkyoxyacetylenes can be synthesized in a single-pot preparation of triisopropylsilyloxyacetylenes from esters. The silyloxyacetylenes are useful substitutes for alkoxyacetylenes in [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with ketenes and vinylketenes affording cyclobutenones (Scheme 8). center Diazoketones can be synthesized in one-step from readily available ketones or carboxylic acid precursors by the addition of diazomethane to acyl chlorides. A diazo group transfer method can be used to produce Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones. The traditional method of the deformylative diazo transfer approach has been improved upon by substituting the trifluoroacetylation of generated lithium enolates for the Claisen formylation step. The key step in this procedure is activation of the ketone starting material to the corresponding Œ±-trifluoroacetyl derivative using trifluoroethyltrifluoroacetate (TFEA) (Scheme 9).Danheiser, R.L., Miller, R. F., Brisbois, R. G., Park, S. Z. ‚ÄúAn Improved Method for the Synthesis of Œ±-Diazoketones.‚Äù J. Org. Chem. 1990, 55, 1959-1964. center Alkynes or ketenophiles can be synthesized by various methods. Trialkylsilyloxyalkynes have proven to be excellent ketenophiles. These alkynes react in the annulation reaction to form resorcinol monosilyl ethers which can be de-protected under mild reaction conditions. Base-promoted dehydrohalogenation of (Z)-2-halovinyl ethers to form alkoxyacetylenes is one of the most well established routes of alkyne synthesis (Scheme 10).Danheiser, R.L., Nishida, A., Savariar, S., Trova, M. P. ‚ÄúTrialkylsiloxyalkynes: Synthesis and Aromatic Annulation Reactions. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988, 29, 4917-4920. center The synthesized alkynes are then heated in benzene or toluene in presence of excess cyclobutenone initiating the benzannulation reaction. Treatment with n-Bu4NF in tetrahydrofuran removes the siloxy groups to form the desired diols. Scope Alkynyl ethers and siloxyacetylenes have proven to be the ideal pair for aromatic annulations. The reactions can be run with both activated heterosubstituted alkynes and un-activated acetlyenes. Alkynyl thioethers and ynamines have been used as reactants in the annulation reaction. Conjugated enynes have also been used for benzannulation reactions catalyzed by cobalt. This type of benzannulation involves a [4+2] cycloaddition followed by a 1,3-hydrogen shift. In dichloromethane, the symmetrical benzannulation products are yielded but in tetrahydrofuran (THF), unsymmetrical benzannulation products were obtained with good regioselectivity. These reactions utilize 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) substituted cobalt catalyst in the presence of powdered zinc and zinc iodide for a solvent dependent benzannulation reaction (Scheme 11). In dichloromethane the ratio of A:B is 78:22 with an overall combined yield of 90% and in THF the ratio has switched to 7:93 (A:B) with a combined yield of 85%.P√ºnner, F., Hilt, G. ‚ÄúRegioselective Solvent-dependent Benzannulation of Conjugated Enynes.‚Äù Chem. Commun. 2012, 48, 3617‚Äì3619. center Palladium- catalyzed benzannulations have been developed using allylic compounds and alkynes. This palladium catalyzed reaction has been performed in both inter- and intramolecular forms. The cationic palladium complex [(Œ∑3-C3H5)Pd(CH3CN)2](BF4) reacts with an excess of 4-octyne when heated to 80 ¬∞C in the presence of triphenylphosphine forming the aromatic compound 1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrapropylbenzene (Scheme 12). It was determined that the presence of exactly one equivalent of palladium catalyst (from which the allyl group adds into the final aromatic structure) is crucial for the catalyzed benzannulation to occur in good yield.Tsukada, N., Sugawara, S., Nakaoka, K., Inoue, Y. ‚ÄúPalladium-Catalyzed Benzannulation from Alkynes and Allylic Compounds.‚Äù J. Org. Chem. 2003, 68, 5961-5966. center This catalyzed reaction was also optimized for allyl substrates with catalytic [Pd2(dba)3]CHCl3 and triphenylphosphine (dba =dibenzylideneacetone) (Scheme 13). center Applications in Total Synthesis Mycophenolic acid is a Penicillium metabolite that was originally prepared via a key benzannulation step. An alkyne and a cyclobutenone were reacted to form a substituted phenol in a single step in a 73% yield (Scheme 14). Mycophenolic acid was prepared in nine steps in an overall yield of 17-19%.Danheiser, R. L., Gee, S. K., Perez, J. J. ‚ÄúTotal Synthesis of Mycophenolic Acid.‚Äù J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986, 108, 807. center In the synthesis of highly substituted indoles performed by Danheiser, the key step was a benzannulation reaction using cyclobutenone and ynamides to produce highly substituted aniline derivatives. In this case, the ortho position can be functionalized with various substituents. Following the benzannulation reaction with various heterocyclization reactions can provide access to substituted indoles (Scheme 15).Lam, T. Y., Wang, Y., Danheiser, R.

They obtained the cyclobutenone substrate using a hetero-[2+2] cycloaddition between aryl ynol ethers (aryl ketene precursors), and the following benzannulation enabled the rapid construction of the carbazole cole of dictyodendrins F, H and I. The successful usage of Danheiser benzannulation allows Zhang and Ready to achieve the so-far shortest synthesis of dictyodendrin natural products. 989x989px  References  Category:Organic reactions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Danheiser benzannulation"},{"id":"44503217","text":"Bao or Pao is the pinyin romanization of two Chinese surnames, ÂåÖ () and ÈÆë/È≤ç ().

Lawrence Park is located in Chantilly, Virginia, just north of Centreville, on Route 28. The park preserves the cultural and natural resources of western Fairfax County and has a long and complex history lasting 8,000 years. The land was originally inhabited by Native Americans, but as Europeans settled in Virginia, the land was shaped by only three families: the Browns, Machens and Lawrences. Through these periods, the land was used as a tenant farm, family homestead, and country estate until it was deeded to Fairfax County Park Authority as a 640-acre nature park in 1971. On the eastern side of Route 28, visitors can learn about the site‚Äôs natural and cultural history at Walney Visitor Center, where visitors can see the park‚Äôs several significant structures including Walney, an 18th-century farmhouse, and 19th century outbuildings and features, including a smokehouse, dairy, ice house and ice pond remnants. Cabell's Mill and Middlegate stand in the southeastern end of the park. Middlegate is an early 19th-century stone house associated with Cabell‚Äôs Mill, which was built in the 18th century. Cabell's Mill is a popular setting for weddings and is available for rent through the Fairfax County Park Authority. Middlegate is used for park administrative offices. Approximately four miles of mostly earthen trails are accessible from the Visitor Center, the pond, Cabell's Mill and the park's northern terminus on Poplar Tree Road. The trails pass through the park's diverse habitats and are popular with birders, runners, dog walkers, and families. Trail maps are available at the Walney Visitor Center. Bicycles are not permitted on most park trails except the paved or gravel Big Rocky Run Stream Trail, which begins near Cabell's Mill and ends at the Fairfax County Parkway. Fishing under state regulations and licensing is permitted in the pond and Big Rocky Run. On the western site of Route 28, the park houses playgrounds, athletic fields (including soccer, baseball, and softball fields), and a fitness trail with stations. History =Brown family= In 1739, Willoughby Newton purchased a series of properties surrounding the Centreville area totaling to 2,500 acres. Newton never settled in western Fairfax County, but instead leased the property to tenant farmers. Thomas Brown received a ‚Äúthree-lives lease‚Äù from Willoughby Newton in 1742 for 150 acres. This meant his lease would be valid through his life, as well as that of his wife, Elizabeth, and first son, Joseph. Through the lease, Brown was required to have a 200-tree apple orchard and pay an annual rent of 530 pounds of dried and cured tobacco. Thomas Brown farmed tobacco as well as crops and vegetables to help support his family. As Brown worked the land, he began build up his wealth and purchased acres outside of his lease. By 1776, Thomas Brown and his youngest son Coleman had acquired some 630 acres, sold the ‚Äúthree-lives lease‚Äù and may have built the stone house that would become Walney Visitor Center. As tobacco depleted the soil, Thomas and Coleman switched from tobacco monoculture to mixed crops including wheat, corn, and rye. At Thomas Brown‚Äôs death in 1793, the property was given to his son Coleman who operated the farm until his death. Coleman left the bulk of the farm to the children of his daughter, Mary Lewis, with the expectation that it would be sold and the proceeds divided among them. But he stipulated that his wife Elizabeth be allowed to reside there for the remainder of her life. For the next ten years, until her death in 1840, Elizabeth had legal oversight of the farm. There are few records pertaining to this period. It is possible she turned over management to her son-in-law, Coleman Lewis. Advertisements for the sale of the farm noted the presence of tenant houses, so it may be that she left management to them. Whoever was responsible, the farm was in poor condition in 1843 when, following Elizabeth's death, it was sold to Lewis H. Machen, one of Thomas Brown's great-grandchildren. =Machen family= Lewis H. Machen In 1843 Lewis H. Machen purchased 725 acres from Coleman Brown's grandchildren for $10,879 and moved to the property with his wife Caroline, daughter Emmeline, and sons Arthur and James. The Machens moved into a framed house that was located near the stone house that still remains on the property. Lewis Machen had a large and valuable collection of books and he converted the small stone house into a library and study. Lewis Machen was not a farmer, but instead served as a clerk for the United States Senate. Lewis was aware that maintaining his position required a political adroitness that did not come easily to him. He hoped the farm would be a source of economic security for him and his family when he chose to retire, or if he lost his position. The Machens also expected that the sale of their home in Washington would help to pay for the farm. Unfortunately, no one was interested in buying the DC property. As a result, Machen was forced to rely on his Senate income to maintain the farm and he remained in DC much of the time, leaving the farm in the care of his wife and two sons. The farm was in poor condition when it was purchased, but Lewis had an avid interest in revitalizing the farm and making it profitable. A participant of the scientific farming movement of the 1840s and 1850s, Lewis experimented with crop rotation and the use of fertilizer including Peruvian guano. Because Lewis was not always on the farm, he wrote extensive letters giving directions to Arthur and James and kept records of the farm in workbooks. These workbooks contain detailed information about the operation of the farm including what tasks were completed each day, who completed them, and what the weather was. The eldest son, Arthur, lived at Walney in his teen years, operating the farm alongside his brother James. It was Arthur who named the farm Walney, a name that referred to the walnut trees that grew in front of the house. Arthur did not, however, have much interest in farming. He was a scholar and entered Harvard Law School in 1849 and settled in Baltimore, Maryland as a lawyer. On the farm, the Machens grew a variety of crops for market or to supply the needs of farm animals, including oats and wheat, corn, radishes and potatoes. They also raised cattle, sheep, and milk cows for market as well as personal use. The Machens also had a kitchen vegetable garden, chickens and hogs which they harvested for their own use. In the winter of 1853, the Machens constructed an ice pond and ice house to harvest and store their own ice. To help them manage the farm, the Machens hired white farmhands and rented enslaved African Americans from slave-owners. In 1859, Lewis finally retired from service as a clerk for the United States Senate. However, Lewis was not able to have a peaceful retirement with the coming of the American Civil War. =American Civil War= Map of the Battle of Chantilly (also known as the Battle of Ox Hill) on September 1, 1862, depicting events from 5 to 10 PM. Walney witnessed extensive troop movement during the American Civil War due to its proximity to Washington D.C. In the winter of 1861-1862, over 40,000 troops camped in the Centreville area, cutting down local trees for firewood, fortifications and shelter, damaging woods, fields, and gardens. During this winter, Walney was used to house a few of the sick soldiers in the area to be cared for by the Machen women. In August 1862, directly following the Battle of Second Manassas, Walney was right in the path of the Union retreat. Union soldiers passed through Walney and stole oxen, horses, food and supplies. They also plundered the stone house and tried to break into the frame house in which Lewis Machen was lying ill. Union soldiers were stopped from entering by Caroline Machen, who stood, barricading the door, until a passing Union officer ordered the men away and stopped the assault. The next day, on September 1st, 1862, the Battle of Ox Hill occurred on a portion of the property in the Machen‚Äôs cornfield. Despite the troop movements and action seen during the war, Walney survived with less property loss than many of the neighboring farms. However, the war had taken a toll on the Machens. Lewis Machen died in 1863, shortly after leaving Walney to take refuge in Baltimore with Arthur. Caroline and daughter Emmeline would remain in Baltimore for the rest of their lives, returning to Walney only for family visits. James returned from service with the Confederate Army to try to rebuild his family's farm despite the losses of war. =Postbellum= James Machen took over Walney after the war. He struggled to replace animals and equipment that had been lost during the war. In December 1874, a faulty chimney caused the frame house in which James and his family lived to burn, forcing James to move his family into the stone house after renovations in 1875. But James persevered and transformed the farm from growing crops to a dairy farm. By 1880, James was producing 3000 pounds of butter a year. In 1881 he expanded his dairy and began to produce cheese as well as butter. As James grew older he began to abandon farming. While historians do not know for certain why James did this, contributing factors could be the death of his wife Georgie in 1895, or the fact that none of his children were interested in taking over the farm. After James' death in 1913, his children rented the farm until the 1920s. Throughout this period, the farm deteriorated significantly and was abandoned until the 1930s. =Lawrence family= In 1935, Ellanor C. Lawrence purchased the property from Machen descendants for $16,500. Ellanor and her husband David Lawrence had lived in Washington D.C. since 1916. Her husband was a columnist and founder of U.S. News and World Report. Though the property would become part of their country estate and retreat from Washington D.C., the Lawrences rented the Walney stone house to various tenants and never lived there. In 1942, Ellanor purchased the adjoining Cabell‚Äôs Mill property, increasing her landholdings by 20 acres. The Lawrences lived at Middlegate, which had been the miller's house, when staying at their Walney estate. Both Cabell's Mill and Middlegate remain as features of Ellanor C. Lawrence Park. Ellanor made several changes to the old Walney farm. She tore down several of the original farm and tenant structures and renovated the Walney house and Middlegate. She was also an avid gardener and added landscape features and flowers, many of which were imported from Japan. Old farm field and pastures were left to return to wild fields and forests. When Ellanor C. Lawrence died in 1969, she willed the property to her husband with the intent that it be given to a public agency so that its natural and cultural resources could be preserved. In 1971, David Lawrence deeded 640 acres including Walney and Cabell‚Äôs Mill to the Fairfax County Park Authority in memory of Ellanor. In 1982, the little stone house that was built by the Browns, had housed the Machen library, and was James' home, became the Walney Visitor Center, interpreting the site‚Äôs natural and cultural history and greeting visitors who visit the park. =Chain of title= NORTH OF ROCKY RUN 1728 Richard Brett/Britt granted land north of Rocky Run circa 1739 Scarlett and Lettice Hancock inherit from Brett/Britt 1741 John Hancock inherits from Scarlett Hancock 1761 Thomas Brown purchases from John Hancock 1769 Coleman Brown purchases from Lettice Hancock Langfitt 1793 Coleman Brown inherits from Thomas Brown 1830 children of Mary Lewis inherit from Coleman Brown, except 2 acres & house granted to Mary Lewis 1843 Lewis Machen purchases from children of Mary Lewis, includes Mary Lewis 2 acres & house 1863 James, Arthur, and Emmeline inherit from Lewis Machen 1935 Ellanor C.

Sida Miscellany 14 The species was first collected in May 1985 in the southern part of the northern peninsula of Baja California, about 100 km north of Guerrero Negro, 400 meters inland from the ocean on rocky walls with a northern exposure in a narrow estuary. The type is from the same locality but collected one year later, 19 May 1986. Distinguishing features Vermilacinia ligulata is distinguished by its thallus divided into relatively few basal branches, generally less than 10, although it may appear to have more by its gregarious habit, and by lacking a blackened base, not reaching more than 3 cm in height, appearing strongly crinkled and twisted with wavy branch margins (when dry), and by having lichen substances of triterpenes, referred to as T1 and T2, along with zeorin and (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane; T3, which occurs in most related species, was not noted. Salazinic acid and usnic acid were also not reported. The branches are often partly tubular near base, and strap shaped above, initially creeping along the substrate for a short distance before ascending upwards, and frequently divided more or less in a digitate (palmate) fashion.

These species are distinguished by the presence or absence of chondroid strands in the medulla, and by their chemistry, N. contorta has divaricatic acid and triterpenes not found in Vermilacinia. Taxonomic History Vermilacinia ligulata is only known from collections made by Richard Spjut during the years 1985‚Äì1996.

Vermilacinia laevigata differs by its larger thallus that often has blackened parts, is more uniformly compressed with blade-like branches that are mostly simple, and by the presence of the T3 compound, instead of the T1 and T2 triterpenes, and is geographically confined to the California Floristic Province. The triterpenes of V. ligulata, commonly referred to as T1 and T2 by their Rf values on thin-layer chromatography plates, have formulas of C30H50O2 (T1) and C30H50OO (T2) as determined by mass spectrometry of a sample of V. reptilioderma. They are known from several other species, all endemic to the central region of Baja California.

Such an impact can release the equivalent energy of several million nuclear weapons detonating simultaneously. Badlands near Drumheller, Alberta, where erosion has exposed the K‚ÄìPg boundary A Wyoming rock with an intermediate claystone layer that contains 1,000 times more iridium than the upper and lower layers. Picture taken at the San Diego Natural History Museum. Complex Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene clay layer (gray) in the Geulhemmergroeve tunnels near Geulhem, The Netherlands. (Finger is below the actual Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary) The Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene (K‚ÄìPg) extinction event, also known as the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary extinction, was a sudden mass extinction of three-quarters of the plant and animal species on Earth, approximately 66 million years ago. With the exception of some ectothermic species such as the sea turtles and crocodilians, no tetrapods weighing more than survived. It marked the end of the Cretaceous period, and with it the end of the entire Mesozoic Era, opening the Cenozoic Era that continues today. In the geologic record, the K‚ÄìPg event is marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K‚ÄìPg boundary, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks. The boundary clay shows high levels of the metal iridium, which is rare in the Earth's crust, but abundant in asteroids. As originally proposed in 1980 by a team of scientists led by Luis Alvarez and his son Walter, it is now generally thought that the K‚ÄìPg extinction was caused by the impact of a massive comet or asteroid , 66 million years ago, which devastated the global environment, mainly through a lingering impact winter which halted photosynthesis in plants and plankton. The impact hypothesis, also known as the Alvarez hypothesis, was bolstered by the discovery of the Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula in the early 1990s, which provided conclusive evidence that the K‚ÄìPg boundary clay represented debris from an asteroid impact. The fact that the extinctions occurred simultaneously provides strong evidence that they were caused by the asteroid. A 2016 drilling project into the Chicxulub peak ring confirmed that the peak ring comprised granite ejected within minutes from deep in the earth, but contained hardly any gypsum, the usual sulfate-containing sea floor rock in the region: The gypsum would have vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere, causing longer-term effects on the climate and food chain. In October 2019, researchers reported that the event rapidly acidified the oceans, producing ecological collapse and, in this way as well, produced long-lasting effects on the climate, and accordingly was a key reason for the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. In January 2020, scientists reported new evidence that the extinction event was mostly a result of the meteorite impact and not volcanism. Other causal or contributing factors to the extinction may have been the Deccan Traps and other volcanic eruptions, climate change, and sea level change. A wide range of species perished in the K‚ÄìPg extinction, the best-known being the non-avian dinosaurs. It also destroyed a myriad of other terrestrial organisms, including some mammals, birds, lizards, insects, plants, and all the pterosaurs. In the oceans, the K‚ÄìPg extinction killed off plesiosaurs and mosasaurs and devastated teleost fish, sharks, mollusks (especially ammonites, which became extinct), and many species of plankton. It is estimated that 75% or more of all species on Earth vanished. Yet the extinction also provided evolutionary opportunities: In its wake, many groups underwent remarkable adaptive radiation ‚Äî sudden and prolific divergence into new forms and species within the disrupted and emptied ecological niches. Mammals in particular diversified in the Paleogene, evolving new forms such as horses, whales, bats, and primates. The surviving group of dinosaurs were avians, ground and water fowl who radiated into all modern species of bird. Teleost fish, and perhaps lizards also radiated. Extinction patterns The K‚ÄìPg extinction event was severe, global, rapid, and selective, eliminating a vast number of species. Based on marine fossils, it is estimated that 75% or more of all species were made extinct. The event appears to have affected all continents at the same time. Non-avian dinosaurs, for example, are known from the Maastrichtian of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and Antarctica, but are unknown from the Cenozoic anywhere in the world. Similarly, fossil pollen shows devastation of the plant communities in areas as far apart as New Mexico, Alaska, China, and New Zealand. Despite the event's severity, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the ground. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on detritus (dead plant and animal matter). In stream communities, few animal groups became extinct, because such communities rely less directly on food from living plants, and more on detritus washed in from the land, protecting them from extinction. Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the water column than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton, while animals on the ocean floor always or sometimes feed on detritus. Coccolithophorids and mollusks (including ammonites, rudists, freshwater snails, and mussels), and those organisms whose food chain included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary. The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, crocodyliforms and champsosaurs, were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous. After the K‚ÄìPg extinction event, biodiversity required substantial time to recover, despite the existence of abundant vacant ecological niches. =Microbiota= The K‚ÄìPg boundary represents one of the most dramatic turnovers in the fossil record for various calcareous nanoplankton that formed the calcium deposits for which the Cretaceous is named. The turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level. Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions than by a decrease in speciation. The K‚ÄìPg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood, mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, which likely causes diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer. Radiolaria have left a geological record since at least the Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K‚ÄìPg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene, a significant turnover in species but not a catastrophic extinction. The occurrence of planktonic foraminifera across the K‚ÄìPg boundary has been studied since the 1930s. Research spurred by the possibility of an impact event at the K‚ÄìPg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at the boundary; there is ongoing debate between groups which think the evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the K‚ÄìPg boundary, and those who think the evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the boundary. Numerous species of benthic foraminifera became extinct during the event, presumably because they depend on organic debris for nutrients, while biomass in the ocean is thought to have decreased. As the marine microbiota recovered, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. Phytoplankton recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early Paleocene. Retrieved 2007-08-19. = Marine invertebrates = Discoscaphites iris ammonite from the Owl Creek Formation (Upper Cretaceous), Owl Creek, Ripley, Mississippi There is significant variation in the fossil record as to the extinction rate of marine invertebrates across the K‚ÄìPg boundary. The apparent rate is influenced by a lack of fossil records, rather than extinctions. Ostracods, a class of small crustaceans that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits in a variety of locations. A review of these fossils shows that ostracod diversity was lower in the Paleocene than any other time in the Cenozoic. Current research cannot ascertain whether the extinctions occurred prior to, or during, the boundary interval. Approximately 60% of late- Cretaceous Scleractinia coral genera failed to cross the K‚ÄìPg boundary into the Paleocene. Further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow tropical waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the photic zone) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Colonial coral species rely upon symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K‚ÄìPg boundary, but the use of data from coral fossils to support K‚ÄìPg extinction and subsequent Paleocene recovery, must be weighed against the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the K‚ÄìPg boundary. The numbers of cephalopod, echinoderm, and bivalve genera exhibited significant diminution after the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Most species of brachiopods, a small phylum of marine invertebrates, survived the K‚ÄìPg extinction event and diversified during the early Paleocene. Rudist bivalves from the Late Cretaceous of the Omani Mountains, United Arab Emirates. Scale bar is 10 mm. Except for nautiloids (represented by the modern order Nautilida) and coleoids (which had already diverged into modern octopodes, squids, and cuttlefish) all other species of the molluscan class Cephalopoda became extinct at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. These included the ecologically significant belemnoids, as well as the ammonoids, a group of highly diverse, numerous, and widely distributed shelled cephalopods. Researchers have pointed out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving nautiloids, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in outsurviving their ammonoid counterparts through the extinction event. The ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction (numerous eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have been devastated by the K‚ÄìPg extinction event. Additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota, nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids. Approximately 35% of echinoderm genera became extinct at the K‚ÄìPg boundary, although taxa that thrived in low-latitude, shallow-water environments during the late Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid- latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. The pattern of extinction points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of carbonate platforms, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event. Other invertebrate groups, including rudists (reef-building clams) and inoceramids (giant relatives of modern scallops), also became extinct at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. =Fish= There are substantial fossil records of jawed fishes across the K‚ÄìPg boundary, which provide good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates. While the deep sea realm was able to remain seemingly unaffected, there was an equal loss between the open marine apex predators and the durophagous demersal feeders on the continental shelf. Within cartilaginous fish, approximately 7 out of the 41 families of neoselachians (modern sharks, skates, and rays) disappeared after this event and batoids (skates and rays) lost nearly all the identifiable species, while more than 90% of teleost fish (bony fish) families survived. In the Maastrichtian age, 28 shark families and 13 batoid families thrived, of which 25 and 9, respectively, survived the K‚ÄìT boundary event. Forty-seven of all neoselachian genera cross the K‚ÄìT boundary, with 85% being sharks. Batoids display with 15% a comparably low survival rate. There is evidence of a mass extinction of bony fishes at a fossil site immediately above the K‚ÄìPg boundary layer on Seymour Island near Antarctica, apparently precipitated by the K‚ÄìPg extinction event; the marine and freshwater environments of fishes mitigated the environmental effects of the extinction event. =Terrestrial invertebrates= Insect damage to the fossilized leaves of flowering plants from fourteen sites in North America was used as a proxy for insect diversity across the K‚ÄìPg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction. Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity. During the early Paleocene, flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects, even 1.7 million years after the extinction event. =Terrestrial plants= There is overwhelming evidence of global disruption of plant communities at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Extinctions are seen both in studies of fossil pollen, and fossil leaves. In North America, the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the K‚ÄìPg boundary sections, although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary. In North America, approximately 57% of plant species became extinct. In high southern hemisphere latitudes, such as New Zealand and Antarctica, the mass die-off of flora caused no significant turnover in species, but dramatic and short-term changes in the relative abundance of plant groups. In some regions, the Paleocene recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species, represented as a fern spike in the geologic record; this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. Due to the wholesale destruction of plants at the K‚ÄìPg boundary, there was a proliferation of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, that do not require photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, initially ferns and other ground-level plants, returned. Just two species of fern appear to have dominated the landscape for centuries after the event. Polyploidy appears to have enhanced the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact. =Fungi= While it appears that many fungi were wiped out at the KT boundary, it's noteworthy that evidence has been found of a \\"world of fungus\\" dominating for a few years after the event. Microfossils from that period indicate a great increase in fungal spores, long before the resumption of plentiful fern spores in the recovery after the impact. Monoporisporites and hypha are almost exclusive microfossils for a short span during and after the iridium boundary. These saprophytes would not need sunlight, during the period where the atmosphere may have been clogged with dust and sulfur aerosols. This \\"fungal world\\" appears to happen during many such extinction events, including the Permian- Triassic boundary, the largest known in earth's history, losing 90% of all species. = Amphibians = There is limited evidence for extinction of amphibians at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. A study of fossil vertebrates across the K‚ÄìPg boundary in Montana concluded that no species of amphibian became extinct. Yet there are several species of Maastrichtian amphibian, not included as part of this study, which are unknown from the Paleocene. These include the frog Theatonius lancensis and the albanerpetontid Albanerpeton galaktion; therefore, some amphibians do seem to have become extinct at the boundary. The relatively low levels of extinction seen among amphibians probably reflect the low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals. =Non-archosaurs= Turtles More than 80% of Cretaceous turtle species passed through the K‚ÄìPg boundary. All six turtle families in existence at the end of the Cretaceous survived into the Paleogene and are represented by living species. Lepidosauria The living non-archosaurian reptile taxa, lepidosaurians (snakes, lizards and tuataras), survived across the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Living lepidosaurs include the tuataras (the only living rhynchocephalians) and the squamates. The rhynchocephalians were a widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurians during the early Mesozoic, but began to decline by the mid-Cretaceous, although they were very successful in the Late Cretaceous of South America. They are represented today by a single genus, located exclusively in New Zealand. Kronosaurus Hunt, a rendering by Dmitry Bogdanov in 2008. Large marine reptiles, including plesiosaurians such as these, became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. The order Squamata, which is represented today by lizards, snakes and amphisbaenians (worm lizards), radiated into various ecological niches during the Jurassic and was successful throughout the Cretaceous. They survived through the K‚ÄìPg boundary and are currently the most successful and diverse group of living reptiles, with more than 6,000 extant species. Many families of terrestrial squamates became extinct at the boundary, such as monstersaurians and polyglyphanodonts, and fossil evidence indicates they suffered very heavy losses in the K‚ÄìT event, only recovering 10 million years after it. Non-archosaurian marine reptiles Giant non- archosaurian aquatic reptiles such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, which were the top marine predators of their time, became extinct by the end of the Cretaceous. The ichthyosaurs had disappeared from fossil records before the mass extinction occurred. =Archosaurs= The archosaur clade includes two surviving groups, crocodilians and birds, along with the various extinct groups of non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs. Crocodyliforms Ten families of crocodilians or their close relatives are represented in the Maastrichtian fossil records, of which five died out prior to the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Five families have both Maastrichtian and Paleocene fossil representatives. All of the surviving families of crocodyliforms inhabited freshwater and terrestrial environments‚Äîexcept for the Dyrosauridae, which lived in freshwater and marine locations. Approximately 50% of crocodyliform representatives survived across the K‚ÄìPg boundary, the only apparent trend being that no large crocodiles survived. Crocodyliform survivability across the boundary may have resulted from their aquatic niche and ability to burrow, which reduced susceptibility to negative environmental effects at the boundary. Jouve and colleagues suggested in 2008 that juvenile marine crocodyliforms lived in freshwater environments as do modern marine crocodile juveniles, which would have helped them survive where other marine reptiles became extinct; freshwater environments were not so strongly affected by the K‚ÄìPg extinction event as marine environments were. Pterosaurs One family of pterosaurs, Azhdarchidae, was definitely present in the Maastrichtian, and it likely became extinct at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. These large pterosaurs were the last representatives of a declining group that contained ten families during the mid-Cretaceous. Several other pterosaur lineages may have been present during the Maastrichtian, such as the ornithocheirids, pteranodontids, nyctosaurids, as well as a possible tapejarid, though they are represented by fragmentary remains that are difficult to assign to any given group. While this was occurring, modern birds were undergoing diversification; traditionally it was thought that they replaced archaic birds and pterosaur groups, possibly due to direct competition, or they simply filled empty niches, but there is no correlation between pterosaur and avian diversities that are conclusive to a competition hypothesis, and small pterosaurs were present in the Late Cretaceous. At least some niches previously held by birds were reclaimed by pterosaurs prior to the K‚ÄìPg event. Birds Most paleontologists regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs (see Origin of birds). It is thought that all non-avian theropods became extinct, including then-flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and hesperornithiforms. Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K‚ÄìPg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and ratite bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs. Large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K‚ÄìPg boundary. The absence of these birds in the Paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there. The most successful and dominant group of avialans, enantiornithes, were wiped out. Only a small fraction of ground and water- dwelling Cretaceous bird species survived the impact, giving rise to today's birds. The only bird group known for certain to have survived the K‚ÄìPg boundary is the Aves. Avians may have been able to survive the extinction as a result of their abilities to dive, swim, or seek shelter in water and marshlands. Many species of avians can build burrows, or nest in tree holes, or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. The open niche space and relative scarcity of predators following the K-Pg extinction allowed for adaptive radiation of various avian groups. Ratites, for example, rapidly diversified in the early Paleogene and are believed to have convergently developed flightlessness at least three to six times, often fulfilling the niche space for large herbivores once occupied by non-avian dinosaurs. Non-avian dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus was among the dinosaurs living on Earth before the extinction. Excluding a few controversial claims, scientists agree that all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record has been interpreted to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity during the last few million years of the Cretaceous, and it may be that the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options. There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply. The growing consensus about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see dinosaur physiology) helps to understand their full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the crocodilians. Ectothermic (\\"cold- blooded\\") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating), while endothermic (\\"warm-blooded\\") animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non- avian dinosaurs died out, while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch. Whether the extinction occurred gradually or suddenly has been debated, as both views have support from the fossil record. A study of 29 fossil sites in Catalan Pyrenees of Europe in 2010 supports the view that dinosaurs there had great diversity until the asteroid impact, with more than 100 living species. More recent research indicates that this figure is obscured by taphonomic biases and the sparsity of the continental fossil record. The results of this study, which were based on estimated real global biodiversity, showed that between 628 and 1,078 non- avian dinosaur species were alive at the end of the Cretaceous and underwent sudden extinction after the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. Alternatively, interpretation based on the fossil-bearing rocks along the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada, supports the gradual extinction of non-avian dinosaurs; during the last 10 million years of the Cretaceous layers there, the number of dinosaur species seems to have decreased from about 45 to approximately 12. Other scientists have made the same assessment following their research. Several researchers support the existence of Paleocene non- avian dinosaurs. Evidence of this existence is based on the discovery of dinosaur remains in the Hell Creek Formation up to above and 40,000 years later than the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Pollen samples recovered near a fossilized hadrosaur femur recovered in the Ojo Alamo Sandstone at the San Juan River in Colorado, indicate that the animal lived during the Cenozoic, approximately (about 1 million years after the K‚ÄìPg extinction event). If their existence past the K‚ÄìPg boundary can be confirmed, these hadrosaurids would be considered a dead clade walking. The scientific consensus is that these fossils were eroded from their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments (also known as reworked fossils). Choristodere The choristoderes (semi-aquatic archosauromorphs) survived across the K‚ÄìPg boundary but would die out in the early Miocene. Studies on Champsosaurus palatal teeth suggest that there were dietary changes among the various species across the KT event. = Mammals = All major Cretaceous mammalian lineages, including monotremes (egg-laying mammals), multituberculates, metatherians, eutherians, dryolestoideans, and gondwanatheres survived the K‚ÄìPg extinction event, although they suffered losses. In particular, metatherians largely disappeared from North America, and the Asian deltatheroidans became extinct (aside from the lineage leading to Gurbanodelta). In the Hell Creek beds of North America, at least half of the ten known multituberculate species and all eleven metatherians species are not found above the boundary. Multituberculates in Europe and North America survived relatively unscathed and quickly bounced back in the Paleocene, but Asian forms were devastated, never again to represent a significant component of mammalian fauna. A recent study indicates that metatherians suffered the heaviest losses at the K‚ÄìPg event, followed by multituberculates, while eutherians recovered the quickest. Mammalian species began diversifying approximately 30 million years prior to the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Diversification of mammals stalled across the boundary. Current research indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K‚ÄìPg boundary, despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs. Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K‚ÄìPg boundary, including Chiroptera (bats) and Cetartiodactyla (a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and even-toed ungulates), although recent research concludes that only marsupial orders diversified soon after the K‚ÄìPg boundary. K‚ÄìPg boundary mammalian species were generally small, comparable in size to rats; this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments. It is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K‚ÄìPg boundary environmental stresses.  Evidence  = North American fossils = Hell Creek Formation In North American terrestrial sequences, the extinction event is best represented by the marked discrepancy between the rich and relatively abundant late-Maastrichtian pollen record and the post-boundary fern spike. At present the most informative sequence of dinosaur-bearing rocks in the world from the K‚ÄìPg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana. Comparison with the older Judith River Formation (Montana) and Dinosaur Park Formation (Alberta), which both date from approximately 75 Ma, provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10 million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent. The middle‚Äìlate Campanian formations show a greater diversity of dinosaurs than any other single group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: Tyrannosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, and Torosaurus, which suggests food was plentiful immediately prior to the extinction. In addition to rich dinosaur fossils, there are also plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K‚ÄìPg boundary. In the sediments below the K‚ÄìPg boundary the dominant plant remains are angiosperm pollen grains, but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores. More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants. = Marine fossils = The mass extinction of marine plankton appears to have been abrupt and right at the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Ammonite genera became extinct at or near the K‚ÄìPg boundary; there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K‚ÄìPg boundary, and a small, gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous. Further analysis shows that several processes were in progress in the late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction. The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K‚ÄìPg boundary increased in temperature. The temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65.4‚Äì65.2 million years ago, which is very near the time of the extinction event. Not only did the climate temperature increase, but the water temperature decreased, causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity. = Megatsunamis = The scientific consensus is that the asteroid impact at the K‚ÄìPg boundary left megatsunami deposits and sediments around the area of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, from the colossal waves created by the impact. These deposits have been identified in the La Popa basin in northeastern Mexico, platform carbonates in northeastern Brazil, in Atlantic deep-sea sediments, and in the form of the thickest-known layer of graded sand deposits, around , in the Chicxulub crater itself, directly above the shocked granite ejecta. The megatsunami has been estimated at more than tall, as the asteroid fell into relatively shallow seas; in deep seas it would have been tall. = Fossils in sedimentary rocks deposited during the impact= Fossiliferous sedimentary rocks deposited during the K‚ÄìPg impact have been found in the Gulf of Mexico area, including tsunami wash deposits carrying remains of a mangrove-type ecosystem, evidence that after the impact water sloshed back and forth repeatedly in the Gulf of Mexico, and dead fish left in shallow water but not disturbed by scavengers.  Duration  The rapidity of the extinction is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes imply a rapid extinction over a relatively short period (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others imply longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the Signor‚ÄìLipps effect; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found. Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K‚ÄìPg extinction to a few million years after it. The sedimentation rate and thickness of K‚ÄìPg clay from three sites suggest rapid extinction, perhaps less than 10,000 years. At one site in the Denver Basin of Colorado, the 'fern spike' lasted about 1,000 years (no more than 71 thousand years); the earliest Cenozoic mammals appeared about 185,000 years (no more than 570,000 years) after the K‚ÄìPg boundary layer was deposited. In some remote locations such as New Zealand, dinosaurs may have survived for several million years after the impact.  Chicxulub impact  = Evidence for impact = In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160, and 20 times in three sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in Earth's crust because it is a siderophile element which mostly sank along with iron into Earth's core during planetary differentiation. As iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth at the time of the K‚ÄìPg boundary. There were earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event, but this was the first hard evidence. The K‚ÄìPg boundary exposure in Trinidad Lake State Park, in the Raton Basin of Colorado, shows an abrupt change from dark- to light-colored rock. White line added to mark the transition. This hypothesis was viewed as radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay was found to be full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. Shocked quartzShocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures as in nuclear blasts and meteorite impacts. and other minerals were also identified in the K‚ÄìPg boundary. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean provided more evidence, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby‚Äîas did the discovery that the K‚ÄìPg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico. Radar topography reveals the -wide ring of the Chicxulub Crater. Further research identified the giant Chicxulub crater, buried under Chicxulub on the coast of Yucat√°n, as the source of the K‚ÄìPg boundary clay. Identified in 1990 based on work by geophysicist Glen Penfield in 1978, the crater is oval, with an average diameter of roughly , about the size calculated by the Alvarez team. The discovery of the crater‚Äîa prediction of the impact hypothesis‚Äîprovided conclusive evidence for a K‚ÄìPg impact, and strengthened the hypothesis that it caused the extinction. In a 2013 paper, Paul Renne of the Berkeley Geochronology Center dated the impact at years ago, based on argon‚Äìargon dating. He further posits that the mass extinction occurred within 32,000 years of this date. In 2007, it was proposed that the impactor belonged to the Baptistina family of asteroids. This link has been doubted, though not disproved, in part because of a lack of observations of the asteroid and its family. It was reported in 2009 that 298 Baptistina does not share the chemical signature of the K‚ÄìPg impactor. Further, a 2011 Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) study of reflected light from the asteroids of the family estimated their break-up at 80 Ma, giving them insufficient time to shift orbits and impact Earth by 66 Ma. = Effects of impact = In , an international panel of 41 scientists reviewed 20 years of scientific literature and endorsed the asteroid hypothesis, specifically the Chicxulub impact, as the cause of the extinction, ruling out other theories such as massive volcanism. They had determined that a asteroid hurtled into Earth at Chicxulub on Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula. The collision would have released the same energy as ‚Äîmore than a billion times the energy of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Chicxulub impact caused a global catastrophe. Some of the phenomena were brief occurrences immediately following the impact, but there were also long-term geochemical and climatic disruptions that devastated the ecology. The re-entry of ejecta into Earth's atmosphere would include a brief (hours-long) but intense pulse of infrared radiation, cooking exposed organisms. This is debated, with opponents arguing that local ferocious fires, probably limited to North America, fall short of global firestorms. This is the \\"Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene firestorm debate\\". A paper in 2013 by a prominent modeler of nuclear winter suggested that, based on the amount of soot in the global debris layer, the entire terrestrial biosphere might have burned, implying a global soot-cloud blocking out the sun and creating an impact winter effect. Aside from the hypothesized fire and/or impact winter effects, the impact would have created a dust cloud that blocked sunlight for up to a year, inhibiting photosynthesis. The asteroid hit an area of carbonate rock containing a large amount of combustible hydrocarbons and sulphur, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused acid rain. The resulting acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that grow shells of calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the sea surface temperature dropped as much as for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and subsequently herbivores and their predators. Creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival. Freezing temperatures probably lasted for at least three years. If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary greenhouse effect once the dust clouds and aerosol settled; this would have exterminated the most vulnerable organisms that survived the period immediately after the impact. Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth at approximately the end of the Cretaceous, but there was still an ongoing dispute for some time on whether the impact was the sole cause of the extinctions. There is evidence that dinosaurs had been in decline for up to 50 million years already due to changing environmental factors.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science- environment-36073592 Several studies in 2020, like Hull et al. and Chiarenza et al. show quantitatively that the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene Mass Extinction about 66 million years ago was mostly a result of a meteorite impact (the Chicxulub impactor) and not a result of volcanism. The river bed at the Moody Creek Mine, 7 Mile Creek / Waimatuku, Dunollie, New Zealand contains evidence of a devastating event on terrestrial plant communities at the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary, confirming the severity and global nature of the event. =2016 Chicxulub crater drilling project= In 2016, a scientific drilling project obtained deep rock-core samples from the peak ring around the Chicxulub impact crater. The discoveries confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had been shocked by immense pressure and melted in just minutes from its usual state into its present form. Unlike sea-floor deposits, the peak ring was made of granite originating much deeper in the earth, which had been ejected to the surface by the impact. Gypsum is a sulfate-containing rock usually present in the shallow seabed of the region; it had been almost entirely removed, vaporized into the atmosphere. Further, the event was immediately followed by a megatsunamiA megatsunami is a massive movement of sea waters, which can reach inland tens or hundreds of kilometers. sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring. These findings strongly support the impact's role in the extinction event. The impactor was large enough to create a peak ring, to melt, shock, and eject deep granite, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted for several years. This worldwide dispersal of dust and sulfates would have affected climate catastrophically, led to large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain.  Alternative hypotheses  Although the concurrence of the end-Cretaceous extinctions with the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis, some scientists continue to support other contributing causes: volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events. The end-Cretaceous event is the only mass extinction known to be associated with an impact, and other large impacts, such as the Manicouagan Reservoir impact, do not coincide with any noticeable extinction events. = Deccan Traps = Before 2000, arguments that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 Mya and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted over a period of only 800,000 years spanning the K‚ÄìPg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter. The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere. In the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (d. 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. Even Walter Alvarez acknowledged that other major changes may have contributed to the extinctions. Combining these theories, some geophysical models suggest that the impact contributed to the Deccan Traps. These models, combined with high-precision radiometric dating, suggest that the Chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest Deccan eruptions, as well as eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on Earth. = Multiple impact event = Other crater-like topographic features have also been proposed as impact craters formed in connection with Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction. This suggests the possibility of near-simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object similar to the Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9 impact with Jupiter. In addition to the Chicxulub crater, there is the Boltysh crater in Ukraine (), the Silverpit crater in the North Sea () possibly formed by bolide impact, and the controversial and much larger Shiva crater. Any other craters that might have formed in the Tethys Ocean would have been obscured by the northward tectonic drift of Africa and India. = Maastrichtian sea-level regression = There is clear evidence that sea levels fell in the final stage of the Cretaceous by more than at any other time in the Mesozoic era. In some Maastrichtian stage rock layers from various parts of the world, the later layers are terrestrial; earlier layers represent shorelines and the earliest layers represent seabeds. These layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with mountain building, therefore the likeliest explanation is a regression, a drop in sea level. There is no direct evidence for the cause of the regression, but the currently accepted explanation is that the mid-ocean ridges became less active and sank under their own weight. A severe regression would have greatly reduced the continental shelf area, the most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, but this change would not have caused the extinction of the ammonites. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and increasing global temperatures. Marine regression also resulted in the loss of epeiric seas, such as the Western Interior Seaway of North America. The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing coastal plains that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates, those that prefer marine environments, such as sharks, suffered. = Multiple causes = Proponents of multiple causation view the suggested single causes as either too small to produce the vast scale of the extinction, or not likely to produce its observed taxonomic pattern. In a review article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky discussed a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, as the largest vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already- stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. Recent work led by Sierra Peterson at Seymour Island, Antarctica, showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact. The team analyzed combined extinction patterns using a new clumped isotope temperature record from a hiatus-free, expanded K‚ÄìPg boundary section. They documented a 7.8¬±3.3 ¬∞C warming synchronous with the onset of Deccan Traps volcanism and a second, smaller warming at the time of meteorite impact. They suggest local warming may have been amplified due to simultaneous disappearance of continental or sea ice. Intra-shell variability indicates a possible reduction in seasonality after Deccan eruptions began, continuing through the meteorite event. Species extinction at Seymour Island occurred in two pulses that coincide with the two observed warming events, directly linking the end-Cretaceous extinction at this site to both volcanic and meteorite events via climate change.  Recovery and radiation  An artist's rendering of Thescelosaurus shortly after the K‚ÄìPg mass extinction. It survived by burrowing, but would soon die of starvation. The K‚ÄìPg extinction had a profound effect on the evolution of life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K‚ÄìPg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K‚ÄìPg boundary. Other groups also underwent major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K‚ÄìPg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, such as the herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes may have led to the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps to take the place of leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.

Instead, they imported crops from other regions or even other countries. In return, they would trade products they had to other countries. These products included fish, whale products, ships, timber products. Also, they traded furs and livestock products made from animals living in the surrounding forests. Using the large numbers of trees in the forest, people from New England worked at shipbuilding. People in New England cut down trees for lumber to build ships. They would then use them for fishing and hunting whales. That is also a factor that affected what goods people in New England would trade. There was much trade between New England and other regions or countries such as England. New England would export resources like fish and lumber to Africa, England, and the West Indies.

Some wealthy people worked in the city although most colonists were farmers. Because of fertile soil and a good growing season, most farmers grew enough for their family and a surplus, which they could sell. They grew wheat, grains, and many other things. New York and Philadelphia were the Middle Colonies' biggest cities. This was because they were the center of trade with all the harbors to import and export goods.

A predominant feature of the region is the Coastal Plain. This region had humid summers and temperate winters which are prime conditions for agriculture. Due to the climate of temperate summers, the grains were allowed to grow for longer periods of time. Up north, the winters were much too harsh to grow these grains. These grains were then exported to other Colonies due to its prime location to the ocean. The climate was prime for these grains which is a direct correlation to how geography relates to trade goods in the Middle Eastern Colonies.  Southern colonies  Location of Jamestown, Virginia The southern British colonies in North America were the Colony of Virginia, Province of North Carolina, Province of South Carolina, and Province of Georgia. The first successful English colony in N. America was Jamestown, established off the Chesapeake Bay in 1607. In 1668 King Charles II granted the Carolina charter to eight Lords Proprietor. Georgia was not established as a colony until 1732 under a charter granted to James Oglethorpe by King George II. = Geography = Located between 40 degrees and 30 degrees latitude, the physiographic makeup of the southern colonies is generally divided into three regions. The Atlantic Coastal Plain (divided into two parts; the Inner Coastal Plain and the Tidewater), Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge Mountains and Appalachian mountain regions.

It only has an intermittent flow and some of its waters drain into the Jeddo Tunnel instead of Black Creek. The creek is in the Eastern Middle Anthracite Field. There is at least one bridge crossing the creek. Course Little Black Creek begins at the confluence of two unnamed tributaries on the border between Hazle Township and Lattimer. It flows west and slightly south for more than a mile before turning south-southwest for some distance. By this point, the creek has begun to flow along the border between Hazle Township and Harleigh. After several tenths of a mile, the creek fully enters Hazle Township and crosses Pennsylvania Route 309. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Black Creek. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Little Black Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between and above sea level. Both the source and the mouth of the creek are in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Hazleton. The Jeddo Tunnel drains water from the Little Black Creek Coal Basin. Jeddo Tunnel A passes through this coal basin. Little Black Creek is one of four surface streams that successfully exits the Jeddo Tunnel basin. It is the third-largest of the streams that do so. Little Black Creek has been described by Bloomsburg University professor Duane Braun as having \\"sharp, multiple crest hydrography\\". The stream bed of the creek changes course at least fairly regularly. The creek is near the Woodside Coal Basin, which is a natural sub-basin that has been reclaimed. Coal basins are under 30 percent of the creek's drainage basin and the area in the vicinity of the creek has been heavily mined. Hydrology and watershed The Little Black Creek Coal Basin has an area of . Most of the watershed is in Hazle Township and Butler Township, but a small portion of the northeastern part of the watershed is in the borough of Freeland. The entirety of the watershed is within the Jeddo Tunnel drainage basin. The creek's watershed makes up 14 percent of the Jeddo Tunnel watershed. Most of the watershed of Little Black Creek is in the Eastern Middle Anthracite Field, which is part of the Anthracite Upland Section of the Ridge and Valley Province. The watershed of Little Black Creek is adjacent to the watersheds of Black Creek and Nescopeck Creek. The headwaters of Little Black Creek are east of Pardeesville and the mouth of the creek is near Hazleton. A pond is located in the upper reaches of the watershed. Little Black Creek does not perennially have any discharge. Instead, it has an intermittent or rare discharge. The runoff levels of the creek was measured six times between October 1997 and October 1998. The runoff was measured to be 0 all but two times. The remaining two times, the runoff was 1 cubic foot per second and 2.4 cubic feet per second. The Little Black Creek Coal Basin contributes 11.43 cubic feet per second of water to the Jeddo Tunnel's outflow. History The Nescopeck Path historically crossed Little Black Creek. A concrete slab bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 309 over Little Black Creek was built in 1928. It is long. There are plans to reestablish the channel of the creek or construct it from scratch in its upper reaches. There are ten mining permits in the Little Black Creek Coal Basin. The upper reaches of the creek has had its course altered by mining. Little Black Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on January 1, 1990.

It is sometimes known as the rose flower urchin or the pink flower urchin. Like the related flower urchin, they are venomous. Taxonomy Toxopneustes roseus is one of the four species in the genus Toxopneustes. It was first described by the American zoologist Alexander Emanuel Agassiz in 1863 as Boletia roseus. The generic name Toxopneustes literally means \\"poison breath\\", derived from Greek œÑŒøŒæŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ [œÜŒ¨œÅŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩ] (toksik√≥n [ph√°rmakon], \\"arrow [poison]\\") and œÄŒΩŒµœÖœÉœÑŒøœÇ (pneustos, \\"breath\\"). The specific name roseus means \\"rosy\\" in Latin. Though it does not have a widely used common name, it is sometimes known as the \\"rose flower urchin\\" or the \\"pink flower urchin\\". More commonly, it is simply called a \\"flower urchin\\", though that name strictly applies only to the related Indo- West Pacific species, Toxopneustes pileolus. Description Toxopneustes roseus is similar in appearance to the more widespread flower urchin, Toxopneustes pileolus. It can be distinguished by having a rigid \\"shell\\" (test) that is a solid pink, red, or purple in color, in contrast to the variegated coloration of the test of Toxopneustes pileolus. Like other members of the genus, its most conspicuous feature are its numerous pedicellariae (stalked grasping appendages) which gives it the appearance of being a cluster of flowers. Distribution Toxopneustes roseus is the only member of the genus found in the East Pacific. It can be found from Peru, up along the coast of Central America (including the Gulf of California), and as far north as California. They can also be found in the waters around the Galapagos Islands. They are common in coral reefs, rhodolith beds, and rocky environments, at depths of . They can also be found in sand and mud substrates. Ecology Toxopneustes roseus feeds almost exclusively on rhodoliths, a coralline algae. They are highly mobile. They move and feed throughout the day and night, though they seem to be more active at night. Toxopneustes roseus are among the numerous species of sea urchins known as \\"collector urchins\\", so named because they frequently cover the upper surfaces of their bodies with debris from their surroundings. This behavior is usually referred to as \\"covering\\" or \\"heaping\\". A 1998 study has postulated that the debris collected by the sea urchins may serve as ballast, preventing them from being swept away by wave surges when feeding Venom Like other members of the genus, Toxopneustes roseus is venomous. The flower-like pedicellariae can deliver a painful sting if touched.

The square is the location of two of Cardiff's few residential tower blocks, as well as shops, a pub, church, health centre and community centre. History During the 1840s the Marquess of Bute created the residential area of Butetown, to house workers for the new Cardiff Docks. After his death (in 1848), and the death in 1852 of the owner of a glassworks on the site, land was acquired between West Bute Street (to the east) and the Glamorganshire Canal (to the west) to create a large square of three-storey decorative houses.Evans, Dosworth, Barnett, Below the Bridge, p. 23 It was shown as \\"Luton Square\\" on an 1855 map. The square was a \\"jewell\\" in \\"perhaps the poshest place in town\\" surrounding a green, tranquil park with its houses home to shipwrights, mariners, merchants, brokers and builders. The area became highly multicultural, \\"one of the most colourful and cosmopolitan communities on Earth\\". By the 1880s the wealthier residents had moved away to the new suburbs. While the nearby Mount Stuart Square became the site for an impressive new Coal Exchange building, Loudoun Square became increasingly overcrowded as residents took in tenants to help pay the high rents.Evans, Dosworth, Barnett, Below the Bridge, pp. 43-44 The Loudoun Square area became known as \\"Tiger Bay\\", and the racial composition became even more diverse with the arrival of seafarers on the ships in the period before the Great War. 1960s redevelopment By the late 1940s the houses in Butetown were in extremely poor repair and the area was seen by the city authorities as a physical and moral slum.Evans, Dosworth, Barnett, Below the Bridge, pp. 54-55 It was decided to demolish the existing houses and replace them with modern residential tower blocks. Loudoun Square was the first area to be tackled and the nineteenth century housing was cleared in 1960. Residents of the Square were moved to new housing or decanted to Cardiff's suburban housing estates. Between 1960 and 1966 two 16-storey tower blocks, Loudoun House and Nelson House, were built on the centre of Loudoun Square. Recent events A new foyer, \\"hotel-style\\" concierge reception and garden area was created by Cardiff Council for Loudoun House and Nelson House in 2001, described by a resident as \\"similar to the St David's Hotel\\". In Summer 2010 work started to replace and improve the facilities in the square, with a ¬£13 million revamp led by Cardiff Community Housing Association. The new facilities would include a new shopping centre, community hub and a health centre, together with 13 new houses and 48 apartments to a BREEAM accredited eco-standard.

The film stars Patrick Stewart, Carla Gugino and Matthew Lillard. The film was released on January 14, 2015, by IFC Films. Plot The film revolves around Tobi, a middle-aged ex-dancer now working as a ballet instructor at the Juilliard School in New York City. He is asked for an interview by husband and wife Mike and Lisa, who claim they are preparing a dissertation on the dance community of the 1960s. Through the course of the interview, Mike's questions keep getting more and more personal. He finally reveals that he suspects that Tobi is his biological father, as indicated by Mike's mother on her deathbed. When Tobi denies this, Mike forcefully takes a DNA sample from Tobi and rushes to a police lab, where his friend Jim performs a DNA test. Outraged by Mike's violence, Lisa stays to help Tobi clean up the mess Mike made. She bonds with Tobi as a person and Tobi reveals that he knows he is Mike's father, but denied it out of shame. He had abandoned the boy for his career. He also reveals that he paid a part of Mike's college tuition for college. When Mike returns to take Lisa home, the three have an argument. Tobi tells Mike to treat his wife well. After further argument, in which Mike tells Tobi he chose to make his life so that no one loves him, the pair leave. Lisa convinces Tobi to tell Mike the truth. He also invites the pair for brunch the next day. On their way to Tobi's house the next morning, Mike is called by Jim, who tells him that the DNA was not a match. When Lisa and Mike tell Tobi this, he has a nervous breakdown, and politely asks them to let him be alone.

April 28, 1958) is an American Orthodox rabbi, an author and controversial leader in the Orthodox Jewish community. He has been a spokesman for the International Rabbinic Coalition for Israel.

For seven years, Pruzansky led the RCA's conversion court or beit din for Bergen County, where his congregation is located. However, after Rabbi Barry Freundel of the RCA was arrested on charges of voyeurism for spying on women at a mikva and was accused of abusing potential converts, the RCA appointed a committee that will include women to review the conversion process and safeguards.

Abe Foxman denounced the blog as \\"outright racism and bigotry,\\" and lamented the congregation's support of Pruzansky. On November 25, 2014, the Orthodox Union issued a public statement distancing itself from Pruzansky's remarks, noting that it could not support a response to terror that includes wholesale demonization of Arabs, collective punishment of Arabs or destruction or dismantling of Muslim holy sites.

The board has also acted to ensure security for the synagogue is tightened.

The post prompted many angry responses, in which Pruzansky was accused of blaming victims of rape, of not taking rape seriously, and of not acknowledging or understanding that marital rape exists. After Pruzansky followed the March 31 blog post with another, on April 13, 2016, entitled \\"Culture Wars ‚Äì Update,\\" in which he defended his position and reiterated his arguments and position, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance responded, demanding that the rabbi be removed from the speaking roster of a one-day conference scheduled to be held at Bnai Yeshurun. The organization's demands were met, and Pruzansky was dropped from the conference. In April 2016, the Rabbinical Council of America decried Pruzansky position, noting that \\"while Rabbi Pruzansky raises some important points regarding sexual behavior on college campuses, the RCA rejects the tone and much of the substance of his recent comments regarding rape.\\" Personal Pruzansky is married to the former Karen Hausdorff, who is a speech language pathologist, and has four children, two of whom live in Israel.

History  Denuvo is developed by Denuvo Software Solutions GmbH, a software company based in Salzburg, Austria. The company was formed through a management buyout of DigitalWorks, the arm of the Sony Digital Audio Disc Corporation that developed the SecuROM DRM technology. In January 2018, the company was acquired by larger software company Irdeto. As of August 2018, the company employs 1,000 people, up from originally 45. Development of the Denuvo software started in 2014. FIFA 15, released in September 2014, was the first game to use Denuvo. 3DM, a Chinese warez group, first claimed to have breached Denuvo's technology in a blog post published on 1 December 2014, wherein they announced that they would release cracked versions of Denuvo-protected games FIFA 15, Dragon Age: Inquisition and Lords of the Fallen. Following onto this, 3DM released the version of Dragon Age: Inquisition about two weeks after that game had shipped. The overall cracking progress took about a month, an unusually long time in the game cracking scene. When asked about this development, Denuvo Software Solutions acknowledged that \\"every protected game eventually gets cracked\\". However, technology website Ars Technica noted that most sales for major games happen within 30 days of release, and so publishers may consider Denuvo a success if it meant a game took significantly longer to be cracked. In January 2016, 3DM's founder, Bird Sister, revealed that they were to give up on trying to break the Denuvo implementation for Just Cause 3, and warned that, due to the ongoing trend for the implementation, there would be \\"no free games to play in the world\\" in the near future. Subsequently, 3DM opted to not crack any games for one year to examine whether such a move would have any influence on game sales. By October 2017, crackers were able to bypass Denuvo's protection within hours of a game's release, with notable examples being South Park: The Fractured but Whole, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Total War: Warhammer 2 and FIFA 18, all being cracked on their release dates. In another notable case, Assassin's Creed Origins, which wrapped Denuvo within security tool VMProtect as well as Ubisoft's proprietary DRM used for their Uplay distribution software, had its security features bypassed by Italian collective CPY in February 2018, three months after the game's release. In December 2018, Hitman 2 protection was bypassed three days before its official release date due to exclusive pre-order access, drawing comparisons to Final Fantasy XV, which had its protection removed four days before release. By 2019, several products like Devil May Cry 5, Metro Exodus, Resident Evil 2, Far Cry New Dawn, Football Manager 2019 and Soul Calibur 6, were cracked within their first week of release, with Ace Combat 7 taking thirteen days. In the case of Rage 2, which was released on Steam as well as Bethesda Softworks' own Bethesda Launcher, the Steam version was protected by Denuvo, whereas the Bethesda Launcher version was not, leading to the game being cracked immediately, and Denuvo being removed from the Steam release two days later. A sister product, Denuvo Anti-Cheat, was announced in March 2019, and first used with Doom Eternal following a patch on 14 May 2020. However, less than a week later Doom developer id Software announced they would be removing it from the game following negative response from players.  Technology  Games protected by Denuvo require an online activation. The software uses a \\"64-bit encryption machine\\". Denuvo's marketing director, Thomas Goebl, stated that some console-exclusive games get PC releases due to this technology.  Criticism  Denuvo has been criticised for high CPU usage and excessive writing operations on storage components, the latter causing significant life-span reductions for solid-state drives (SSDs). Denuvo Software Solutions has denied both claims. In the case of Tekken 7 and Sonic Mania Plus, Denuvo caused a significant decrease in performance in several parts of these games. Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica reviewed in-depth how Denuvo was causing performance penalties, releasing an article on the matter in December 2018. In July 2018, Denuvo Software Solutions filed a lawsuit against Voksi, a 21 year old Bulgarian hacker who had cracked several Denuvo- protected games. Voksi was arrested by Bulgarian authorities, and his website, Revolt, was taken offline. In December 2018, Joel Hruska of ExtremeTech compared the performance of multiple games with Denuvo enabled and disabled, and found that the games tested had significantly higher frame rates and lower loading times when Denuvo was not used.

A single species, S. acrensis, is known from the Late Miocene (between the Mayoan and Huayquerian SALMA, between 11.6 to 5.3 million years ago) of the Madre de Dios Formation, South America. It is one of the few northern mammals that entered South America before the Pliocene.Donald R. Prothero , Kenneth E. Campbell, Jr. , Brian L. Beatty , and Carl D. Frailey. 2014. New late Miocene dromomerycine artiodactyl from the Amazon Basin: implications for interchange dynamics. Journal of Paleontology, 88(3):434‚Äì443.  Description  Surameryx is known from the left half of the nearly complete lower jaw, reminiscent of the North American palaeomerycids, which are known from numerous fossils. The jaw of Surameryx is similar to that of Barbouromeryx in having a premolar row without reduction compared to the molar row; additionally it showed the characteristic \\"Palaeomeryx fold\\", a typical molar crest present in various types of primitive ruminants, and a vertical groove on the back or inner surface of the fourth premolar. Surameryx still differs from its relatives in the much wider shape of the molars and premolars, and in its shorter, upward recurved coronoid process; the stylids were also higher than in other related genera.  Taxonomy  Surameryx acrensis was first named and described in 2014, based on the fossil jaw discovered in the Madre de Dios Formation extending along the Acre River in the area between Cobija, Bolivia and Assis Brasil. Surameryx is a representative of the palaeomerycids, an extinct family of Miocene artiodactyls related to cervids and giraffids. More specifically, Surameryx was a member of the dromomerycines, a group of palaeomerycids endemic to North America; within these, it seems to have a close relationship with Barbouromeryx trigonocorneus, a primitive dromomerycine of the middle Miocene (20‚Äì16 million years ago). The name Surameryx is derived from the Spanish word sur, \\"south\\" and the Greek meryx, \\"ruminant\\"; the species name acrensis refers to the Acre River.  Relevance  The discovery of a dromomerycine in South America is exceptional; until 2014 there were only sporadic findings of placental mammals other than xenarthrans or meridiungulates in South America in layers earlier than the Pliocene epoch. While the Great American Biotic Interchange is traditionally regarded as an event of the late Pliocene (about 3 million years ago), it actually started much earlier, going back at least to the late Miocene, about 10 million years ago. The presence of Surameryx in the Amazon basin is evidence of this exchange in the Miocene, which had already been suggested by the presence of contemporary specimens of gomphotheriids (Amahuacatherium),Campbell, Kenneth E., Carl D. Frailey, and Lidia Romero Pittman.

It seems that the paleomerycids were unable to successfully colonize South America, while other groups fared better there. Proboscideans survived until the arrival of humans) and peccaries and tapirs currently live in South America. However, the dating of the putative Miocene fossil beds in western Amazonia and the identification of the gomphothere remains as Amahuacatherium have been challenged.

Its titular is Saint Louis of Toulouse. History Franciscan priests Father Ju√°n Portocarrero de Plasencia and Father Diego de Oropesa de San Jos√©, known as the Apostles of Laguna and Tayabas, established the visita of Lucban in 1578 and started evangelizing the people of the town. It was elevated as a parish in 1595 under Father Miguel de Talavera alongside the construction of its first church made of wood, dedicated to Saint Louis of Toulouse. The first church was ruined in 1629 and a second church was established on the present site. Construction of the second church, made of stone, masonry, and nipa, proceeded from 1630 to 1640 and the convent was finished in 1650. Church roofing was changed to tiles in 1683 under the supervision of Father Francisco Huerta. Fire destroyed the building in 1733. That same year, Father Pascual Martinez began construction of a third building, the present one, which was completed in 1738. The rebuilt convent was completed in 1743. On April 4, 1945, the day American soldiers liberated Lucban during World War II, the church was partially damaged by a bomb. It was immediately reconstructed under the supervision of Monsignor Antonio Radovan. In July 2014 Typhoon Glenda destroyed the roof over the altar, causing flooding inside the church.  Features  The church follows the baroque design. It has a three-story facade. The second level features semi-circular windows flanked by Corinthian columns and niches containing statues of saints. The church also has an octagonal, three-story belltower standing on a square base.  Pahiyas Festival  The church on the eve of the Pahiyas Festival in 2017. A 6:00 AM mass at the church marks the start of the colorful Pahiyas Festival every May 15, at 7:00 AM a procession leaves the church carrying the images of San Isidro Labrador and Santa Mar√≠a de la Cabeza on a route around the town.

During his tenure in B.C., Devion used co-funding (working with independent producers, Telefilm Canada, and others to co-produce programs) as a way to minimize the damage of budget cutbacks. CBC British Columbia produced a number of programs that were picked up by the national network, including Good Rockin' Tonite, The Best Years, and The Canadian Gardener. Another program produced by CBC British Columbia, Switchback, was adapted for local broadcast by other affiliates. In April 1988, Devion was appointed to the newly created position of Director of Co- Funding for the English television network. In this role, he was responsible for finding private sector and government financing for television programs (outside of news and documentary programming) and obtaining programs from local affiliates to broadcast nationally.

In 1917, several converts were made among the Churches of Christ in Christian Union including one of the denomination's founders, Henry C. Leeth (?-1967). Leeth started a Christian commune with Runyan. The commune consisted of a farm and a store near Urbana, Ohio. The Churches of Christ in Christian Union expelled Leeth and 13 other ministers for holding to Runyan's teachings, which denominational leaders found to be too humanistic.A Goodly Heritage: A History of the Churches of Christ in Christian Union, 1976, pg. 112.

It is based on letters between 18-year-old American Charles Vernon Brown, his family, friends, and other members of his hometown of Massillon, Ohio, dating from his enlistment in the United States Marine Corps in March 1918 during World War I to the return of his body from France in 1921. The play was produced through a grant from the Ohio Arts Council/Ohio Humanities Council Joint Program in 1988 through a commission from the Massillon Museum and was first performed at the Lincoln Theater in Massillon in 1989. Synopsis The play takes place between March 1918 and January 1921 and is based on actual letters written by 18-year old Charles Vernon Brown, members of the immediate and extended Brown family, and other friends and acquaintances from the Northeast Ohio city of Massillon. When US President Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany in 1918 during World War I, Charles Vernon Brown was an 18-year-old high school graduate. He and his friend Chester Potts joined the United States Marine Corps on April 21, 1918 and, after completing training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and Marine Corps Base Quantico, were assigned to France. The family and friends he left behind wrote to him throughout his brief military life. The title of the play comes from how he would address each of his letters home: \\"Dear Mother and all\\". Charles Vernon's mother Lena Brown was the chief correspondent for the letters, which was typical for many families. Charles's father, also named Charles, never wrote his son and appeared to never fully recover from his departure. The Brown family also had three daughters: Dorothy, Ethel, and Helen. Charles Vernon saw action in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel in mid September 1918. He was wounded October 4, 1918 in the Forest of Argonne during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He died from his wounds on October 24. Because of the length of time it took to send and receive letters, Lena Brown received the letter from her son letting her know he was wounded but alive around the date he actually died. She became increasingly anxious as time passed on without any update on his condition, and did not receive the telegram of his death until November 19, eight days after the Armistice. Charles was initially buried in France. Lena held out hope that their son had, in fact, not been killed when a photo of the grave in France showed the name of \\"Charles B. Brown\\" instead of \\"Charles V. Brown\\". Three months later, however, uncle Mortimer Duffield, a doctor with the American Expeditionary Forces, was able to confirm that the grave was that of Charles V. Brown when the Browns' home address was listed as the address for dead soldier in question. Charles's body was returned to Massillon on January 12, 1921 and his funeral was held in his home and at the Wesley Methodist Church on January 13. Publication and performances Dear Mother and All was commissioned by the Massillon Museum in 1988 and is based on their collection of letters related to Charles Vernon Brown. The collection includes over 200 letters written by over 60 people covering a period of approximately three years. The play was funded by a $9,000 grant from the Ohio Arts Council and Ohio Humanities Council and written by Sandra Perlman of Kent, Ohio. Dear Mother and All debuted in Massillon July 28‚Äì30, 1989 at the Lions Lincoln Theater. It was selected as a second-place entry in the first Playwright's Forum at Youngstown State University in 1993 and performed at the university's Spotlight Theater. A monologue from the play was published by Meriwether Publishing in 2001 as part of their Audition Monologs for Student Actors II collection. In December 2013, it was performed in a staged reading at the Erdmann‚ÄìZucchero (EZ) Black Box Theatre at Kent State University. The show is divided into two acts with 31 total scenes and a performance time of approximately 120 minutes. Action takes place at the Brown home in Massillon and wherever Charles Vernon is writing from at the time. The cast has 22 roles, 11 male and 11 female. While it is not a musical, period background music is suggested as an element, and the script is written to accommodate music.

During World War I, she travelled to London to be in proximity to her brothers and cousins who were serving with the AIF, as well as to study art when she could. She assisted with the volunteer war effort. Following the War, she studied with Frances Hodgkins, in the Colarossi in Paris and in Italy before returning to Australia in 1921. Career Watercolour painting by Vida Lahey featuring Brisbane City Hall as seen from Albert Park with the Albert Street Methodist Church steeple to the left (1936) Vida Lahey was one of the first female artists in Queensland and Australia, who regarded themselves as professionals and who sought to earn a living from practising their art. Vida pioneered art classes for both children and adults in Queensland; and she and Daphne Mayo were responsible for the foundation of the Queensland Art Fund in 1929, which helped to establish an art library and acquire works of art for the state. She travelled to Europe in 1927 for further opportunities to study art. Vida was awarded the Society of Artists (NSW) Medal in 1945, in appreciation of good services for the advancement of Australian art, the Coronation Medal in 1953 and in 1958 honoured with an MBE for services to art. Later life Vida Lahey's house Wonga Wallen was originally built for her brother Romeo Lahey in Canungra, on a spur of the Darlington Range and was completed in 1920. Later the house was moved from the outskirts to the Canungra township on the hill above the present Catholic Church and occupied by her parents David and Jane Jemima Lahey, and then moved again by Vida and her sister Jayne Lahey in 1946 to its present block in Sir Fred Schonell Drive, St Lucia in Brisbane. Vida remained at the house Wonga Wallen at St Lucia until her death on 29 August 1968 and was cremated. Wonga Wallen was transferred to the sole ownership of her sister Jayne who remained there until a few years before her death in 1982 during which time another sister, Mavis Denholm n√©e Lahey lived in the house. The house was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. Works A bowl of flowers, watercolour by Vida Lahey (1939) Vida is known to have painted at least two paintings of the heritage-listed Lahey house, Wonga Wallen, Canungra in the late 1930s and Wonga Wallen Loggia at Canungra in the 1940s both in the collection of Ms Shirley Lahey. Another painting, Bedroom at St Lucia with Dobell portrait, c.1961, was painted by Vida in her St Lucia bedroom.  Collections  Vida Lahey is represented in major Australian art galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia. Her painting, Monday Morning is part of the Queensland Art Gallery  Gallery of Modern Art Collection.  Exhibitions  'Songs of Colour: The Art of Vida Lahey', Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane, 1989.

Critic David Appleford of Valley Screen and Stage gave the film a glowing review, writing: \\"Backed by an outstanding, atmospheric score from musician Todd Maki and solid performances from Hodges, Trainor and Spence, plus an effective appearance from Clint Howard whose somewhat creepy presence only adds to the overall mystery of Lauren's kidnapper, director Clen√©t Verdi-Rose has delivered a feature that needs to venture further than the confines of the festival circuit.\\" Views on Film gave a \\"thumbs up\\" rating the film 3 out of 4 stars and calling it \\"powerful\\" while singling out praise for the performances of Jordon Hodges, Randy Spence and Clint Howard.

Stern Architects with interiors by Thierry Despont. The tower has 70 floors and 116 units. The tower is the 17th tallest building in New York City, and neighbors the Central Park Tower, which will be the second tallest building in the city upon completion. History The building that previously occupied the site was a 20-story building built in 1954. It contained 124 apartments, and was purchased in 2005 by Vornado for $131.5 million. After the purchase, Vornado entered a legal battle with its rent-stabilized tenants concerning their eviction. A court sided with Vornado in 2009, and the developer ultimately settled with tenants in 2010, paying between $1.3 million and $1.56 million to those remaining in the building. Vornado has reported the total land cost for the building to be over $515.4 million. Demolition of the existing structure began in 2012 after the settling of a dispute between Vornado and Extell. Extell, another developer, owned the parking garage under the previous building, and was unwilling to close it. Demolition was completed in early 2013. Robert A. M. Stern's designs were released in early 2014. The plans were approved in March 2014. The building is one of several major developments on or around 57th Street and Central Park, dubbed Billionaires' Row by the media, including One57, 432 Park Avenue, 111 West 57th Street, and Central Park Tower. Design Designs originally called for a \\"glass\\" tower. Contrary to the early plans, Robert A. M. Stern's designs call for a limestone-clad building, similar to other buildings by Stern such as 15 Central Park West. The building is one of three skyscrapers designed by Stern in Manhattan, joining 30 Park Place in the Financial District, and 520 Park Avenue, east of Central Park. In November 2016 Justin Casquejo, a thrill-seeking teenage free solo climber and stunt performer, hung from the not-yet-completed tower. =Amenities= The building has a porte-cochere, as well as a wine cellar, a swimming pool, private dining rooms, an athletic club, a juice bar, a library, a basketball court, a golf simulator and a children‚Äôs play area . Tenants As of September 30, 2018, approximately 83% of the condominium units were under sales contracts, with closings scheduled through 2020. On January 23, 2019, it was reported that billionaire hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin purchased a penthouse for $238 million, the most expensive home ever sold in the United States. Other reported buyers include billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Och, financial services executive Andrew Zaro, New York real estate investor Ofer Yardeni, Entertainment Studios CEO Byron Allen and musician Sting along with his wife, actress and producer Trudie Styler.

Limestone was quarried on-site during construction, and the south- western corner (the South Knoll) and eastern portion of the site are at a considerably higher ground level. The Fremantle Prison site includes the prison cell blocks, gatehouse, perimeter walls, cottages, tunnels, and related infrastructure. The Main Cell Block is the longest and tallest cell range in Australia, and a dominating feature of the prison. New Division, constructed between 1904 and 1907, continues the fa√ßade alignment of the main block. Service buildings were converted into the separate Women's Prison. Fremantle Prison is surrounded by limestone perimeter walls, while a two storey limestone gatehouse, with a central clock, presents an imposing entrance. North and south of the gatehouse, on The Terrace, are several cottages and houses ‚Äì three of which are built in Victorian style in contrast to the Georgian style of the others. A tunnel network exists under the prison, built to provide the prison, and later the town of Fremantle, with a supply of fresh water. Other elements of the site include the hospital building, prisoner workshops, open spaces, and a limestone ramp on the axis of the gatehouse, heading down towards the port area of Fremantle. Archaeological zones and sub- surface remains of varying levels of significance are found throughout the area of the convict grant. Background Fremantle Prison dates from the early years of European settlement, when it was constructed as the centre of the British Imperial Convict Establishment in Western Australia. While the colony was established as a \\"free settlement\\" in 1829, by the 1840s the early reluctance to accept Britain's convicts was overcome. Cheap convict labour could overcome the significant shortage of manpower in the colony. However, the arrival of the first convict ship Scindian on 2 June 1850 was unexpected. While a sailing ship had been sent ahead to inform of the pending arrival of seventy-five convicts, it had been blown off course. The Round House was full to capacity, almost overflowing, so the convicts had to be left on the ship. There was also no prepared accommodation for the warders, pensioner guards, Captain Edward Walcott Henderson, Comptroller General of Convicts, or his clerk, James Manning. Rents for accommodation in Fremantle quickly rose due to the sudden increase in demand, leaving Henderson paying more for his basic lodgings in Fremantle than for his house in London. Eventually Henderson leased two properties in Essex Street for ¬£250 per year, at the site of the modern-day Esplanade Hotel. He used his convicts to convert the buildings into a temporary prison. Meanwhile, Henderson was looking for a site to build a permanent convict establishment. Whilst he favoured Mount Eliza (now known as Kings Park) due to its height, which gave it pleasing vistas and supposedly healthier air, Governor Charles Fitzgerald rejected that proposal. Henderson ultimately settled on the current site on a hill, in a raised and dominant position overlooking the port city of Fremantle.  Site  =Description= Fremantle Prison was built on a land grant of about from limestone quarried on-site, and timber cut from Mount Eliza. The site exhibits considerable changes in ground level, natural and man-made, as a result of its location and former use. The ground level is considerably higher in the south-western corner of the site with what remains of the natural landform, formerly known as Church Hill, now referred to as the South Knoll. The eastern portion of the site is also considerably higher than the ground level established around the main cell block. It is a comparatively level terrace and is the highest part of the precinct. Fremantle Prison comprises substantially intact convict era structures, including the limestone perimeter walls of exceptional heritage significance. Other structures, dating from the time the precinct was in use as a colonial and state prison, are also significant. The convict era complex includes the 1859 main cell block, chapel and wards, yards and refractory cells; perimeter walls, gate house complex and prison officer residences on the Terrace; service buildings and hospital; south-eastern workshops; ramp access tramway (Fairbairn Street) and Henderson Street Warder's Cottages. Other elements which contribute to the site's overall heritage significance include the western workshops (1900); new division (1907); and conversion of service building to the female division and the addition of an eastern range (1889‚Äì1909). =Layout= A tall boundary wall encloses the prison grounds, with a gatehouse in the centre of the western wall, facing The Terrace. Other roads bounding the site are Knutsford Street to the north, Hampton Road to the east, and Fothergill Street to the south. Cottages, which housed prison workers and officials, are located outside the wall either side of the gatehouse. Inside the walls, the parade ground is located east of the gatehouse. Beyond it is the Main Cell Block at the centre of the site, which contains two chapels. North of the main block is New Division, and west of that, in the north-western corner, is the former Women's Prison, previously the cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry. The hospital building stands in the north-eastern corner, while the former workshops are located in the south- eastern corner, as well as to the north of the gatehouse. A system of tunnels, constructed to provide fresh water from an aquifer, runs under the eastern edge of the site. = Archaeology = Archaeological zones and sub-surface remains of varying levels of significance are found throughout the area of the convict grant. In particular, the sites of the three former cottages to the east of the perimeter wall in the Hampton Road reserve, the site of the former 'cage' in the New Division courtyard and the features upon and under the knoll terraces. Other site features include those associated with the water supply system constructed in the 1890s: the brick-vaulted underground reservoir, the associated pumping station, a complex series of rock cut shafts, drives, weirs and the tunnel network. Graffiti and a tablet records the progress of the excavators. Walls and gatehouse The prison gatehouse, restored in 2005 The prison is surrounded by limestone perimeter walls, which define the extent of the depot and its original topography to the south, east and north. The walls are of random rubble limestone and lime mortar and range in height from . The additional four courses added in 1898 are of dark stone with a coping. Attached piers occur at approximately centres on the lee sides of the walls. There are a number of openings including both vehicular and pedestrian gates. The walls are of exceptional heritage significance being a vital part of the precinct defining its character. Sterile zones, inside the main perimeter walls and the walls encircling the female division and outside the prison wall, were standard prison practice for surveillance and contribute to the austere character of the prison. The entry complex consists of a combined gate house and quarters, an entry court and military and civil guard houses with embrasures flanking the inner gate. The two storey limestone gatehouse, with a central clock, presents an imposing entry to the former prison. The gatehouse and associated entry complex was constructed between 1854 and 1855 using convict labour. It was designed by Royal Engineer Edmund Henderson, and constructed out of limestone. The gatehouse has two towers either side of a narrow gate, reminiscent of those found in 13th century English castles or walled cities. The gate was made from iron which had been scavenged from shipwrecks, while the clock at the top of the structure was imported from England. The clock was made in London in 1854, installed two years later, and as of 2004, was still sounding every hour. The gatehouse also has a smaller, second, inner gate, engraved with the names of three significant figures: H. Wray RE, who designed the gate; J. Manning, clerk of works, who supervised its fabrication; and Joseph Nelson, the Royal Sappers soldier that wrought the iron. The complex was expanded and altered successively throughout the use of the entry complex for prison's functions. The entry complex was extended north to the female division as a workshop range, the western workshops, leaving a sterile zone beside the perimeter wall. The gatehouse has remained a significant feature and landmark since the closure of the prison, as the main entrance, and housing a caf√© and office areas. Restoration was carried out in 2005, preserving the original stone facade and removing non-original rendering.  Cell blocks  =Main Cell Block= Main Cell Block exterior Based on the English Pentonville Prison design model of Joshua Jebb, the site's key feature, the Main Cell Block, was designed by the Comptroller of Convicts Captain Henderson, and completed in 1859. Designed to hold up to 1000 prisoners, it is long and four storeys high, the longest and tallest cell range in Australia. It was constructed by convicts in the 1850s, and there have been few changes since that time. The 1859 main cell block has an impressive facade and is built of limestone ashlar blocks quarried from the site. It is significant for the ways in which its scale, position in the precinct, simplicity, material and near pristine character ensures that it is the focal and dominating feature of the prison; the evidence of its fabric, internal configuration and spaces reveals its functioning as a convict depot and subsequent prison and its atmosphere. It has come to symbolise the imperial convict era in colonial Western Australia. Main Cell Block internal arrangement The central, four-storey high cell block is flanked on either end by large dormitory wards, called the Association Rooms. Here, as many as 80 men slept in hammocks, either as a reward for good behaviour or because they would soon receive their Ticket of Leave. In contrast, the cells were a confining space measuring just . While each cell initially had a basin connected to running water, the installation was before the advent of S-bends; the smells coming up the pipes lead to their removal by the 1860s. Following a Royal Commission, the cells were made larger by removing a dividing wall from between two cells. Electric lighting was installed in the 1920s, but there were never any toilets ‚Äì buckets were for the duration of the prison's operation. Since the prison's closure, six cells have been restored to represent the varying living conditions at different times in the prison's history. The main block also houses the gallows, solitary confinement cells, and two chapels. The single storey 1855 refractory block is on the same axis as the main cell block to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. The gallows chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The gallows operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged. At the centre of the Main Cell Block is the Anglican Chapel, whose windows were the only ones without bars. It occupies a prominent position in the projecting wing in the centre of the facade. It retains its original painted and stencilled wall patterns beneath later paint layers and is the most intact early prison chapel in Australia. Its interior features include an early and substantial example of a laminated arch construction in the colonies and the first in WA, handsome decalogue boards and some original and elegant joinery. Behind the Anglican chapel altar, there is a painted representation of the Ten Commandments. The words to the sixth commandment use the unusual translation of \\"thou shalt do no murder\\" rather than \\"thou shalt not kill,\\" the more common interpretation in the Church of England. Given that the gallows were still in regular use, it was felt that \\"thou shalt not kill\\" would have been hypocritical. The Catholic Chapel was put into the upper northern Association Ward in 1861. The floor has evidence of its former use for communal prisoner accommodation, in the form of mortices for hammock rails and a convict painted mural which decorates its wall. =New Division= New Division, adjacent to the hospital (right) and Main Cell Block (left) Fremantle Prison's New Division was constructed between 1904 and 1907, as a response to overcrowding. The division continues the fa√ßade alignment of the main block. The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example of an attempt to introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for the first three months of their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal within five years. The New Division was the first to have electricity, with underground wiring. During World War Two, the Australian Army appropriated the New Division, to keep prisoners separate from the main population, and for those condemned to death. In 1994 the building was retrofitted to cater for offices, small business premises, and meeting rooms. =Women's Prison= The north-western complex was originally a service area with a cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry, built in the 1850s. A place for women prisoners was needed following the closure of Perth Gaol and the transfer of prisoners to Fremantle. The buildings were converted to a prison, and a wall built around them, creating Western Australia's first separate prison for women ‚Äì a gaol within a gaol. Population and crime growth led to them being extended in the 1890s and 1910s. The single storey limestone building, also known as the female division, has a distinctive monitor roof and an upper storey addition to part of the eastern range in red brick. The construction of Bandyup Women's Prison saw Fremantle's Women's Prison close in 1970. The space was used for education and assessment until the main prison's closure in 1991, and has since been adapted for TAFE use as a visual arts facility.  Staff accommodation  2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, at the north end of the street A flat area, to the immediate west of the prison, is called The Terrace and was formed from rubble resulting from the levelling of the prison site. Adjoining the western perimeter wall, but outside the prison on the northern side of the terrace compound, is staff accommodation. Three adjoining residences were built in the 1890s as quarters for prison staff. The cottages at 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, at the northern end of the street, were built in a Victorian style, in contrast to the Georgian style of the other houses. Number 2 incorporates parts of an 1857 guard room and was converted in the 1890s to quarters, when Numbers 4 and 6 were built alongside as a duplex. Number 2 is a single storey house with random rubble limestone walls and corrugated iron roof separated from the perimeter wall by a rear yard. Numbers 4 and 6 are a pair of single duplex units with random rubble limestone walls, corrugated iron roofs and front verandahs, separated from the perimeter wall by a rear yard. Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 The Terrace, were built during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, also known as the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with rendered and painted limestone walls. The plan is roughly square with verandahs and balconies along the west and south sides. A single storey building connects the south-east side of the house to the main prison wall. 10 The Terrace, also known as the Superintendent's House Number 10, also known as the Superintendent's House, is a two storey house with rendered limestone walls and a corrugated iron roof behind parapet walls. It is connected to the gatehouse with limestone walled buildings. The plan is roughly square and there is a door from the house into the prison from the north-east room of the ground floor. The house was initially built in 1853 for the Chaplain, but was taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and was later used by the prison administration. Number 16 is a house is two storey building, roughly square in plan, with painted limestone walls and a corrugated sheet metal roof behind a parapet. It accommodated first the superintendent, later on the resident magistrate, and remained in-use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, also known as the Surgeon's House, is a two storey structure with limestone walls. It is the southernmost house on The Terrace. Numbers 18 and 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s. A single storey limestone structure (former stables) is located to the south of Number 18.  Other buildings  =Hospital= The hospital, built between 1857 and 1859, was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. Located in the north-eastern corner of the prison compound, the building is H-shaped in plan, single storey with rendered and painted limestone walls. It features a wide verandah with timber posts. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished, and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991. Adjacent to the hospital building is the east reservoir. The brick vaulted reservoir and reticulation system, constructed in 1890 and about 1895, appear as a low brick structure. The reservoir roof consists of with five rendered vaults each side of a central vault raised above those each side. The centre of the eastern terrace contains the subsurface remains of the 1850s bathhouse and well. =Workshops= The prison printery in 1909 The prison's workshops provided activities and training for the prisoners. They also reduced the cost of maintenance, repairs, and construction by providing an in-house service. The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, one of the first buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop. The West Workshops were built at the start of the twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop. The five western workshops are a single storey squared limestone rubble building with openings dressed in brick, with an open saw- tooth roof with southern skylights, concealed behind a parapet wall. In 1993 the western workshops were adapted for use as TAFE art workshops. Buildings in the area south of the east workshops were used for a shower block, helmet workshop and associated sheds. The structures are recent and, with the exception of some terrace walling, are the last of a series that have been erected and dismantled since World War I. Tunnels View inside the tunnels At the south eastern corner of the eastern terrace is the former pumping station, associated tunnels and a set of 1850s workshops within an enclosing wall. Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building on the western side with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960. A tunnel network exists under the prison, including a connection to South Beach in South Fremantle. It was built by prisoners, but the purpose was not to enable escapes; their labour was used to provide the prison, and later the town of Fremantle, with a supply of fresh water. Guards in a gun tower adjacent to the tunnel entrance prevented any attempted escapes. In 1852, during construction of the buildings, shafts were sunk into the limestone bedrock to provide the prison with fresh water from an aquifer. In 1874, the Fremantle's \\"Water House Well\\", used to supply ships, suffered storm damage. This prompted a tank to be installed at the prison, behind the main cell block, to offer the town an alternative water supply. Prisoners worked a pump to fill the tank, which was connected to the jetties through gravity-fed pipes. Increasing demand led to the construction of a reservoir in 1876, from which water was drawn, still pumped by prisoners. From 1888 to 1894, additional wells were built, connected by a series of tunnels or horizontal drives under the north-east of the prison. A steam pump was implemented, which drew per hour of water into the new East Reservoir. In 1896, a town reservoir was constructed on Swanbourne Street, fed from the prison by a triple expansion steam-driven pump which could take more than per day from the prison tunnels. Prisoners, relieved of manual pumping, were employed to supply wood and stoke boilers. The Metropolitan Sewerage & Water Supply authority took over control of the pumping station from 1901 until 1910, when both the prison and town were connected to Perth's metropolitan water supply. The tunnels were closed in 1910, but the groundwater continued to be used for the prison's gardens. In 1989, oil leaking from nearby tanks contaminated the water. The pollution was eventually cleared by 1996 through bioremediation. Since the prison's closure the water supply system including the tunnels, were the subject of heritage studies, including a 2004 inspection by the Western Australia Maritime Museum. The tunnels were re-opened in mid-2005, and within one year the main shaft had been refurbished, including \\"installation of audio-visual equipment, railings and lighting as well as the removal of debris from the access shaft and tunnels, the creation of new steel platforms and ladders and the addition of extra limestone rocks in the tunnels to help lift users out of the water.\\" Open spaces and related elements View across to South Knoll The open spaces of the precinct are significant as they provide impressive settings for the structures. They are also important spaces in their own right retaining the stark open character of a penal institution required for surveillance. The extensive forecourt of the main cell block, with its scale and secure location within the perimeter walls, is particularly impressive. Paths are bitumen with grassed garden beds delineated by raised brick edging. South Knoll comprises the remains of the high, natural ground level which at least by 1896 had been terraced to form flat, grassed areas. The former playing fields and tennis courts are still in evidence. There is a brick- vaulted reservoir located under the Knoll. The significant landscape presents an austere and formal quality within the perimeter walls. Generally the landscape is sparse and simple, comprising unobtrusive elements such as lawn, low plantings and pavement. Landscape elements outside the walls include the exotic almond and pine trees on the Terrace. An inclined tramway, the ramp, was built from the front of the terrace, on the axis of the gatehouse, down towards the port area of Fremantle. The ramp, constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut and fill activities required to create the prison site and the terrace. The ramp is an integral part of the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment of the ramp, where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three terrace houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point. The limestone used for the early prison and its associated housing was quarried on the site. Other surviving elements of the early convict establishment include Henderson's house, \\"The Knowle\\", the three Henderson Street cottages (terrace housing) at numbers 7‚Äì17, 19‚Äì29, and 31‚Äì41 Henderson Street, a range of terraces at 3‚Äì9 Holdsworth Street, paths, roads and ramps, garden sites, walls, sub surface works and the more distant routes to the Asylum, the Commissariat Store and wharf site.

Adult moths of most species of this subfamily lack small, simple eyes near the large, compound eyes and have quadrifine (four-veined) hindwing cells. The micronoctuid moths are an exception because they possess simple eyes and bifine (two-veined) hindwing cells. Taxonomy Phylogenetic studies have shown that this subfamily should include the micronoctuid moths as a Micronoctuini tribe.

It is a position held by some Gnostics in the first to third century, as well as some modern Mandaeans, Muslims, and many Japanese. Christian and Gnostic traditions The Book of Thomas the Contender, a Gnostic text thought to have been written in the late second or the third century,John D. Turner, The Anchor Bible Dictionary, volume 6, p. 529. cites Jesus as stating, when speaking to Thomas the Apostle, \\"[I]t has been said that you are my twin and true companion.\\". Additionally, the third century text Acts of Thomas (not to be confused with the Gospel of Thomas) contains an episode in which the risen Jesus appears \\"in the likeness of\\" Thomas the Apostle, and is subsequently mistaken for Thomas by a king.Bart D. Erhman, Lost Scriptures: Books that Did Not Make It into the New Testament, p. 122 However, these early texts do not expressly put forward any sort of substitution hypothesis with respect to the death and resurrection of Jesus. The Second Treatise of the Great Seth, a Gnostic text from the third century, claims that Simon of Cyrene was crucified in the place of Jesus.Bart D. Erhman, Lost Scriptures: Books that Did Not Make It into the New Testament, p. 82 The text is written from the first-person narrative perspective of Jesus, attributing to Jesus statements such as \\"I was laughing at their ignorance\\" when the crowd mistakenly crucifies Simon of Cyrene, and asserting that this deception was made possible because \\"I [Jesus] was altering my shapes, changing from form to form.\\" The Gospel of Barnabas describes Jesus escaping crucifixion through being raised alive to heaven by a committee of holy angels; afterwards, Judas Iscariot is supernaturally transformed to look identical to Jesus, and is subsequently crucified in Jesus' place. Concerning its date of composition, few academics argue that the Gospel of Barnabas was composed any earlier than the 14th century, although a minority of scholars see it as containing portions of an earlier work. Paul William Roberts reports in his 1995 travel narrative Journey of the Magi: In Search of the Birth of Jesus, that some contemporary Mandaeans hold that Thomas the Apostle was the twin brother of Jesus and was crucified in Jesus' place. The etymology of Thomas with respect to Thomas the Apostle and the name Judas (distinct from Judas Iscariot) that he is given in various early texts and traditions is alluded to by some as evidence of Jesus having had a twin. Islamic perspective A verse in the Qur'an saying of Jesus that \\"they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them\\" has been interpreted by many Muslims to mean that a different man who only appeared to be Jesus died in his place. Muslim scholars do not agree on the identity of the substitute, but he is often thought to have been one of the Apostles or Simon of Cyrene. Japan A tradition in the Japanese village of Shing≈ç, Aomori holds that Jesus had a brother named Isukiri who took his place on the cross. According to this tradition, Jesus fled to Japan, married, bore children, and died there. In popular culture *The Red Dwarf series ten episode \\"Lemons\\" includes the idea that Judas was actually the twin brother of Jesus, who died in his place to 'fake' the resurrection and spread Jesus' gospel.
