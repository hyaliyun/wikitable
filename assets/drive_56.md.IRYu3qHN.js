Weight training benches may be of various designs: fixed horizontal, fixed inclined, fixed in a folded position, with one adjustable portion, with two or more adjustable portions, with racks to hold bars, etc. In the limit, the definition of a bench blurs into that of combinations that mix a bench and associated equipment. Benches are manufactured by many different vendors, in an array of qualities, features, and prices. Alternatives Though the weight bench seems to define weight training for modern audiences, benches are not strictly necessary for many, if not most, exercises that typically use them. For example, seated presses may be done while standing. In recent years, many home fitness enthusiasts have begun incorporating a swiss ball into their workouts in place of a traditional bench, since it is both more space-efficient and requires engagement of the core abdominal muscles. This substitution is not without criticism, since it can be difficult to maintain form and balance when lifting more than one's own body weight. Before the invention of the weight bench the common way to work the chest was to lie on the floor and do what was known as the floor or supine press.  Types of Weight Bench  There are 6 different types of weight benches available. = Flat Bench = These are the most common and most popular types of benches. These are the flat benches that don‚Äôt have any attachments. The main muscle being worked is the chest, and the secondary muscles being used are the triceps and the shoulders. = Adjustable Weight Bench = An adjustable bench is flexible and allows you to do a whole lot of exercises by adjusting the bench as per need. It can lie flat, can be inclined or declined = Olympic Weight Bench = Olympic benches are professional advance level benches that are wider and longer. Olympic benches are not simple benches rather they have several additional equipment added to them such as squat rack, weight plates, rod, dumbbells and more. It is a complete workout machine that allows you to do some advance exercises such as squats, quad exercises, bench press and more. = Folding Weight Bench = Not all the benches can be folded. If you are in need of a weight bench that can be folded and carried easily anywhere, you should go for a folding one. These benches are not feature-rich as they have to fold so these are either flat or adjustable benches. = Abdominal Bench = It is a bench that is specifically made for performing ab exercises. The position of these benches can be either flat, incline or decline. These benches have foot rollers that are used to lock the feet thus protecting the exerciser. = Preacher Curl Bench = It is a bench that‚Äôs made for doing preacher curls specifically. Which are mainly used to work the peak of your biceps.

He was one of the strongest competitive cyclists in the United States in the early 1970s, winning the United States National Road Race Championships in 1974. Biography Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Allis began racing while a student at Princeton University, and had not yet graduated when he led three of his Princeton teammates to compete in the world road championships in Ronse, Belgium. The team performed poorly in the road race, but better in the time trial, where they took 20th place. This was the first American presence in international cycling competition since the era of Major Taylor. Allis stayed to race in Europe when his teammates returned to the United States, signing on as a category 1 amateur with the Paris club, ACBB. He was the first English speaker to ride for the team. Despite the skepticism of French cycling enthusiasts, who informed him that Americans were biologically unfit to compete, Allis did achieve victories, including Paris to Cayeux-sur-Mer in 1964. The team was so surprised to see their American rider win that they had to scramble to find him a clean jersey to wear on the podium; he had been given the worst one in the shop. His victory was covered in L'√âquipe and mentioned in the New York Times. Allis returned home to complete his Princeton degree. In 1965, he placed second in the national collegiate road championship.\\"Hinnov of Princeton Retains Bicycle Road Racing Title,\\" New York Times, May 9, 1965 In his senior year, he participated in his first Olympic Games. After placing fourth in trials in Central Park, he was selected for the men's individual road race,\\"Castilloux Takes 112¬Ω-Mile Final in Bicycle Trials,\\" Robert Lipsyte, New York Times,September 7, 1964 but was under academic probation and the school almost declined to allow him to attend. However, somebody pointed out to the administration that Harvard and Yale each had two Olympians that year and that, without Allis, Princeton would have had only one (Bill Bradley). He produced the best American result in the event that year, 70th out of 126 riders.\\"6-Man Cycling Club Is Riding High at Princeton; Victory Streak Goes Back to 1962 for Road Racers,\\" New York Times, November 7, 1965, p. S11 Allis also raced in the team time trial in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City and the road race at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where he took 63rd. In 2005, Allis said that his failure to gain success at the Olympics was the biggest disappointment of his career. After a brief stint in the Army, Allis shone in American racing in the early 1970s, organizing along with Dave Chauner the Raleigh team that dominated American racing, and winning the national road championship in 1974,\\"Roster of Winners of Individual and Team Championships in Sports During 1974,\\" New York Times, December 22, 1974\\"Allis Wins Title In Bicycle Racing,\\" New York Times, July 29, 1974, p.30 which he won by applying brutal tactics against the newcomer Tommy Officer, the 175-mile Quebec-Montreal race in 1973, and two runnings of the Mount Washington Hill Climb.His 1974 record-setting win is mentioned in \\"Bicycling Grand Prix is Taken by Stettina,\\" New York Times, September 10, 1979 He retired from national competition in 1976. Allis achieved all his victories as an amateur. He would have entered European professional racing but was denied the opportunity in 1969 by the management of ACBB, who declared he was too old. Allis lives in Massachusetts with his wife Kim, and has two daughters, Paget and Galen. He was a co-owner of the Belmont Wheelworks and Ace Wheelworks bike stores, and coached the Harvard University cycling team from 1980 through 2010. He was inducted into the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1993.

It is often referred to as Grand Prix 1, MicroProse Grand Prix, or just F1GP. Although the game itself was not affiliated officially with the FIA or any Formula One drivers, team liveries and driver helmets were accurate to represent the 1991 season, but the names were fictional. The game is a simulation of Formula One racing at the time and was noted for its 3D graphics, remarkably high framerate (25 fps) and attention to detail, in particular the player's ability to edit the teams and drivers and set up their car to their own personal specifications. The game was ranked the 27th best game of all time by Amiga Power.Amiga Power magazine issue 64, Future Publishing, August 1996 Grand Prixs success spawned three sequels, called Grand Prix 2, Grand Prix 3 and Grand Prix 4. Impact on the racing simulation genre After Papyrus' Indianapolis 500: The Simulation, which was released three years earlier, it was the second serious 3D polygon- based racing sim (that is, without textures, except some for the scenery in the PC version). Although Indy 500 was strictly speaking first in pioneering many novel features, F1GP would make a bigger overall impression and impact because it featured Formula One race cars, and because it offered the player a complete season to compete in, featuring 16 F1 tracks to Papyrus' 1 track in Indy 500. When Indy 500 and F1GP appeared, they were the very first to implement something that resembled \\"real world\\" racing physics, accurate track modelling and car handling that required skills somewhat similar to real-world driving skills to perform well. Both were also the first to offer meaningful options to tune the behaviour of the cars. Although not quite on the level of later simulations, the most important variables, such as gear ratios, tyre compounds and wing settings were available to tune and, more importantly, proved to make an actual difference when driving. Important were also the functional rearview mirrors and an \\"instant replay\\" system with a wide range of adjustable camera settings not seen in other games of the era. In addition, action replays would automatically change camera position and angle according to what was happening on track, a feature which is unavailable in leading F1 licensed games in 2019. Despite several continuity hiccups, the game offered a completely new experience for players at the time. The accurately modelled tracks meant that the player could actually recognise their location on the real-life circuit. The detailed physics engine provided a more realistic driving experience than had been seen before, drivers could easily experience the differences in handling depending on how you entered a corner and how soon or late you accelerated out of it. Unlike other racing simulations of the time, the accuracy of the simulation actually made the 1/1000 of a second chronometer meaningful, as races could be won or lost by a few thousandths of a second. Vitally, the combination of graphics and physics meant players could actually \\"feel\\" whether they were driving fast or slow, and could predict how the car would respond. Even details such as tyre wear were modelled throughout the race, qualifying tyres are an extreme example of this: players could not drive more than a couple of laps without beginning to lose grip and eventually spinning out on nearly every corner. Together with the 16 tracks and the atmosphere-packed rendition of complete Grand Prix weekends, it made F1GP a favourite with Formula One and racing sim fans for many years, and is still referred to occasionally in current reviews as a classic benchmark. Two more aspects worth mentioning are the \\"driving help\\" features, the ability to drive easily with the keyboard or another controller, and the availability of automatic transmission on most cars. F1GP was built on a system that allowed for an almost perfect learning-curve. Depending on which driving assistances were activated, the game covered playability from a pure arcade-racer level up to the most advanced sim-level available at the time. Players could choose to activate innovative help-functions like \\"brake-assistance\\" which would apply the brakes in time for a corner, displaying an \\"ideal line\\" on the tarmac to help learning the layout of a track, suggestions for the optimum gear, and others. Perhaps the most impressive achievements in that respect were the \\"steering help\\" and \\"throttle assistance\\". At the time F1GP was released, analogue steering wheels were far from mainstream. Even joysticks were still mostly digital, and in that respect no different from a keyboard. In order to compensate for the strict on-off nature of digital controllers, Geoff Crammond implemented a method to 'smoothen' the inputs. \\"Throttle assistance\\" prevented wheel spin when going on the gas. \\"Steering help\\" smoothened the steering actions (as an indication, one would experience cars steering slightly into corners all on their own when this help was activated). This was a subtle exercise, as it could give the impression of cars driving themselves when implemented too strongly. As experience showed, a balance was found. Which turned F1GP, and its successors, into a racing game that could be fully enjoyed and played well via digital input devices. As an aside, it is illustrative for the depth of the game that people actually learned to overcome the need for \\"Throttle Assistance\\" when using the keyboard, and discovered that disabling it and applying the right techniques enabled \\"digital\\" drivers to go faster (at the expense of tyre wear). To this day F1GP remains a unique and world leading example in providing a learning curve that caters from the utter driving novice to the very advanced sim-driver. Limitations Despite these great achievements, F1GP also contained a flaw that was considered irrelevant at first, but would later seriously compromise the potential of the game and its successors. Geoff Crammond wrote the game long before the era of DirectX, OpenGL and 3D acceleration video cards. So F1GP was built around a proprietary 3D engine that ran in software. This engine was set up in such a way that a fixed frame rate had to be chosen (up to 25.6 frame/s on the PC version), and the game would at all times try to render the specified number of frames. The result was that the engine would never drop frames when the CPU couldn't handle the rendering in realtime. Instead, gametime itself was slowed down. The software itself provided an option to display the CPU-load, pressing the \\"o\\" key. When this was higher than 100%, the game was no longer working in realtime. This would become known in the community as the infamous \\"slow-motion driving\\". Since the rendering was obviously dependent on the complexity of the scene, this also meant that one could experience slowdowns of the action only on certain parts of certain tracks, or when there were lots of cars around (for example at the start). The game did provide options to eliminate trackside details; (CTRL-D), and in addition one could also choose a lower framerate to avoid the problem altogether. It also has to be understood that gamers didn't have quite the same expectations of framerates as nowadays. The unmatched quality of the 3D representations in itself was enough to impress people, so the actual impact on single-player gaming was not seen as important. Later in the game's life, this effect became a larger issue. The Grand Prix series never offered solid multiplayer network support, largely due to this design choice. \\"Real time\\" in the game could differ between different players, and this conflicted with the all-important synchronization in a multiplayer context. The effect could also be misused to artificially slow down the action, and exploit the extra reaction time that became available to the player that way. Although largely irrelevant if one played the game on one's own, it caused a lot of trouble for online competitions (see below). Successors Grand Prix 3 and Grand Prix 4 offered LAN-play and were even hacked to be playable over the Internet, but never performed reasonably. Even when the first boom of 3D acceleration chipsets revolutionized gaming, the concept was not reworked as this would have required a large rewrite of the game engine, and remained a problem (although less so because of the available computer power). Another exploitable flaw lay in the physics engine, which only took account of horizontal collisions and ignored vertical velocity when calculating damage. Thus, it was possible to use the rumble strips on some tracks to launch the car into the air, bypassing chicanes, and land without damaging the car. Historical online gaming and community F1GP was among the first wave of games that had a busy online community. The first competitions were organized via online services like Compuserve in 1993, with driver Ivan establishing a secure presence at the top of leaderboards. F1GP crossed over to the wider Internet once these became mainstream. The racing didn't actually happen online. F1GP only offered modem play. Thus, the competitions were based on submitted save-games of races and practice laps. These were then used in competitions around complete (or partial) races on the one hand, and so called \\"Hotlap Competitions\\" on the other hand. Often, the races followed the schedule of the real world Formula One competition. The community spawned a host of mods, making the game highly customizable for its time. Liveries, car- performance and the performance of the computer-opponents, camera-settings and many other settings could be edited. First attempts at a track-editor emerged, but this would only become reality after the arrival of the successor Grand Prix 2. In 1994, the Amiga version of F1GP benefitted from a game editor called F1GP-Ed. Whilst this was not the first editor made for the Amigahttps://www.howtoretro.com/f1gp-amiga-review/, it proved to be the most evolved and widely adopted over time. Because of the possibilities to edit the performance of the car, or to make other aspects of the game favour the player, there were also a lot of utilities to check for cheats. These could handle just about every possible trick that was available, except one: the mentioned \\"slow-motion driving\\" effect. The game didn't store the CPU-load data, which could be displayed via a function key, in any save game file. So there was no way to exclude the possibility that someone maximized the graphics detail on purpose to force a slowdown of the action. In practice, F1GP was already an 'older' game when online competitions appeared. This meant that most used computers could easily handle the highest detail at the highest framerate. As such, F1GP-based competitions were actually not hit by the \\"slow-mo\\" cheat. Both because the communities were small, and because the CPU- power surplus meant that the effect and its possible usefulness as a way to cheat were less well known. Its successor Grand Prix 2 though, was notorious for its high CPU-demands. When it appeared, there were no systems available that could handle it at full detail. Most people had difficulty finding a good compromise between details and smooth framerate, and the majority were likely playing in moderate slow-motion without being aware. When the Grand Prix 2 community materialized and exploded far beyond what F1GP ever offered, it soon became apparent that some participants in the competitions submitted results that were totally unrealistic. Telemetry-data files even showed typical signs of \\"slow-motion driving\\" (like impossibly fast gearchange speeds) but there was no way to unambiguously prove it. This problem kept bugging the community for several years until the utility GP2LAP was developed to monitor and log the CPU load dynamically during the driving. Play by Mail Mode A special PBM or Play by Mail mode was introduced in F1GP. Players would choose one of the drivers for the particular race and when their turn was up save the game onto floppy disk. The disk would then be sent via second class mail to other participants in the event to continue with their turn. This would again be saved and the disk mailed out to the next participant. The PBM mode could extend to include a full seasons championship.  Release  A port of Formula One Grand Prix for the Atari Jaguar was in development and planned to be published by MicroProse, but it was never released. Reception Computer Gaming World stated that \\"World Circuit is a winner, going away at the finish\\". In 1993 the magazine named it and Star Wars: X-Wing Simulation Game of the Year, and in 1994 reported that of four new racing games, \\"there is not a World Circuit in the lot\\". In 1994, PC Gamer UK named it the 29th best computer game of all time. The editors praised Geoff Crammond's past work and called Grand Prix \\"easily his masterpiece to date.\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared World Circuit the 66th-best computer game ever released. Grand Prix and its sequel, collectively, were named the seventh best computer game of all time by PC Gamer UK in 1997. Modern-day community and online gaming F1GP Site homepage screenshot Despite the sheer age of the game and the fact that it is both technically and graphically inferior to modern racing simulators, F1GP still has a small community and on-going developments relating to the game. Prior to 2008, the forefront of this community was found at the racing game website SimRacingWorld. A single section was reserved for F1GP in which community information and developments, both historical and current were available to anybody interested in the game. The last update to the F1GP section of the site was made in April 2007, and the SimRacingWorld site was shut down in March 2017. The successor to the previously illustrated website was created on 14 January 2007 and it was a Yahoo group. This portal was originally designed to augment SimRacingWorld, promoting community discussion and allowing casual players to remain aware of new developments. However, it has since expanded to contain a selection of files. Up to 1 April 2018, all new community developments were made available via this portal. However, it is clear that there was significantly more material on the SimRacingWorld website than on the group and thus it cannot be seen as a complete replacement. A new F1GP community website was launched on 1 April 2018. The website includes a mirror of all the content that was previously hosted on the SimRacingWorld website and the F1GP Yahoo group portal, as well as new developments. Alongside the website, a new discussion forum was launched. It is a Google group that features a forum and a mailing list. The discussion group is regularly updated with new developments. One of the focuses of these communities has been on online multiplayer competitions. The ERace is an online multiplayer competition which uses the play by mail mode to facilitate a championship. This contest was announced on 11 October 2011 and is still running as of the current date. Competition updates are regularly posted on the Yahoo group portal for all those interested in the game to read. In addition to the play by mail mode, a competition using a direct Internet connection between two players has also been tested. The online gaming mode utilizes the game's built-in modem play and the serial port virtualization capabilities of the DOSBox emulator program. This method of playing F1GP over a LAN connection or over the Internet was originally tested in 2011. The method was fully documented on 1 June 2017. With the increasing speed and the decreasing latency of modern network connections, this type of multiplayer games is expected to become more relevant in the future. Modern-day developments (2006‚Äì) Chequered Flag screenshot Modern day developments for F1GP have largely have been limited to small-scale community updates and projects. However, three developments in particular deserve notable mention. The construction of an open-source game editor \\"Chequered Flag\\" is the first of these as it was a project of significant scale, designed to unify previous editing tools and introduce new game modification facilities. Initial progress was good and a number of screenshots were released on 3 September 2006 to give an indication of the editor construction state. This was followed on 23 December 2006 by the first release of the editor under version 0.1.0. This early version focused only on providing modification facilities for track editing. A more complete set of editing tools was anticipated, although this remains the only released version as of the current date. ArgEditor screenshot The second significant development revolves around the creation of a modern game editor \\"ArgEditor\\". It represents a fresh take on an F1GP editor which works on all recent versions of the Windows operating system. It includes almost all of the features of older game editors and expands them with new features. The editor was first introduced on 15 September 2015 under version 0.8. The features of the editor have gradually been expanded and the current stable version 1.0 has been released on 18 February 2018. The third significant development is the \\"ArgTrack\\" track editor. It is a simple, semi- functional track editor, aimed at simplifying the track editing process. The editor was first introduced on 2 May 2018 under version 0.1.0.23.

Academic career After finishing school in Frankfurt (Oder), he studied at the Royal Industrial Institute of Berlin, earning his Ph.D. with Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg in 1863. Vogel's thesis, which was published in Poggendorffs Annalen (119, pp. 497), had the title: √úber das Verhalten des Chlorsilbers, Bromsilbers und Iodsilbers im Licht und die Theorie der Photographie (Reactions of Silver Chloride, Silver Bromide and Silver Iodide with Light and the Theory of Photography). This marked the beginning of his research into the photographic process. From 1860 until 1865, he was an assistant in the mineralogical museum of the University of Berlin, and from 1884 was director of the photo-technical laboratory of the Technical Institute there. From 1864 he was a professor at Berlin's Technische Hochschule (from 1879, the Technical University of Berlin), where he introduced photography as a field of study. Dye sensitization In 1873 Vogel discovered dye sensitization, a pivotal contribution to the progress of photography. The photographic emulsions in use at that time were sensitive to blue, violet and ultraviolet light, but only slightly sensitive to green and practically insensitive to the rest of the spectrum. While trying out some factory-made collodion bromide dry plates from England, Vogel was amazed to find that they were more sensitive to green than to blue. He sought the cause and his experiments indicated that this sensitivity was due to a yellow substance in the emulsion, apparently included as an anti-halation agent. Rinsing it out with alcohol removed the unusual sensitivity to green. He then tried adding small amounts of various aniline dyes to freshly prepared emulsions and found several dyes which added sensitivity to various parts of the spectrum, closely corresponding to wavelengths of light the dyes absorbed. Vogel was able to add sensitivity to green, yellow, orange and even red.Vogel, H: \\"On the sensitiveness of bromide of silver to the so-called chemically inactive colours\\", Chemical News, December 26, 1873:318-319, copying from The Photographic News, date and page not cited but apparently December 12, 1873, in turn translated from Vogel's own publication Photographische Mittheilungen, December, 1873 10(117):233-237.Vogel, H: \\"Photo-spectroscopic researches\\", The Photographic News, March 20, 1874:136-137, translated from Photographische Mittheilungen, February, 1874 10(119):279-283.Vogel, H: \\"Rendering actinic non-actinic rays\\", The Photographic News, July 3, 1874:320-321. In this communication, apparently in the original English, Vogel answers critics who suggest that the sensitivity into red which he reports is an error due to an impure spectrum by noting that the Fraunhofer lines recorded on his test plates are in their correct locations, which would not be the case if the photographic action were due to light of other wavelengths. For further details cf. Klaus Hentschel: Mapping the Spectrum, Oxford: OUP, 2002. This made photography much more useful to science, allowed a more satisfactory rendering of colored subjects into black-and-white, and brought actual color photography into the realm of the practical. ISSN 0161-7370, copying from Nature. After summarizing the discoveries of Vogel and Edmond Becquerel, this article notes some of the prospective benefits to science and to photography in general. Caution: an error found in early English-language reports of Becquerel's results with chlorophyll is repeated here. In his original paper in French (Comptes Rendus (1874) 79:185-190) Becquerel reports strong action between Fraunhofer lines C and B (red), not C and D (orange) as it appears in a widely-copied English translation which is reflected here. Subsequent references to these lines in his paper confirm that \\"C et B\\" as it appears on page 188 of the original is correct. In the early 1890s, Vogel's son Ernst assisted German-American photographer William Kurtz in applying dye sensitization and three-color photography to halftone printing, so that full- color prints could be economically mass-produced with a printing press. Other activities In addition to his work as a photographic technical innovator, Vogel taught Alfred Stieglitz between 1882 and 1886. He participated in at least two photographic expeditions to Egypt as well as others to Italy and possibly Asia. Vogel founded the periodical Photographische Mittheilungen in 1864 and served as its publisher until his death. His silver tester, photometer for pigment printing and heliotype printing, and universal spectroscope were introduced into general use. He visited the United States in 1870 and 1883.

It is owned by iHeartMedia. Its studios are located in San Diego's Kearny Mesa neighborhood on the northeast side, and the transmitter is located in La Jolla. It broadcasts from the KGTV Tower, shared with several other San Diego FM stations and KGTV.http://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/patg?id=KMYI-FM KMYI is the oldest continuously operating FM station in the San Diego metropolitan area. The station is the San Diego affiliate for On Air with Ryan Seacrest, and is one of few Hot AC stations to carry the program. KMYI broadcasts in HD. It carries the news/talk programming of sister station KOGO on its HD2 sub- channel. In November 2018, KMYI activated an HD3 sub-channel, which airs a Soft AC format branded as \\"The Breeze.\\" It is the only station in iHeart's San Diego cluster to have three HD channels. History =Early years (1949‚Äì1996)= The station signed on in 1949 using the call sign KFSD-FM and simulcasting KFSD (now KOGO).Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-26 It carried the AM station's format of Middle of the Road music with news and personalities. As one of the earliest FM stations in Southern California, it was originally powered at 100,000 watts, and even today has more power (77,000 watts) than most of its rivals, which normally are limited to 50,000 watts. As FM radios became more available, especially among the affluent and audiophiles, KFSD-FM adopted a classical music format in 1956, for which it was known for nearly four decades. =Format changes and sale (1996‚Äì2000)= KFSD-FM was sold by Lotus Communications to Nationwide Communications in 1996. The new owners decided classical music would not have enough listeners and revenue, so the format was switched to classic hits as \\"94.1 The Eagle\\" on January 16, 1997, with the call letters KXGL. KXGL was acquired in 1998 by Jacor Communications, which was later acquired by Clear Channel Communications. On August 10, 1998, KXGL dropped the classic hits music format and call letters, switching to soft adult contemporary music as KJQY, known as K-Joy 94.1 to compete with leading AC station KYXY.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-08-07.pdf (The K-Joy call sign was on a previous KYXY competitor, KJQY, which is now the current incarnation of KSON.) In 2000, KJQY changed to a new format called Soft Oldies. When Oldies station KBZT left the format in November of that year, KJQY became a mainstream oldies station (later moving to 95.7 and 99.3 and rebranded as \\"KOOL\\").http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-11-24.pdf =Hot AC (2001‚Äìpresent)= Pre-launch poll; holiday music On November 21, 2001, KJQY swapped formats and call letters with Mix 95.7, also owned by Clear Channel. 94.1 (now with the placeholder KMSX calls) then began stunting with a loop of Christmas music. At the same time, the station administered a poll, asking listeners what they would like to hear, and later began informing listeners to find out the poll results at 3 p.m. on December 25, 2001. My 94.1 The stunting continued until the advertised date and time, which at that point, the station's callsign became KMYI, flipped to its present Hot AC format and branded as My 94.1. The first song under the Hot AC format was \\"Breathe\\" by Faith Hill.http://formatchange.com/kjqy-becomes- my-94-1/http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2002/RR-2002-01-04.pdf For a time, KMYI was simulcast in Temecula, California on KMYT until December 2, 2004, when KMYT switched to a smooth jazz format. Star 94.1 On September 19, 2005, noted San Diego radio duo \\"Jeff and Jer\\" came to KMYI, and the station was rebranded as Star 94.1, picking up both the morning show and the moniker from KFMB-FM, which had switched to adult hits and joined Jack FM earlier in the year. The station adopted the \\"San Diego's Best Variety\\" slogan to reflect its broadcast area, although it has recently began using the corporate \\"More Music, More Variety\\" slogan on air. Clear Channel Communications became iHeartMedia in 2014. Through all of the changes that have occurred since becoming a hot AC station, the one constant at KMYI had taken place during the final weeks of the year: Up until 2014, KMYI had an annual tradition of playing all Christmas music, returning to its regular Hot AC format on December 26. This ended in 2015 to focus on New Year's Eve music content instead. Today, KMYI's chief rivals are KYXY, which has moved closer to a Hot AC format to gain younger listeners, and KXSN, which broadcasts a Classic Hits format and calls itself Sunny 98.1, Competition for this station is established by playing songs from the 1990s at the bottom of each hour. Morning shows KMYI has had many morning shows throughout the years: When the station first flipped to Hot AC in 2001, KMYI recruited Jagger and Kristi, their tenure lasted until summer 2005, when they would move to XHRM. On rebranding to \\"Star 94.1\\" in 2005, KMYI picked up the Jeff and Jer Showgram. 2005 also saw the addition of notable personality Delana, who originally came in to co-host with Jeff and Jer. On August 20, 2009, Jeff and Jer exited Star 94.1 to be replaced by AJ Machado from sister Top 40 station KHTS-FM. On August 31, 2009, \\"AJ in the Morning\\" debuted on Star 94.1 with most of the former \\"Playhouse\\" cast, with the exception of Geena The Latina, who remains at KHTS-FM. In June 2012, the morning show was replaced with Jesse Lozano, who re-located to San Diego to host mornings on KMYI. Jesse also voicetracks in afternoons on KIIS-FM in Los Angeles, and is also known as Boy Toy Jesse. On August 16, 2019, it was announced that KMYI will welcome Tati (coming from KSSX), as their new morning co-host. The newly rebranded \\"Jesse and Tati\\" program debuted on August 26. This change comes as outgoing co-host Delana announced her move to the afternoon drive spot, in addition to her role on iHeart's Pride Radio network.

It was designed for Mastertronic's Arcadia Systems, an arcade machine based on the custom hardware of the Amiga, and was released in 1987. It was ported to a range of other platforms and released on these across 1988 and 1989. Electronic Arts distributed the Amiga version of the game. Gameplay Taking the role of a monster, the player must destroy buildings in search of eggs. The goal of the game is to find the golden dragon's egg. The player controls one of two monsters who must destroy buildings in order to find Roc eggs, the discovery of each of which triggers a fight with a rival monster. When five eggs are found, the two monsters fight on a volcano to claim the dragon's egg. The game is an action game with fighting game elements. The player chooses to play as either a dragon-like lizard or an ogre (depicted as a cyclops in the game); the character that the player does not select becomes the player's rival to obtain the egg. In the arcade version of the game either one or two players could play simultaneously, whereas on the ports only one player could play at a time. Gameplay takes place across the ten cities of the Lost Island, each representing a different era of civilisation (such as ancient Egypt and the Wild West) and each comprising one level of the game. Each city is represented by a single static playing area that uses a form of 2.5D projection in order to give the impression of depth on the screen. Reception The game received mixed reviews from gaming magazines across the platforms to which it was ported, with scores ranging from around 2/10 (or equivalent) up to almost 9/10. While reviewers praised the graphics and sound, particularly on the Amiga port, they criticised the gameplay - ACE magazine said that although the game had \\"good graphics, atmospheric sound and good gameplay\\" there was not enough challenge to the game and that players would \\"not want to spend much time playing a game you know you can beat easily\\" \\\\- and ZX Spectrum reviewers were unimpressed by the fact that the game required levels to be loaded individually, with Your Sinclair magazine describing it as a \\"multi-level, multi-load, beat 'em, blowtorch 'em up which'll have you screaming its title each time you die and have to reload\\". The game was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #141 by Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers normally assign a rating to a game ranging from 1 up to 5 stars, but they disliked this game so much that they ranked it with an \\"X\\" instead. See also *Crush, Crumble and Chomp!

They compete in the National Ice Hockey League (NIHL) National League, the second tier of English Ice Hockey. From the 20/21 NIHL season, the club will be based in Slough, Berkshire, UK. History =Early years= The Bracknell Bees were formed in 1987, under the ownership of John Nike OBE. Bees began life in the Heineken League Division Two, under the leadership of former Durham Wasps and Nottingham Panthers forward, Jamie Crapper, where they finished 6th. The following season, Heineken withdrew their sponsorship of the second division, which was renamed the English League Division 1. Bees narrowly missed out on the championship to the Humberside Seahawks, but then won the league the following season, gaining promotion to the Heineken League Division 1. Having finished third, behind Humberside and the Slough Jets, Bees progressed to the top tier of British hockey, the Heineken Premier Division, via the play-offs, alongside the Seahawks. Once at the top, it was a struggle and Bees were regularly mid-table or below, before eventually being relegated in 1995, under the leadership of Mike Urquhart. =New beginning= That sparked a new beginning for the club. Urquhart left and was replaced by Jim Fuyarchuck, who re-installed the feel-good factor at the Hive (Nickname of the Bees home, the John Nike Leisuresport Complex) Bees again finished third in the first division (No longer sponsored by Heineken) but this time, they missed out to Milton Keynes Kings in the promotion play-offs. However, this did not matter, as the following season saw the formation of a new league ‚Äì The Ice Hockey Superleague (ISL) which was the country's first fully professional league since the 1950s. Bees were expected to be one of the smaller teams in this big league, playing against teams with big arenas. However, a creditable 6th of 8 was followed by a 3rd-place finish and then a fourth, before Bees did the unthinkable and took the Superleague title. Coach Dave Whistle, in only his second season as a coach, took the little club to the very top =Slippery slope= Things went downhill from there. A new club, Belfast Giants, tempted Whistle away with a lucrative package and he was closely followed by seven of the championship-winning squad. Whistle repeated the feat, winning the ISL in his second season. Meanwhile, Whistle was replaced by Enio Saccillotto, who never managed to recover from only having three players return. Bees did finish a creditable third in his first season, but never really looked like one of the better teams in the league. From this point forwards, the Bees never looked like returning to the 'top table' of British Ice Hockey. The Bees eventually announced that they were to leave the ISL at the end of the 2002‚Äì2003 season. With Manchester and Ayr having ceased operations during the season, the Bees announcement finally spelt the end of the ISL as a viable league. The Bees joined the British National League and were instantly tipped as being major contenders for the title. However, they finished just fourth in their first season, before going on to win the league and cup double in their second season. Ironically, as with the ISL winning team, the Bees were coached by an ex Bees player, Mike Ellis, again coaching in his second season. =The Taylor Times= After the double winning season, Mr Nike announced that he was no longer going to be funding the Bees. Up stepped local Estate Agent, David Taylor. David was a sponsor of the Bees and along with his wife Sharon and coach Mike Ellis, they set up a new club. Mr Nike granted them a licence to use the name \\"Bracknell Bees\\" for marketing purposes for a three-year period. At this time, Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers decided to resign from the British National League in order to join the premier Elite Ice Hockey League. As this would leave the BNL with only five teams; and thus with little option but to fold, the Capitals and Vipers temporarily withdrew their applications so as to allow the remaining BNL teams to apply for EIHL status. However, terms could not be agreed between the EIHL and the remaining five BNL teams; leading the Capitals and Vipers to resubmit their original applications and join the EIHL; which ultimately resulted in the closure of the BNL. This led the Bees, along with fellow former BNL members Hull Stingrays and, the Bees biggest rivals, Guildford Flames, to move to the EPIHL. Coach Mike Ellis put together a mix of youth and experience and they tasted some success in their first EPL season. As well as finishing a respectable 5th in the league, Bees made it to the play-off final, beating the Sheffield Scimitars in the semi-finals at the SkyDome Arena in Coventry. Bracknell came up short in the final though, against the Milton Keynes Lightning. However, The Bees did go one better a few weeks earlier, in the EPL Cup, winning the two legged final against the Hull Stingrays in March. Mike Ellis departed to become head coach of the Nottingham Panthers in May 2006 and was replaced on 25 May, by his assistant, Ryan Aldridge, with Lee Ealey-Newman bench coach. 10 months later, On 11 March 2007, the Bracknell Bees were crowned champions of the English Premier Ice Hockey League for the 2006/2007 season, following a 3‚Äì0 shut-out of the Romford Raiders, as the only remaining contenders for the title, the Sheffield Scimitars lost at Milton Keynes. Not content with one trophy though, Bees followed it up with their first ever play-off success at the SkyDome Arena in Coventry, overcoming the Peterborough Phantoms 2‚Äì1 in a semi-final shoot-out, before defeating archrivals and the previous season's league champions, the Guildford Flames, 3‚Äì2, in the final. In April 2007, David and Sharon Taylor announced that they were to take on the ownership of the Basingstoke Bison as well as the Bees. With this announcement, came the news that head coach, Ryan Aldridge was to move to the Bison as their new head coach and be replaced as Bees player/coach, by defenceman Dwight Parrish. Dwight Parrish re-signed the bulk of the previous season's double-winning team, but lost influential forward, Lukas Smital. Smital was replaced by Michal Kanka and Peter Jasik and the team continued to enjoy success, before off-ice problems started to set in. The Taylors ran into financial difficulties early in the season and their contract with Planet Ice to run the Bison was terminated. The troubles were mirrored at the Bees and following rumours of unpaid bills, player wages and team unrest, the Taylors announced in December 2007 that they were to relinquish the operating licence for the Bees. At the time in spite of the off ice difficulties, the Bees were sitting in second place in the English Premier Ice Hockey League, 1 point adrift of leaders, Guildford Flames, were through to the semi-finals of the EPL cup and in a good position in the Knock-out cup. =Supporter-led takeover= Within a week of the Taylors walking away from the club, Bees fan Katie Eleftheriou and then Supporters Club Chairman Stuart Robinson formed Bees Ice Management Ltd to take over the operating licence and came up with a rescue plan to see the club through to the end of the season, if fans were willing to help through pledging donations. This they did and the club successfully completed the season, finishing in 3rd place in the league, winning the EPL cup and finishing runner up to Slough Jets in the play-off final. For the 2008‚Äì2009 season Dwight Parrish returned to the Manchester Phoenix and was replaced as head coach by the previous season's captain, Adam Bicknell. During the season, Bicknell recruited Peter Russell as a bench coach, after Russell had been released by Swindon Wildcats. Bees finished the season in 5th place in the EPL before going out of the play-offs in a two- legged quarter final to Slough Jets, 7‚Äì5 on aggregate. Bees reached the semi- final of the EPL Cup, where they lost 6‚Äì4 on aggregate to Peterborough Phantoms who went on to take all four trophies on offer for the season, leaving the Bees with no trophies for the first time in 5 seasons. During the 2008‚Äì2009 season, Eleftheriou and Robinson announced that they would not continue to run the Bees beyond the end of the campaign. This was announced mid season in an effort to allow time for a new owners to be found and make the relevant arrangements with John Nike Leisuresport, who would issue the operating licence. Unfortunately, with parties interested, deadlines came and went and were extended, but no deal could be reached. At the last moment in the absence of any alternative owner, Eleftheriou and Robinson announced that they would continue with revised budgets, rather than see the club fold. Unfortunately, by that stage the majority of the team had signed elsewhere, while coach Adam Bicknell announced that he was to retire to play local league football instead. With little time to build a new team, Bees recruited Claude Dumas as player coach, after his club Telford Tigers announced that they were to mothball. Dumas recruited three imports from the French Elite League, forwards Michal Pinc and Jaroslav Cesky, along with Dutch international defenceman, Chad Euverman. Euverman announced after the start of the season that he would not be joining up with his new team and was soon replaced by the previous seasons fans' favourite, Andrius Kaminskas. Only two EIHA trained players returned from the previous season, Ryan Watt and Danny House. As well as being joined after the start of the season by Kaminskas, December also saw a surprise returnee, when Adam Bicknell rejoined the team. After Dumas took the decision to retire from hockey at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, Gareth Cox was appointed as the new head coach. Cox had been the coach the Bracknell Hornets English National League team for a number of years, leading them to a playoff title before moving to the Bees. He brought a number of young players with him from the Hornets and kept the core of Dumas' squad from the previous year together including EPL player of the year Jaroslav Cesky who stayed at the club with line mate Pinc despite receiving rumoured lucrative offers from elsewhere. However, things didn't go to plan and Bees finished the season at the foot of the EPL table. For the 2011‚Äì12 season, assistant coach, Greg Randall left to join the Peterborough Phantoms and was replaced by Lukas Smital, a former Bee and Cox's former assistant with the Hornets. Sm√≠tal was already the head coach of the Bracknell Ice Hockey Club and upon his return to the Bees, also took on the role of head coach to their senior team, Bracknell Hornets, while Cox also took on the head coach role with the Under 18 team, Bracknell Drones. Together, the pair set about rebuilding the Bees from the bottom up, bringing back former Bees, Martin M√°≈°a, Matt Foord, Shaun Thompson, Carl Graham, Tom Annetts and Brad Watchorn, and adding some players used to competing at the top end of the table, including Guildford captain, Rob Lamey and Slough pair, Michael Bowman and Andy Munroe. Bees showed a big improvement, doubling their points tally of the previous season, but still missing out on post-season play, finishing 9th, with only Telford behind them 2012-13 saw far less changes, with coach Gareth Cox choosing to just tweak what he had. Peter Jasik moved from the Bees to the Hornets and giant Latvian defenceman, Sergejs Louskins both departed, and Bees went with two import defencemen in Jan Bendik and Marcel Petran. Petran had a good offer from abroad during the season and left, to be replaced by Pavel Strycek. The tweaks worked and Bees made the play-offs, with a 6th-place finish, but after a first leg win against Manchester, a 7‚Äì2 defeat in Altrincham saw Bees exit at the quarter final stage =Precision Sports Marketing= Eleftheriou and Robinson confirmed their standing down in April 2013 and in their place Precision Sports Marketing (PSM) were confirmed by John Nike Leisuresport the following month from the 2013‚Äì14 season. PSM, led by former Bracknell junior Ben Beecher and local businessman Andrew Cross, stated an ambition to make the Bees vibrant, visible and viable and the best family sporting experience in Berkshire. In doing so, the aim is to build a sustainable sporting entertainment experience for the supporters, raise attendance at home games, and recognise the role played by many in the wider Bees family. \\"The Bees have to be financially viable, history tells us that. Next season, we intend to introduce fresh sponsorship and advertising packages as well as innovative ticket incentives for all our loyal supporters. It‚Äôs time to get out the arm chair and get down to the Hive\\", stated Cross. The new owners also see the Bracknell Bees as being the top segment of the overall Bracknell Ice Hockey Club with the junior teams being instrumental in developing future Bees, with a clear focus on the wider value of the junior setup within the local community. On the personnel front, Beeching moved quickly to re-sign Head Coach Gareth Cox and Player/Assistant Coach Lukas Smital who had led the team to a sixth-place finish in the English Premier League and a playoff quarter final in the previous season. Off ice, the management were supplemented with a team of marketing and management experts as well as the Bees Supporters Club to help guide the club towards their vision. John Nike Leisuresport Limited, which issues the license to operate the Bees, was equally excited with the PSM appointment. \\"We received several expressions of interest and proposals but the PSM business plan offered the best all round package for the Bees and Bracknell\\", commented Director Martin Weddell. \\"Their recognition of the efforts put in by the previous team and their innovative future plans were key factors in making our due diligence decision. We put forward the business proposal of PSM to John Nike Founder & Chairman, who has agreed to the granting of the Bees Licence to PSM, commenting that he is delighted with the prospect of the continuation of the Bracknell Bees under the operational direction of PSM with its undoubted business intentions to grow the team and its reputation. 2013/15 season, the first for PSM was not without its tests. Some difficult decisions had to be made, including the mid-season release of head coach, Gareth Cox, replaced by his assistant, Lukas Smital, who became player coach. Shortly after, import forward, Kamil Tvrdek, who signed from MK Lightning in the summer, was released and the decision was taken to complete the season with just three imports, with the goal being to make the play-offs. Helped by the strong emergence of youngsters, Harvey Stead and Vanya Antonov, Bees achieved this goal on the penultimate weekend of the season. In a repeat of the previous season, Bees played Manchester in the quarter finals and after winning the first leg, went down in the away leg to the newly crowned champions. The big plus of the season was the increase in crowd sizes, helping to put Bees in a strong position for the next season 2014/15 season was a big struggle, with Bees winning just 7 of their 48 league games, finishing bottom of the league. The positive part of the season was the emergence of several young prospects. Vanya Antonov, in his first full season was the team's top British scorer, while youngsters Josh (Tiger) Tetlow, Tom Relf, and Ziggy Beasley got their chances on two way contracts, as Bees looked to development for the future =Red Hockey Ltd Acquires Significant Shareholding= It was announced in March 2015, that Red Hockey Ltd, the company which also owns the Telford Tigers, had purchased a significant shareholding of 49% in the Bracknell Bees from Precision Sports Marketing. However, the major shareholding of Bracknell Bees will remain under the control of Precision Sports Marketing, led by Ben Beeching and Andrew Cross. =Save the Bees= In March 2016 PSM withdrew from the ownership of the Bracknell Bees. A supporters based ownership started by Lukas Smital (Head Coach) commenced. Lukas approached the support & services of Matt Fettel and Carol to make up the trio who would approach Mr John Nike for the license of the Bracknell Bees and look to seek re-entry into the Premier Division. Together with the valued council of a number of key contributors - Stuart Robinson & Katie Eleftheriou - Previous Owners, Mr Paul Newberry and Mr Chris Reilly the new directors were able to quickly understand areas that needed focus, together with the lessons & vast experience they have had being around the club for many years. So the Save the Bees Campaign was launched with a number of key aims: 1\\\\. Save the immediate future of the club by raising cash flow to seek re-entry. 2\\\\. Raise awareness of the club's position to seek potential sponsors & partners 3\\\\. Recover lost relationships 4\\\\. Improvements to the match night experience 5\\\\. Leave the club in a better position for its future The campaign was supported by local media including Heart FM, BBC, BBC Berkshire, Bracknell News, Reading Chronicle and the Wokingham Paper.https://www.getreading.co.uk/sport/ice- hockey/save-bracknell-bees-campaign-running-11364650 In June 2016, against the odds, both financially and time, the club raised enough revenue to commence the season and was granted entry into the EPL The Directors were keen to point out that it is thanks to fans, volunteers, sponsors and partners that the club was saved. The club looks forward to contributing to the 2016/2017 EPL Season. =Closure of the Hive= In May 2020, the Bees announced that the JNL Bracknell Complex were \\"commencing meaningful statutory consultations on potential staff redundancies.\\" due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fans were assured that season tickets would be refunded, should the club be unable to participate in the upcoming 20/21 season, promising a further update after the 30-day statutory consultation period. In July 2020, the Bees announced that the Hive would be permanently closed with immediate effect, after a financially viable plan to keep the complex open could not be found. The Bees assured fans that positive progress was being made in finding a new home for the 20/21 season and beyond, stating \\"whilst the Hive may have closed, the club will live on. Whilst bricks and mortar are important, this club is about people, family and community\\". In August 2020, the Bees announced they would be playing their home games out of the Slough Ice Arena, sharing with the Slough Jets organisation. Due to the change of location, from this point on the Bracknell Bees Ice Hockey Club became the Bees Ice Hockey Club. Standout players Bees have had several stand-out players, a few of whom are listed below: *Jamie Crapper was the Bees first coach, he was recruited by Mr John Nike OBE. with the task of creating the Bracknell Bees ice hockey team which entered the British Heineken League in 1987.

Army Recognition. 15 May 2020.  Design and features  A naval strike missile is fired from the in 2019 The state-of-the-art design and use of composite materials is meant to give the missile sophisticated stealth capabilities. The missile will weigh slightly more than 400 kg (880 lb) and have a range of more than 185 km (100 nm). NSM is designed for littoral waters (\\"brown water\\") as well as for open sea (\\"green and blue water\\") scenarios. The usage of a high strength titanium alloy blast/fragmentation warhead from TDW is in line with the modern lightweight design and features insensitive high-explosive. Warhead initiation is by a void-sensing Programmable Intelligent Multi-Purpose Fuze designed to optimise effect against hard targets. Like its Penguin predecessor, NSM is able to fly over and around landmasses, travel in sea skim mode, and then make random manoeuvres in the terminal phase, making it harder to stop by enemy countermeasures. While the Penguin is a yaw-to-turn missile, NSM is based on bank-to-turn flight (see Yaw (flight) and flight control). In 2016, it was confirmed by the Royal Norwegian Navy that NSM also can attack land targets. The target selection technology provides NSM with a capacity for independent detection, recognition, and discrimination of targets at sea or on the coast. This is possible by the combination of an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker and an onboard target database. NSM is able to navigate by GPS, inertial and terrain reference systems. After being launched into the air by a solid rocket booster which is jettisoned upon burning out, the missile is propelled to its target in high subsonic speed by a turbojet sustainer engine‚Äîleaving the 125 kg multi-purpose blast/fragmentation warhead to do its work, which in case of a ship target means impacting the ship at or near the water line. An NSM coastal battery consists of three missile launch vehicles, one battery command vehicle, three combat command vehicles, one mobile communication center, one mobile radar vehicle with TRS-15C radar, one transport and loading vehicle, and one mobile workshop vehicle. Each MLV carries 4 missiles and can be connected to the CCV by optical fiber or radio up to away; up to 6 launchers with 24 missiles can be netted together at once.Kongsberg showcasing Polish Navy's NSM Coastal Battery vehicles at MSPO 2014 - Navyrecognition.com, 3 September 2014 When installed on ships, NSMs can be deck-mounted in packs of one, two, three, four, or six launchers.

This missile is called Joint Strike Missile (JSM) and will feature an option for ground strike and a two-way communications line, so that the missile can communicate with the central control room or other missiles in the air. This missile will be integrated with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. Studies have shown that the F-35 would be able to carry two of these in its internal bays, while additional missiles could be carried externally.

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1761. It is a very distinctive species with very dark brown, almost black, forewings marked with a large white stigma from which the species gets its common name. The hindwings are grey with a dark band at the termen. The wingspan is 38‚Äì50 mm. It flies at night in July and August and is attracted to light, sugar and flowers. Larva Distribution The distribution area ranges from Spain in the west to Korea and Japan. It is found throughout Europe apart from the south-east. To the north it is found in Scotland and southern Fennoscandia, east through southern Russia, the Russian Far East and Siberia and Central Asia to the Kamchatka Peninsula. Then northern China to Korea and Japan. The southern boundary runs through northern Spain, Italy (except for Sicily), Macedonia, Bulgaria, Asia Minor, the southern Caucasus, northern Iran. In the Alps it rises up to about 1000 m.

In recent times colours have been increasingly used as trade marks in the marketplace. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect colours as trademarks through registration, as a colour as such was not considered to be a distinctive 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass \\"any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\\" (article 15(1)). Despite the recognition which must be accorded to colour trade marks in most countries, the graphical representation of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue. This category of trade marks is distinguished from conventional (word or logo) trade marks that feature a specific colour or combination of colours; the latter category of trade marks present different legal issues. Registration of colour marks in different jurisdictions =India= In India, a colour mark can be registered provided the consumers directly link the colour with the brand. The application might be refused if a single colour is claimed as it is difficult to prove distinctiveness with just a single colour. =Australia= Requirements are set out in the Trade Marks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure issued by IP Australia. =European Union= In the European Union, Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94 of 20 December 1993 (\\"signs of which a Community Trade Mark may consist\\") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of \\"any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\\". In Libertel Groep v Benelux Merkenbureau (case C-104/01) dated May 6, 2003 the ECJ repeats the criteria from Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00) that graphical representation preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective. This definition generally encompasses colour marks, and therefore an applicant for a CTM or a national trademark in the EC may define their colour trademark using an international colour code such as RAL or Pantone. In most cases, a colour trademark will be registered only after an enhanced distinctiveness through use in the EC has been proved. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, trade marks consisting of colours or combinations of colours can be registered. However, an applicant's ability to register colour trade marks is limited by several considerations, in line with European Union jurisprudence. Thus, for example, while a trade mark described simply as a colour is registrable, a trade mark described as consisting \\"predominantly\\" of a particular colour is not. In a recent case, the High Court of Justice, Court of Chancery held that an application to register such a trade mark was permissible in Soci√©t√© des Produits Nestl√© S.A. v. Cadbury UK Limited (2012), but on appeal the Court of Appeal reversed the decision in October 2014.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/04/cadbury-dairy-milk- purple-trademark-blocked =United States= In the United States, the United States Court of Appeals ruled in 1985 that Owens Corning had the right to prevent competitors from using the colour pink in their insulation products, thus making Owens Corning the first company in the United States to trademark a colour. In 1995, the United States Supreme Court further acknowledged that a colour could be used as a trademark in the case of Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., Inc., 514 U.S. 159 (1995). The trademark owner must show that the trademark colour has acquired substantial distinctiveness, and the colour indicates source of the goods to which it is applied. Functionality bar The Lanham Act specifically states that \\"[n]o trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it (e) Consists of a mark which (5) comprises any matter that, as a whole, is functional.\\" . If a colour is held functional for any product, then it is not registrable or protectable as a trademark. Several U.S. Courts have dealt with the matter, and colours have been held functional for various purposes. In Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co., 90 USPQ2d 1425 (TTAB 2007), the purple colour was considered functional for coated abrasives, because ‚Äú[i]n the field of coated abrasives, color serves a myriad of functions, including color coding, and the need to color code lends support for the basic finding that color, including purple, is functional in the field of coated abrasives having paper or cloth backing.‚Äù Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co., 90 USPQ2d 1425, 1447 (TTAB 2007). The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, in In re Ferris Corp., 59 USPQ2d 1587 (TTAB 2000), held that the colour pink for wound dressings was functional and not registrable, as its colour resembles human skin and was selected for this specific purpose. In In re Orange Communications, Inc., 41 USPQ2d 1036 (TTAB 1996), the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board denied registration for the colours orange and yellow for public telephones and telephone booths, because it confers the goods better visibility under any lighting condition. Also, the colour coral was held functional for earplugs, because it makes them easier to see in safety checks. In re Howard S. Leight & Associates Inc., 39 USPQ2d 1058 (TTAB 1996). Aesthetical functionality bar In addition to the functionality bar, the colour cannot have an aesthetically functional purpose in order to be registrable or protected. In Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull, for example, the United States Patents and Trademark Office's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board held that the black colour was not registrable for outboard motors: \\"[A]lthough the color black is not functional in the sense that it makes these engines work better, or that it makes them easier or less expensive to manufacture, black is more desirable from the perspective of prospective purchasers because it is color compatible with a wider variety of boat colors and because objects colored black appear smaller than they do when they are painted other lighter or brighter colors. The evidence shows that people who buy outboard motors for boats like the colors of the motors to be harmonious with the colors of their vessels, and that they also find it desirable under some circumstances to reduce the perception of the size of the motors in proportion to the boats.\\" British Seagull Ltd. v. Brunswick Corp., 28 USPQ 2d 1197, 1199 (1993). Even though there is no direct function for the colour black in this case, protection was denied under the argument that consumers prefer it for aesthetic purposes. A similar judgement was entered in Deere & Co. v. Farmhand. Deere & Co. tried to establish exclusive use of its John Deere green colour as a trademark, in order to enjoin Farmhand from applying it to its products. Although the John Deere green colour does not provide any specific function to the good to which it is applied, the United States District Court for S.D. Iowa \\"found that farmers prefer to match their loaders to their tractor\\". Deere & Co. v. Farmhand, Inc., 560 F. Supp. 85, 98 (U.S. Dist. Court S.D. Iowa, 1982). Therefore, if Deere & Co. were awarded exclusive use of the John Deere green, its competitors would be in disadvantage because of reasons unrelated to the functional quality or price of its products. =Examples= File:Henninger Turm 2006 -T-Mobile Team-b.jpgT-Mobile's magenta File:Tram in Sofia near Macedonia place 2012 PD 044.jpgLilac of Milka-chocolate File:Tiffany4men.jpgBlue of Tiffany & Co., Pantone 1837 File:Skalm 2.JPGOrange of Fiskars scissors File:Reese's logo.svgAgain, the color orange in Reese's.

The name may refer to the pie's frequent presence on wedding menus, or to Margaret Bridie of Glamis, \\"who sold them at the Buttermarket in Forfar\\". They are similar to pasties, but because they are made without potatoes, are much heavier in texture. Bakers in Forfar traditionally use shortcrust pastry for their bridies, but in the rest of Scotland, flaky pastry is sometimes substituted. The filling of a bridie consists of minced steak, butter, and beef suet seasoned with salt and pepper. It is sometimes made with minced onions. Before being baked, the bridie's filling is placed on pastry dough, which is then folded into a semi-circular or triangular shape; finally, the edges are crimped. If the baker pokes one hole in the top of a bridie, this indicates that it is plain, or without onions; two holes means that it does contain onions a convention which is applied also to a Scotch pie.

He also taught at Georgetown University Law Center from 1974 to 1978. In 1979, Randolph was appointed Special Counsel to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (the Ethics Committee) of the United States House of Representatives, remaining in this position until 1980. He then stayed in private practice, becoming a partner at Pepper, Hamilton & Scheetz, until he moved to the bench in 1990. He held a number of positions while in private practice, including Special Assistant Attorney General for the states of New Mexico (1985‚Äì90), Utah (1986‚Äì1990) and Montana (1983‚Äì1990). He also served as a Member of the Advisory Panel of the Federal Courts Study Committee. From 1971 to 1990, Randolph argued 23 times in the United States Supreme Court. Federal judicial service Randolph was nominated by President George H. W. Bush on May 8, 1990, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated by Judge Spottswood William Robinson III.Pres. Nom. 1240, 101st Cong. (1990). He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 13, 1990, and received commission on July 16, 1990. He assumed senior status on November 1, 2008. From 1993 through 1995 Judge Randolph was a member of the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States, and from 1995 to 1998 served as the Committee's chairman. On July 3, 2019, after District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan received a message regarding a July 12, 2019 event co- sponsored by judiciary branch's research and education agency, he forwarded the email to about 45 judges and their staffs to alert them to an upcoming climate-change seminar. His note said only, \\"just FYI.\\" Within an hour, Randolph replied via a \\"Reply all,\\" response to Sullivan and all those who had been copied on the forwarded email. He questioned Sullivan's ethics and recommended he get \\"back into the business of judging, which are (sic) what you are being paid to do. As a former chairman of the federal judiciary's ethics committee, I think you have crossed the line. Should I report you? I don‚Äôt know?\\" Characterizing Sullivan's first message as having subjected, \\"...our colleagues to this nonsense,\\" Randolph suggested he had breached judicial decorum: \\"The jurisdiction assigned to you does not include saving the planet. A little hubris (sic) would be welcomed in many of your latest public displays. The supposedly (sic) science and stuff you are now sponsoring is nothing of the sort.\\" Sullivan responded to Randolph and all who had been copied: \\"I sincerely regret that you were offended by my email! I merely forwarded an email announcing a seminar sponsored in conjunction with the support of the Federal Judicial Center. I have no stake in that seminar.\\" Two other judges defended Sullivan to those copied on the exchange. One wrote to explain the purpose of the Center's presentation and noting that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. chaired a board which had approved of the event. The second characterized Randolph's outburst as \\"accusatory,\\" and \\"quite disturbing.\\"A federal judge in D.C. hit 'Reply All,' and now there's a formal question about his decorum, The Washington Post, Ann E. Marimow, August 16, 2019. Retrieved August 26, 2019. Notable cases In 2006, Judge Randolph found that a rule by Security and Exchange Commission requiring hedge funds to consider natural persons as clients was arbitrary and capricious. In June 2017, Randolph partially dissented when the court found that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act did not prevent the survivors of a Holocaust victim from suing to recover art stolen by Nazi plunderers.. =Guantanamo Bay= Al Odah v. United States was the first appeal before the D.C. Circuit challenging the Bush Administration's policies regarding detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay. In Al Odah, Judge Randolph wrote for a unanimous panel that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay did not have rights under the United States Constitution. That decision was reversed by the Supreme Court in Rasul v. Bush. The United States Congress subsequently passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which was intended to reverse the effect of the Supreme Court's decision in Rasul. Judge Randolph also wrote the majority opinion for the D.C. Circuit in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. Hamdan involved a challenge to the Bush Administration's military commissions to try designated \\"enemy combatants\\" at Guantanamo Bay. Judge Randolph held for a unanimous court that the Administration had authority to conduct the commissions and that they were not in violation of the Geneva Conventions. Judge Stephen Williams concurred in the judgment, disagreeing on the latter point. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. Again, the United States Congress passed legislation, this time the Military Commissions Act of 2006, to reverse the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling. Rasul v. Bush became Boumediene v. Bush when it came again before the D.C. Circuit. Judge Randolph again wrote the majority opinion. In Boumediene the court upheld the Military Commissions Act, which stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear petitions of habeas corpus from aliens detained by the US Military. This time Judge Judith Rogers dissented. The petitioners in Boumediene asked the Supreme Court to reverse Judge Randolph's opinion. The Court denied their petition, but, in an unusual move, later reversed itself and granted certiorari, then reversed.Boumediene v. Bush Oyez.org. Retrieved 7 January 2015. In March 2017, Randolph argued that the public has no First Amendment right to access prisoners' court filings when the court, unanimous in judgment but in divided opinions, found that the press could not access classified video of Jihad Ahmed Mustafa Dhiab being force fed during the Guantanamo Bay hunger strikes..

Factory was the first theatre to announce that it would exclusively produce Canadian plays, but it soon became a widely emulated policy by other theatre companies. Factory quickly became known as the home of the Canadian playwright, and is especially associated with George F. Walker, most of whose plays premiered there. For over four decades, Factory Theatre has developed and produced some of the finest theatrical works in Canada's national canon and been home to some of the most gifted and prolific playwrights in Canada. In any given year, more than 50,000 patrons come to Factory‚Äôs historic Victorian mansion at the corner of Bathurst and Adelaide Streets (in the heart of Toronto‚Äôs cultural west-end district) ‚Äì an inviting, inclusive environment where ideas and imagination intersect. Factory Theatre is unique in that it is committed solely to the development and production of Canadian plays through staged readings, workshops, Natural Resources (resident creation groups), writers‚Äô retreats, residencies, Factory Wired (festivals of new work in progress), and ultimately premiere productions. The Factory Theatre play development program is committed to the long-term investment of playwrights and creators and Canadian work that celebrates our diversity by engaging, provoking, entertaining, and inspiring our artists, audience and the community at large. Factory has been known as the home of the Canadian playwright as well as supporting a broad spectrum of forms and voices, and is also dedicated to serving its community by building a strong neighbourhood identity in its role as a cultural hub. Partnerships with local schools and businesses and initiatives, such as its Neighbours Nights and Curtain Raiser events, are what ground it as a remarkable artistic resource and cultural institution.  Building history  Architect Gundry and Langley designed the building in 1869. J.M. Cowan is considered the subsequent architect/consultant. Factory Theatre consists of two main buildings. The first is the original 1896 house and the second is the 1910 addition. The building is also known as the John Mulvey House. It was given heritage status by the Ontario Heritage Board in 1987. The original house was constructed in a classic Queen Anne Gothic design for the prominent Toronto merchant John Mulvey in 1869. It is attributed to architects Gundry & Langley. The house‚Äôs architectural features include: * an asymmetrical fa√ßade * an irregular gabled roof * a fine buff brickwork with stone sills and hood mouldings * a Gothic arch entry In 1909, the property was sold to the Roman Catholic Church, Parish of St. Mary and was used as their Arts and Literary Centre. The larger addition to the complex was built in 1910 and designed by J.M. Cowan. It includes a church hall set up in theatre style with an overhanging balcony still in use today. The addition‚Äôs main architectural features all face Adelaide Street. They are: * a distinctive fa√ßade * a central oriel window * two flanking entrances with arched transoms Before Factory Theatre occupied the building in 1983, it had been used as a residence, a manse, and a daycare.  Leadership history  In 1977, Gass's own play, Winter Offensive aroused widespread criticism because of what was regarded as its gratuitous depiction of sex and violence amongst the upper echelons of the Nazi party. Frustrated by what he saw as the conservatism of the community, Gass resigned. Dian English took over the role of managing director of the Factory (1977-1995) and moved the theatre to its current location in the historic building at the corner of Bathurst and Adelaide (125 Bathurst Street, Toronto, On) and pulled the struggling theatre out of debt into fiscal solvency. Gass was succeeded as artistic director of Factory by Bob White (1977‚Äì87), then Jackie Maxwell (1987‚Äì95). During much of this time George F. Walker came on as the in-house writer with plays such as The Art of War, Criminals in Love, Love and Anger, Escape from Happiness and Nothing Sacred. Other notable works included Crossing Over by Neil Munro, The Rez Sisters by Tomson Highway, Rick Mercer's one man show, Robert Lepage's The Dragon's Trilogy and The Kids in the Hall. English left in 1995 and Michael Springate came on as artistic director for one season, 1995-96. At this point, the theatre experienced a financial downturn and it was widely feared that the company might close for good. However, Gass returned in 1996 to resume the artistic directorship with the intention of putting the theatre back on its feet. His decision to perform all six of the plays in George F. Walker's Suburban Motel as a full season brought the theatre a remarkably swift return to popularity, relevance and financial prosperity. Gass was fired as artistic director in 2012 amid controversy.\\"The Interview: Factory Theatre‚Äôs artistic directors Nina Lee Aquino and Nigel Shawn Williams\\" . Toronto Life, January 24, 2013. Several playwrights, including Walker and Judith Thompson, pulled their work from the theatre in protest, and figures including Atom Egoyan, Gordon Pinsent, Fiona Reid and R. H. Thomson called for a boycott of the company. Since then theatre professionals and community partners have publicity supported Factory Theatre and its existing pursuit of New Canadian voices. Nina Lee Aquino and Nigel Shawn Williams were named the new artistic directors in late 2012. In December 2014, Factory Theatre presented a re-branding as \\"Factory. Theatre with Grit\\" and announced that Aquino was appointed sole artistic director. Factory's current artistic team includes Aquino as artistic director, Williams as associate artistic director and Jonathan Heppner as artistic producer.

Bridge of Splendor) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Situated in the Western Galilee on the coastal highway between Nahariya and the Lebanese border, opposite the Akhziv National Park, it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Asher Regional Council. In it had a population of . History Gesher HaZiv was founded on the land of the former Palestinian village of al-Zib, close to the village site. The kibbutz was founded in 1948 by two groups: 120 people from the first immigrants' gar'in of the Habonim Labor Zionist youth movement of North America, and half of the former members of kibbutz Beit HaArava, evacuated on 20 May, 1948 during the then-ongoing War of Independence. It is named in memory of the 14 Palmach members who were killed during the 1946 Night of the Bridges, and in relation to the ancient Phoenician and Arab village of Achziv whose nearby remains are part of a national park by the sea ‚Äì Achziv means disappointment, so the first core of \\"Chalutzim\\" (pioneers) decided to name the new settlement, just the opposite, as \\"joy\\", in spite of the failed 1946 operation as well as their own disappointment created by the recent evacuation from Beit HaArava. The kibbutz quickly became an agricultural success after its founding.\\"To See Son in Israel's 1st All American Colony\\", Nassau Daily Review-Star, July 1, 1949, p. 15 In July 1998, Gesher HaZiv joined the vanguard of \\"privatization\\" in the kibbutz movement. Largely due to pressures caused by collective debts, the majority of the membership voted to adopt a policy of \\"differential income\\". Numerous economic branches were sold off, and many communal services were either shut down entirely or converted to a non-subsidized, pay-per-use basis. Kibbutz homes were parceled into separate lots and became the private property of each kibbutz family. In 2004 the kibbutz began absorbing 200 families in a new housing development. The new families together with the veteran kibbutz members formed an administrative municipality which manages the community. The veteran members retained the framework of the veteran kibbutz. In this framework they have maintained a level of mutual aid and economic cooperation, while all community services and activities are shared by all members of the new municipality. From 2006, many children of the veteran members, who had left the kibbutz in previous years, began returning with their families to build their homes in the revitalized community. They have become members of the community municipality, but also of the veteran kibbutz framework. Education In 1952, Gesher HaZiv became the second kibbutz to have its children sleep in the parents' homes (, lina Mishpahtit) rather than in communal children's houses (, lina meshutefet). On the kibbutz grounds are two regional schools: the elementary school Hofei HaGalil (\\"Galilee Shores\\"; grades 1-6) and the experiential secondary school Sulam Tsor (\\"Ladder to Tyre\\"; grades 7-12). These schools serve local kibbutzim and moshavim, along with accepting private students from nearby towns. Since the mid-1990s, Gesher HaZiv has its own local chapter of the Zionist youth movement HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed.

This highway was created when a portion of SH 183 was rerouted on August 29, 1979. It is locally known as Hurst Boulevard and Euless Boulevard. It passes near the main facility of Bell Helicopter Textron. Route description SH 10 begins at the intersection of Interstate 820, SH 121, and SH 183 in Hurst. The highway travels east on Hurst Blvd, gradually turning to the northeast. The road name changes to Euless Blvd when it crosses Raider Drive. The route terminates in Euless when it reaches an intersection with SH 183 just west of SH 360. History left An earlier incarnation of SH 10 was one of the original twenty-five state highways proposed on June 21, 1917, overlaid on top of the Fort Worth-Brady-Fort Stockton Highway. In 1919 the routing was proposed from the New Mexico border to the junction of SH 54 and US 62. The proposed routing was never built. From the junction, SH 10 continued south over present-day SH 54 to Van Horn, then east on US 90 through Lobo to Alpine. The road continued eastward on present day US 67 into Fort Stockton, then followed present-day I-10 through Ozona and Sonora. From there, the road headed eastward on present-day RM 864 to US 190 through Brady. From there, it headed northeast on US 377 through Brownwood, Comanche, and Granbury toward its terminus in Fort Worth. In late July 1917, the segment from New Mexico to Lobo (still a proposed route) was assigned to the ambitious SH 12 roadway. On March 15, 1920, the routing from Alpine to Fort Stockton had not yet been built, so SH 10 and SH 12 were rerouted again in West Texas. SH 10 now left its old alignment at Valentine via the current RM 505 eastward to SH 166 and SH 17 into Fort Davis. A segment between Fort Davis and Fort Stockton was proposed using an old postal road, but the road was closed when SH 99 (later SH 10, now US 67) from Alpine to Fort Stockton was built. On August 21, 1923, SH 10 had lost all of its assignment west of Sonora, with the section concurrent with SH 27 dropped, the section from Fort Stockton to Valentine cancelled as it was never built, and west of there was transferred to SH 54, which was created to replace part of SH 12. The road was extended, however, through Fort Worth to Denton, replacing SH 40A. On November 19, 1923, the section of SH 10 from Brady to Sonora was cancelled. On March 16, 1925, SH 10 was extended north through Pilot Point to Tioga. On September 14, 1926, SH 10 was to be extended northeast to Sherman and southwest to Del Rio, with the designation not taken over until January 1, 1928. On February 20, 1928, the extension to Del Rio was modified to end 2 miles northeast of London. SH 10's north end was relocated to Whitesboro rather than Sherman. On March 3, 1931, the section of SH 10 from Brady to 2 miles northeast of London was cancelled, and SH 10 was rerouted on a new extension from Brady to Menard. On July 23, 1934, SH 10 was redirected southwest from Brownwood to Alpine, replacing SH 99. The old route to Menard became part of rerouted SH 23. On September 26, 1939, most of SH 10 was cancelled, leaving only the Denton- Whitesboro segment to the old highway. On January 29, 1942, SH 10 was extended to the Oklahoma border. On October 29, 1960, that highway was redesignated as SH 99 (now US 377), which, ironically, had taken most of the western SH 10 segments in the 1930s and also was replaced by SH 10. left SH 10A was a route near SH 10 designated on March 17, 1919, designated from Stephenville northeast to Dallas. On July 18, 1922, SH 10A extended to Strawn. On August 21, 1923, it had been redesignated as SH 68 (now US 67), and the section from Stephenville to Strawn was cancelled.

Thompson published numerous notes on the distribution, breeding, eggs, habitat, song, plumage, behaviour, nesting and food of birds. These formed the basis of his four- volume The Natural History of Ireland, and were much used by contemporary and later authors such as Francis Orpen Morris.http://www.birdcheck.co.uk/main/previewpages/previewpage35.htm Early years Thompson was born in the booming maritime city of Belfast, Ireland, the eldest son of a linen merchant, whose wealth would later permit Thompson to fund his own research without an academic affiliation. Thompson attended the newly formed Royal Belfast Academical Institution, where he got a degree in Biological Science. Founded by, amongst others, John Templeton, the school had a strong natural history section that produced a cohort of prominent naturalists. In 1826 he went on a Grand Tour accompanied by cousin George Langtry, a Fortwilliam, Belfast shipowner.Andrew O'Brien, Linde Lunney (2009). Thompson, William. In James McGuire, James Quinn (ed.), Dictionary of Irish Biography. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press. (http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a8529) They starting in the Netherlands then travelled through Belgium down the Rhine to Switzerland and on to Rome and Naples. They returned via Florence, Geneva and Paris. Thompson's first scientific paper, The Birds of the Copeland Islands, was published in 1827 shortly after he joined the Belfast Natural History Society. In these years he became a member of the Belfast Literary Society. Research Thompson contributed up-to-date information on the birds of Ireland to Selby's The Magazine of Zoology and Botany, The Annals of Natural History, The Magazine of Natural History, and the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, and prepared the first comprehensive list of Ireland's birds for the 1840 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Glasgow. Other work, primarily about birds, was published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London and the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Journal. These papers formed the basis of his seminal work‚ÄîThe Natural History of Ireland‚Äîpublished in three volumes between 1849 and 1851. He documented many rare species, that he learned about through being shot by his network of correspondents. These included the first Irish occurrences of Bonaparte's Gull and American Bittern. He never observed a Red Kite and noted 'The name of \\"Kite\\" appears commonly in the catalogues of birds given in the Statistical Surveys of the Irish counties, and elsewhere; but, as the larger species of the falconidae are in some places called Kite and Glead, as well as Goshawk or Goose-hawk, there can be no doubt that the buzzard, or some common species, was meant'. In 1834 Thompson began studying the distribution of marine animals in space (depth range) and time (seasonality). His first research was with Edward Forbes conducting dredging in the Irish Sea. Other participants were Robert MacAndrew, George Barlee, John Gwyn Jeffreys and his fellow Irishmen Robert Ball, Edmund Getty and George Crawford Hyndman. In 1835 he travelled in France, Switzerland and Germany with Forbes. Then in 1841 he joined Forbes and Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt on the Beacon commanded by Thomas Graves and working in the Mediterranean and Aegean. The expedition lasted eighteen months and conducted more than one hundred dredging operations at depths varying from 1 to 130 fathoms, as well as shore-based studies. Thompson focused on the depth range of algae, his main collection of which is in the Ulster Museum herbarium and consists of five large albumsAlgae collection.

The Marine Botanist; an Introduction to the Study of the British Sea-weeds;... Third edition. Brighton, London. George Dickie's Flora of Ulster contains records of Thompson's frequent botanical contributions and he is mentioned in William Baird's Natural History of British Entomostraca. Later years Thompson corresponded extensively on all aspects of natural history with naturalists in both Britain and Ireland, including with zoologist Thomas Bell who was at the heart of the English scientific establishment and two of the \\"Grandees\\" of the Zoological Society, Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William Ogilby. As Thompson's reputation spread, information was passed to him by interested observers all over Ireland. However his health became poor around 1847 or 1848, when he was 42, and he suffered from heart trouble from 1847. In 1852 Thompson died of a heart attack in LondonFairley, J.S. 1975.

Skalski was the top Polish fighter ace of the war and the first Allied fighter ace of the war, credited, according to the Bajan's list, with 18 11/12 victories and two probable. Some sources, including Skalski himself, give a number of 22 11/12 victories. He returned to the Polish Air Force after the Second World War and rose to the rank of brigadier general. Early life and career Stanis≈Çaw Skalski was born on 27 November 1915 in Kodyma in Podolia Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine). After completing Pilot Training School in 1938, Skalski was ordered to the 142nd Fighter Squadron in Toru≈Ñ (142 eskadra \\"Toru≈Ñska\\"). On 1 September 1939 he attacked a German Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft, which was eventually shot down by Marian Pisarek. Skalski then landed next to it, helped to bandage wounded crew members and arranged for them to be taken to a military hospital. The following day, nine PZL P-11s of the 142 Squadron, led by Major Lesnievski, intercepted two formations of Dornier Do 217 on River Vistula. Jackson 1979, p. 27. Attacking head on, the Polish pilots managed to shoot down seven twin-engined bombers, two of them credited to Skalski. Jackson 1979, pp. 28-29. By 16 September Skalski reached flying ace status, claiming a total of six German aircraft and making him the first Allied air ace of the Second World War. Skalski's claims consisted of one Junkers Ju 86, two Dornier Do 17, one Junkers Ju 87, two Hs 126s and one Hs 126 shared (official list credits him with four aircraft: two Do 17s, one Hs 126, one Ju 87 and one Hs 126 shared).Note: In this context \\"ace\\" means shooting down five or more enemy aircraft. Soon after he fled the country with other Polish pilots to Romania, and from there via Beirut to France and after went on to fight with the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain. RAF service Stanis≈Çaw Skalski In August 1940, Pilot Officer Skalski joined No. 501 Squadron RAF. From 30 August to 2 September 1940 he shot down a He 111 bomber and three Messerschmitt Bf 109s. On 5 September Skalski himself was shot down.According to some sources, he shot down a He 111 bomber and two Bf 109s in that flight, but there is no firm evidence, these victories were not acknowledged officially, and several other pilots also claimed these Bf 109s. Skalski bailed out with severe burns, and was hospitalized for six weeks. He returned to his unit in late October 1940. During the Battle of Britain, he was credited with four planes shot down and one shared. In March 1941 Skalski was assigned to No. 306 (Polish) Squadron RAF,Note: 306 Dywizjon My≈õliwski \\"Toru≈Ñski\\"; the unit insignia was derived from that of Skalski's original unit, 142 eskadry flying in Circus sorties over France. On 15 August 1941 he crashed while landing Spitfire W3170 after returning from a mission. On 1 March 1942, he became a flight commander in No. 316 (Polish) Squadron RAF. On 29 April 1942 Flight Lieutenant Skalski was made Commanding Officer of the No. 317 (Polish) Squadron RAF for five months. From November 1942 he was an instructor with No. 58 Operation Training Unit. In October 1942 Skalski was given command of the Polish Fighting Team (PFT), or so called \\"Cyrk Skalskiego\\" (Skalski's Circus) ‚Äì a special flight consisting of fifteen experienced Polish fighter pilot volunteers. The Poles arrived at Bu Grara airfield, west of Tripoli in March 1943 and attached to No. 145 Squadron RAF. The PFT took part in actions in Tripolitania and in Sicily. On 6 May 1943 the \\"Skalski Circus\\" fought its last battle. The unit was disbanded after the conclusion of the North African campaign. During its two months on operations, the Polish pilots had claimed a total of 26 German and Italian aircraft shot down. Skalski scored four aircraft, and Pilot Officer Eugeniusz Horbaczewski claimed five confirmed victories. Arthur Coningham (pictured left) and General Kazimierz Sosnkowski (pictured right). A Mustang flown by Stanis≈Çaw Skalski, Coolham, June 1944. Skalski then became commander of No. 601 (County of London) Squadron, the first Pole to command an RAF squadron. He then took part in the invasion of Sicily and invasion of Italy. From December 1943 to April 1944 Wing Commander Skalski commanded No. 131 Polish Fighter Wing. On 4 April 1944 he was appointed commander of No. 133 Polish Fighter Wing, flying the Mustang Mk III. On 24 June 1944 Skalski scored two air victories over Rouen. Skalski left for a tour of duty in the USA in September 1944, returning in February 1945 to a staff position at No. 11 Group. Return to Poland and arrest Stanis≈Çaw Skalski after arrest by communist political police 1948 After the war Skalski returned to Poland in 1947 and joined the Air Force of the Polish Army. In 1948 however he was arrested under the false charge of espionage. Sentenced to death, he spent three years awaiting the execution, after which his sentence was changed to life imprisonment in Wronki Prison. After the end of Stalinism in Poland, in 1956 he was released, rehabilitated, and allowed to join the military. He served at various posts in the Headquarters of the Polish Air Force. He wrote memoires of the 1939 campaign Czarne krzy≈ºe nad PolskƒÖ (\\"Black crosses over Poland\\", 1957). On 20 May 1968 he was nominated the secretary general of the Aeroklub Polski and on 10 April 1972 he retired. On 15 September 1988 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In 1990 he met with the German pilot he had rescued on the first day of the war. Stanis≈Çaw Skalski died in Warsaw on 12 November 2004.

His approach was derived from the hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer. Early years and education Jauss was born in G√∂ppingen, W√ºrttemberg, Germany, and died on 1 March 1997 in Constance, Germany. His family came from a long line of teachers. His religious background was pietism. Jauss‚Äôs Gymnasium studies took place in Esslingen and Geislingen between 1932 and 1939. As a young soldier in the Second World War, Jauss spent two winters on the Russian Front in the SS (SS-Nr. 401.359) and the Waffen-SS. In 1942, he was a member of the \\"SS- Freiwilligen-Legion Niederlande\\". In 1943, he was Obersturmf√ºhrer in the \\"11th SS-Freiwilligen-Legion Nordland\\". In 1944, he was Hauptsturmf√ºhrer in the SS reserve. Subsequently, he was part of the \\"33rd Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS Charlemagne\\".Ernst Klee, Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 282. In 1944, he was able to begin his studies and complete his first semester in occupied Prague. In November 1948 at Heidelberg, the twenty-seven-year-old Jauss, after postwar imprisonment, began studies in Romance Philology, Philosophy, History and Germanistik (German literature and linguistics). Teachers at that time who made an impact on his thought included Martin Heidegger and Hans Georg Gadamer. He was to remain there until 1954. In these years he made study trips to Paris and Perugia. The themes of past and the present, time and remembrance, were already engaging Jauss‚Äôs research from the time of his doctorate at the University of Heidelberg in 1952. His dissertation, under the direction of the philologist Gerhard Hess, was entitled Zeit und Erinnerung in Marcel Prousts ¬´√Ä la recherche du temps perdu¬ª. In 1957, with the treatise Untersuchungen zur mittelalterlichen Tierdichtung, he obtained his habilitation for Romance Philology at the University of Heidelberg.  Career  In 1959, Jauss took up his first teaching appointment as associate professor and director of the Romance Seminar at the University of M√ºnster, Westfalen. In 1961, he moved to the University of Gie√üen, where, as full professor, he helped in the restructuring of the Romance Seminar. It was in these years (1959‚Äì1962) that Jauss, along with Erich K√∂hler, founded a series of medieval texts entitled Grundri√ü der romanischen Literaturen des Mittelalters (Outline of Romance Literatures of the Middle Ages). In 1963, he also played a prominent role in establishing the research group \\"Poetik und Hermeneutik\\" with two other colleagues from Gie√üen (Hans Blumenberg and Clemens Heselhaus), along with Wolfgang Iser from W√ºrzburg. The year 1966 saw the founding of the University of Constance as part of the reform of the German university system taking place at that time. Jauss was invited by his former teacher Gerhard Hess to join the staff. Doing away with previous autonomous institutes, the new university at Constance was set up with a cooperative and cross-disciplinary structure of \\"Units of Teaching and Research,\\" following the Humboldt principle of developing teaching out of research. Working on numerous committees, Jauss was particularly involved with setting up the \\"subject area\\" (Fachbereiche) of literary studies (Literaturwissenschaft), an innovative structure at the time but soon to be emulated throughout Germany. Five professors, surrendering the privileges of departmental chairmanship in their different language fields, organised themselves into a research group that soon became known internationally as \\"The Constance School\\": Wolfgang Iser (English), Wolfgang Preisendanz (German), Manfred Fuhrmann (Latin), Hans Robert Jauss (Romance), and Jurij Striedter (Slavic). Jauss‚Äôs own inaugural lecture in 1967, entitled \\"Literary History as a Challenge to Literary Theory\\", was dramatic and programmatic in its call for a new approach to literary studies. The ensuing years saw an application and development of that program, at times in vigorous debate with a diversity of dialogue partners. Throughout his career, he was guest professor at the University of Z√ºrich (winter semester 1967/68); at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin (winter semester 1968/69); at Columbia University, New York (Fall 1973); at Yale University, New Haven (Spring 1976; turning down an offer to go there again in 1977); at the Sorbonne (Paris IV, winter semester, 1978); at the University of Leuven (Franqui-Professur, 1982); at the University of California, Berkeley (Spring 1982); at the University of California (1985); at Princeton University (Whitney J. Oates Visiting Fellow, February 1986); and at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (Brittingham Visiting Professor of English, March 1986).  Honors and death  In 1980 Jauss became a member of the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften. He was also honoured by the Italian Accademia dei Lincei. After his retirement on 1 April 1987 until his death in 1997, he lived near Constance as Professor Emeritus of the University. He died in Konstanz. Reevaluating Jauss's past In 1995, Jauss' SS dossier was first published by the Romance scholar Earl Jeffrey Richards, as part of an evaluation of attacks by former Nazis on Ernst Robert Curtius.Richards, Earl Jeffrey (1995). \\"La conscience europ√©nne chez Curtius et chez ses d√©tractuers,\\" in: Bem and Guyauz, Ernst Robert Curtius et l'id√©e d'Europe (Paris: Champion, pp. 257-258). Richards later documented Jauss's various falsehoods and fabrications after the war.Richards, Earl Jeffrey (1997). \\"Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung nach dem Kalten Krieg. Der Fall Hans Robert Jau√ü und das Verstehen,\\" in: Germanisten, Tidskrift f√∂r svensk germanistik, Zeitschrift schwedischer Germanisten 2.1, pp. 1-20. Despite his unmasking of Jauss's past, however, it would be another two decades before the academy as a whole took stock of his legacy. In 2014, the University of Konstanz commissioned the historian Jens Westemeier to examine Jauss's political and war-time past, leading to its re-evaluation. Westemeier's research demonstrated that Jauss was likely involved in war crimes (as a company commander in 1943 in a unit that later became known as the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division) and that Jauss falsified documents and glossed over his autobiography. Westemeier expanded on his work to later publish the monograph Hans Robert Jau√ü. Jugend, Krieg und Internierung (Hans Robert Jauss. Youth, War and Internment).Ahlrich Meyer: \\"Fake documents, beautifully colored biography\\", Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, 26 October 2016  Bibliography  * Jauss, Hans Robert.

Plot introduction The protagonists of the series are mostly immortal cyborgs, specifically the botanist Mendoza, and the Facilitator Joseph. They were recruited as children to serve the Company in its ostensible mission to preserve artifacts from the past for a better future. Like the second novel, Sky Coyote, this is a volume which fills in background that is not apparent to Mendoza, the narrator of the first and third books. The principal characters are Joseph and his friend, the Literature Specialist Lewis. Action starts in 1996 and continues through the next 250 years. Over this period the world changes profoundly. Japan suffers violent earthquakes and sinks into the sea. Japanese society relocates to Mexico. The USA fragments into independent republics. Animal rights movements and other activists pass laws eliminating the consumption of meat, dairy products, coffee, chocolate, alcohol, tobacco and many other stimulants and foods. Los Angeles becomes an anarchic war-zone walled off from the rest of California. Terrorists use a nuclear weapon to destroy Belfast, Northern Ireland. Anti-gravity is \\"re-discovered\\", having been known to the ancient Egyptians. =Explanation of the novel's title= Graveyards, both figurative and literal, recur as a motif in the narrative. Porfirio is introduced during a traditional visit to a cemetery on the Day of the Dead festival. The repositories where cyborgs, mostly Enforcers, are held in suspended animation, are a kind of graveyard. One such has its entrance inside a tomb. Joseph has to disinter Budu from an urban park, as neat as any cemetery, and take him to a repository for revival. Plot summary =Frame story= Segments titled \\"Joseph in the darkness\\" appear before and after each of the episodes described below. Joseph, apparently talking to his father- figure, Budu, fills in historical detail in the storyline and discusses his own motivations. =1996: Hollywood= In Mendoza in Hollywood, the botanist Mendoza and her companion Einar were thrown forward in time from 1863 to 1996 in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. This is supposed to be impossible, but Mendoza is a Crome generator, a psychic who cannot control her potential, and Laurel Canyon is a focus of Crome radiation (explaining its attraction for certain kinds of people over the years!). As the action of this novel opens, Lewis is arriving at Company HQ in Laurel Canyon in 1996. Entering the building he is just in time to see Mendoza being sent back to her own time, and tries to warn her \\"Don't go with him!\\", meaning the English agent she encounters later. From his point of view, that encounter was the cause of her disappearance. She vanishes as the transfer takes place. Lewis takes advantage of work in San Francisco to contact Joseph who is working in the hi-tech industry there. Joseph persuades him to try out a new virtual reality helmet, which turns out to have a fault that disables cyborgs' implanted monitors for 24 hours. Joseph and Lewis can now talk freely, without Company eavesdropping. Initially reluctant, Joseph drives Lewis to Bodega Bay to talk to Juan Bautista who was the last cyborg to see Mendoza. They give him a dose of VR and then pump him for information. Juan Bautista is able to draw a picture of the man Mendoza met in 1863 and subsequently ran away with. To Joseph's shock, the man is a double for Nicholas Harpole, the religious fanatic with whom Mendoza fell in love in Tudor England, and who was subsequently burned at the stake. Joseph sees Nicholas as the main cause of Mendoza's troubles. He also hates religious fanatics of all stripes. Leaving Juan Bautista, Joseph and Lewis agree to meet from time to time as circumstances allow, and as they learn more. =2025: Austin, Texas= A family is celebrating the \\"Day of the Dead\\" at a graveyard in Texas. The paterfamilias, actually an uncle, is Porfirio, Mendoza's Facilitator in 1863. Under cover of an electrical storm, Joseph contacts Porfirio and asks what he knows about Mendoza. Porfirio tells him Mendoza was sent back in time, Back Way Back, over 100,000 years. The Company operated resorts for rich clients back before the arrival of humans in the New World. She must have been sent there, but why? Porfirio sends Joseph on his way with one request: don't come back. =2026: London, England= Lewis poses as an antiquarian, buying old papers and books, and comes into possession of a box which contains a picture of a man named Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax, who he recognizes as the man in the picture drawn by Juan Bautista. Further research turns up a well-born man, apparently a natural son of someone in high places, with powerful friends who guide his life. He served as an agent of various shadowy entities. Lewis contacts Joseph and they meet in London. They make a junket to the north of England. They spend time in the country of \\"The Innocents\\", an imagined novel combining elements of Animal Farm and Watership Down. This novel and its loony fans are among the catalysts for the growing animal-rights movement which will eventually ban meat consumption in many countries. They stay at a house run by two of the more extreme fans, but Joseph has other motives. He has finally decoded some information Budu forced on him, and he means to act on it. Under cover of another storm, Joseph sneaks out of the house, with Lewis tailing him. They uncover a secret installation in a hillside, containing many cyborgs suspended in tanks of fluid. Are Mendoza and Budu in places like this? Lewis' Company conditioning, intended to keep cyborgs out of forbidden places, causes him to re-experience his suppressed memories of being disabled and kidnapped in medieval Ireland. He begins to understand why the Company left him in South America for 700 years, until the events recorded in Sky Coyote. =2142: London and Fez= Lewis is still researching Edward when he can. He learns that Nennius, another cyborg, was monitoring or guiding Edward, even being the headmaster of his school. Joseph seeks out Suleyman, a former Barbary Coast pirate who has built up an independent power base in Fez, Morocco. Suleyman has also found means of frustrating the Company monitoring. Suleyman reveals that he himself is working secretly against other factions, some of whom seem to be creating new diseases to wipe out humans. He implicates Budu in this, to Joseph's consternation. Joseph and Lewis meet again in London. Joseph now has one of Suleyman's masking devices. Lewis tells him all he knows about Edward. Edward was working for people who wanted to gain possession of Santa Catalina island, off the California coast. Joseph has a meeting with Victor, who reveals that he did bring Budu down, a few hours before the San Francisco earthquake in 1906, and tells Joseph where to find him. =2225: London; Ir√∫n del Mar, Spain= Lewis is working in a library. Finding his cover blown by a strange little man, Lewis drops out of sight and heads to Spain for another meeting with Joseph. On the way he encounters more of the strange men, and is injured with some kind of disrupter that partially disables his hand. This is not supposed to be possible, as the cyborgs have self-repair mechanisms. Told to take a vacation, he accompanies Joseph on a tour of the local archeological sites‚Äî the places where Joseph was raised, 20,000 years previously, before checking into a Company base for repairs. =2275: Santa Catalina Island, California= Lewis has an \\"accidental\\" encounter with Nennius aboard a cruise ship, and Nennius feeds him a story about Edward. Lewis contacts Joseph, and they proceed to Santa Catalina where Lewis believes the key to the mystery is hidden. It is a trap. Lewis is taken, and Joseph severely injured. Rolling off a cliff and into the sea, he eventually washes up onshore and is able to reach one of Suleyman's mosques, from where he is taken to Suleyman himself. When he recovers, his implant has been removed. He is a free agent, but also a fugitive. If the Company ever discovers he is still alive, there will be Hell to pay. Suleyman gives him the same message as Porfirio did: go, and don't come back. =2275: San Francisco and Mount Tamalpais, California= Joseph follows Victor's instructions and locates Budu, buried by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. He takes the remains to one of the Company's storage facilities under Mount Tamalpais and starts the process of revivification, with help from the cyborg Abdiel, whose entire life consists of journeying between these facilities, maintaining them. =Joseph in the darkness= Joseph settles down to wait for Budu to re-activate, and tells his recovering corpse his story. He likens himself to Hamlet, for delaying too long in taking action, resulting in the deaths of all around him. But he still has 74 years until 2355... Characters Facilitator Joseph is a major character in this novel, as he is in most of the Company stories. At the end of the previous installment, Sky Coyote, his first-person narrative concluded with him expressing a certain ill-defined unease at his life, which by then had moved from Spain to Old California to Hollywood. For the first time in his thousands of years of life he was questioning his own motives as a Company operative. Lewis's news of Mendoza's appearance in 1996, coupled with the discovery that her disappearance in 1863 had been connected with the identical twin of the man who ruined her in Elizabethan England, begins his estrangement from the organization he has served since prehistory. He finally decodes the information given to him by his own father, Budu, which reveals to him the hidden Company graveyards where damaged and inconvenient immortals sleep. The novel ends with him turned into a demon of sorts, a malevolent free spirit determined to bring doom on those who have abused him and his loved ones for so long. Literature Specialist Lewis was introduced in Sky Coyote as a mild mannered Company flunky with no skeletons in his closet. In this novel his tragic background, both as a victim of the mysterious little men and as a man doomed to love an unattainable woman, come to the fore. Unfortunately he is soon out of his depth. As a Preserver, his ability to carry out clandestine operations is practically nonexistent. Even Joseph, normally the lead man in any deception, cannot help him when the party being deceived is the all- knowing Dr. Zeus. Security Tech Porfirio is, in some ways, a more extreme version of Joseph. Like Joseph, he has formed a deep attachment to others, in his case the descendants of his brother. His distaste for Company work is suppressed by his need to stay in touch with his family. It is a Devil's bargain that the Company is quite happy with. Executive Facilitator Suleyman is, at the very least, a few thousand years old, and one of the major players in the Company itself. He has the power to help Joseph, but at the same time he is suspicious of the motives of anyone outside his own sphere of influence, but especially Joseph himself. Suleyman suspects that Joseph's father Budu is behind the plagues that appear from time to time, decimating the mortals. Facilitator Victor is a cipher, a man who knows more than he is willing to admit, and who is deeply troubled by his work for the Company. His story is told in the shorter works in the Company stories. His connection with Lewis is more important than either suspects. The Botanist Mendoza and her lover, in his different incarnations, are the offstage, unseen characters in the story. Joseph seeks Mendoza through the Company's secret vaults, while Lewis seeks her through his investigations of Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax, who may or may not be also Nicholas Harpole, the Elizabethan religious zealot so hated by Joseph. Major themes Joseph is concerned about Mendoza - he recruited her and more or less thinks of her as a daughter - but he is also trying to find out what happened to Budu, who recruited him and whom he regards as his father. Budu happened to have been an Enforcer, an 8-foot killing machine with mixed ancestry from humans, Neanderthals and God knows what else the Company used. Far from being monsters, Enforcers were gentle beings who only killed those who killed others. Chapters throughout the book, all entitled \\"Joseph in the Darkness\\", seem to consist of Joseph addressing his father, relating events as decades pass between encounters with Lewis. At the end we discover where these conversations take place. Lewis is simply in love with Mendoza. He initially contacts Joseph to try to find out why Mendoza disappeared in 1863. Through the following decades and centuries, he stumbles across clues to the Company's real origins, but in following them he may just be following a trail of breadcrumbs laid by the Company itself. A major plot element throughout the book is that all the cyborgs have implants that transmit everything they see and hear to a central database. Much of the plot is driven by attempts to circumvent this. Socially the book presents a dystopic view of the future. Not only does the U.S.A. fragment, California descending into anarchy, but the rise of extreme animal rights agitation and various prohibition movements means that in the future meat-eating, coffee, alcohol, tobacco, chocolate and all manner of other social and private stimulants are illegal. In the future, Britain is somewhat resurgent as a country, despite being wracked by domestic terrorism. It also becomes clear that the Company's origins are there. People in general are not doing well, though. The population is declining in many countries, partly due to a rash of unexplained epidemics, partly due to disgust with the process of procreation itself. Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science New Syon House in the story is a fictional building in London. Syon House is a real mansion by the Thames, opposite Kew. Bodega Bay is well known as the site for much of the filming of the movie The Birds. It is also close to Drake's Bay, once thought to be the site of Sir Francis Drake's landing on the American mainland. One of the main plot points of this series is the discovery of certain artifacts on Santa Catalina by members of the Drake expedition.

Early years Francesca Isabel Natividad was born on February 13, 1948, in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua State, Mexico. As the eldest of nine children she did not speak English until she was 10 years of age; this was in 1958. At that time, her mother married a U.S. citizen and they moved to Texas. Natividad attended Ysleta High School in El Paso, where she was her senior class president. After moving to California, Natividad worked as both a maid and a cook for Stella Stevens, and then as a key-punch operator for IBM, before eventually turning to go-go dancing to make ends meet. At this time, she adopted the stage name of \\"Kitten\\" Natividad, which came from her shyness. In 1969, at the age of 21 years, she had her first breast implant surgery in Tijuana (where it was legal) on the advice of her agent. Career Francesca, by then known mainly as Kitten Natividad, was introduced to Russ Meyer by fellow dancer Shari Eubank, a performer in Meyer's 1975 film Supervixens. Meyer hired her to narrate his movie Up! In it, she was shown sitting nude in a tree, quoting the poetry of Hilda Doolittle, and acting as a Greek chorus to the nonsensical action. Meyer was so impressed he wanted her to star in his next feature, Beneath the Valley of the Ultra- Vixens, one of several collaborations between Meyer and film critic Roger Ebert. Meyer paid for a second breast enhancement and voice lessons to eliminate her accent. Due to the tragic results of her breast enhancement surgeries she deeply regretted what she was talked into doing. She left her husband for Meyer during the filming, and they lived together as a couple for most of the next 15 years. After this, Natividad moved into pornographic modeling, mainly doing glamour or girl-girl shoots with the likes of Candy Samples, Uschi Digard, and Patty Plenty. The appearances increased her dancing income many times over. She incorporated a giant champagne glass into her act, similar to such as Lili St. Cyr had used, accompanied by the Bobby Darin hit \\"Splish Splash.\\" She appeared as a guest on The Dating Game, one of a number of game shows that Chuck Barris produced. During the 1980s, Natividad began appearing in pornographic productions, initially limiting her performances to appearing topless. Eventually, however, she graduated to engaging in hardcore performances, usually with younger men and women. She has had backlash from burlesque performers because she did hardcore videos. She also founded the private photo and video studio called \\"The Kitten Klub.\\" Her website is now closed. She famously appeared as a stripper at the bachelor party held by Sean Penn to celebrate his 1985 marriage to Madonna. In 2001, Natividad starred in the cult film comedy The Double-D Avenger, directed by William Winckler, and in it, she was reunited with fellow Russ Meyer \\"repertory\\" stars actress Haji (from Meyer's Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!) and Raven De La Croix from Meyer's film Up! In The Double-D Avenger, Kitten Natividad played Chastity Knott, a woman who becomes a busty costumed crime fighter. = In pop culture = * Se√±ora Natividad appeared on The Gong Show in the late 1970s and on The Dollar-Ninety-Eight Beauty Show, both of which, like The Dating Game, were produced by Chuck Barris. (Barris hosted The Gong Show; Rip Taylor hosted The Dollar-Ninety-Eight Beauty Show; and Jim Lange hosted The Dating Game.) * She appeared in a 1980s music video for Mitch Ryder's version of the song \\"When You Were Mine,\\" which was written and composed by Prince. * In August 2006, Se√±ora Natividad appeared in a Playboy layout, \\"The History of Bikinis.\\" Natividad in 2000 Personal life In October 1999, Natividad underwent double-mastectomy surgery for treatment of breast cancer. After her breasts were removed, it was discovered that the silicone that had been used in her implants when she had undergone her 1969 surgery was of an industrial grade rather than a surgical grade. She subsequently underwent corrective surgery, and this brought her closer to the size that her fans remembered her having been. As of early August 2016, she was living alone with a pit bull and three cats, all of which were featured in the 2005 documentary movie Pornstar Pets, and she continued to support herself with sales of her porn videos and phone sex. She appeared in the Adam Rifkin independent feature A Night at the Golden Eagle; according to her, Rifkin remembered recognizing her when their cars were both stopped at the same stoplight 25 years earlier.

Early life Castro, who was born in Bayonne, France, was a French diplomat of Portuguese-Jewish descent. He later immigrated to the United States and became an American citizen in 1827. In 1838, he worked as a banker in France and sought to secure a loan for the young Republic of Texas. He was then appointed as consul general for Texas by President Sam Houston. He recruited hundreds of families for emigration to Texas. Most came primarily from the Haut-Rhin region of Alsace, in northeastern France. They traveled to Texas from 1843 to 1847 and settled in the Medina River valley, just west of San Antonio. The city of Castroville on the Medina River is named for him, as is Castro County in the Texas Panhandle. Castro himself settled for a time in Castroville. Republic of Texas land grants The Republic of Texas issued colonization land grants with individuals, conditional upon said individuals establishing settlements in a stated geographical area of Texas. The grants were limited to a given time period in which colonization had to take place. On February 15, 1842, Castro, in temporary partnership with Jean Jassaud, was issued two land grants by the Republic of Texas. The grants were for the colonization of 600 families (with an option to increase that number to 1000) in three years. The first 200 families had to be settled by August 15, 1843. One grant was approximately 600,000 acres, near what is now Starr County, along the Rio Grande. Castro would not be seen fulfilling the colonization of this grant. The other grant totaled 1,250,000 acres, west of San Antonio and included the counties of Atascosa, Frio, La Salle, Medina, and McMullen. This second grant would result in what came to be known as Castro's Colony. Castro began recruiting from an office in Paris in 1842 and the first of his recruits sailed into the port of Galveston, Texas, on January 1, 1843. In the fall of 1843, Castro recruits in Alsace, Baden, and Switzerland. Waves of his colonists departed for Texas in the winter of 1843 and spring of 1844. Castro left Europe for Texas on May 19, 1844, by way of New Orleans. He made it to San Antonio in July 1844 to meet with the colonists and was escorted by the Texas Rangers to inspect his land grant. The first of Castro's colonists arrived at the land on September 2, 1844. A grant covering 3,878,000 acres over 5,000 square miles, went to Henry Francis Fisher and Burchard Miller. On June 7, 1842, Fisher and Miller received a colonization land grant to settle 1,000 immigrant families of German, Dutch, Swiss, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian ancestry. The grant was issued as the Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant. Fisher and Miller were also unsuccessful in colonization efforts, but they were able to get their deadline extended. On June 26, 1844, they sold the grant to the Adelsverein. Henry Fisher was made part of the Verein colonial committee. On July 3 and July 6, 1842, two land grants were issued to Alexander Bourgeois d'Orvanne and Armand Ducos, for colonization of 1,700 families along the Uvalde, Frio and Medina rivers. On April 7, 1844, after their colonization efforts proved fruitless, Bourgeois and Ducos sold their grant to the Adelsverein, conditional on making Alexander Bourgeois d'Orvanne the Colonial Director. Unfortunately, the grant had already expired and Bourgeois was unable to get the deadline for colonization extended. Additional sourcing *Crook, Cornelia English (1988).

Bollea was involved in a car accident in which he crashed into a tree as result of driving under the influence of alcohol and racing his automobile on August 26, 2007. He spent May 9, 2008, to October 21, 2008, in Pinellas County Jail as a result. The passenger in Bollea's car, John Graziano, was seriously injured and suffered massive brain damage. Motorsports Bollea earned a Formula D competition license in 2006 from Formula Drift, the only professional drifting series in North America, and competed in one of their competitions, the event in Atlanta on May 12, 2007. Bollea was active in the NOPI Drift series, qualified 10th at the Denver NOPI drift event of 2007, and placed third at their Pittsburgh event. Bollea occasionally attended amateur drifting competitions. According to Chris Tyler, a drift event organizer, Bollea attended an event the Friday prior to the crash of Nick's Toyota Supra. Bollea did not compete; he gave drifting demonstrations between the runs of competitors. Bollea's celebrity status and enthusiasm for drifting attracted sponsors. He was briefly signed to Dodge, but company spokesman Todd Goyer said that he \\"is not a Dodge driver or a Mopar driver\\", and that his relationship with Dodge/Mopar ended two months prior to his 2007 crash. He was sponsored for the 2007 season by Polaroid, Mac Tools, BF Goodrich and Sparco. These companies are still listed on the NOPI website as sponsors of Nick's drift car, but Polaroid VP of marketing Cheryl Mau said, \\"We do not have a signed sponsorship agreement with Nick Hogan for the 2008 race season.\\" Bollea had two Dodge Vipers with steering modified to enhance their drifting capability, but his last competition vehicle was a Nissan 350Z. John Graziano (the veteran Marine injured in the Supra crash) and Danny Jacobs (the driver of the silver Viper, seen with the Supra at the time of the crash) worked in Nick Bollea's pit crew during 2007 in St. Louis, Denver and Los Angeles. Barry Lawrence, the passenger in the aforementioned Viper, was also a member of Bollea's pit crew. Vehicular incidents On September 13, 2006, in Bay Harbor Islands, Florida, Bollea was driving a yellow 2001 Lamborghini Diablo VT owned by Cecile Barker (chairman of SoBe Entertainment, the record label attached to his sister) when it caught on fire. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue spokesman Paul Perry said, \\"It was a normal car fire. It happens a bunch of times every day and nobody notices.\\" On September 17, 2006, Bollea was stopped twice driving between Miami and Tampa. He was warned the first time and ticketed the second for going in a zone. In an August 2007 interview with Rides, Bollea said he was driving in a zone. His mother said the interview was exaggerated. On February 8, 2007, he was ticketed in Miami-Dade County, Florida for driving in a zone, and on April 25, 2007, he was ticketed and received four points on his license for driving in a zone in Osceola County. On August 10, 2007, he was ticketed in Pinellas Park after being clocked going in a construction zone. =Toyota Supra crash= On the evening of August 26, 2007, just 16 days after his fourth speeding ticket in 11 months, the 17-year- old Bollea was involved in a serious accident in Clearwater, Florida. Bollea and three members of the pit crew for his drifting team, using two of his father's cars -- a yellow Toyota Supra and a silver Dodge Viper -- were traveling to a steakhouse when the single-vehicle crash occurred at Court Street and Missouri Avenue, near downtown Clearwater. The yellow Supra, which Bollea had been driving in the outside lane, fishtailed and spun across the road, crashing into the median strip and into a palm tree. The impact destroyed the car. Bollea and his passenger, 22-year-old John Graziano, were flown to Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. Bollea was released from care on August 27 and said to be \\"OK\\". Graziano, a U.S. Marine and a member of Bollea's pit crew, was not wearing a seatbelt. The eye and brain injuries he sustained are expected to leave him in a nursing home for the rest of his life. In September 2009, Graziano returned to his home where he continued to receive full-time care.Drew Harwell (September 10, 2009). John Graziano leaves hospital two years after car wreck with Nick Hogan . St. Petersburg Times. Accessed 2010-12-01. Criminal charges Bollea was charged with several violations for the crash, including a felony. He turned himself in to authorities on Wednesday, November 7, 2007, and was released within hours on $10,000 bail. Bollea was charged with reckless driving involving serious bodily injury (a 3rd degree felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison plus fines), use of a motor vehicle in commission of a felony, a person under the age of 21 operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol level of 0.02% or higher, and illegal window tint. Two hours after the wreck, Nick's blood alcohol content was 0.055%. Police believed that Nick Bollea and Danny Jacobs were speeding \\"in excess of in the posted zone\\" on the wet road prior to the crash and both were charged with reckless driving. Eyewitnesses claimed the cars were racing. The official police report says that the two cars were racing, but that Jacobs' actions were not a direct cause of the accident. Prior to the trial, Bollea's lawyer said that the accident was not the result of speeding, emphasizing that Bollea was wearing a seatbelt and Graziano was not.

The Graziano family denied rumors of a civil suit, but later the Graziano family lawyers suggested a civil suit against the Bolleas to pay for John's lifetime medical care. Incarceration On May 9, 2008, Bollea entered a no contest plea and was sentenced to eight months in Pinellas County Jail. The sentence also called for Bollea to serve five years of probation, 500 community service hours, and his driver's license was suspended for 3 years. After a public records request, Pinellas County Sheriff's Office released audio tapes of Nick's jail phone conversation from his overnight incarceration several months earlier. The conversation included Nick saying that crash victim John Graziano was a \\"negative person.\\" The press was critical of the excerpts blaming the crash victim and said the phone calls could mark the end of Hulkamania. Nick later sued the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office for releasing the tapes of his phone conversations. Bollea was separated from the general jail population because he was a minor. His attorneys asked for reconsideration of his sentence, seeking temporary house arrest until he was 18 years old. On June 3, 2008, the motion was denied. Soon after, Bollea was moved to join three other juvenile inmates. On July 27 (his 18th birthday), he was moved to Pinellas County Jail general population. On October 21, 2008, Bollea was released from the Pinellas County Jail due to \\"good time\\" credit and moved to his mother's home in Clearwater, Florida.Nick Hogan is a free man (October 21, 2008) MyFoxTampaBay.

Later life Bollea had been in a long-time relationship with model Breana Tiesi from 2008 and 2015, followed by a relationship with popular Instagram model Brit Manuela between 2017 and 2018. Since 2019, he has been with pornographic actress Tana Lea. In October 2014, several publications named Bollea as the first male star to be directly targeted in the 2014 celebrity photo leaks, however Bollea denied the authenticity of some of the pictures.

History Bilton was first recorded (as Billeton) in the Domesday Book in 1086. The name is of Old English origin and means \\"farmstead of a man named Billa\\". Bilton was historically in the parish of Knaresborough in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It formed a township with Harrogate,GENUKI website: Parish of Knaresborough and in 1866 the township of Bilton with Harrogate became a civil parish.Vision of Britain: Bilton with Harrogate When Harrogate became a municipal borough in 1894, Bilton remained outside the borough and became a separate civil parish. In 1896, Starbeck was separated from Bilton to form a new civil parish. In 1938 the civil parish was abolished, and most of Bilton was added to Harrogate. In 1848 the Leeds and Thirsk Railway was opened through Bilton, although no station was built there. The line crossed the River Nidd on the northern boundary of Bilton by a stone viaduct. In 1908 a narrow gauge railway was constructed from the main line to carry coal to the gas works next to the Little Wonder roundabout. The line was closed in 1956, and with the tracks having been removed the only remains of the line are some walls and the tunnels that carried the trains. A small museum was opened in the neighbouring New Park School, where the line used to come out above ground. Between 2007 and 2008 the school created a garden, known as \\"The Secret Railway Garden\\", to commemorate the line. The area of Bilton west of the railway line was developed in the 19th and 20th centuries. The parish church of St John, designed by Gilbert Scott, was built between 1851 and 1857. It is now a Grade II* listed building. The area east of the railway has remained rural, with scattered houses now known as Old Bilton. The main railway line through Bilton was closed in 1969. In 2013 it was reopened as a cycle way and bridleway known as the Nidderdale Greenway. Bilton Hall is a large former country house lying to the east of Old Bilton on a hill facing Knaresborough. Built on the site of a hunting lodge constructed on the orders of John O'Gaunt in 1380. William Slingsby, who discovered the first spa well in Harrogate, once resided at the Hall. Bilton Hall became the seat of the Stockdale family from 1631, with three members of that family serving as Members of Parliament for Knaresborough. It later passed into institutional use and is now a care home. Community Bilton Lane On the first May Bank Holiday each year the Bilton Gala takes place.Bilton Gala The first Gala was held in 1977 and the event, which is attended by local families, raises money for groups and organisations within the local community. Bilton has five churches, four primary schools and its own library. There are a number of shops, including two convenience stores. The Library closed but has now re-opened on the site of Woodfield Primary School. There is one public house, the Gardeners Arms, in Old Bilton. The Skipton (formerly the Dragon) on Skipton Road closed in February 2014 and The Oak Beck public house on Woodfield Road has been demolished and is being replaced with eight dwellings. There is a working men's club on Skipton Road. The Red Cat Cottage (formerly Red Cat Inn), a Grade II listed building is located in the area. It is situated close to the Nidd Gorge conservation area. Transport Roads out of Bilton lead to Skipton Road, the major artery across North Harrogate, resulting in very heavy congestion at peak times, and heavy traffic throughout the day.

In the currently known particle physics, summarised by the standard model of elementary particles and interactions, it is possible to distinguish in an absolute sense particles of matter and particles of antimatter. This is particularly easy for those particles that carry electric charge, such as electrons or protons or quarks, while the distinction is more subtle in the case of neutrinos, fundamental elementary particles that do not carry electric charge. In the standard model, it is not possible to create a net amount of matter particles‚Äîor more precisely, it is not possible to change the net number of leptons or of quarks in any perturbative reaction among particles. This remark is consistent with all existing observations. However, similar processes are not considered to be impossible and are expected in other models of the elementary particles, that extend the standard model. They are necessary in speculative theories that aim to explain the cosmic excess of matter over antimatter, such as leptogenesis and baryogenesis. They could even manifest themselves in laboratory as proton decay or as creations of electrons in the so-called neutrinoless double beta decay. The latter case occurs if the neutrinos are Majorana particles, being at the same time matter and antimatter, according to the definition given just above. In a wider sense, one can use the word matter simply to refer to fermions. In this sense, matter and antimatter particles (such as an electron and a positron) are a priori identified. The process inverse to particle annihilation can be called matter creation; more precisely, we are considering here the process obtained under time reversal of the annihilation process. This process is also known as pair production, and can be described as the conversion of light particles (i.e., photons) into one or more massive particles . The most common and well-studied case is the one where two photons convert into an electron‚Äìpositron pair. Photon pair production Because of momentum conservation laws, the creation of a pair of fermions (matter particles) out of a single photon cannot occur. However, matter creation is allowed by these laws when in the presence of another particle (another boson, or even a fermion) which can share the primary photon's momentum. Thus, matter can be created out of two photons. The law of conservation of energy sets a minimum photon energy required for the creation of a pair of fermions: this threshold energy must be greater than the total rest energy of the fermions created. To create an electron-positron pair, the total energy of the photons, in the rest frame, must be at least 2mec2 = 2 √ó = (me is the mass of one electron and c is the speed of light in vacuum), an energy value that corresponds to soft gamma ray photons. The creation of a much more massive pair, like a proton and antiproton, requires photons with energy of more than (hard gamma ray photons). The first published calculations of the rate of e+‚Äìe‚àí pair production in photon-photon collisions were done by Lev Landau in 1934. It was predicted that the process of e+‚Äìe‚àí pair creation (via collisions of photons) dominates in collision of ultra-relativistic charged particles‚Äîbecause those photons are radiated in narrow cones along the direction of motion of the original particle, greatly increasing photon flux. In high-energy particle colliders, matter creation events have yielded a wide variety of exotic heavy particles precipitating out of colliding photon jets (see two-photon physics). Currently, two-photon physics studies creation of various fermion pairs both theoretically and experimentally (using particle accelerators, air showers, radioactive isotopes, etc.). It is possible to create all fundamental particles in the standard model, including quarks, leptons and bosons using photons of varying energies above some minimum threshold, whether directly (by pair production), or by decay of the intermediate particle (such as a W boson decaying to form an electron and an electron-antineutrino). As shown above, to produce ordinary baryonic matter out of a photon gas, this gas must not only have a very high photon density, but also be very hot ‚Äì the energy (temperature) of photons must obviously exceed the rest mass energy of the given matter particle pair. The threshold temperature for production of electrons is about 1010 K, 1013 K for protons and neutrons, etc. According to the Big Bang theory, in the early universe, mass-less photons and massive fermions would inter-convert freely. As the photon gas expanded and cooled, some fermions would be left over (in extremely small amounts ~10‚àí10) because low energy photons could no longer break them apart. Those left-over fermions would have become the matter we see today in the universe around us.

D. Hirsch, is an American educator and academic literary critic. He is professor emeritus of education and humanities at the University of Virginia. In the 1960s Hirsch's Validity in Interpretation made an important contribution to contemporary literary theory and established him as \\"the founder of contemporary intentionalism,\\"S√∏ren Harnow Klausen, \\"Levels of Literary Meaning,\\" Philosophy and Literature, vol. 41, no. 1 (April 2017), p. 71). defending the notion of objectivity in humanistic studies and distinguishing between the \\"meaning\\" of a text, which relates to understanding and does not change, and its \\"significance\\", which relates to explanation and changes over time. In popular culture Hirsch is best known for his work on cultural literacy, and is the founder and chairman of the Core Knowledge Foundation. Beginning in 1990s, Hirsch began publishing books in the Core Knowledge Grader Series which the Foundation describes as \\"an engaging, illustrated guide to the essential knowledge outlined in the Core Knowledge Sequence\\", including information and activities for teachers, parents and children, as well as suggestions for related readings and resources. There are currently eight books in print, beginning with What Your Preschooler Needs to Know and ending with What Your Sixth Grader Needs to Know. The books have been particularly popular with parents who homeschool, as well as parents whose children attend Core Knowledge schools, and have been revised and updated over the years.  Early life  Hirsch was born on March 22, 1928, in Memphis, Tennessee.  Critique of the education system  In 1996, Hirsch wrote The Schools We Need and Why We Don't Have Them. In it, Hirsch proposed that romanticized, anti-knowledge theories of education are the cause of America's lackluster educational performance and also of widening inequalities in gender and race. Hirsch portrays American educational theory as one that attempts to give students intellectual tools such as \\"critical thinking skills\\" but denigrates teaching any actual content and labels it \\"mere rote learning.\\" Hirsch states that is what has failed to develop knowledgeable, literate students. This is a sample passage on Romanticism from The Schools We Need and Why We Don't Have Them: > Romanticism believed that human nature is innately good, and should > therefore be encouraged to take its natural course, unspoiled by the > artificial imposition of prejudice and convention. Second, Romanticism > concluded that a child is neither a scaled-down, ignorant version of the > adult nor a formless piece of clay in need of molding, rather, the child is > a special being in its own right with unique, trustworthy ‚Äì indeed holy ‚Äì > impulses that should be allowed to develop and run their course. The Schools We Need included sharp criticism of American schools of education. Hirsch described the contemporary school as a \\"Thoughtworld\\" that is hostile to research-based findings and dissenting ideas.  Recent works  In 2006, Hirsch published The Knowledge Deficit, in which he continued the argument made in Cultural Literacy. Disappointing results on reading tests, Hirsch argued, can be traced back to a knowledge deficit that keeps students from making sense of what they read. In 2009, he published The Making of Americans: Democracy and Our Schools, in which he makes the case that the true mission of the schools is to prepare citizens for participation in our democracy by embracing a common-core, knowledge-rich curriculum as opposed to what Hirsch claims to be the current content-free approach. He laments 60 years without a curriculum in US schools because of the anti-curriculum approach championed by John Dewey and other Progressives. In 2016, he published \\"Why Knowledge Matters: Rescuing our Children from Failed Educational Theories\\", outlining the three major problems with education in the United States: the emphasis on teaching skills, such as critical thinking skills, rather than knowledge, individualism rather than communal learning, and developmentalism, that is, teaching children what is \\"appropriate\\" for their age.  Core Knowledge in the UK  In 2011 a British version of The Core Knowledge Sequence was published onlineThe UK Core Knowledge Sequence and the books began to be adapted for the UK, beginning with What Your Year 1 Child Needs to Know.The official partnership in the UK  Influence in US education  While Hirsch's views continue to provoke debate and controversy, Sol Stern, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has written extensively on education reform, wrote in 2013 that Hirsch was \\"the most important education reformer of the past half-century.\\" = Core Knowledge schools in the US = The Core Knowledge Foundation reports that there were 1,260 schools in the US (across 46 states and District of Columbia) using all or part of the Core Knowledge Sequence. The Foundation believes that the actual number is much higher, but only counts schools that submit a \\"profile form\\" to the Foundation annually. The profile of Core Knowledge Schools in the US is diverse‚Äîincluding public, charter, private and parochial schools in urban, suburban and rural locations. Independent nonprofit GreatSchools.org reports that more than 400 of these schools are preschools. = Common Core standards in the US = While he was not directly involved in developing the Common Core State Standards adopted in 46 states and the District of Columbia, many education watchers credit E. D. Hirsch as having provided the \\"intellectual foundation\\" for the initiative.  Controversy  = Politics = While the Core Knowledge Foundation in the US describes itself as non-partisan, Hirsch himself is an avowed Democrat who has described himself as \\"practically a socialist\\" and \\"a man of the Left, the Old Left\\". Over the years, he has expressed deep sympathy for underprivileged minority youths and has stated that he specifically designed a curriculum to \\"place all children on common ground, sharing a common body of knowledge. That's one way to secure civil rights.\\" In The Making of Americans (2010), Hirsch explained his position as both a \\"political liberal\\" and \\"an educational conservative\\": = Proponents and critics = Since \\"Cultural Literacy\\" was first published in The American Scholar in 1983, Hirsch has often been embraced by political conservatives and attacked by liberals and progressives. William Bennett, a prominent conservative who served as Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities and later US Secretary of Education, was an early proponent of Hirsch's views. Harvard University professor Howard Gardner, who is best known for his theory of multiple intelligences, has been a long-time critic of Hirsch. Gardner described one of his own books, The Disciplined Mind (1999), as part of a \\"sustained dialectic\\" with E. D. Hirsch, and criticized Hirsch's curriculum as \\"at best superficial and at worst anti- intellectual\\". In 2007, Gardner accused Hirsch of having \\"swallowed a neoconservative caricature of contemporary American education.\\" While acknowledging that criticism and debate \\"have been very good for business,\\" Hirsch has openly expressed his frustration with ongoing accusations of intellectual elitism and racism. Regarding the frequent comparisons of Hirsch's Cultural Literacy to Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind, which was published around the same time, Hirsch has stated: \\"That was just bad luck ... Allan Bloom really was an elitist.\\" In reality, critics of Hirsch come from both progressive and conservative circles. As Jason R. Edwards explains: = Influence in the UK = In the UK, the Core Knowledge books are published by Civitas, which is widely characterised in the national news media as a \\"right-of-centre\\", \\"right-leaning\\" or \\"right-wing thinktank.\\" Former UK Education Secretary Michael Gove publicly expressed his admiration for E. D. Hirsch as early as 2009, and education watchers have suggested that the revised national curriculum first proposed by Gove in 2011 was heavily influenced by Hirsch. = Influence in other countries =  Portugal  E. D. Hirsch was invited to Portugal in 2004 by the then minister of education and later participated at a conference organized by Nuno Crato. On the occasion, he was interviewed by various media. His points of view were part of the public educational debate developed for a few years after his visit. Later, his ideas were very influential, namely during the tenure of minister Nuno Crato (2011‚Äì2015) in which the curricula were reorganized and standards (\\"metas curriculares\\") were introduced. These standards explicitly highlight the essential knowledge students should master and were built in a progressive, systematic, and layered fashion inspired by Hirsch's ideas. Various analysts attribute to these rigorous and demanding standards, among other factors, the notable 2015 improvement in Portuguese student results in PISA and TIMSS international studies.  Fellowships, awards and memberships  Hirsch has been awarded several fellowships and honors, including the Fulbright Fellowship (1955), the Morse Fellowship (1960), the Guggenheim Fellowship (1964), the Explicator Prize (1965), the NEA Fellowship (1970), the NEH Senior Fellowship (1971‚Äì71), the Wesleyan University Center for the Humanities Fellowship (1973), the Princeton University Fellowship in the Humanities (1977), and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences Fellowship at Stanford University (1980‚Äì81). At the University of Virginia he was Linden Kent Memorial Professor of English Emeritus, in addition to Professor of Education and Humanities. He has received honorary degrees from Rhodes College and Williams College. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a board member of the Albert Shanker Institute. He lives in Charlottesville, Virginia.

It can be used to date rocks that formed and crystallised from about 1 million years to over 4.5 billion years ago with routine precisions in the 0.1‚Äì1 percent range. The method is usually applied to zircon. This mineral incorporates uranium and thorium atoms into its crystal structure, but strongly rejects lead when forming. As a result, newly-formed zircon deposits will contain no lead, meaning that any lead found in the mineral is radiogenic. Since the exact rate at which uranium decays into lead is known, the current ratio of lead to uranium in a sample of the mineral can be used to reliably determine its age. The method relies on two separate decay chains, the uranium series from 238U to 206Pb, with a half-life of 4.47 billion years and the actinium series from 235U to 207Pb, with a half- life of 710 million years. Decay routes Uranium decays to lead via a series of alpha (and beta) decays, in which 238U with daughter nuclides undergo total eight alpha and six beta decays whereas 235U with daughters only experience seven alpha and four beta decays. The existence of two 'parallel' uranium‚Äìlead decay routes (238U to 206Pb and 235U to 207Pb) leads to multiple dating techniques within the overall U‚ÄìPb system. The term U‚ÄìPb dating normally implies the coupled use of both decay schemes in the 'concordia diagram' (see below). However, use of a single decay scheme (usually 238U to 206Pb) leads to the U‚ÄìPb isochron dating method, analogous to the rubidium‚Äìstrontium dating method. Finally, ages can also be determined from the U‚ÄìPb system by analysis of Pb isotope ratios alone. This is termed the lead‚Äìlead dating method. Clair Cameron Patterson, an American geochemist who pioneered studies of uranium‚Äìlead radiometric dating methods, used it to obtain one of the earliest estimates of the age of the Earth. Mineralogy Although zircon (ZrSiO4) is most commonly used, other minerals such as monazite (see: monazite geochronology), titanite, and baddeleyite can also be used. Where crystals such as zircon with uranium and thorium inclusions do not occur, uranium-lead dating techniques have also been applied to other minerals such as calcite/aragonite and other carbonate minerals. These types of minerals often produce lower precision ages than igneous and metamorphic minerals traditionally used for age dating, but are more common in the geologic record. Mechanism During the alpha decay steps, the zircon crystal experiences radiation damage, associated with each alpha decay. This damage is most concentrated around the parent isotope (U and Th), expelling the daughter isotope (Pb) from its original position in the zircon lattice. In areas with a high concentration of the parent isotope, damage to the crystal lattice is quite extensive, and will often interconnect to form a network of radiation damaged areas. Fission tracks and micro-cracks within the crystal will further extend this radiation damage network. These fission tracks act as conduits deep within the crystal, providing a method of transport to facilitate the leaching of lead isotopes from the zircon crystal. Computation Under conditions where no lead loss or gain from the outside environment has occurred, the age of the zircon can be calculated by assuming exponential decay of Uranium. That is :N_{\\\\mathrm{Now}} = N_{\\\\mathrm{Orig}} e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\, where * N_{\\\\mathrm{Now}} = \\\\mathrm{U} is the number of uranium atoms measured now. * N_{\\\\mathrm{Orig}} is the number of uranium atoms originally - equal to the sum of uranium and lead atoms \\\\mathrm{U} + \\\\mathrm{Pb} measured now. * \\\\lambda = \\\\lambda_\\\\mathrm{U} is the decay rate of Uranium. * t is the age of the zircon, which one wants to determine. This gives :\\\\mathrm{U} = \\\\left( \\\\mathrm{U} + \\\\mathrm{Pb} \\\\right) e^{-\\\\lambda_\\\\mathrm{U} t} , which can be written as :{{\\\\mathrm{Pb}}\\\\over{\\\\mathrm{U}}} = e^{\\\\lambda_\\\\mathrm{U} t} - 1. The more commonly used decay chains of Uranium and Lead gives the following equations: {{NumBlk::{{^\\\\text{206}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{Pb}^*}\\\\over{^\\\\text{238}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{U}}}=e^{\\\\lambda_{238}t}-1,}} {{NumBlk::{{^\\\\text{207}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{Pb}^*}\\\\over{^\\\\text{235}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{U}}}=e^{\\\\lambda_{235}t}-1.}} These are said to yield concordant ages. It is these concordant ages, plotted over a series of time intervals, that result in the concordant line. Loss (leakage) of lead from the sample will result in a discrepancy in the ages determined by each decay scheme. This effect is referred to as discordance and is demonstrated in Figure 1. If a series of zircon samples has lost different amounts of lead, the samples generate a discordant line. The upper intercept of the concordia and the discordia line will reflect the original age of formation, while the lower intercept will reflect the age of the event that led to open system behavior and therefore the lead loss; although there has been some disagreement regarding the meaning of the lower intercept ages. Figure 1: Concordia diagram for data published by Mattinson for zircon samples from Klamath Mountains in Northern California. Ages for the concordia increase in increments of 100 million years. Undamaged zircon retains the lead generated by radioactive decay of uranium and thorium up to very high temperatures (about 900 ¬∞C), though accumulated radiation damage within zones of very high uranium can lower this temperature substantially. Zircon is very chemically inert and resistant to mechanical weathering‚Äîa mixed blessing for geochronologists, as zones or even whole crystals can survive melting of their parent rock with their original uranium-lead age intact. Zircon crystals with prolonged and complex histories can thus contain zones of dramatically different ages (usually, with the oldest and youngest zones forming the core and rim, respectively, of the crystal), and thus are said to demonstrate inherited characteristics. Unraveling such complications (which, depending on their maximum lead-retention temperature, can also exist within other minerals) generally requires in situ micro-beam analysis via, say, ion microprobe (SIMS) or laser ICP-MS.

Route description SH 11 begins at an intersection with State Highway 56 on the easternedge of Sherman, just north of the Sherman Regional Airport. The route then travels to the southeast through Northeast Texas. In 2009, it was rerouted around the city of Commerce, concurrent with State Highway 24 and State Loop 178, with the old routing through Commerce transferred to a business route. It continues southeast toward Sulphur Springs, where it shares a concurrency with State Highway 154 and the old routing of US 67, and intersects I-30 on the south side of town. After Sulphur Springs, the route takes a more easterly direction through Northeast Texas, before reaching its eastern terminus at US 59 (Future I-369) on the eastern edge of Linden. History left State Highway 11 was one of the original twenty-five state highways proposed on June 21, 1917, overlaid on top of the Jefferson Highway. In 1917, the routing was proposed from the Oklahoma border at Denison, south on present day U.S. Highway 69 through Whitewright into Greenville. From Greenville, it went east on U.S. Highway 67 to Mount Pleasant, and south on U.S. Highway 271 to Gilmer and along State Highway 300 to Longview, and finally, U.S. Highway 80 through Marshall to the Louisiana border. On June 17, 1918, the segment from Gilmer to Longview had yet to be built, so the road was rerouted over the current US 271 and US 80 routes through Gladewater, Texas. On August 21, 1923, SH 11 had lost most of its original assignment. The section north of Greenville was transferred to SH 42, the section south to Gladewater was renumbered as SH 65, and the section east of there was transferred to SH 15. SH 11 was rerouted southeast via current SH 11 to Daingerfield, replacing part of SH 1A, then north on current U.S. Highway 259 to Omaha. On March 16, 1927, SH 11 was rerouted via the current SH 11 to end at Commerce. The section from Greenville to Sulphur Springs became a rerouting of SH 1. On March 19, 1929, SH 11 extended north to DeKalb. On February 8, 1933, it was extended to begin in Ladonia via the present day State Highway 50. On July 15, 1935, the extension from Commerce to Ladonia was cancelled. On November 24, 1936, this extension was restored. On September 26, 1939 the US 259 segment of SH 11 was cancelled and was transferred to SH 26, and SH 11 was extended from Daingerfield to Linden via its current alignment, replacing SH 47, and up US 59 to a terminus in Texarkana. The US 59 alignment of SH 11 was removed on October 13, 1947 and was transferred to US 59, The Ladonia-Commerce segment was removed as it became part of SH 50, and SH 11 was rerouted on its current assignment on December 17, 1970 over FM 1281 and part of FM 697.

History When news of the bombardment and subsequent surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina reached Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to join the Army to quell the rebellion of the Southern states. Across the North, eager recruits responded to calls from local governmental officials to join newly raised state regiments. Governor Andrew Curtin of Pennsylvania issued a proclamation asking for 13,000 able-bodied men to volunteer to help preserve the Union. Within three days, thousands of men had converged at Harrisburg to enlist, but they had no formal place to organize or drill. Dauphin County officials offered Governor Curtin the use of the County Agricultural Society on the northern outskirts of Harrisburg for these volunteers. Maj. Joseph F. Knipe officially opened the camp on April 18, 1861, and named it Camp Curtin in honor of the governor (the planned name had been Camp Union). From December 1861 to March 1862, the camp was commanded by Truman Seymour. More than 300,000 soldiers passed through Camp Curtin, making it the largest Federal camp during the Civil War. Harrisburg's location on major railroad lines running east and west, and north and south made it the ideal location for moving men and supplies to the armies in the field. In addition to Pennsylvania regiments, troops from Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Wisconsin, and the Regular Army used Camp Curtin. The camp and surrounding area also saw service as a supply depot, hospital and prisoner-of-war camp. At the end of the war, Camp Curtin was used as a mustering-out point for thousands of troops on their way home. It was officially closed on November 11, 1865.

One of her brothers was Edward Fitton., The National Archives: Court of Star Chamber STAC 5/H25/2, Retrieved 8 August 2018 Life at court Double portrait by unknown artist of her sister Anne Newdigate and Mary Fitton in 1592 Mary Fitton became a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth in about 1595. Her father recommended her to the care of Sir William Knollys, Comptroller of the Queen's household. Sir William promised, \\"I will be as careful of her well doing as if I were her own true father.\\"Haynes, Alan: Sex in Elizabethan England 1997:44. But Knollys, then fifty years old and married, soon became suitor to Mary Fitton. He wrote of his passion to her sister and even named Mary's niece, whom he was sponsoring as godfather, \\"Mary\\". His infatuation was well known and mocked in court. In 1599, Mary had to quit the court because she was suffering from a mixture of physical and mental symptoms that Elizabethans called \\"suffocation of the mother\\", probably a form of hysteria. When she returned to court, she refused Knollys. In June 1600 Mary led a dance in the masque celebrating the fashionable wedding of Lady Anne Russell, granddaughter of the Earl of Bedford, with Henry Somerset, later created Marquess of Worcester, at Lord Cobham's residence in Blackfriars.Noted in J.G. Waller, \\"The lords of Cobham, their monuments and the church\\" Archaeologia Cantiana (The Kent Archaeological Society) 1878:157. Led by Mary, the maids performed an allegorical dance and afterwards chose substitutes from the audience. Mary boldly chose the queen, telling her that she represented Affection (which then meant passionate love), to which the queen replied \\"Affection? Affection's false.\\" William Herbert, later Earl of Pembroke, is known to have been present at this affair. Mary Fitton became his mistress, and was soon pregnant. In February 1601 Pembroke was sent to the Fleet Prison after admitting paternity but refusing to marry his mistress.Letters of Robert Cecil to George Carew (London, 1864), p. 65. Mary Fitton was placed with Lady Margaret Hawkins, the widow of Sir John Hopkins, for her confinement. In March 1601 she gave birth to a baby boy who died immediately (perhaps from syphilis, which it is believed Pembroke may have suffered from). Both Mary and Pembroke were dismissed from court. Life after court Mary did not seem as abashed by the business as her father, who considered it to be social ruin. Knollys tried to woo her once again, but Mary was firm. She had an affair with the married Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Leveson, bearing him two daughters.Sam Schoenbaum, Shakespeare's Lives, Oxford University Press, 1991, p. 329. He left her ¬£100 after his death in 1605 (his wife, who was suffering from a serious mental illness, had to be committed to the care of her father). After this she had an affair with Captain William Polwhele, one of Leveson's officers. She bore a son that was presumably his. Her mother was scandalized, writing to her other, married, daughter, \\"such shame as never had a Cheshire woman, worse now than ever. Write no more to me of her.\\"Haynes, Alan. Sex in Elizabethan England 1997:49. Even Mary's marriage to Polwhele did not mollify her mother; she referred to Polwhele as \\"a very knave\\". When her husband died in 1610, Mary had a son and daughter to take care of. She married again, to a Pembrokeshire captain named John Lougher. Lougher was a \\"gentleman lawyer\\" and former M.P., who once served on the court of high commission at York.Rosemary O'Day, \\"Mary Fitton\\", The Routledge Companion to the Tudor Age, Routledge, 2012. He died in 1636. She died in 1647 and was buried in Gawsworth, leaving a little Welsh property to her daughter who had married and had children herself. Her ghost is reputed to haunt Gawsworth Old Hall. Shakespeare The relationship with Herbert is the basis for the claim that Fitton was the \\"dark lady\\" of Shakespeare's sonnets. Herbert is one of the main candidates for the identity of the Fair Youth, a character who betrays the poet by having an affair with the Dark Lady, hence the claim that Fitton might be the lady. The suggestion was first made by Thomas Tyler in his 1890 edition of the sonnets. It was taken up by Frank Harris in several books, including The Women of Shakespeare and Shakespeare and his Love. His influential biography The Man Shakespeare asserted that Fitton had ruined Shakespeare's life and that he died \\"broken hearted for love of the Dark Lady.\\"Sunil Kumar Sarker, Shakespeare's sonnets, Atlantic, 2006, pp. 101‚Äì2. Later scholars have not pursued these assertions. Paul Edmondson and Stanley Wells comment that \\"her star waned when she was discovered to have been fair\\".Paul Edmondson, Stanley Wells, Shakespeare's Sonnets, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004, p. 25. There is no hint in her authenticated biography that she was acquainted with Shakespeare. She had some known literary connections; William Kempe, who was a clown in Shakespeare's company, dedicated his Nine Daies Wonder (1600) to \\"Mistress Anne Fitton\\", Maid of Honor to Elizabeth. This may have been an error for Mary, rather than her sister Anne. There is also a sonnet addressed to her in an anonymous volume, A Womans Woorth defended against all the Men in the World. Fitton correspondence Letters written to Mary Fitton's sister Anne Newdigate were preserved in the Newdigate family archives. In the 1890s these letters were transcribed and published by Lady Newdigate-Newdegate (the wife of Sir Edward Newdigate-Newdegate). Footnotes References *Haynes, Alan. Sex in Elizabethan England.

New Bilton is a suburb of Rugby, Warwickshire, in England, situated to the west of the town centre. New Bilton is also a ward of the Borough of Rugby whose population at the 2011 census was 8,313. The area straddles the A428 main road, known locally as Lawford Road. The area was historically within the parish of Bilton (which has also been absorbed into Rugby) and was developed into a suburb during the Victorian era in connection with the local cement industry and brick making industry; the cement industry still continues but the brick making industry has since died out. In 1867 New Bilton became a separate ecclesiastical parish from Bilton, and the local church of St Oswald on Lawford Road was consecrated, later being enlarged in 1881. In 2012, the church was renamed St Matthew and St Oswald's, after the nearby St Matthew church was closed. New Bilton comprises mostly Victorian terraced housing. Some modern housing has been built on the former GEC site to the rear of Avenue Road up to the limestone quarries of Cemex. The local community are served by a couple of corner shops, the Royal Oak and Holly Bush public houses, a mini market and a Coop store. Residents are also fortunate to have a sub post office, a Church of England Church and a Christian Centre. Schooling is provided from age 3 to 11 at 3 schools, St Matthew's Bloxam; St Oswald's and Oakfield, all within the ward of New Bilton. School time can be confusing with children passing each other going to different schools.

Chief artists include Matthew Dear, Dabrye (a.k.a. Tadd Mullinix), Com Truise, Tycho, Gold Panda, School of Seven Bells, Mux Mool, and Shigeto. History Ghostly International was founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan by Sam Valenti IV in 1999.Ghostly International: The Q&A;, The Journal of Murketing He grew up in suburban Detroit, where, having become a fan of underground music culture, he would sneak into hip-hop clubs by carrying records for his Detroit DJ hero Houseshoes. Valenti later became a DJ himself, taking the name DJ SpaceGhost;They spin by night: The rise of Ann Arbor indie label Ghostly International, Detroit Metro Times this theme is echoed by the name and logo of Ghostly International. Valenti met Matthew Dear at a house party that Valenti attended during his first week at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Their shared affection for electronic music, particularly the sound of Detroit techno, led to the label's (and Dear‚Äôs) first 12 inch single, \\"Hands Up For Detroit.\\" Following this, Ghostly enjoyed early success with albums by Mullinix as well as Disco Nouveau, a compilation including artists such as ADULT., Solvent, Legowelt, Daniel Wang and DMX Krew, inspired by the Italo disco movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The label has since widened its focus to include groups such as Skeletons & The Girl-Faced Boys and Mobius Band, whose rock-based sound meshes with the label's eccentric leanings. Also known for forward-thinking package design by the likes of Will Calcutt and Deanne Cheuk, as well as the Boy, Cat, and Bird logos of Michael Segal, Ghostly International aims to be a complete aesthetic experience. Ghostly International followed up Disco Nouveau with two more successful compilation albums featuring its artists: Idol Tryouts and Idol Tryouts 2. Ghostly International also runs a companion label, Spectral Sound, dedicated to more dancefloor-oriented music coming from some of the same artists on Ghostly (such as James T. Cotton, another moniker of Tadd Mullinix, aka Dabrye). Ghostly International and Adult Swim released a compilation album known as Ghostly Swim,Ghostly Swim compilation , Adult Swim available on Adult Swim's website for free. It was released with a bonus track on January 27, 2009 as a limited edition CD. A sequel to Ghostly Swim, Ghostly Swim 2, was released digitally on December 23, 2014, and on CD on April 28, 2015. The label has also been involved in the soundtracks for video games. In 2014, Ghostly released a compilation album of new and previously recorded work by Ghostly artists to act as the soundtrack to the video game Hohokum. A year later, the first soundtrack to critically acclaimed videogame Minecraft by German musician C418 was released by Ghostly as a vinyl LP on August 21, 2015, four years after its original digital release by C418.http://www.factmag.com/2015/06/23/a-minecraft-soundtrack-coming-this- summer-on-vinyl/ List of artists *Adult. *Aeroc *Beacon *Black Marble *Choir of Young Believers *Christopher Willits *Ciel *Com Truise *C418 *Dabrye *Dauwd *Fort Romeau *Geotic *Gold Panda *Heathered Pearls *HTRK *Jacaszek *Kate Simko *Kiln *Lord RAJA *Lusine *Mary Lattimore *Matrixxman *Matthew Dear *Michna *Moderna *Mux Mool *Nautiluss *Pale Sketcher *Phantogram *Psymun *Recondite *Sam Valenti IV *Shigeto *The Sight Below *Solvent *Tadd Mullinix *Tobacco *Tropic of Cancer *Ultra√≠sta *Willits + Sakamoto (Christopher Willits & Ryuichi Sakamoto) *Xeno & Oaklander =Formerly signed= *10:32 *Ben Benjamin *Cepia *The Chap *Charles Manier *Clark Warner *Daniel Wang *Deastro *Dykehouse *Grand Valley State New Music Ensemble *JDSY *Jeffery Sfire *Kill Memory Crash *Loscil *Midwest Product *PostPrior *Mike Servito *Mobius Band *North Valley Subconscious Orchestra *School of Seven Bells *Skeletons & The Kings of All Cities *Syntaks *Twine *Tycho References External links * Official site * Metro Times article * Ghostly Apparitions - An Exploration of Michael Cina's Album Artwork for Ghostly International * Ghostly International moves to Tech Brewery, inks new deals Category:American independent record labels Category:Techno record labels Category:Music of Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:Record labels based in Michigan Category:Record labels established in 1999 Category:Companies based in Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:1999 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Ghostly International"},{"id":"2362542","text":"Spectral Sound is a record label that was originally an offshoot of the more cerebral Ghostly International, but has since gained similar notoriety thanks to successful records by Matthew Dear and other techno producers.

History Texas-born Dear moved to Michigan as a teenager, where he was inspired by the sound of Detroit Techno. Dear met Sam Valenti IV at a party while attending the University of Michigan, after which the two started the record label, Ghostly International, based on a shared love of electronic music. Dear's first single was 1999's \\"Hands Up For Detroit\\" (co-produced by ghettotech pioneer Disco D, who performed under the name Daisha). Successive singles, such as \\"Stealing Moves\\" and the chart- topping \\"Mouth to Mouth\\" (as Audion) were issued on Spectral Sound, Ghostly's offshoot that focuses on dancefloor music. Dear's first album Leave Luck to Heaven appeared in 2003 and was praised widely as a seminal fusion of pop and minimal techno. The album's single \\"Dog Days\\" became one of Spectral's best sellers and a favorite of international DJs like Richie Hawtin. Dear followed the album with Backstroke in 2004 and has also begun working under the harder- edged Audion alias, apart from additional monikers False and Jabberjaw. In 2007, Dear released his sophomore full-length, Asa Breed. Matthew and his band, Matthew Dear's Big Hands, then began a US promotional tour and a European tour as the opening act for Hot Chip. 2008 saw the re-release of Asa Breed as the Asa Breed Black Edition. This re-release added 5 new songs, including a remix of Don and Sherri from Hot Chip and the video for the song, shot in downtown New York City. In 2011, Dear opened for Interpol, performing on their first three dates in the UK. Dear's fourth album, Black City, was released on August 17, 2010. It conceptualizes a futuristic metropolis that never sleeps. Dear describes 'Black City': \\"Well, there's a kind of timelessness to it in the sense that I don't want things to run on a 24-hour clock. It seems like a city that's always awake, maybe always dialed in electronically, and cannot be turned off. It's this imaginary weird never- sleeping town. But yeah it's full of lust, and love, and dark shadows. Weird things around the corner‚Ä¶\\" Black City was met with near-unanimous critical praise, earning top marks from Mojo, Uncut, Q, URB, and the Village Voice, ending up on countless year-end lists, and earning Pitchfork's Best New Music nod. A worldwide tour followed. On stage, Dear performs with a multi-pieced live band. They have supported Interpol, Hot Chip and Depeche Mode on their world tours. Dear revived his Audion alias in 2013, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the first Audion release with a compilation, Audion X, and a series of new singles and DJ performances leading up to the release of the second Audion album, Alpha, in 2016. In early 2017 he released an entry into the well-regarded DJ-KiCKS mix series, along with his first single under his own name in five years, \\"Wrong With Us\\". The song was produced during a writing and recording session with the English duo Simian Mobile Disco, which also yielded several other songs. In June, he released \\"Modafinil Blues\\", the first single from his upcoming album, and announced tour dates, where he will be performing without a band for the first time. Influences Dear has listed Talking Heads, David Bowie, Adonis, Nitzer Ebb, and Roman Fl√ºgel as inspirations. When asked who he is influenced by Dear replied, \\"Definitely I'm influenced by Brian Eno and a lot of his work. I've said it before but he is one that is so interesting to listen to on all formats whether it be his production with other bands, whether it's his solo work or whether it's his collaboration work with other artists. He's probably the number one.\\" Discography =As Matthew Dear= Solo Albums *2003 Leave Luck to Heaven (Spectral Sound) *2004 Backstroke (Spectral Sound) *2007 Asa Breed (Ghostly International) *2008

(TMBI), formerly known as the Reader's Digest Association, Inc. (RDA), is an American multi-platform media and publishing company that is co-headquartered in New York City and White Plains, New York. The company was founded by husband and wife DeWitt Wallace and Lila Bell Wallace in New York City in 1922 with the first publication of the magazine Reader's Digest. The company's brands include Reader's Digest, Taste of Home, The Family Handyman, Simple & Delicious, Birds & Blooms, Reminisce, Country, EnrichU, and others. At its peak in 1973, the flagship magazine had over 30 million subscribers and continues to be published in 30 countries. As of 2016, its portfolio of brands garners 53 million unique online visitors and 40 million print readers per month. History Trusted Media Brands, Inc. (TMBI) was founded as Reader's Digest Association, Inc. (RDA) in New York City in 1922 by married duo DeWitt Wallace and Lila Bell Wallace. The two self- published the first edition of Reader's Digest in February 1922. To market the magazine, the two used direct mail marketing and sent 5,000 letters to nurses and schoolteachers. In 1925, DeWitt Wallace purchased land in Westchester County, New York where he moved the headquarters of RDA. In 1927, the number of Reader's Digest subscribers increased to 30,000. In 1939, that number was up to 3 million, and, by 1973, it had reached over 30 million. In 1986, under the new leadership of George Grune, the RDA began creating and acquiring new brands and publications to diversify its portfolio. Its first special-interest magazine, Travel Holiday, was acquired in 1986 and was followed by the acquisition of The Family Handyman in 1987. In 1990, it acquired American Health. That same year, the company went public. At the time, it had 7,200 employees in 54 locations throughout the world. In 1991, RDA acquired Joshua Morris Publishing, a children's book publisher and made its first move into the children's book industry. In 2002, RDA purchased Reiman Publications and its selection of 12 magazines for $760 million. The deal gave RDA ownership over magazines including Taste of Home, Country Woman, Birds & Blooms, Country, Reminisce, Healthy Cooking, Simple & Delicious, Farm & Ranch Living, and others. In 2005, RDA launched Every Day with Rachael Ray and purchased Allrecipes.com the following year. Both would eventually be sold to the Meredith Corporation in 2011 and 2012 respectively. In March 2007, RDA was purchased by an investment group led by private equity firm, Ripplewood Holdings, for $1.6 billion. Ripplewood made RDA a private company for the first time since 1990. RDA filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and again in 2012. It emerged from bankruptcy in 2013. On April 7, 2014, Bonnie Kintzer was appointed President and CEO of RDA. Kintzer had previously worked at RDA from 1998 to 2007. One of Kintzer's first major moves was to change the company's name to Trusted Media Brands, Inc. (TMBI) in September 2015. The new name was chosen to encompass all brands under the company's banner rather than just Reader's Digest. TMBI has placed renewed focus on a wide variety of media platforms including digital content, social media, video, and others. As of 2016, TMBI's portfolio of brands reaches 53 million unique visitors, 40 million print readers, and 40 million social media users per month. In 2016, TMBI sold its children's publishing operations to Readerlink Distribution Services.

She was scrapped in 1931. History Selfridge was named for Thomas O. Selfridge. She was laid down on 28 April 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; launched on 25 July 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Katharine Kellond, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Selfridge; and commissioned on 17 February 1921, Commander A. S. Farquhar in command. Selfridge arrived at her home port, San Diego, California, on 16 March 1921 and remained there until June 1922, when she proceeded to the Puget Sound area for exercises with the fleet. She returned to San Diego on 12 September for further training. On 6 February 1923, she sailed with the Battle Fleet for the Panama Canal Zone and conducted exercises there from 26 February to 31 March before returning to San Diego on 11 April. She then underwent overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard from 30 May to 16 July and rejoined the fleet for summer exercises off Washington. On 10 September, she returned to San Pedro, having rescued en route survivors of SS Cuba which had been wrecked on San Miguel Island on 8 September. On 2 January 1924, Selfridge departed San Diego with the Battle Fleet and participated in exercises in the Caribbean with the United States Fleet from 17 January to 6 April. Returning to San Diego on 22 April, she departed on 25 June for exercises off Puget Sound. She was overhauled at Mare Island between 5 August and 1 October and returned to San Diego on 2 October. Selfridge departed San Diego on 1 April 1925 with the fleet and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 April for exercises. Departing on 25 June, she underwent overhaul at Bremerton from 9 August to 3 October and returned to San Diego on 6 October. On 1 February 1926, Selfridge sailed from San Diego with the Battle Fleet and participated in exercises off Panama before returning to San Diego on 1 April. She arrived in the Puget Sound area on 10 July 1926 and, after receiving repairs at Mare Island from 9 August to 22 September, returned to San Diego on 24 September. In February 1927, she again sailed for the Canal Zone with the fleet and, after transiting the canal on 4 March, conducted exercises in the Caribbean until 22 April. With the fleet, she then visited New York and participated in a joint Army-Navy exercise in Narragansett Bay before arriving at Hampton Roads on 29 May for a Presidential Review. She was then assigned duty with the Special Service Squadron protecting lives and property of United States and other foreign citizens in Nicaragua and helping peacekeeping operations. She also carried out two patrols off that country, from 18 June to 2 July and 16 to 26 July. She then proceeded to Mare Island, underwent overhaul there, and returned to San Diego on 30 September. Selfridge departed San Diego on 9 April 1928 and, after conducting Fleet Problem VIII with the fleet en route, arrived at Pearl Harbor on 28 April. She returned to San Diego on 23 June and, after a two-week training cruise to Honolulu, underwent overhaul at Mare Island from 26 July to 19 September. She resumed exercises at San Diego and, between 27 January and 11 March 1929, participated in the fleet concentration off Panama. Fate She returned to San Diego on 22 March 1929 and was decommissioned there on 8 February 1930. Selfridge was struck from the Navy list on 3 November 1930, scrapped at the Mare Island Navy Yard, and her hulk was sold on 2 September 1931 to Marine Salvage Company, Oakland, California.

It is situated to the north of Corbridge, off the A68 road and includes some properties situated on the A68 (Dere Street).  Governance  Bingfield is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham. Modern history of Bingfield Bingfield likely developed from a farming community in the early 19th century, since most of the buildings date to that era. There were probably four farms: the present farm at the bottom of the road (now owned by the Whites and Sistersons); the Scott's farm, located about half a mile from Bingfield Combe Cottage, which consists of a massive farmhouse and several barn houses, now converted into homes. There is a smaller farm fifty yards opposite from the original farmhouse at the bottom of the hill, which was owned by the Scotts and Bingfield east quarter. There was also a school in Bingfield, and a church which dates to the late 18th/early 19th century. As there is no church in Hallington (the next village along) their population would also have used this church and school. It is not clear when the school closed, but area octogenarians Nicholas White and Keith Scott attended the school. Bingfield remained largely unchanged from the mid 19th century until after the Second World War. The change began with mechanisation. In the 1960s many farmers in England fell on hard times. It was then that the Whites, who owned the smaller farm at the bottom of Bingham hill sold off half their farm to Cuthbert Sisterson. The Suddes (a local family run farm around two miles (3 km) away) had to sell their farm house, but the son (Michael) has managed to buy it back in recent times. Since the 1970s there was a period of farmers selling off redundant farm buildings to be converted into houses. Going further back in time, Bingfield was an ancient settlement. There are the remains of an ancient medieval village in the field in front of the church, uncovered during an oil excavation. Bingfield Hall Bingfield Hall was in the hands of the Story family for many years. John Story of Bingfield Hall (1648-1725) emigrated to Ireland, perhaps during the Williamite plantation of Scots in Ulster (1680s-1690s), and settled as a major landowner at Corick House, near Clogher, Co. Tyrone. This family expanded its influence and in 1745 a house called Bingfield was built by Joseph Story, Archdeacon of Kilmore Cathedral, about a mile away ‚Äì a house which was to become influential in Irish society. Genealogical records of the Northumberland Storys survive from the 17th and 18th centuries, but Bingfield Hall is long demolished and replaced by a farmhouse now also in ruins: enquiries in 1895 by Col. Robert Story could find no trace of the Hall in 1895, and the name of the family was unknown to those on the farm. History of Bingfield Combe Cottage and two neighbouring houses Bingfield Combe Cottage was originally built as a cart shed for Bingfield farm (which is the farm where about one mile away, at the bottom of the hill). The cottage was built to store carts and farm machinery such as ploughs. There are now two separately-owned farms separated by about 50 yards; however, this holding used to be a single large farm (approximately 1000 acres). As far as is known the cottage was constructed in about 1830. The stone was probably sourced from the quarry along the ridge, although there are reports that claim that actual stones were removed from Hadrian's Wall, which runs less than three miles (5 km) away to the south from Bingfield. The farm at the bottom of Bingfeld hill has most recently been owned by the Whites, and until recently the farm 500 yards from this was owned by the Sistersons. There were three buildings up here. As well as the cottage the other two buildings were used to support the farm. The next-door house, then a barn, was for stabling horses/cattle, and the house behind the cottage was the gin gang; this was a massive room for grinding corn. A horse was hooked up to a gear system which operated grinding stones powered by the horse walking round the room. It can be deduced that these buildings were built up here (remote from the farm) to save the farmer from having to transport equipment up and down the hill in the days before mechanization (tractors). Bingfield farmhouse was the building that would have been built originally, and the cottage, and then the barn would have been built in the years after that.

Rivalries have arisen among NHL teams for many different reasons, the primary ones including geographic proximity, familiarity with opponents, on- ice incidents, and cultural, linguistic, or national pride. The importance of these various factors has varied widely throughout the history of the league. Early history During the earliest days of the NHL, the league was limited strictly to Central Canada, and all cities in the league were in close proximity, making for bitter rivalries all around. In addition, Montreal had two teams representing its English-French divide. The \\"French\\" Canadiens battled the \\"English\\" Wanderers (and later the Maroons). Rivalries also existed with other leagues, such as the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. It was not until 1926 that the NHL took sole ownership of the Stanley Cup. By that time, the league began expanding into the United States, and new rivalries were created. Rapid expansion into the U.S. for a short time created a cross-town rivalry in New York City between the New York Rangers and New York Americans. The economic turmoil of the Great Depression and World War II, however, forced several teams to fold, with the result that by 1942 the NHL consisted of only 6 teams. =Original Six rivalries= From ‚Äì, only six teams (the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers, and Toronto Maple Leafs) played in the NHL. With only 6 opponents, teams played more frequently and games were often underscored by personal rivalries between players. These personal and team rivalries lasted for many years, as the turnover rate on NHL rosters was very low. At one point or another, during this era, all the teams had animosity towards one another. Eastern Conference =Atlantic Division= The current Atlantic Division was formed in 1974 as the Adams Division, which beginning in 1981 had all its teams in Eastern Canada and New England with the exception of the Buffalo Sabres, which are located in Western New York. The division became the Northeast Division in 1993, and then the Atlantic Division in 2013. Battle of Ontario: Ottawa Senators vs. Toronto Maple Leafs The Battle of Ontario is a rivalry between the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs. The teams compete in the same division and meet frequently during regular season games. In the early 2000s, the teams met four times in the playoffs with Toronto winning all 4 series. Battle of the QEW: Buffalo Sabres vs. Toronto Maple Leafs The rivalry between the Buffalo Sabres and Toronto Maple Leafs is due to the 100-mile distance between their home arenas (KeyBank Center and Scotiabank Arena respectively) via the Queen Elizabeth Way. The Sabres have won 72 of 110 all-time home games against the Maple Leafs despite the large contingent of Toronto fans at those games. Since the season, both teams have played in the Northeast Division, now the Atlantic Division. Buffalo won the 1999 Eastern Conference Finals against Toronto in five games, the only playoff series between the two teams. The rivalry was added to in May 2015, with head coach Mike Babcock signing with the Leafs (who the Sabres were close to inking a deal with the day prior). In 2018‚Äì19, Toronto swept Buffalo in the season series for the first time ever. Buffalo had previously swept a season series with Toronto in 1979‚Äì80, 1987‚Äì88, and 1991‚Äì92. As of the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Buffalo leads the all-time series 119‚Äì73‚Äì18‚Äì9 (including a 4‚Äì1 playoff record) against Toronto. Boston Bruins vs. Buffalo Sabres The Bruins and Sabres have had a rivalry since the Sabres joined the NHL in 1970. These teams have met in the playoffs eight times with the Bruins winning the first five meetings in 1982, 1983, 1988, 1989, and 1992. Their 1983 series was most memorable when in game 7 of the Adams Division final, Brad Park scored the winning goal at 1:52 of sudden death overtime. The Sabres would finally be victorious in 1993, when they swept the Bruins in the opening round on Brad May's famous \\"May Day\\" goal called by longtime Sabres broadcaster Rick Jeanneret. In 1999, the Sabres beat the Bruins in six games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals on their way to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Stars in six games on Brett Hull's controversial goal. The teams met in the opening round of the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Sabres, who won the Northeast Division with 100 points and were seeded 3rd in the Eastern Conference, were upset by the 6th seeded Bruins in six games. In April 2013, the rivalry was set aside when both teams faced off in the Bruins first home game after the Boston Marathon bombing. The Bruins were also responsible for Ryan Miller's head injury in 2011. Milan Lucic gave him a concussion but received no suspension. As of the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Boston leads the all-time series 164‚Äì114‚Äì29‚Äì12 (including a 25‚Äì20 playoff record) against Buffalo. Boston Bruins vs. Montreal Canadiens The Bruins‚ÄìCanadiens rivalry is considered by former Canadiens head coach Jacques Martin to be \\"one of the greatest rivalries in sports,\\" along with the Yankees‚ÄìRed Sox rivalry, Dodgers‚ÄìGiants rivalry, Bears‚ÄìPackers rivalry, and Celtics‚ÄìLakers rivalry. The two teams have played each other more times, in both regular season play and the playoffs, than any other two teams in NHL history. In the playoffs, the two teams have met in 34 series for a total of 171 games, 11 series, and 60 more games than two other Original 6 teams, the Red Wings and Maple Leafs. The two teams have faced each other 9 times in Game sevens, more times than any other opponents in NHL history. Boston Bruins vs. Toronto Maple Leafs Both teams are Original Six teams, with their first game played in Boston's inaugural season in 1924. From 1924-2019, the two teams met each other in the 16 playoff series, and faced each other in one Stanley Cup Finals. The rivalry has since been renewed from the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs which saw the Bruins rally from a 4‚Äì1 third period deficit to defeat the Maple Leafs in overtime, 5‚Äì4, and advance to the second round. The Bruins and Maple Leafs faced each other in both the 2018 and 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Bruins winning both series in seven games. Detroit Red Wings vs. Toronto Maple Leafs While the Toronto-Montreal rivalry is one of the most famous in all of sports, the rivalry with the Red Wings is no less intense. This rivalry dates to the 1920s. As of 2017, they have had twenty-three playoff meetings, five in the finals. So fierce was the rivalry that when the New York Rangers reached the finals against Detroit in 1950, but could not play in their home rink, Madison Square Garden, because the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus were in town, they arranged to play home games in Toronto, whose fans hated the Wings. The rivalry heightened to a fever pitch due to an incident in the 1950 playoffs when Detroit's young star, Gordie Howe, mistimed a check on Toronto's Ted Kennedy and fell head-first into the boards, suffering severe injuries and needing emergency surgery to save his life. While Kennedy was exonerated by the NHL, Detroit management and fans accused him of deliberately injuring Howe. The result was a violent playoff series and increased animosity between the teams. The teams' proximity to each other ‚Äì Toronto and Detroit are approximately 240 miles (380 km) apart, mainly using Ontario Highway 401 ‚Äì and a number of shared fans (particularly in markets such as Windsor, Ontario) added to the rivalry. After the Leafs moved to the Eastern Conference in 1998, they faced each other less often, and the rivalry was more often found in the stands than on the ice. The matchup became a divisional one for the first time in fifteen seasons, in the 2013‚Äì14 season when the Red Wings moved into the Eastern Conference, sharing their division with the Maple Leafs. The 2014 NHL Winter Classic was played between the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor on January 1, 2014. The rivalry may have heightened in 2015 with the signing of former Red Wings coach Mike Babcock as the new coach of the Leafs. Governor's Cup: Florida Panthers vs. Tampa Bay Lightning The Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning are both teams located within the state of Florida along Interstate 75, representing different geographical areas within the state. The two teams have played in the same division since 1993 (Atlantic Division from 1993‚Äì98, Southeast Division from 1998‚Äì2013, and the new Atlantic Division since 2013). These two teams have never faced each other in the playoffs. Prior to the 2013‚Äì14 season, it was announced that the two teams would compete to win the \\"Governor's Cup.\\" The team who earns the most points in head-to-head matchups is awarded a trophy in recognition of their regular-season series win. If the teams finish the season with equal points earned in games against one another, the first tiebreaker is goal difference in those games. Montreal Canadiens vs. Ottawa Senators (original and modern) The rivalry between Montreal Canadiens and the original Ottawa Senators & later the modern Ottawa Senators began, just like Toronto and Ottawa, in the early days of the NHL. The first National Hockey League game was between the original Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens on December 19, 1917. Also, in 1927, the two teams faced each other in the second round, Ottawa won that series and they went on to win the Stanley Cup. The Canadiens and the modern Senators face each other often as they are both in the Atlantic Division and there is only a two-hour drive from Montreal to Ottawa via Quebec Autoroute 40 and Ontario Highway 417. The modern Ottawa Senators' first NHL game was held in Ottawa on October 8, 1992 where the expansion Senators beat the Canadiens 5‚Äì3. That victory was one of the only Senators' highlights of their inaugural season; they won only nine more games the rest of the season to finish with ten wins and 24 points (tied for the NHL's worst record with the San Jose Sharks; but San Jose had a better regular season record, who had one more win - 11 to 10; it should also be noted that Ottawa lost 70 games to San Jose's 71),List of NHL records (team)#Season records while the Canadiens won their 24th Stanley Cup that season. The modern Senators and the Canadiens faced each other in the playoffs for the first time in 2013. In that series, there were a large amount of controversial events. In game 1, Senators' Eric Gryba laid out Montreal's Lars Eller in an open ice hit. After the game, Senators' coach Paul MacLean blamed Raphael Diaz for a suicide pass. Later, Canadiens' coach Michel Therrien responded and said that what Maclean said was a \\"lack of respect.\\" Ottawa won that game 4‚Äì2; Brandon Prust later insulted MacLean after the game, saying that he doesn't care what that \\"bug-eyed, fat walrus has to say.\\" In Game 3, there was a full line brawl between Ottawa and Montreal. And later in that game, Paul MacLean called a timeout with 17 seconds left in the 3rd period with a 6‚Äì1 lead. Michel Therrien called Maclean classless while Maclean responded by saying that he was protecting his players from Montreal's dirty play in that game. The underdog Senators eventually won the series 4‚Äì1. Two years later, the rivalry was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal's PK Subban slashed Ottawa's Mark Stone‚Äîbreaking his wrist‚Äîand Subban was later kicked out of the game. Senators' coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserves a suspension. Ottawa's Clarke MacArthur called it a lumberjack slash and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did not deserve to be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. Montreal won that game 4‚Äì3. Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal. Riding a 3‚Äì0 lead in the series, Montreal saw Ottawa win the next two games, before closing the series in Game 6 with a 2‚Äì0 win in Ottawa. As of the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Montreal leads the all-time series 77‚Äì59‚Äì5‚Äì12 including a (5‚Äì6) playoff record against Ottawa. Montreal Canadiens vs. Toronto Maple Leafs The Canadiens‚ÄìMaple Leafs rivalry is the oldest in NHL history. From 1943‚Äì79, the two teams met each other in the playoffs 15 times, and faced off in five Stanley Cup Finals. While the on-ice competition is fierce, the Leafs-Habs rivalry is symbolic of the rivalry between Canada's two largest cities: Toronto and Montreal, and by extension its two major linguistic groups, anglophones and francophones and their status as hubs for English Canada and French Canada, respectively. Notably, the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs have won the most Stanley Cups in the NHL, with 24 and 13, respectively. As a result of their success, they have the two largest fanbases in the entire league ‚Äì both teams have an influx of visiting fans in their home arenas when they play each other. However, neither team has won the cup since the 1990s when Montreal won the cup in 1993 and Toronto in 1967. =Metropolitan Division= The basic structure of the Metropolitan Division dates to the 1974 formation of the Patrick Division, which from 1981 onwards would have all its teams in the Mid-Atlantic States. It became the Atlantic Division (not the same as the current Atlantic Division) in 1993, and then the Metropolitan Division in 2013. New York Islanders vs. Philadelphia Flyers Similar to other New York‚ÄìPhiladelphia sports rivalries, the Islanders and Flyers have been rivals since New York‚Äôs establishment into the league in 1972. The 2 teams have met in the postseason 5 times: 1975, 1980, 1985, 1987, and 2020. The Flyers have won 3 of the 5 series, but the most notable series between the two teams was in the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals which the Islanders won in 6 games. Game 6 was notable for Bob Nystrom's OT goal which not only gave the Islanders their first Stanley Cup in franchise history, but also kick-started a dynasty for the team as New York went on to win the Cup again in 1981, 1982, and 1983. As of the 2019‚Äì20 season, Philadelphia leads the all time series 141‚Äì96‚Äì26‚Äì13, including a (17‚Äì14) playoff record against the New York Islanders. Battle of the Hudson River: New Jersey Devils vs. New York Rangers The Devils‚ÄìRangers rivalry, exists between two teams in the New York metropolitan area. The two teams are called \\"cross-river rivals.\\" This is because Madison Square Garden in Midtown Manhattan, where the Rangers play, is less than ten miles and across the Hudson River from the Prudential Center in downtown Newark (and previously, the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford), the home arena of the Devils. Travel between both arenas is easily accomplished by road (usually through the Lincoln Tunnel), rapid transit (on the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) train) and rail (along the Northeast Corridor). The teams have met six times in the playoffs; the Rangers have won four times. Battle of the Turnpikes: New Jersey Devils vs. Philadelphia Flyers The rivalry between the New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia Flyers is very intense in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania, sometimes being referred to as the \\"Battle of the Turnpikes.\\" The Devils play in Newark, New Jersey, which can be accessed by using the New Jersey Turnpike and the Flyers play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is about twenty-five miles from the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The two turnpikes connect over the Delaware River on the border of Pennsylvania and New Jersey near Northeast Philadelphia and Burlington, New Jersey. In addition, the Flyers practice in Voorhees Township, New Jersey, and since their Stanley Cup championships of and , many members of those Cup-winning teams (as well as other Flyers alumni) have lived in South Jersey. Since the conferences were realigned and renamed prior to the season, the two teams have won the two highest numbers of division titles (the Devils 9, the Flyers 6). Together, the two teams' 15 division championships account for almost all of the 18 total Atlantic Division titles. Battle of Pennsylvania: Philadelphia Flyers vs. Pittsburgh Penguins The Battle of Pennsylvania, which is the Philadelphia Flyers‚ÄìPittsburgh Penguins rivalry, began in 1967 when the teams were introduced into the NHL's \\"Next Six\\" expansion wave. The rivalry exists due to divisional alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in the state of Pennsylvania. In their 2012 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals matchup, the rivalry strengthened with several on and off-ice incidents resulting in suspensions and fines. Philadelphia took a 3‚Äì0 series lead, and by the fourth game the two teams had combined to score an NHL-record 45 goals. The Flyers ultimately prevailed in game 6, by which point the two teams had combined for 309 penalty minutes. At times, the rivalry has been considered by some to be the most heated in the league. Battle of New York: New York Islanders vs. New York Rangers The Islanders‚ÄìRangers rivalry, also unofficially known as the \\"Battle of New York\\", is unique among New York City's major league sports, as the Islanders and Rangers are in the same conference and division, guaranteeing plenty of matchups ‚Äì similar to the National Basketball Association's Brooklyn Nets and New York Knicks, who since 2015 also share arenas with the Islanders and Rangers, respectively. Major League Baseball's New York Yankees and New York Mets are in different leagues, as are the National Football League's New York Jets and New York Giants, so the only meeting opportunities are during inter-league or championship games. The games are often characterized by more fights in the stands than on the ice. The New York Islanders originally entered the league as the \\"step sister\\" of the New York Rangers, but their 4 straight Stanley Cups in the early 1980s generated a fierce rivalry between the teams and fan bases. New York Rangers vs. Pittsburgh Penguins The Rangers and Penguins have been a rivals since the past those years even when the range the rivalry have changing it out then something so the Rangers winning two times from the playoffs and the Penguins winning five times from the playoffs. New York Islanders vs. Pittsburgh Penguins The Islanders and Penguins have been rivals since the mid-1970s. These two teams have met in the playoffs five times, with the Islanders winning four of the five playoff series. In 1975, the Penguins led their playoff series against the Islanders three games to none. However, the Islanders came back to win the next four games to take the series in seven games, becoming only the second team in NHL history (after the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1942) to win a playoff series after trailing three games to none. In 1982, the Islanders won the first two games easily, before Pittsburgh tied the series. Going home for Game 5 and facing elimination, the game went into overtime where John Tonelli scored the game-winner. In 1993, both teams met in the division final with the Islanders defeating the two time defending Stanley Cup champion Penguins in seven games. On February 11, 2011, the teams engaged in a vicious brawl. In the game (which the Islanders dominated the Penguins 9‚Äì3) the teams combined for 65 penalties, which included 15 fighting majors and 21 game misconducts, resulting in a combined total of 346 penalty minutes. The two teams met in the opening round of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Penguins coming out on top in six games. Both teams met in the 2019 playoffs, where the Penguins were heavily favored, but the Islanders surprisingly swept the series. As of the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Pittsburgh leads the all-time series 134‚Äì120‚Äì22‚Äì12 including a (12‚Äì17) playoff record against the New York Islanders. New York Islanders vs. Washington Capitals The rivalry takes place in the Metropolitan Division. The Capitals and Islanders were heavy rivals during the 1980s and early 1990s, becoming intense once again in the 2018‚Äì19 season, when Washington Capitals head coach Barry Trotz signed for the Islanders after leading the Capitals to win the 2018 Stanley Cup. New York Rangers vs. Washington Capitals The rivalry takes place in the Metropolitan Division. The two have been rivals since the Capitals joined the Patrick Division in 1979. The rivalry got really heated during the 1990s with these teams meeting three times in five seasons. However, the rivalry has really heated as of 2015 with five series within the last seven years. Philadelphia Flyers vs. New York Rangers upright The Flyers‚ÄìRangers rivalry is one of the most well-known of the league. They have met 11 times in the Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Flyers winning 6 times, and have been division rivals since the season. There is a long-standing bitter rivalry between the sports fans from New York City and Philadelphia, which are approximately two hours apart by car, also seen in the Mets‚ÄìPhillies rivalry in Major League Baseball and the Eagles‚ÄìGiants rivalry in the National Football League. Games between the two teams at Madison Square Garden and Wells Fargo Center are often very intense, hard-hitting affairs, as each home crowd does its best to create an unfriendly, sometimes volatile atmosphere for any visiting-team fans. Philadelphia Flyers vs. Washington Capitals The Flyers and Capitals have been rivals through the 1980s, dating back to their days in the Patrick Division. In 1984, Mike Gartner lead the Capitals to a three-game sweep of the Flyers in the opening round of the playoffs for the Capitals' first ever playoff series victory, and in the process ending the careers of Bobby Clarke and Bill Barber, the last two players of the Broad Street Bullies era. In 1988, the Capitals trailed the Flyers three games to one in the opening round of the playoffs. Washington would rally to win the next three games to take the series in seven games capped off by Dale Hunter's overtime goal in game seven. The following year, Tim Kerr and Ron Hextall helped the Flyers take down the division champions Capitals. In the 2000s, the rivalry was reignited by the rebirth of the Alexander Ovechkin-led Capitals, whom the Flyers eliminated in 2008. Since the league-wide realignment in 2013, the rivalry between the teams has started to intensify. During a regular season game in 2013, there was an all-out line-brawl between the two teams. Washington would win the game 7‚Äì0. Both teams met in the first round of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Capitals winning the series four games to two. Pittsburgh Penguins vs. Columbus Blue Jackets The Columbus Blue Jackets have established a rivalry with the Pittsburgh Penguins in recent history (as of the 2013‚Äì14 season). This is referenced in telecasts, news articles and online arguments between fans of the clubs. Games between the two teams are very physical, with numerous fights and post-whistle scrums. This rivalry is one of the NHL's newest, and primarily exists due to divisional and geographical alignments (Columbus and Pittsburgh are approximately 3 hours apart by automobile, via Interstates 70 and 79). As a result, it is not uncommon to see large numbers of visiting Penguins fans at games versus the Jackets in Nationwide Arena. The seeds for this rivalry were planted when the Blue Jackets traded star forward Rick Nash to the New York Rangers for Brandon Dubinsky, the latter of whom has a personal feud with Penguins' star centerman Sidney Crosby. Furthermore, this was amplified by the arrival of longtime Philadelphia Flyers forward Scott Hartnell in Columbus, who has been involved in numerous brawls and conflicts with the Penguins during his time as a Flyer. The 2013‚Äì14 NHL realignment saw the Jackets and the Detroit Red Wings move to the Eastern Conference, placing Columbus in the Metropolitan Division with the Penguins. Pittsburgh swept the regular season series against the Jackets, but Columbus, on the heels of a 93-point season, earned a wild-card playoff berth (at that time only their second in team history), facing the Penguins in the first round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, which the Penguins won in 6 games. The two teams met yet again in the first round in 2017. That series was won by the Penguins in 5 games, marking the second time in four years that Pittsburgh ended the Blue Jackets' season. Despite these playoff losses to the Penguins, the Blue Jackets have in recent years gotten the better of Pittsburgh in regular season matchups, leaving the Penguins with a losing record versus Columbus over the past two years of play. Further intensifying the rivalry, the Jackets fired head coach Todd Richards early in the 2015‚Äì16 season, replacing him with John Tortorella, who has a long-standing disdain for the Penguins, dating back to his days as head coach of the New York Rangers. Tensions between the teams further flared up during a regular season game at Nationwide Arena on November 27, 2015, when Brandon Dubinsky was penalized for a cross-check to Sidney Crosby, a hit which briefly injured Crosby and later earned Dubinsky a one-game suspension. Crosby would later return to the game; however, the Jackets prevailed 2‚Äì1 in overtime over the Penguins, a goal on which Dubinsky assisted. In an interview following Dubinsky's suspension, Tortorella would later go on to be quoted: \\"We're not going to whine here. Pittsburgh can whine. Pittsburgh whines enough for the whole league, so there's no room for any other team to whine. We'll just go about our business.\\" The two teams met for their second playoff meeting in the 2017 playoffs. Game 2 in Pittsburgh, won by the Penguins, saw an incident near the end of the game where Blue Jackets forward Matt Calvert cross-checked and subsequently broke his stick across the back of Penguins forward Tom Kuhnhackl, sparking a melee on the ice. Calvert would later be suspended for his actions. Pittsburgh would be victorious in five games, en route to their second straight Stanley Cup championship. On December 21, 2017, in Pittsburgh, a scrum broke out at the end of the second period during a game between the two teams. Numerous penalties were handed out, including roughing penalties to Columbus defenseman Seth Jones and Pittsburgh forward Sidney Crosby, as well as a five-minute major to Columbus forward Boone Jenner, for a high-stick to Penguin star Jake Guentzel. The Penguins prevailed, 3‚Äì2, in a shootout. As of the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Pittsburgh leads the all-time series 31‚Äì11‚Äì0‚Äì4 (including an 8‚Äì3 playoff record) against Columbus. Pittsburgh Penguins vs. Washington Capitals upright These two teams played in the Patrick Division together from 1981‚Äì1993, and have been part of the Metro Division since 2013. In total, the two teams have met 11 times in the playoffs. Despite trailing in nine of the eleven series, Pittsburgh has won all but the 1994 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals and the 2018 Eastern Conference Second Round, both series Pittsburgh were heavily favored. The teams first met in the 1991 Patrick Division Finals, when the Penguins defeated the Capitals in 5 en route to capturing the Stanley Cup. In fact, all 6 Stanley Cups championship seasons combined between Washington and Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh has 5 of them), have involved a round against the other team. The rivalry was intense during the early 2000s when the Penguins beat the Capitals in the first round in consecutive seasons (1999‚Äì2000, 2000‚Äì01), and seemed to amplify more after the trade of Jarom√≠r J√°gr. More recently, with the drafting and emergence of Alexander Ovechkin in Washington, and Sidney Crosby in Pittsburgh, the rivalry has heated up again, with controversial comments that Alexander Semin made about Crosby in the media and physical altercations taking place between Ovechkin and Malkin during games. One of the best series to date between the teams was the 2009 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which the Capitals took a 2‚Äì0 series lead before letting it go once again to be downed in 7 games, ending with a 6‚Äì2 Game 7 loss at the Verizon Center. Just like in 1991 and 1992, the Penguins defeated the Capitals in the playoffs en route to the Stanley Cup. The two teams faced off at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic hosted in Pittsburgh at Heinz Field, with the Capitals emerging victorious 3‚Äì1, and a hit in the game resulting in Crosby missing nearly all of two seasons with concussion-related issues. Both teams completed their second playoff confrontation in the Ovechkin-Crosby era in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs with the Penguins winning in six games, again preceding Pittsburgh's fourth Stanley Cup title. In 2017, these two teams met again in the second round. Pittsburgh gained a 3‚Äì1 series lead only to see Washington win the next two games. The Penguins shut out the Capitals at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals and eventually the franchise's fifth Stanley Cup. The two teams met again in the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs in the second round for the third consecutive year. The Washington Capitals defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games to advance to the Eastern Conference Final, and eventually win the Stanley Cup. =Interdivisional= Boston Bruins vs. New York Rangers The NHL's extension of the Boston‚ÄìNew York rivalry ‚Äì present in the other leagues with the Yankees‚ÄìRed Sox rivalry, Celtics‚ÄìKnicks rivalry and Jets‚ÄìPatriots rivalry ‚Äì had its peak during the 1970s, but saw a resurgence in the 2010s. In the Original Six era, the teams had six matchups, with the Rangers only winning in 1928 and 1940 ‚Äì both on the way to a Stanley Cup title. Between 1970 and 1973, where the Rangers' GAG line and the Bruins led by Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito had strong showings; the teams met three times, with the highest point being the 1972 Stanley Cup Finals, which the Bruins won in six games, but Rangers won in 5 games, in 1973. 40 years passed before the next series between the Bruins and Rangers, and in 2013 the Bruins eliminated the Rangers in five games. As of the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Boston leads the all-time series (319‚Äì267‚Äì99‚Äì11), including (26‚Äì19‚Äì2) playoff record against the New York Rangers. The Bruins have won seven of ten playoffs series between the teams. Boston Bruins vs. Philadelphia Flyers The Boston‚ÄìPhiladelphia NHL rivalry, also present in the NBA's Celtics‚Äì76ers rivalry, dates back to and was most intense in the 1970s, but the rivalry renewed its intensity in the 2010s. In the early 1970s, both the Bruins and Flyers played similar styles that reflected perfectly on each teams respective city, with the Bruins being known as the \\"Big Bad Bruins\\" and the Flyers as the \\"Broad Street Bullies.\\" The most vicious rivalry of the era hit its peak in the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals, with the Bruins, led by Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito, and Flyers, led by Bobby Clarke and Bernie Parent, in an intense grudge match. The Flyers would complete a stunning upset, defeating the Bruins in six games. The two teams would meet each other again in the 1976, 1977, and 1978 playoffs, but would not meet each other again in the playoffs until 2010. Prior to the playoff meeting, the two teams squared off in the 2010 Winter Classic at Fenway Park, with the Bruins winning the game 2‚Äì1 in overtime. When the two teams met in the playoffs that year, the Bruins stormed out to a 3‚Äì0 series lead, but the Flyers would complete a stunning comeback, winning the series four games to three, and end up in the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals. The Bruins would get revenge the next season by sweeping the Flyers in the conference semifinals en route to their 2011 Stanley Cup win. In total, the Bruins and Flyers have met in the playoffs six times, with each team winning three series. New York Islanders vs. Toronto Maple Leafs The rivalry between the Islanders and the Leafs has been underground for many years. While these teams don't meet as frequently as divisional opponents, the games between the two teams are just as intense. Soon after the Islanders became a franchise both teams met each other in the playoffs. One highlight series between these two teams took place in the 1978 playoffs. The Leafs and Islanders met in the Quarterfinals, where Toronto won in seven games after Lanny McDonald scored the overtime winner in Game Seven to win 2‚Äì1. New York later got their revenge, sweeping the Leafs 3‚Äì0 in the first round of the 1981 Stanley Cup playoffs. The rivalry evaporated due to low frequency of matchups, but the teams met again in the 2002 playoffs, where Toronto won the series in seven games. The rivalry has since intensified following the 2017‚Äì18 season, after general manager Lou Lamoriello's contract with the Leafs expired on April 30, 2018. Lamoriello was subsequently hired by the Islanders as their president of hockey operations on May 22, 2018, and later named himself the general manager. The rivalry was renewed when on July 1, 2018, star player and then-Isles captain John Tavares left the Islanders to sign with his hometown Maple Leafs. This move was negatively received by the Islander fans, as they thought Tavares had a legitimate chance of re-signing following his pleading to then-general manager Garth Snow to not trade him. On February 28, 2019, in a highly publicized and sold-out game, Toronto played New York in Nassau Coliseum. Tavares was relentlessly booed and heckled by Islanders fans throughout the match, including during his tribute video, and items were thrown at Tavares on the ice. The Islanders won the game 6‚Äì1, but the Leafs later took the next game at the Islanders arena on April 1, 2019, by a score of 2‚Äì1. Tavares scored the eventual game-winning goal, clinching a playoff berth for the Leafs and a first round match-up against Boston Bruins. At the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season, the Islanders lead the all-time series 78‚Äì66‚Äì7‚Äì8, with a playoff record of 9‚Äì8 against Toronto. The Leafs have won two of the three playoff series between the teams. Western Conference There are significantly fewer major rivalries in the NHL's Western Conference, due to this conference being much newer (the conference as a whole was created in 1967 as the West Division, then expanded as a Conference in 1974) and only one of the conference's teams ‚Äì the Chicago Blackhawks ‚Äì predates the conference's creation. Geographically, its teams are generally spread much farther apart than those of the Eastern Conference. =Central Division= The Central Division was essentially formed as the Norris Division in 1974. From 1981 onward, it would have all the Central Time Zone teams in the US and the Eastern Time Zone teams not in the Wales Conference. It became the Central Division in 1993. Chicago Blackhawks vs. Minnesota Wild The Blackhawks‚ÄìWild rivalry started during the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs when the two teams met in the first round. The Blackhawks won in 5 games in that series. The NHL realignment that took place during the 2013 offseason placed Chicago and Minnesota within the Central Division, further invigorating the rivalry, and also rekindling the Chicago-Minnesota rivalry that died out when the Minnesota North Stars relocated to Dallas in 1993. The rivalry became even more intense with another playoff meeting between the Blackhawks and the Wild in the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, this time in the second round. The Blackhawks once again turned out victorious, this time winning in 6 games. In the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Blackhawks and the Wild met again in the second round. The Blackhawks won yet again, but this time, in the fashion of a sweep. The rivalry has sparked interest within the NHL, and during the 2015 All Star Weekend in Columbus, the League announced two NHL Stadium Series games and the 2016 NHL Winter Classic. Game one of the 2016 NHL Stadium Series featured the Blackhawks and the Wild at TCF Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota on February 21, 2016. Minnesota won the game 6‚Äì1. As of the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Minnesota leads the all-time series 45‚Äì40‚Äì1‚Äì4, including a 3‚Äì12 playoff record against Chicago. Chicago Blackhawks vs. St. Louis Blues The Blackhawks‚ÄìBlues rivalry features the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues. Since , the two teams have been in the same division together. It is the most intense rivalry in terms of penalty minutes and fighting. At the height of the rivalry throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, it was common to go to a Chicago vs. St. Louis game and see a brawl break out. The most famous brawl of this era was the St. Patrick's Day Massacre. The rivalry cooled somewhat in the 2000s, but it heated back up in the 2010s, with both teams finding success in the early 2010s as well as Chicago losing the longtime division rivalry with the Detroit Red Wings as a result of the 2013‚Äì14 realignment. All six Sutter Brothers would play for this rivalry. In the 2010s, Chicago won the Stanley Cup three times and St. Louis once.  St. Louis Blues vs. Minnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars  The Blues‚ÄìStars rivalry began in 1967 when the two teams debuted as part of the NHL expansion. Both teams have been in the same division in all but 17 of their seasons. The two teams faced off in the Stanley Cup playoffs 14 times, with the Blues owning an 8‚Äì6 mark. They have met in five Game 7s, four of which needed overtime. The two teams met for the first time in the 1968 Stanley Cup playoffs, in which Ron Schock's double overtime goal in Game 7 sent the Blues to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance. In both the 1999 and 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Stars and Blues won the Stanley Cup, and along the way, defeated the other team in the second round during those playoff runs. The 1999 series saw four games decided in overtime, and the 2019 series ended in double overtime in which St. Louis native Patrick Maroon tipped in the game-winning goal. =Pacific Division= The Pacific Division dates back to the 1974 formation of the Smythe Division, which from 1981 onward would contain the westernmost teams in the NHL. It became the Pacific Division in 1993.  Anaheim Ducks vs. San Jose Sharks The Ducks‚ÄìSharks rivalry has been going since 1993 when the Ducks came into existence. The rivalry got heated when the two faced each other in the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Ducks won the series 4‚Äì2. Both teams met again in the 2018 playoffs, where the Sharks swept the Ducks 4‚Äì0 in the first round. As of the end of the 2018‚Äì19 NHL season, San Jose leads the all-time series 78‚Äì58‚Äì4‚Äì10, including a 6‚Äì4 playoff record against Anaheim. Battle of Alberta: Calgary Flames vs. Edmonton Oilers The Battle of Alberta is the bitter rivalry between the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers. The two teams are based in the cities of Edmonton, the provincial capital of Alberta, and Calgary, the province's most populous city. Most often it is used to describe sporting events between the two cities, although this is not exclusive as the rivalry predates organized sports in Alberta. The rivalry peaked during the mid-late 1980s, as from 1983-1990 the Western Conference only had two different champions, both being Calgary and Edmonton. They frequently played each other in the playoffs, with three series going 7 games. Edmonton won the Stanley Cup in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990. Calgary won the Stanley Cup in 1989. Calgary leads the all- time series with a 127‚Äì118‚Äì18 record, however, Edmonton leads in postseason victories with a 19‚Äì11 record. Calgary Flames vs. Vancouver Canucks The Canucks‚ÄìFlames rivalry is a rivalry between the Vancouver Canucks and Calgary Flames. The two teams have played in the same division since the 1981‚Äì82 NHL division realignment. Freeway Face-Off: Anaheim Ducks vs. Los Angeles Kings The term Freeway Face-Off refers to a series of games played between the Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings. The series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one can travel from one team's arena to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5. The two teams have also faced off in an outdoor game at Dodger Stadium, in which the Ducks won 3‚Äì0. The two teams have met only once in the playoffs, during the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, of which the Kings won 4 games to 3. The Kings would eventually go on to win the Stanley Cup that year. The term is akin to the Freeway Series which refers to meetings between the Los Angeles area baseball teams, the Los Angeles Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers. San Jose Sharks vs. Los Angeles Kings The rivalry between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area NHL teams began as a result of the 1967 NHL expansion, which established both the Los Angeles Kings and the California Golden Seals. At the time, the Kings and Seals were the only two NHL teams located west of the Mississippi River (the St. Louis Blues and the Minnesota North Stars were located on that river), and thus were created for each other to both reduce the amount of travel each team would need to do and to gain a foothold on the West Coast, previously the province of the borderline-major Western Hockey League, of which the Seals had been a member. The Seals were a historically unsuccessful team and left the Bay Area in 1976; the team ceased to exist when it merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978. The Kings‚ÄìSharks rivalry started in 1991, when the San Jose Sharks were spun off from the North Stars and effectively reborn under the Seals' previous ownership. This rivalry really kicked things off with defeating the Wayne Gretzky era Los Angeles Kings 4‚Äì0 on April 28, 1995 destroyed any hope of a Kings playoff appearance. The Kings didn't get a definitive win over the Sharks until the season, when the Kings' victory on February 17, 2003 at the Staples Center ended the Sharks hope of making the playoffs. The Kings and Sharks met in the playoffs for the first time ever in 2011. The Sharks were the #2 seed and the Kings were the #7 seed. The Sharks eliminated Los Angeles in six games with Joe Thornton scoring the OT goal that eliminated the Kings. In the 2011‚Äì12 NHL season, the teams competed for the last two seeds in the west with the Sharks ultimately securing the #7 seed while L.A. went into the #8 seed. San Jose was eliminated by the St. Louis Blues in the first round while L.A. steamrolled their way to their first Stanley Cup in the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals. The two teams faced each other again at the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Kings winning the series 4‚Äì3. The Kings and Sharks met again in the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs for the second year in a row, further adding fuel to the rivalry in a series that turned out to become a surprising 7-game series. San Jose took home ice and stormed to a 3‚Äì0 series lead, winning on home ice easily 6‚Äì3 and 7‚Äì2 before edging the Kings at Staples Center 4‚Äì3 in OT. The Kings then rebounded to send the series back to San Jose with a 6‚Äì3 victory in Game 4 before winning on the road 3‚Äì0 in Game 5 to head back to Los Angeles. A 4‚Äì1 win in Los Angeles for the Kings brought the series to seven games, becoming just the 9th team in history to force a Game 7 after being down 0‚Äì3. Given the chance to become just the 4th team in NHL history to complete the unlikeliest of comebacks, the Kings won 5‚Äì1 in San Jose to win the series. In doing so, Mike Richards and Jeff Carter became the first NHL players to complete the comeback twice, both being part of the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers team that came back from 0‚Äì3 down to the Boston Bruins, of which Richards was captain. In February 2015, the two teams faced off against each other in an outdoor game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. The Kings won the game 2‚Äì1. In 2016, following a season where the Kings and Sharks missed the playoffs, both teams met in the first round. San Jose won in 5 games. San Jose Sharks vs. Vegas Golden Knights The Golden Knights‚ÄìSharks rivalry started during the 2017‚Äì18 season in which Vegas began playing. Both teams met in the playoffs during the second round, which Vegas won in six games. During the 2018‚Äì19 NHL season, the rivalry became intense. With both teams set to play each other in the first round, the two teams met in a regular season game prior to the playoffs. The game decided home-ice advantage during that first round match up for which the Sharks won in overtime. In the 2019 playoffs, the Golden Knights took a 3‚Äì1 series lead. Game Three saw Golden Knights enforcer Ryan Reaves call out Sharks forward Evander Kane after the two fought each other. After a victorious Game Five at home, the Sharks forced a seventh game with Tomas Hertl's double overtime goal. Prior to Game Seven, both head coaches took shots at each other with Sharks coach Peter DeBoer calling out Gerard Gallant for chirping at players while Gallant responded by saying, \\"For that clown to say that in the paper yesterday is not right.\\" In Game Seven, the Knights took a 3‚Äì0 lead in the third period, however, Vegas forward Cody Eakin was given a questionable and controversial major penalty for cross-checking which injured Sharks captain Joe Pavelski, forcing the NHL to review all major penalties except for fighting from a monitor in a scorer's table; officials will reserve authority to reduce the penalty to a minor penalty depending on the result of the review.https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-announces-rule-changes- for-2019-20-season/c-307949196 San Jose scored 4 goals in 4:01 on the ensuing power play to take the lead late, but with 47.0 seconds left, the Golden Knights forward Jonathan Marchessault tied it up to send the game into overtime. In overtime, Sharks forward Barclay Goodrow completed the comeback, ending the Knights season and propelling the Sharks into a second round matchup with the Colorado Avalanche. In a pre-season game between the two teams on September 29, 2019, multiple fights broke out, including two line brawls. The teams accumulated a total of 106 penalty minutes between them, with Sharks forward Evander Kane alone accumulating 27. Multiple game misconducts were given out and Kane was ejected for abuse of officials, being later given a 3-game suspension. On January 15, 2020, Peter DeBoer was hired as the head coach of the Golden Knights after having been fired by the Sharks on December 11, 2019, replacing Gerard Gallant, who was fired the same day. As of the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Vegas leads the all-time series 12‚Äì7‚Äì0‚Äì2, including a 7‚Äì6 playoff record against San Jose. =Interdivisional= Chicago Blackhawks vs. Los Angeles Kings The rivalry started in the 1970‚Äì71 season, when the Chicago Blackhawks moved to the West Division. Although these two teams never shared the same success, they did meet in the 1974 playoffs where the more experienced Blackhawks won the series in five games. It cooled down after the Hawks and the Kings were in separate divisions. It got intense in the 2012‚Äì13 lockout-shortened season, when the Blackhawks spoiled the Kings' banner party on their way to one of the best starts in sports history. The rivalry caught fire when these two teams meet in the Western Conference Finals. The Kings were the defending champions, but their hopes of repeating were dashed as the Hawks downed the Kings in double overtime in game 5. In 2014, the reverse happened; the Blackhawks were defending champs, but the Kings crushed their dreams for a repeat in game 7, also in OT, after building a 3‚Äì1 series lead. With both teams struggling after their Stanley Cups, the rivalry has started to die down a little. At the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Chicago leads the all-time series (105‚Äì86‚Äì17‚Äì7), including an (11‚Äì6) playoff record against Los Angeles. Calgary Flames vs. Winnipeg Jets (original and modern) The Flames and Jets (the original incarnation and later the modern) rivalry is unique in the NHL. Both teams compete in the Western Conference, as they are both located in Western Canada. However, Calgary plays in the Pacific Division and Winnipeg plays in the Central Division. The Flames and both the original and modern Jets met in the playoffs four times (three straight years in the 1980s; the fourth in 2020), with each team winning two series. In 1985, the Jets defeated the Flames 3‚Äì1 for their first ever playoff series victory. The next season, the Flames got their revenge by sweeping the Jets in three straight games capped off by Lanny McDonald's overtime winner in the deciding game beginning Calgary's run to the Stanley Cup Final where they lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games. In 1987, the Jets upset the Flames in six games in the opening round in what would turn out to be their final playoff series victory for the franchise until 2012, when they were known as the Phoenix Coyotes. This was also the last time a Winnipeg-based NHL team won a playoff series until 2018 as (modern). The rivalry is based on the tradition used by their set of fans. Both the original and later the modern created the Winnipeg Whiteout by wearing white to home playoff games in Winnipeg, and the \\"C of Red\\" is used by Calgary Flames fans by wearing a red jersey with Calgary's flaming C on it. The rivalry was revived when the Flames and the the modern Jets met in the 2019 Heritage Classic. The Jets won the game, 2‚Äì1 after Bryan Little scored at 3:04 of overtime. Both teams later met in qualifying round of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, the first playoff series between these two teams and the fourth playoff meeting overall between the two cities. The Flames won the series 3‚Äì1. Since 2011 (when the Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg), Calgary lead the all-time series 15‚Äì9‚Äì2, including a (3‚Äì1) playoff record against the new Winnipeg Jets. Historical =Battle of California: Los Angeles Kings vs. Oakland/California Golden Seals (1967‚Äì1976)= The Los Angeles Kings and the California Golden Seals had a rivalry that existed between 1967 (when both teams joined the league) and 1976 (when the Seals moved to Cleveland and subsequently folded). The two teams were opposite ends of California. Located in Oakland, the Seals were known as the California Seals until December 1967, when they changed their name to the Oakland Seals. The two teams met in the 1969 playoffs, going to seven games. The Kings would be victorious in game seven, defeating the Seals 4‚Äì3. The early 1970s were a tough time for both teams as they both missed playoffs from 1971‚Äì1973. The Kings were in last place in 1970. The Seals made the 1970 playoffs, but lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Later that year the Seals were bought by Charlie Finley, the owner of the Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics, and changed their name to the California Golden Seals. The Golden Seals for struggled for the rest of their time in the league, finishing last place in 1970‚Äì71 and 1973‚Äì74. Bankruptcy issues came along as well. The Golden Seals last game was a 5‚Äì2 victory over Los Angeles in Oakland on April 4, 1976. That summer the Seals relocated and became the Cleveland Barons, and folded in 1978. Another Battle of California did not happen until the 1991‚Äì92 season, when the San Jose Sharks came into the league. The Kings won the all-time regular season series 38‚Äì20‚Äì11 including a 4‚Äì3 record in the playoffs for a total of 42‚Äì23‚Äì11. =Battle of New England: Boston Bruins vs. Hartford Whalers (1979‚Äì1997)= The rivalry was first started before the two teams ever met on the ice when the Bruins \\"blocked\\" the WHA merger in 1979 because \\"the Whalers were in their territory.\\" They first played against each other in the 1979‚Äì80 season with the Bruins flourishing during the season while the expansion Whalers played awfully that year. The Whalers have played the Bruins twice in the playoffs in 1990 and 1991, with the Bruins winning both times. The rivalry got to a heating point when the Bruins' Cam Neely and the Whalers' Ulf Samuelsson would fight on a regular occasion. It got to a point where Samuelsson hit Neely in the knees during the 1991 Stanley Cup playoffs, but Samuelsson was traded to the Penguins earlier that season. At the Hartford Civic Center, usually where the Bruins won, the Whalers fans would fight Bruins fans on Ann St. in Downtown Hartford. The rivalry ended in 1997 when the Whalers relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina. Before the Whalers moved to Raleigh, Boston won the all-time regular season series 68‚Äì42‚Äì14‚Äì0, and the all-time playoff series 8‚Äì5, for a total of 76‚Äì47‚Äì14‚Äì0 against Hartford. In 2018‚Äì19, the rivalry was sort of reignited, the Hurricanes wore the Whalers Late 80's jerseys in two games against the Bruins, one in Raleigh, proclaimed as ‚ÄúWhalers Night‚Äù and one in Boston. The series was split 1-1. The two team later matched up in the Eastern Conference Finals that year where Boston swept Carolina, 4-0 en route to the Stanley Cup Finals. =Battle of Quebec: Montreal Canadiens vs. Quebec Nordiques (1979‚Äì1995)= The Battle of Quebec is the nickname for a former NHL rivalry between the Montreal Canadiens and Quebec Nordiques. The rivalry lasted from to . The teams played against each other five times in the NHL playoffs, and the Canadiens won three of the series. One meeting, in 1984, resulted in the Good Friday Massacre, a game in which multiple brawls happened. The Battle of Quebec extended to politics, in which the Canadiens and Nordiques became symbols for rival parties, and beer distribution, as the teams were both owned by competing breweries. The Nordiques' departure from Quebec City to become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995 ended the rivalry. Before the Nordiques moved to Denver, Montreal won the all-time regular season series 79‚Äì57‚Äì12, and the all-time playoff series 17‚Äì14, for a total of 96‚Äì71‚Äì12 against Quebec. =Buffalo Sabres vs. Ottawa Senators (1992‚ÄìPresent)= The Sabres and Senators had a strong rivalry after the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, when both teams were vying for the Northeast Division title. Ottawa had the upper hand on Buffalo during regular season games, but Buffalo beat them in the playoffs. The best known game in this rivalry occurred on February 22, 2007, which included a large fight that included both goaltenders and verbal sparring between the two coaches (Buffalo won the game 6‚Äì5). The teams have met four times in the playoffs, with Buffalo winning three series and Ottawa winning one. Ottawa also beat Buffalo in the final game of the 1996‚Äì97 season to make the playoffs for the first time since entering the league. With both teams struggling at inconsistent times, the rivalry effectively ended; however, both teams remain in the same division, and the rivalry could be renewed if another incident were to occur. As of the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Buffalo leads the all-time series (80‚Äì58‚Äì10‚Äì10) including a (13‚Äì8) playoff record against Ottawa. =Calgary Flames vs. Winnipeg Jets (original) (1980‚Äì1996)= The Flames and Jets (the original incarnation) met in the playoffs three straight years in the 1980s, with Winnipeg winning two of the three matchups. In 1985, the Jets defeated the Flames three games to one for their first ever playoff series victory. The next season, the Flames got their revenge by sweeping the Jets in three straight games capped off by Lanny McDonald's overtime winner in the deciding game beginning Calgary's run to the Stanley Cup Final where they lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games. In 1987, the Jets upset the Flames in six games in the opening round in what would turn out to be their final playoff series victory for the franchise until 2012, when they were known as the Phoenix Coyotes. This was also the last time a Winnipeg-based NHL team won a playoff series until 2018 as (modern). From 1980 (when the Flames moved to Calgary) to 1996 (when the original Jets moved to Arizona), Calgary won the all-time series 57‚Äì45‚Äì16 (including a 6‚Äì7 playoff record) against Winnipeg. =Chicago Blackhawks vs. Detroit Red Wings (1926‚Äì2013)= The Blackhawks‚ÄìRed Wings rivalry was the most intense in the Central Division during the post lockout era. It existed between , went through the Original Six days (during which they were the league's only teams in the Midwest), to 2013. These two clubs have faced each other in more regular season games than any other two clubs in NHL history, except the Bruins‚ÄìCanadiens rivalry, which exceeds them in total games played when Stanley Cup playoff games are included. Before the 2013‚Äì14 season, the Detroit Red Wings moved from the Central Division of the Western Conference to the newly formed Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference, while Chicago stayed in the Central Division. This effectively caused the rivalry to cease (despite the two cities being relatively close to each other), as the Blackhawks and Red Wings now meet only twice a year. However, the rich history between the two teams remains very popular today; some even consider the rivalry to still be in existence deep down. =Chicago Blackhawks vs. Minnesota North Stars (1981‚Äì1993)= The North Stars and the Blackhawks played each other in the playoffs six times from 1982 through 1991. The rivalry was at its most fierce from the 1981‚Äì82 through 1984‚Äì85 seasons, when the teams played in four straight playoff series, with the Blackhawks winning three out of the four. In 1991, the Blackhawks had won the Presidents‚Äô Trophy with 106 points while the St. Louis Blues finished 2nd overall with 105 points, and both teams were among the favorites to win the Stanley Cup. Both Chicago and St. Louis were supposed to meet in the Norris Division Final. However, despite Minnesota finishing with 68 points (38 behind Chicago and 37 behind St. Louis) during the season, the North Stars upset the Presidents‚Äô Trophy winning Blackhawks in the Norris Division Semifinals and 2nd place overall Blues in the Norris Division Final, both in 6 games, beginning their Cinderella run to the Stanley Cup Final before losing to Pittsburgh Penguins, in 6 games. It was the 2nd and 3rd largest upset in NHL history in terms of points. The Blackhawks got a small measure of revenge the next year, when they dethroned the North Stars as Campbell Conference Champions. Just like the North Stars the year before, the Blackhawks lost to Pittsburgh Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final. The rivalry died in 1993, when the North Stars moved to Dallas. =Chicago Blackhawks vs. Vancouver Canucks (1970-present)= For a period of five seasons between 2008‚Äì09 and 2012‚Äì13, this rivalry was considered one of the best, if not the best rivalry in the NHL. This is mainly because there were three straight years of playoffs series between these teams in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The first seeds of the rivalry began with the realignment of the NHL in 1974, placing both teams in the newly formed Smythe Division. For two years, they battled each other for the top spot and in 1977, they went down to the wire for the last playoff spot, which Chicago won on a tiebreaker by virtue of having more wins at season's end. The two teams met in the playoffs for the first time in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals, which is best remembered for a mock surrender by then-Canucks coach Roger Neilson over what he deemed questionable officiating in Game 2, which began the Towel Power tradition in Vancouver and elsewhere in sports. Vancouver prevailed in the series four games to one, as part of their 1982 Cinderella Stanley Cup run. The Blackhawks swept the Canucks in the 1995 Western Conference Semifinals. They would not meet again until the season. The Blackhawks would eliminate the Canucks in the playoffs that season in the second round and would defeat them again the following season in the same round as part of their 2010 Stanley Cup run. The rivalry reached its peak in the 2011 playoffs, as they met for the third straight year in the first round of the playoffs that year, where the Canucks finally defeated Chicago 4‚Äì3. In this series, the Canucks took a 3‚Äì0 series only to drop the next three games. In Game 7, the Blackhawks tied it in the final minutes shorthanded, sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Canucks forward Alexandre Burrows scored on a slapshot to win the series for the Canucks, as part of their run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, in which they ultimately lost in seven games to the Boston Bruins. The rivalry has died down since then due to the Canucks' on-ice struggles since their appearance in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals as well as a lack of playoff matches between the two teams. =Colorado Avalanche vs. Detroit Red Wings (1995-2003)= The groundwork for the Avalanche‚ÄìRed Wings rivalry was laid well before Denver even had an NHL franchise, during games between Detroit and Quebec. Once the Nordiques moved to Denver, the small rivalry still existed. In a regular season game between Detroit and Montreal, the Wings scored on Patrick Roy nine times, leading to Roy demanding a trade. Roy was eventually traded to Colorado and became a huge factor in the rivalry. During the 1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Red Wings player Kris Draper was checked into the boards and severely injured by Avalanche player Claude Lemieux. Draper went to the hospital with a concussion and multiple broken bones in his face as a result, and he required surgery and stitches; he did not return to play until the following season. This event led to a massive on-ice confrontation during an Avalanche-Red Wings game on March 26, 1997, which involved Red Wings player Darren McCarty, another member of the \\"Grind Line\\" and Draper's best friend, beating up Lemieux as revenge for the incident with Draper. Both of these days were major reasons why the Detroit-Colorado rivalry became so heated so quickly. The rivalry was largely predicated on the competitiveness of both teams in the late '90s and early 2000s. From ‚Äì, the teams met in five playoff series, three times in the Western Conference Finals. Out of those seven seasons, the teams combined to win five Stanley Cups and four Presidents' Trophies. From ‚Äì, both teams, along with the New Jersey Devils, reigned exclusively as Stanley Cup champions, except in , which was won by the Dallas Stars (the Devils beat the Red Wings in 1995, while the Avalanche beat the Devils in ). The rivalry died down after the 2001‚Äì02 season, with the following season having both teams falling in round one and Roy's eventual retirement. The last playoff meeting between the two teams was in 2008, with the Red Wings sweeping the Avalanche 4‚Äì0 on the way to the Stanley Cup. With conference realignment in 2013, the only playoff matchup between the two teams that is possible now is in the Stanley Cup Finals; this put an end to the rivalry for good. However, a stadium series game took place on February 27, 2016 between the two teams at Coors Field, which the Red Wings won 5‚Äì3. However, the Avalanche came back in the alumni game, winning the meaningless exhibition contest 5-3. =Detroit Red Wings vs. St. Louis Blues (1981‚Äì2013)= The rivalry began when the Red Wings switched divisions for the 1981‚Äì82 season. The rivalry would develop in the late 1980s when they had intense division battles. In 1988, the Red Wings defeated the Blues in five games in the Norris division final. The rivalry really heated up in the 1990s. In 1991, the Blues defeated the Red Wings in seven games in the Norris division semi-finals after overcoming a 3‚Äì1 series deficit. They would meet up in the playoffs three straight times between 1996‚Äì98; the Red Wings won all three series. However, the Blues almost defeated the Red Wings in 1996. They held a 3‚Äì2 advantage and it looked like the Blues would upset the Wings in Game Six, but the Wings won the last two games including a double overtime victory in Game Seven. This was also be part of the 1997 and 1998 Stanley Cup runs. When the Divisions realigned in 1998, this was the most intense rivalry in the Central division as they had many division battles until the 2004 season. They met during the playoffs in 2002 in the conference semifinals. The Red Wings defeated the Blues in five games as part of their 2002 Stanley Cup run. The rivalry instantly died in the post lockout as the Blues entered a slump, only reviving as the teams fought for the Central Division title in the 2011‚Äì12 season. The Red Wings joined the Eastern Conference in 2013 and now only play the Blues twice a year. =Edmonton Oilers vs. Los Angeles Kings (1981‚Äì1993)= The rivalry between the Edmonton Oilers and the Los Angeles Kings began more or less the instant the Oilers began playing in the NHL in the 1979‚Äì80 season. Among the first- year Oilers' players included a young Wayne Gretzky, who instantly challenged for the Art Ross Trophy against the Kings' Marcel Dionne. In the end, Gretzky and Dionne were both tied with 137 points, but the award was given to Dionne, who had two more goals (53 vs. Gretzky's 51). It should also be noted that Gretzky played 79 games to Dionne's full 80. Gretzky remarked during a press conference at which the scoring title was awarded to Dionne that he had been taught \\"that an assist was as good as a goal.\\" The two teams would not meet in the playoffs until the 1981‚Äì82 season. That season, Gretzky shattered the NHL record books with the most points in a season with 212 (92 goals and 120 assists). The Oilers also jumped to the top of their division despite playing in their third NHL season and had the second best record in the league. The Kings, after an impressive 1980‚Äì81 season, slumped to having the fifth worst record in the 21-team-NHL. They only made the playoffs, being fourth in the same division as the Oilers, because the Colorado Rockies had an even worse record in their last season. This set the stage for the top-seeded, heavily favored Oilers to meet in the first round against the Kings. After a two-game split in Edmonton, Game 3 in Los Angeles began with a commanding Oilers 5‚Äì0 lead after two periods. However, in a miraculous comeback, the Kings managed to tie the game 5‚Äì5 in the third period, scoring the tying goal with five seconds left on a two-man advantage. The Kings won the game 6‚Äì5 in overtime. This game is often referred to as the Miracle on Manchester. The Oilers won Game 4 to send the series back to Edmonton for the deciding game in a best-of- five series. However, it was the Kings who upset the Oilers and advanced to the next round. For the next two seasons, the Kings missed the playoffs completely while the Oilers competed in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983 and won their first Stanley Cup in 1984. Both finals were played against the dynasty New York Islanders. The two teams finally met again in 1985, but this time the Oilers defeated the Kings in three straight games. The Oilers won their second straight Stanley Cup. They met again in 1987 under a new best-of-seven playoff format for the first round, and again the Oilers won, this time in five games, and again the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup. The entire world of sports was shocked on August 9, 1988 upon the announcement of the Oilers trading Wayne Gretzky along with Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley, to the Kings for two rising young players (Jimmy Carson and Martin G√©linas), three first-round draft picks, and US$15,000,000. Gretzky led the Kings in the 1988‚Äì89 season to vast improvements. For the first time, the Kings had a better season record than Edmonton, finishing second in the Smythe Division over the third place Oilers. This also led to another first round match up between the Kings and Oilers. This time, it was the Kings, with Gretzky, against the Oilers, and the Kings also had home-ice advantage. The Oilers lead the series against the Kings 3‚Äì1, but Los Angeles won three straight wins to win the series and upset Edmonton. In the next three playoff meetings between the two teams, the Gretzky-led Kings were eliminated by his former teammates in four, six, and six games respectively. Edmonton also won another Stanley Cup in 1990 after sweeping the Kings in the second round. After the 1990‚Äì91 season, the rivalry died down as players from the Oilers moved to other teams. Jari Kurri and Charlie Huddy rejoined Gretzky on the Kings and go on a playoff run to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, losing to Montreal in five games. Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Adam Graves, Craig MacTavish, Jeff Beukeboom, Kevin Lowe, and Esa Tikkanen moved to the New York Rangers and won the Stanley Cup in 1994. Furthermore, despite being reunited in the Pacific Division prior to the 2013‚Äì14 season, the Oilers and Kings have not met in the playoffs since 1992, nor have been regularly competitive at the same time, thus keeping what once was an intense divisional rivalry dormant. When the Oilers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2006 (lost to the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games), the Kings failed to make the playoffs. For the next 10 years after their playoff run, Edmonton did not make a postseason appearance, while Los Angeles won the Cup in 2012 and 2014. =Edmonton Oilers vs. Winnipeg Jets (original) (1972‚Äì1979 in WHA, 1979‚Äì1996)= The Oilers and Jets both started their existence in the World Hockey Association in 1972. There, the Jets dominated the Oilers winning the Avco Cup three times, while the Oilers were not playoff contenders. But, when they joined the NHL in 1979 (along with the Quebec Nordiques and Hartford Whalers), the tables were turned, thanks to an 18-year- old from Brantford, Ontario named Wayne Gretzky. From 1983 to 1989, the Oilers and Jets met in the playoffs five times, the Oilers won every one of them, losing only one game out of the 19 games played between the two on their way to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1988; with the Oilers winning the Stanley Cup in the latter four years. Gretzky had been traded to the Los Angeles Kings by the time the two teams met in the first round of the 1990 playoffs. The Jets took a commanding 3‚Äì1 series lead and led Game 5 by that same margin. Eventually, the Oilers fought back to win the next three games and the series in seven. The Oilers would lose just three more games the remainder of the playoffs, en route to their fifth Stanley Cup championship in seven years. The rivalry ended in 1996 when the original Jets left Winnipeg to become the Phoenix Coyotes. Before the Jets moved to Arizona, Edmonton won the all-time regular season series 63‚Äì41‚Äì8, and the all-time playoff series 22‚Äì4, for a total of 85‚Äì45‚Äì8. =Montreal Canadiens vs. Montreal Maroons (1924‚Äì1938)= The Montreal Canadiens and Montreal Maroons had a rivalry that existed between 1924 and 1938. Since 1918 no other team had been occupied in Montreal. The Montreal Wanderers had played for only six games before the arena they played in, the Montreal Arena, burnt down. The Montreal Maroons were meant to appeal to the English-speaking people of Quebec while the Canadiens were meant to appeal to French-Canadians. The two teams met in the playoffs for the first time in 1926 for a 2-game total-goals series. The final game had 11,000 fans packed in an arena meant for 10,000 as the Canadiens defeated the Maroons. The next year the Maroons would have their revenge as they defeated the Canadiens 3‚Äì2 in total goals. This would be their last playoff meeting before the Maroons eventually folded in 1938. =New York Americans vs. New York Rangers (1926‚Äì1942)= The New York Americans and New York Rangers had a rivalry that existed between 1926 (When the Rangers became an NHL team) and 1942 (When the Americans folded). The two teams played in Madison Square Garden; however the Americans were the first NHL team to occupy the stadium. Even though the Garden had promised team owner and bootlegger Bill Dwyer the Americans would be the sole hockey team in New York, fan popularity and ticket sales allowed the Rangers to come into existence, thus the rivalry was born. The two teams first met in the playoffs via two-game total goals series in 1929. Both teams struggled to score in both games as goaltender Roy Worters of the Americans shut down the Rangers for the most part, and the Americans struggled to find offense during the games. The Rangers would win the series 1‚Äì0 in overtime. The Americans then struggled to make the playoffs only making it in 1936. Under the ownership of Red Dutton, the Americans made the playoffs in 1938 with a 19‚Äì18‚Äì11 record. Facing the Rangers for the second and final time, the Americans defeated the Rangers in three games with the help of veterans Ching Johnson and Hap Day. Once the United States joined World War II, both teams started to fade in terms of players; most American-born players went to fight in the war. The Americans folded in 1942 with the hope of coming back in 1946 after the war ended. However, the League reneged the promises made to the Amerks and cancelled the franchise. Owner Red Dutton was so furious at Madison Square Garden for not reinstating his team that he swore the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup during his lifetime. This became true as the Rangers did not win the Stanley Cup again until 1994; Dutton died in 1987.

The route was designated on August 27, 1959 as a renumbering of SH 235 to smooth the travel transition with Louisiana Highway 12, with which it connects. Route description SH 12 begins at an intersection with I-10 and US 90 on the north side of Vidor, and travels to the northeast. It travels through lightly populated country before reaching the Sabine River at Deweyville. The route continues into Louisiana as Louisiana Highway 12. History left SH 12 was one of the original twenty five state highways proposed on June 21, 1917. It was an ambitious undertaking to construct a border-to-border highway hugging the southern Texas coast and border with Mexico, and was to be named the 'Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway.' In 1917 the route followed present day Interstate 10 eastward from El Paso to roughly Esperanza. From there the road was proposed to go to Presidio (not built) and followed FM 170 from there to near Lajitas. It was proposed from there to hug the Rio Grande through Big Bend and towards Langtry (again, never built) where it would have met up with present day U.S. Highway 90. On US 90, the road would have gone into Del Rio and, via present day US 277, into Eagle Pass and though to Paso de Francia via present day FM 1021 and FM 1472 to Laredo. The Paso de Francia to Laredo segment was again, at the time never built. From Laredo to Pharr the road would have followed present day U.S. Highway 83. At Pharr, a spur of SH 12 would have continued east on US 83 to Brownsville. The main road went north on from Pharr on U.S. Highway 281 to Falfurrias then East on SH 285 into Riviera and north on U.S. Highway 77 towards Victoria, through to Houston on U.S. Highway 59 and finally US 90 to Orange. The route from Kingsville to Brownsville was determined on July 3, 1917. Unfortunately many of the roads in West and South Texas did not exist as planned (and still don't), and the technology available in 1919 wasn't up to the task of building so many miles of non-existent roadway quickly and efficiently. This led to SH 12 being rerouted many times, each time trying to keep it as a border-to-border highway, hugging the southern borderline. On November 20, 1917, SH 12 was rerouted into Corpus Christi via present day Interstate 37, U.S. Highway 181 and SH 35 into Rockport, Texas. The road then doublebacked, via SH 188 and FM 136 to Bayside. From here, another proposed road would have met back with US 77 into Victoria. In late July 1917, the segment from El Paso, to near Lobo was rerouted to instead go to a proposed New Mexico crossing, due south into Van Horn, via SH 54 and continued to near Valentine, Texas over US 90. By 1919, the road again was proposed to bypass Big Bend, meeting up again with current US 90 in Sanderson, meeting up with its old alignment in Langtry. By 1919, SH 12 then terminated far short of Orange in Rosenberg. Much like other highways at the time, multiple alternate routings have been created using the same number, and SH 12 was no exception. SH 12A was designated on December 17, 1918 via present day SH 60 from Wharton to Matagorda.SH 12B was designated on March 18, 1919, from Beeville through Oakville, Tilden, and Gardendale, to Eagle Pass as a bypass if SH 12 between these places could not be built. The New Mexico border crossing was rerouted to the current U.S. Highway 180 crossing. On March 15, 1920, The Rio Grande hugging Big Bend segment was completely abandoned, with SH 12 now using the current US 90 highway from Valentine to Alpine to Sanderson. The road from Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Laredo to Pharr was still proposed, and sections had been built west of Pharr. However, not sure if that road would be built either, a cut-off SH 12A was designated on February 22, 1921 from Laredo to Hebbronville which would eventually become SH 359 and SH 44 into Robstown where it met up with the original SH 12. The Matagorda-Wharton segment was renamed SH 12C. On August 21, 1923, SH 12 had lost much of its assignment, being mostly confined to south and southeast Texas. The Eagle Pass-Laredo and Refugio-Rockport segments had never been built. The section of SH 12 from Corpus Christi to Gregory was transferred to the new SH 16, and the section of SH 12 from Gregory to Rockport was handed over to the new SH 57. SH 12C was handed over to the new SH 60. SH 12 at this time followed the routing from Brownsville via Pharr to Alice. From Alice, SH 12 followed SH 359 to Skidmore, US 181 to Beeville, and US 59 to Rosenberg. SH 12B was cancelled and reassigned to the old route of SH 12 from Pharr to Laredo. In 1926, US 83, US 96 and US 77 were overlaid on most of SH 12. On March 19, 1928, SH 12B became part of an extension of SH 2. On March 18, 1929, the section of SH 2 from Laredo to Pharr was changed back to SH 12B. On August 6, 1929, SH 12B became part of an extension of SH 4. On that same day, SH 12 was truncated to Pharr, with the portion south of there being transferred to SH 4. On November 16, 1929, SH 12 was to be built through Fannin Park. On March 19, 1930 SH 12 was rerouted to bypass the park, and the section from Fannin to Fannin Park was renumbered SH 162. On June 24, 1931, SH 12 was rerouted over SH 12A from Laredo to Alice, with the old route to Pharr being transferred to SH 66. The portion of SH 12A from Alice to Robstown became an extension of SH 128. On December 21, 1938, SH 12 Loop was designated in Laredo. On September 26, 1939, the original route was cancelled completely, its mileage taken over by US 59. SH 12 Loop was renumbered as Loop 20 (Laredo).

Directing career In 1976 Woodruff established the Bay Area Playwrights Festival, a summer forum for the development of new plays that is still flourishing.Playwrights Festival web page It was here that Woodruff first worked with the writer Sam Shepard, on a libretto that Shepard had developed for the national bicentennial celebrations, The Sad Lament of Pecos Bill on the Eve of Killing His Wife. The thirty-three-year-old playwright was still better known in London than the States, and his collaborations with Woodruff marked a turning point in both men's careers. For the next five years Woodruff was virtually the sole director of Shepard's work, staging the American premiere of Curse of the Starving Class at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1978, the world premieres of Buried Child (1978) and True West (1980) at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco and then in New York, and the touring productions of Tongues and Savage/Love, which Shepard co-authored with the performer Joseph Chaikin. Woodruff has directed plays performed at Lincoln Center Theater, the New York Shakespeare Festival, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, and The Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.

Owned by Entercom, the station airs a classic hits radio format. The studios and offices are located in San Diego's Stonecrest area, off Granite Ridge Drive, across the street from rival station KMYI. The transmitter is off La Jolla Scenic Drive South in La Jolla, amid towers for several other San Diego FM and TV stations.Radio-Locator.com/KXSN KXSN broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD2 subchannel carries Smooth Jazz, using the call sign of former San Diego jazz outlet KIFM, which once was heard on 98.1. The HD3 subchannel carries \\"Channel Q,\\" a Radio.com format of LGBTQ- oriented talk and EDM dance music. History =KJLM and KDIG= The station first signed on the air on February 4, 1960, as KJLM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1961-1962 page B-23 It was owned by E. Edward Jacobson and it operated at only 4,500 watts, a fraction of its current power. The station aired what it described as a \\"good music\\" format, a mix of middle of the road (MOR) and easy listening music. In 1968, Jacobson changed the station's call sign to KDIG but remained as owner and president, and continued the MOR format. =KIFM= The station changed hands in 1971, getting sold to West Coast Media.Broadcasting Yearbook 1979 page C-27 In 1974, the call letters were switched to KIFM and the format moved to what West Coast described as \\"mellow music,\\" a mix of soft rock and soft adult contemporary. In the 1980s, KIFM experimented with a contemporary jazz program at night, called \\"Lights Out San Diego.\\" In September 1987, as Lights Out San Diego gained in popularity, KIFM went with smooth jazz around the clock as \\"Smooth Jazz 98.1\\". In 1996, KIFM was bought by Jefferson-Pilot Broadcasting for $28.75 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-103 Jefferson-Pilot would be acquired by Lincoln Financial Group. The media division became Lincoln Financial Media. During smooth jazz's popularity, KIFM was one of the top rated stations in San Diego and was the 2005 winner of the Marconi Award. =Smooth AC= In the Summer of 2011, as the smooth jazz format began to age, KIFM shifted its format to smooth adult contemporary, airing mostly pop artists with R&B; roots, such as Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Madonna and Anita Baker, with only an occasional Smooth Jazz instrumental, and rebranded as \\"98.1 Smooth FM\\". By the fall of that year, the station shifted to Rhythmic AC, by playing recent and older R&B; hits and classic soul tracks. When the HD Radio transmitter went on air, the original smooth jazz format moved to KIFM's HD2 subchannel. =Easy 98.1= Without warning on August 19, 2013, at 10 a.m., KIFM flipped to Soft AC as \\"Easy 98.1\\". The rebranding came after KIFM trailed San Diego's longtime AC leader KYXY in the Arbitron ratings reports. The final song on \\"Smooth\\" was \\"I Love You Always Forever\\" by Donna Lewis, while the first song on \\"Easy\\" was \\"Easy\\" by The Commodores. After the flip, the station's ratings improved dramatically, reaching #1 in several Arbitron ratings periods. At the same time, KYXY, like many stations that were originally Soft AC, has moved closer to a more Hot AC format to attract younger listeners. =Entercom purchase= On December 8, 2014, Entercom announced that it was purchasing Lincoln Financial Group's entire 15-station lineup (including KIFM) in a $106.5 million deal, and would operate the outlets under a LMA deal until the sale is approved by the FCC. The merger was approved by the FCC on July 14, 2015, and the sale was completed on July 17. On April 21, 2016, at 5 p.m., after playing \\"Sundown\\" by Gordon Lightfoot, KIFM rebranded as \\"Sunny 98.1,\\" and relaunched its adult contemporary format, this time moving in a more contemporary direction. The first song on \\"Sunny\\" was \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" by Katrina & the Waves. Prior to the change, the station had led the San Diego market with a 6.2 share in the March 2016 Nielsen Audio PPM ratings, making for a rare situation where a radio station at the top of the market ratings changed formats (though it was speculated the station made the change due to low advertising revenues with the previous format). On April 28, 2016, KIFM changed callsigns to KXSN to match the \\"Sunny\\" moniker. Concurrently, the KIFM callsign was moved to a co-owned sports radio station in Sacramento, AM 1320 KCTC. Despite the call letter switch, the KXSN HD2 subchannel is referred to as \\"Smooth Jazz KIFM\\" as a tribute to the classic Smooth Jazz station. =Classic Hits= Channel Q as shown on an automotive entertainment system. On July 24, 2017, KXSN switched to classic hits, and retained the \\"Sunny 98.1\\" branding. This returned the Classic Hits format to the market for the first time since 2000, when KJQY became a Hot AC station. It was a second time that the 98.1 frequency changed formats despite leading the market, this time with a 6.2 share in the June 2017 Nielsen ratings. The change came because of the merger between station owner Entercom and CBS Radio, then-owner of soon-to-be sister station KYXY, as it would eliminate playlist overlap between the 2 stations.Sunny 98.1 San Diego Shifs to Classic Hits Radioinsight - July 31, 2017 Entercom completed the acquisition of KYXY on November 17.

Gameplay The player controls a spacecraft with the mouse. A series of enemies appear and attack the craft; the player must destroy all enemies on the stage to complete it. Enemies that are part of the current stage but have not yet begun to attack can be seen as glowing lines in the background. The player's ship fires bullets upwards continuously, which are used to attack the enemies. If the player's ship contacts an enemy, it is immediately destroyed. Small circular \\"pods\\" may be left on the stage in the locations where enemies are killed; some stages include special enemies which drop pods directly onto the stage in lines. Pods can be destroyed by shooting them. They destroy the player's ship if the player collides with them, and if left unattended eventually explode sending out lines in the four cardinal directions. These lines are also fatal to the player's ship. Finally, at intermittent moments the \\"XY zapper\\" is activated: four sets of lines begin to converge on a particular location on the screen. When they do, the player's ship is destroyed if it is aligned with that location either horizontally or vertically. As the player scores points, sheep (referred to as \\"sheepies\\") begin to drop from the top of the screen. These sheepies have several different effects: * Collecting sheepies increases the firepower of the player's ship, and enables it to fire backwards. * Collecting a tenth sheepie activates \\"the pill\\" - a smaller sheep which moves around the screen destroying enemies on the player's behalf. * Normally, all sheepies are lost when a new stage begins, but collecting a sheepie in the short hang-time between the end of the stage and the start of the next will cause the first sheepie on the new stage to flash, indicating that collecting it will restore the sheepie count from the previous stage. This is referred to as a \\"Continuity Sheepie\\". * When the player's ship is destroyed, the falling wreckage can be steered, and if the centre point of the wreckage lands on an uncollected sheepie then the player's ship is resurrected and no life loss occurs (although no other benefit arises from collecting the sheepie). This is referred to as a \\"Sheepie Save\\". =Ending= The registered version of the game has 50 levels, ending with \\"Love Sheepie Plushophilia\\", a level where the enemies are copies of Jeff's own avatar from the message board. When this stage is completed, a photograph of one of Jeff's real pet sheep appears over the game field accompanied by a congratulations message and the enigmatic note: \\"Shysheep salutes you with stars in her nose!\\". The game then restarts from the first level, with score and lives retained. Special edition The \\"Special Edition\\" of Gridrunner++ was originally created for a gathering of members of the Llamasoft message board taking place in London. It was originally only available at that gathering or via word of mouth from those who had attended. It was later released by Jeff for download but has been removed from the Llamasoft Archive site, due to it being played without buying the standard (registered) version first. The Special Edition is based on the registered version of Gridrunner++; no trial version of it exists. The Special Edition features the following changes: * The main title reads \\"Gridrunner++ London Jolly 2 Special Edition\\". * The sheep picture on the opening title page is replaced by a picture of a plate of Vindaloo. * The displayed play area is much larger and has a larger horizontal dimension than vertical. * Enemies move much faster, making the game much harder than the standard version. * The player's ship can fire horizontally by holding down the left mouse button. * The \\"secret\\" ships from the original version are the defaults in the Special Edition. * Whenever the player's ship is destroyed, one of several samples of a group of people swearing is played. This group is actually composed of all the people who attended the board gathering who met up in Jeff's hotel room in London and were sampled on his laptop. * Numerous other samples are added or altered. * An extra \\"endurance mode\\" option is added, in which the player aims to score the highest amount possible on one life. Ports The Mac version has several additions to the PC version including live online scoreboards and \\"Turbo Nutter Mode\\" which allows the player to enjoy the game at double speed. It was converted to the Mac by Gary Liddon.

Playing career Born in Madrid, Rem√≥n finished his football development with country giants Real Madrid, but served two loans in the third and second divisions before returning in 1971. He then began an interesting battle for first-choice status with Miguel √Ångel Gonz√°lez which would last for the vast majority of his stay: Rem√≥n would start from 1971 to 1973 and 1979 to 1981, and the pair split appearances in two other seasons. In the 1972‚Äì73 European Cup quarter-finals against FC Dynamo Kyiv, in the 0‚Äì0 first leg draw in Odessa, Rem√≥n's heroic efforts earned him the nickname El gato de Odesa (\\"the cat of Odessa\\"). After only eight La Liga appearances in his final five seasons combined, being third-choice for the side that won back-to-back UEFA Cups, he retired at almost 36 with 231 overall appearances for the club to his credit. Rem√≥n earned two caps for Spain during five months in 1973, both in friendlies. His debut came on 2 May, playing the second half of a 2‚Äì3 loss in the Netherlands.

Subsequently, Rem√≥n managed Sporting de Gij√≥n (top division), Albacete Balompi√©, UD Las Palmas, UD Salamanca, CD Numancia (top flight) and C√≥rdoba CF. Both of his appointments in that competition ended prematurely, when the teams were in a relegation position.

Internal conversion is a transition from a higher to a lower electronic state in a molecule or atom.A general and quantitative discussion of intramolecular radiationless transitions is the subject of an article by M. Bixon and J. Jortner (J. Chem. Phys., 48 (2) 715-726 (1968)). It is sometimes called \\"radiationless de-excitation\\", because no photons are emitted. It differs from intersystem crossing in that, while both are radiationless methods of de-excitation, the molecular spin state for internal conversion remains the same, whereas it changes for intersystem crossing. The energy of the electronically excited state is given off to vibrational modes of the molecule. The excitation energy is transformed into heat. Examples A classic example of this process is the quinine sulfate fluorescence, which can be quenched by the use of various halide salts. The excited molecule can de-excite by increasing the thermal energy of the surrounding solvated ions. Several natural molecules perform a fast internal conversion. This ability to transform the excitation energy of photon into heat can be a crucial property for photoprotection by molecules such as melanin. Fast internal conversion reduces the excited state lifetime, and thereby prevents bimolecular reactions. Bimolecular electron transfer always produces a reactive chemical species, free radicals. Nucleic acids (precisely the single, free nucleotides, not those bound in a DNA/RNA strand) have an extremely short lifetime due to a fast internal conversion.

Biography Paul Ross Jacobs was born in New York City. He attended the Juilliard School and as a child, played at Carnegie Hall, on television and for Radio Free Europe. After watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, he started playing guitar. He worked as a session musician during his high school years and later on with Meat Loaf, Roy Buchanan, and Edgar Winter. =Early career= Jacobs' association with the National Lampoon came through Christopher Guest, who had written a large chunk of the first National Lampoon album, Radio Dinner. Guest was working as a session musician and met Jacobs when they were both performing at the same session. Guest was developing his own songs at the time and asked Jacobs to contribute, and a musical association was born. When Guest was tapped for National Lampoon's Lemmings in 1973, he brought Jacobs on board. Jacobs was musical director of the show and album Lemmings. As well as being musical director for the production, he played guitar and piano, and sang lead vocals on several songs. He also appeared on the Lampoon album Goodbye Pop 1952-1976.https://medialoper.com/certain-songs-1255-national- lampoon-a-history-of-neil-young-southern-california-brings-me-down/ =From comedy to rock= After serving as musical director and cast member of \\"The National Lampoon Show\\" Jacobs moved on from Lampoon-related activities and did a stint in the often-intertwined worlds of musical theater and rock and roll. In 1977, when Steinman staged a workshop production of his life-work \\"Neverland\\", Jacobs served as musical director and co-arranged the show's score. A year later, Jacobs joined Meat Loaf as a pianist and background vocalist. =Children's TV= In 1988, following his departure from active live touring with Meat Loaf, Jacobs and his wife began the task of writing songs for Sesame Street. As of 2008, they have written over 100. As of the early 2000s, Jacobs has served as musical director for the PBS show \\"Between the Lions\\" alongside his wife, Sarah Durkee, and they have won several Emmys for their work on that show, most recently the 2007 Emmy for \\"Best Original Song in an Animated Children's Series.\\" Jacobs was nominated again for a Daytime Emmy Award for Best Music Direction and Composition in 2011. =Later work= In 2000, Jacobs won the Van Cliburn Institute Amateur Piano Concerto Competition.

The highway runs from SH 6 south of Bremond to Interstate 45 in Richland.  Route description  State Highway 14 begins at an intersection with SH 6 about 3 miles southwest of Bremond. The route travels northeastward through Bremond, mainly through farmland in central Texas, passing through the western edge of Kosse and through Groesbeck. It then passes through Mexia, intersecting SH 171 and US 84. It reaches its northern terminus at Interstate 45 on the north side of Richland. The entire route closely parallels the original Southern Pacific (now Union Pacific) railway lines.  History  left SH 14 was one of the original twenty six state highways proposed on June 21, 1917, known as the Dallas-Houston Highway. From 1917 the routing mostly followed present day I-45 from Dallas to Corsicana, but going through an unbuilt route through Teague to Houston. On July 17, 1917, SH 14 was rerouted south of Corsicana. From there, the highway turned southwest to Bremond, then following SH 2 to Houston. On November 21, 1917, an intercounty highway was designated from Bremond via Franklin to Bryan. The section of SH 14 south of Bremond was cancelled that day. On March 19, 1918, SH 14 was extended southeast over this intercounty highway. The section from Bremond to Bryan was cancelled on August 21, 1923 (but would be restored as SH 255 on October 26, 1937, which would have its south end in Wheelock). In 1926, U.S. Highway 75 was overlaid on the northern half of SH 14. On April 10, 1934, SH 14 was extended north to west of Sherman, replacing SH 116. On April 9, 1935, SH 14 Spur was created to Thornton. On September 26, 1939, the portion from Dallas to Gunter was renumbered as SH 289 and the section that US 75 overlaid was cancelled. On September 26, 1967, SH 14 was extended south from FM 46 (and SH 6 before this day), to SH 6. The highway has had the same routing since.

History  The San Diego Public Library was established on May 19, 1882, by an elected board of library trustees, one of whom was civic leader and philanthropist George Marston. The first location was rented space in the Commercial Bank building at Fifth and G streets, and the new library opened its doors to the public for the first time on July 15, 1882. San Diego was the first city west of the Mississippi River to receive a Carnegie Library grant. The grant was received in 1899 and the library built in 1902. The library moved to Eighth and E streets where the new Carnegie Library was constructed. A notable librarian during this period was Clara Estelle Breed (1906‚Äì1994), who served as children's librarian at the downtown branch and was appointed City Librarian in 1945, a post she held for 25 years. She founded numerous branch libraries and established the Serra Cooperative Library System, which allows users to borrow books from other libraries in San Diego and Imperial counties. She maintained contact with many Japanese American children when they were interned with their families during World War II; her correspondence with those children is now on display at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. Over the years, many branch libraries have also been opened throughout the City. =Central Library= In 1952, the Carnegie Library was demolished and a new Central Library was opened at the same location on June 27, 1954. That library closed permanently on June 9, 2013, to begin the 10-week process of transferring its 2.6-million-item collection to the new library. In 2010, construction began on a new $184.9 million Central Library at 330 Park Boulevard in downtown San Diego. This 9-story structure was designed by San Diego architect Rob Quigley. It opened on September 30, 2013. The library displays numerous books and collections, including the second largest collection of baseball memorabilia in the U.S. The Central Library also houses a new charter high school, e3 Civic High School, which is billed as the only school in the United States to be housed within a library. The school serves grades 9 through 12. It opened on September 3, 2013 with an initial student body of 260 ninth and tenth graders. Additional grades were added in 2014 and 2015 resulting in a student body of approximately 500.  Services  The San Diego Public Library system currently consists of the Central Library, 35 branch libraries, and an adult literacy program office (READ/San Diego). Library cards are free to applicants who reside within the state of California or own property in the city of San Diego, and to men and women serving in the armed forces who are stationed within San Diego County. Library cards are permanent and must be renewed every two years. There is a $30 annual fee for a non-resident library card. On the third floor of the Central Library is the new Innovation Lab that was originally funded by a state Library Services and Technology Act grant in 2013, when the Central Library opened. Since then, thanks to donations from the community, the lab has expanded and added additional machines. The new space was funded in part by the California State Library. Available equipment and resources from the Innovation Lab include: * 3D Printing & Scanning * Silhouette Cameos/Vinyl Cutter * Sewing & Embroidery Machines * Milling Machine * Laser Cutter * Computers * Maker Classes & Workshop In fiscal year 2006, the Library system had a circulation of more than 7 million and more than 6 million visits by patrons. The San Diego Public Library was one of the first major library systems in the United States to offer free wireless Internet access at all of its locations, including the Central Library and branch libraries. While testing the Spirit of St. Louis airplane in San Diego, Charles Lindbergh used the resources at the San Diego Public Library to plot the course for his historic solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean. Renowned American sculptor Donal Hord bequeathed to the San Diego Public Library his lifelong collection of books and several sculptures in appreciation for the assistance he had received from library's staff over the years.  Branches  Aside from the Central Library, the system includes the following 35 branches:San Diego Public Library: Locations * Allied Gardens/Benjamin * Balboa * Carmel Mountain * Carmel Valley * City Heights/Weingart Branch Library & Performance Annex * Clairemont * College-Rolando * Kensington-Normal Heights * La Jolla/Riford * Linda Vista * Logan Heights * Mira Mesa * Mission Hills-Hillcrest/Harley & Bessie Knox * Mission Valley * Mountain View/Beckwourth * North Clairemont * North Park * North University Community * Oak Park * Ocean Beach * Otay Mesa-Nestor * Pacific Beach/Taylor * Paradise Hills * Point Loma/Hervey * Rancho Bernardo * Rancho Pe√±asquitos * San Carlos * San Ysidro * Scripps Miramar Ranch * Serra Mesa-Kearny Mesa * Skyline Hills * Tierrasanta * University Community * University Heights * Valencia Park/Malcolm X Branch Library & Performing Arts Center  See also  * Althea Warren, head librarian, 1916‚Äì26  References   External links  * * Carnegie Libraries in California Category:Carnegie libraries in California Category:Libraries in San Diego Category:Library buildings completed in 1902 Category:Public libraries in California Category:1882 establishments in California ","title":"San Diego Public Library"},{"id":"2362831","text":"Birtley is a hamlet in Shropshire, England.Ordnance Survey It is situated a short distance to the west of the village of Ticklerton, in countryside to the south-east of the market town of Church Stretton.

Plot summary Hugh Norreys, crippled in a road accident, watches from his couch as John Gabriel runs for parliament in the small Cornish town of St. Loo. Hugh's invalid status seems to encourage his visitors to reveal their secrets and emotions. Hugh is mystified by Gabriel, an ugly little man who, nevertheless, is attractive to women. He is also intrigued by Isabella, a beautiful young woman from the castle down the road. So, Hugh and most of St. Loo are shocked when, shortly after Gabriel wins the election, he and Isabella run away together and Gabriel resigns as a member of parliament.

Mutation testing involves modifying a program in small ways. Each mutated version is called a mutant and tests detect and reject mutants by causing the behavior of the original version to differ from the mutant. This is called killing the mutant. Test suites are measured by the percentage of mutants that they kill. New tests can be designed to kill additional mutants. Mutants are based on well-defined mutation operators that either mimic typical programming errors (such as using the wrong operator or variable name) or force the creation of valuable tests (such as dividing each expression by zero). The purpose is to help the tester develop effective tests or locate weaknesses in the test data used for the program or in sections of the code that are seldom or never accessed during execution. Mutation testing is a form of white-box testing. Introduction Most of this article is about \\"program mutation\\", in which the program is modified. A more general definition of mutation analysis is using well-defined rules defined on syntactic structures to make systematic changes to software artifacts.Paul Ammann and Jeff Offutt. Introduction to Software Testing. Cambridge University Press, 2008. Mutation analysis has been applied to other problems, but is usually applied to testing. So mutation testing is defined as using mutation analysis to design new software tests or to evaluate existing software tests. Thus, mutation analysis and testing can be applied to design models, specifications, databases, tests, XML, and other types of software artifacts, although program mutation is the most common. Overview Tests can be created to verify the correctness of the implementation of a given software system, but the creation of tests still poses the question whether the tests are correct and sufficiently cover the requirements that have originated the implementation. (This technological problem is itself an instance of a deeper philosophical problem named \\"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\\" [\\"Who will guard the guards?\\"].) The idea is that if a mutant is introduced without being detected by the test suite, this indicates either that the code that had been mutated was never executed (dead code) or that the test suite was unable to locate the faults represented by the mutant. For this to function at any scale, a large number of mutants are usually introduced, leading to the compilation and execution of an extremely large number of copies of the program. This problem of the expense of mutation testing had reduced its practical use as a method of software testing. However, the increased use of object oriented programming languages and unit testing frameworks has led to the creation of mutation testing tools that test individual portions of an application. Goals The goals of mutation testing are multiple: * identify weakly tested pieces of code (those for which mutants are not killed) * identify weak tests (those that never kill mutants) * compute the mutation score, the mutation score is the number of mutants killed / total number of mutants. * learn about error propagation and state infection in the program History Mutation testing was originally proposed by Richard Lipton as a student in 1971,Mutation 2000: Uniting the Orthogonal by A. Jefferson Offutt and Roland H. Untch. and first developed and published by DeMillo, Lipton and Sayward.Richard A. DeMillo, Richard J. Lipton, and Fred G. Sayward. Hints on test data selection: Help for the practicing programmer. IEEE Computer, 11(4):34-41. April 1978. The first implementation of a mutation testing tool was by Timothy Budd as part of his PhD work (titled Mutation Analysis) in 1980 from Yale University.Tim A. Budd, Mutation Analysis of Program Test Data. PhD thesis, Yale University New Haven CT, 1980. Recently, with the availability of massive computing power, there has been a resurgence of mutation analysis within the computer science community, and work has been done to define methods of applying mutation testing to object oriented programming languages and non-procedural languages such as XML, SMV, and finite state machines. In 2004 a company called Certess Inc. (now part of Synopsys) extended many of the principles into the hardware verification domain. Whereas mutation analysis only expects to detect a difference in the output produced, Certess extends this by verifying that a checker in the testbench will actually detect the difference. This extension means that all three stages of verification, namely: activation, propagation and detection are evaluated. They called this functional qualification. Fuzzing can be considered to be a special case of mutation testing. In fuzzing, the messages or data exchanged inside communication interfaces (both inside and between software instances) are mutated to catch failures or differences in processing the data. CodenomiconKaksonen, Rauli. A Functional Method for Assessing Protocol Implementation Security (Licentiate thesis). Espoo. 2001. (2001) and Mu Dynamics (2005) evolved fuzzing concepts to a fully stateful mutation testing platform, complete with monitors for thoroughly exercising protocol implementations. Mutation testing overview Mutation testing is based on two hypotheses. The first is the competent programmer hypothesis. This hypothesis states that most software faults introduced by experienced programmers are due to small syntactic errors. The second hypothesis is called the coupling effect. The coupling effect asserts that simple faults can cascade or couple to form other emergent faults.A. Jefferson Offutt. 1992. Investigations of the software testing coupling effect. ACM Trans. Softw. Eng. Methodol. 1, 1 (January 1992), 5-20.A. T. Acree, T. A. Budd, R. A. DeMillo, R. J. Lipton, and F. G. Sayward, \\"Mutation Analysis,\\" Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, Technique Report GIT-ICS-79/08, 1979. Subtle and important faults are also revealed by higher-order mutants, which further support the coupling effect.Yue Jia; Harman, M., \\"Constructing Subtle Faults Using Higher Order Mutation Testing,\\" Source Code Analysis and Manipulation, 2008 Eighth IEEE International Working Conference on , vol., no., pp.249,258, 28-29 Sept. 2008Maryam Umar, \\"An Evaluation of Mutation Operators For Equivalent Mutants,\\" MS Thesis, 2006Smith B., \\"On Guiding Augmentation of an Automated Test Suite via Mutation Analysis,\\" 2008Polo M. and Piattini M., \\"Mutation Testing: practical aspects and cost analysis,\\" University of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain), Presentation, 2009Anderson S., \\"Mutation Testing\\", the University of Edinburgh, School of Informatics, Presentation, 2011 Higher- order mutants are enabled by creating mutants with more than one mutation. Mutation testing is done by selecting a set of mutation operators and then applying them to the source program one at a time for each applicable piece of the source code. The result of applying one mutation operator to the program is called a mutant. If the test suite is able to detect the change (i.e. one of the tests fails), then the mutant is said to be killed. For example, consider the following C++ code fragment: if (a && b) { c = 1; } else { c = 0; } The condition mutation operator would replace \`&&\` with \`\` and produce the following mutant: if (a  b) { c = 1; } else { c = 0; } Now, for the test to kill this mutant, the following three conditions should be met: # A test must reach the mutated statement. # Test input data should infect the program state by causing different program states for the mutant and the original program. For example, a test with \`a = 1\` and \`b = 0\` would do this. # The incorrect program state (the value of 'c') must propagate to the program's output and be checked by the test. These conditions are collectively called the RIP model. Weak mutation testing (or weak mutation coverage) requires that only the first and second conditions are satisfied. Strong mutation testing requires that all three conditions are satisfied. Strong mutation is more powerful, since it ensures that the test suite can really catch the problems. Weak mutation is closely related to code coverage methods. It requires much less computing power to ensure that the test suite satisfies weak mutation testing than strong mutation testing. However, there are cases where it is not possible to find a test case that could kill this mutant. The resulting program is behaviorally equivalent to the original one. Such mutants are called equivalent mutants. Equivalent mutants detection is one of biggest obstacles for practical usage of mutation testing. The effort needed to check if mutants are equivalent or not can be very high even for small programs.P. G. Frankl, S. N. Weiss, and C. Hu. All-uses versus mutation testing: An experimental comparison of effectiveness. Journal of Systems and Software, 38:235‚Äì253, 1997. A systematic literature review of a wide range of approaches to overcome the Equivalent Mutant Problem (presented by Overcoming the Equivalent Mutant Problem: A Systematic Literature Review and a Comparative Experiment of Second Order Mutation by L. Madeyski, W. Orzeszyna, R. Torkar, M. J√≥zala. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering) identified 17 relevant techniques (in 22 articles) and three categories of techniques: detecting (DEM); suggesting (SEM); and avoiding equivalent mutant generation (AEMG). The experiment indicated that Higher Order Mutation in general and JudyDiffOp strategy in particular provide a promising approach to the Equivalent Mutant Problem. Mutation operators Many mutation operators have been explored by researchers. Here are some examples of mutation operators for imperative languages: * Statement deletion * Statement duplication or insertion, e.g. \`goto fail;\`Apple's SSL/TLS bug by Adam Langley. * Replacement of boolean subexpressions with true and false * Replacement of some arithmetic operations with others, e.g. \`+\` with \`*\`, \`-\` with \`/\` * Replacement of some boolean relations with others, e.g. \`>\` with \`>=\`, \`\` and \`<=\` * Replacement of variables with others from the same scope (variable types must be compatible) * Remove method body, implemented in Pitest These mutation operators are also called traditional mutation operators. There are also mutation operators for object-oriented languages,MuJava: An Automated Class Mutation System by Yu- Seung Ma, Jeff Offutt and Yong Rae Kwo. for concurrent constructions,Mutation Operators for Concurrent Java (J2SE 5.0) by Jeremy S. Bradbury, James R. Cordy, Juergen Dingel. complex objects like containers,Mutation of Java Objects by Roger T. Alexander, James M. Bieman, Sudipto Ghosh, Bixia Ji. etc. Operators for containers are called class-level mutation operators. For example, the muJava tool offers various class-level mutation operators such as Access Modifier Change, Type Cast Operator Insertion, and Type Cast Operator Deletion.

It was the first Bentley to feature a body not shared with a Rolls-Royce model since the 1965 S3 Continental and was the first to use the GM 4L80-E transmission. The Continental R was the fastest, most expensive, and most powerful Bentley automobile of its day. It was also the most expensive production car in the world at its introduction. A convertible derivative, called the Bentley Azure, was launched in 1995. Origin and the Bentley revival As managing director of Rolls Royce Motor Cars in the early 1980s under the Vickers ownership, David Plastow could see the potential in the Bentley brand. It had been neglected for the previous 15 years and made up only a very small percentage of the company's sales at that time, particularly outside the UK in important markets such as the USA. The first move in reshaping the brand was to introduce a turbocharged model of the standard Bentley 4-door saloon: as a result, the Bentley Mulsanne Turbo was launched in 1982. On the back of this, Peter Ward, marketing director of the company (and later, Managing Director), wanted to further enhance the distinctive sporting nature of the Bentley brand and move away from a Bentley that was merely a re-badged Rolls Royce. They appointed designers John Heffernan and Ken Greenley to come up with ideas for a new, distinctive, Bentley coup√©. A fibreglass mock up of the design was displayed at the 1985 Geneva Motor Show as Rolls-Royce's \\"Project 90\\" concept of a future Bentley coup√©. The concept was met with an enthusiastic reception, but the Project 90 design was largely shelved as the company began to work towards a replacement for the Rolls-Royce Corniche. During this process, Graham Hull, chief designer in house at Rolls Royce, suggested to the board of directors that the designs sketched for the Corniche would suit a Bentley coup√© better.Hull, p. 63 From this point it was decided the Corniche could continue as it was, and efforts would once again be channelled into a new Bentley coup√©. In 1986 Graham Hull produced a design rendering of a new Bentley coup√© which became the Continental R. Based on the Rolls-Royce SZ platform (which was an evolution of the SY platform), an aerodynamically shaped two-door coup√© body had been styled. John Heffernan and Ken Greenley were officially retained to complete the design of the Continental R. They had run the Automotive Design School at the Royal College of Art and headed up their own consultancy, International Automotive Design, based in Worthing, Southern England. Greenley and Heffernan liaised constantly throughout the design process with Graham Hull. The interior was entirely the work of Graham Hull and the small in house styling team at Rolls Royce. The shape of the car was very different from the somewhat slab sided four-door SZ Rolls-Royce and Bentley of the time and offered a much improved coefficient of drag of . The Continental R also featured roof-cut door frames, a necessity to allow easier access into the car which had a lower roofline than its 4-door saloon contemporaries. A subtle spoiler effect was also a feature of the rear. The finished car is widely acknowledged as a very cleverly and attractively styled vehicle, effectively disguising its huge dimensions (the Continental R is around 4-inch longer than a 2013 long wheelbase Mercedes S Class). The \\"Continental\\" designation recalls the Bentley Continental of the post-war period. The \\"R\\" was meant to recall the R Type Bentley models from the 1950s as well as the Turbo R of the 1980s and 90s where the \\"R\\" refers to \\"roadholding\\". The revival of the Bentley marque following the introduction of the Bentley Mulsanne Turbo, and then the Continental R, is widely acknowledged to have saved Rolls Royce Motor cars and formed the groundwork which led to the buyout and parting of the Rolls Royce and Bentley brands in 1998. Bentley was once again capable of standing alone as a marque in its own right when it was purchased by Volkswagen. Launch A completed pre-production Continental R (developed under the codename \\"Nepal\\") was secretly taken to Switzerland for a surprise launch of the model at the 1991 Geneva Motor Show (It had been expected the car would be launched in 1992). It was driven from behind a wall on the Rolls Royce stand. Handel's Zadok the Priest music was chosen for the launch of the new model which was originally written for King George II's coronation in 1727. The Sultan of Brunei, impressed by the new model, purchased the show car at the event for a price of over GB¬£2 million. The new Mercedes-Benz W140 also launched at the show, was completely upstaged by the launch of the unexpected, vermilion red, new Bentley Coup√© due to the largely positive public reception. Model year changes Since its launch in 1991, the 6.75 L Garrett-turbocharged V8 engine from the Turbo R was chosen for use in the Continental R. In early cars (produced from 1991 to 1993) power output of at 4,000 rpm and peak torque of at 2,000 rpm was available, although this was always estimated as at that time, Rolls-Royce still had a policy of not supplying official figures, preferring to describe power output simply as \\"sufficient\\". The car used the new 4-speed GM 4L80-E automatic transmission which had been exhaustively tested by Rolls Royce, over , and modified by them to deliver very high levels of refinement. The car featured self-levelling hydraulic suspension (with adaptive ride/Automatic Ride Control) and ventilated disc brakes at the front with twin calipers. Engine management was done via the MK-Motronic digital fuel injection with fully mapped ignition control system. At launch, advertised top speed was , along with a 0- acceleration time of 6.6 seconds. The Continental R was priced at US$271,780 in 1992 and GB¬£178,000 in the UK at its launch. All cars were equipped with a centre console mounted electronic gear selector (the first time Rolls Royce had made a car without the autobox selector on the steering column), with a Sport button to simultaneously adjust gearbox mapping and stiffen the suspension for more aggressive driving and handling. For such a large and heavy car, the Continental R was repeatedly acknowledged by road testers and journalists as displaying superb handling characteristics at high speeds. Prices of the Continental R in the UK rose to ¬£180,120 in the 1994 model year. That year also saw a number of revisions to the engine, including revisions to the cylinder heads courtesy of Cosworth (another company within the Vickers group, alongside Rolls-Royce and Bentley). The alloy wheels were also increased in diameter to 17-inch and were of a completely new 7 spoke design. Power output of the engine was now estimated at around at 4,000 rpm and peak torque at 2,000 rpm. 1996 Bentley Continental R interior finished in magnolia & wildberry colour By the 1996 model year, the Continental R was priced at ¬£187,354 in the UK. The year saw some of the most significant changes since the launch of the car, notably the inclusion of the liquid cooled chargecooler as standard, along with an improved Zytek EMS3 engine management system which meant improvement in throttle response and fuel efficiency along with a digitally controlled turbo over-boost. Power output of the engine was increased as a result, and a change in policy by Rolls-Royce: this was the first time performance figures were officially released by the manufacturer, departing from a long tradition of describing performance as \\"adequate\\" or \\"sufficient\\". Probably the reason for this is because the figures were very impressive: at 4,000 rpm and torque of starting to be available at only 2,000 rpm, and available up to 4,000 rpm (according to UK brochure). No other production car in the world at the time delivered such levels of torque. This lead British publication Autocar to suggest, when road testing the 1996 Continental R in August 1995, that the gearbox would've been destroyed due to the enormous levels of low down torque available. 0‚Äì97 km/h was now officially quoted by Rolls-Royce as \\"sub 6 seconds\\" along with a top speed of (according to the UK brochure). The 1996 model year also saw revised 17-inch alloy wheels and steering wheel tilt adjustment for the first time. This was electrically adjustable and so could now be set as part of the seat and wing mirror memory positions. Electronic Traction Assistance System began to appear on the later 1996 model year cars. In the 1998 model year, the electronic traction assistance system was included as standard and some cosmetic changes were made. Power and torque of the engine remained the same as before, but 0‚Äì97 km/h acceleration time was now quoted as \\"6 seconds\\". The cosmetic revisions included fitting the same front seats as fitted to the convertible Azure, which were shared with the BMW 8 Series and trimmed by Rolls-Royce, featuring an integrated seat belt. Other revisions included small mesh vents below the headlights, laser-cut mesh radiator grille as standard, revised alloy wheels and minor changes to front and rear bumpers. Between 1999 and the end of production in 2003, Bentley indulged customers in a variety of special customised cars under their Personal Commission programme with a number of cars fitted with the engine including the Le Mans, Continental R, Continental R 420 and Millennium. A total of 194 Continental R cars had the 420 engine ‚Äì some of which were also wide body cars.  Models  = Continental S = The Continental S was a limited-edition performance model introduced in 1994 and 1995 with a liquid cooled chargecooler added. Only thirty seven were produced and offered to established Bentley customers. The late Alan Clark MP was one such owner. This engine had an estimated output of , and 0‚Äì97 km/h acceleration time improved to 6.1 seconds. = Continental R California Edition = The Continental R California Edition was a limited edition of 6 wide body coup√©s produced in 1998. Other than the California Editions one other wide body car was made in 1998. Number six was fitted with the full-spec Continental T engine that just became available in 1998 with a power output of and a maximum torque of 881 N‚ãÖm (650 lb‚ãÖft). This car was the first Continental R model to be fitted with this engine. The larger dual-caliper brakes were also fitted to number six as well as numerous other features that later were incorporated into the 2000 2003 Continental R420 including push button start, eight gauges, and other unique features. = Continental R Mulliner = The Continental R Mulliner model range, offered from March 1999, was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show. The Bentley Continental R Mulliner was equipped with the same engine as the Continental T. This engine had a power output of and a maximum torque of . The car has an estimated top speed of . 0- acceleration time dropped to 5.6 seconds. One of the reasons the Continental R Mulliner came into existence, were the customers who wanted the power of the Continental T in the longer wheelbase R. The T was shorter than the R, fully at the expense of space for the rear passengers. = Continental T = Bentley Continental T Launched in 1996, the Bentley Continental T was a short wheelbase version of the Continental R offering slightly more power, torque and responsive handling, at the expense of rear passenger leg room. At its launch, the Bentley Continental T offered an additional over the 1996 Continental R, at 400 hp, and an additional of torque at . For the 1998 model year, this was increased to and of torque available at only 2,200 rpm. The Continental T has a more athletic outward appearance due to a shorter wheelbase and extended front and rear wheelarches. The T had larger brake discs and full front brake calipers. It was also equipped with ABS brakes. The interior featured a turned-metal dashboard with chrome-finished instruments (as opposed to the wood finish in the Continental R), lambswool carpets and a polished aluminium trim, although some cars were specified with traditional wood trim. The Continental T's engine responded to a separate push-button starter. Performance, due to less weight, was slightly better than the Continental R cars with the same engine. Due to its shorter wheelbase and compact interior, the Continental T was classified as a subcompact car by the EPA. Performance figures included a 0‚Äì97 km/h time of 6.2 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 14.5 seconds at along with a slalom speed of while the top speed was an estimated . The Bentley Continental T Mulliner was introduced in 1999. Modified shock absorbers in combination with stiffer torsion bars (front +40%, rear +20%) increased the Continental's handling ability. =Continental Sedanca Coup√© (SC)= Bentley Continental Sedanca Coup√© The Continental SC 'Sedanca Coup√©' was a 1999 limited production version of the Continental T with a removable roof panel over the front seats. A total of 79 cars were built with 6 being completed with the Mulliner package and 48 being left hand drive. Blackpool cars The launch of the Continental R had the effect of stimulating the imagination and demands of some of the world's wealthiest individuals. Throughout the 1990s, Rolls-Royce was tasked with developing numerous special cars for such customers, a service beyond that of mere customisation. Code named \\"Blackpool cars\\",Hull, p. 110 these were highly bespoke automobiles, generally based on the Continental R, but with unique body shells often costing several million pounds to tool up, from which a handful of examples would be made.Hull, pp. 110-121 The best known customer for these cars was the Sultan of Brunei who had numerous unique automobiles made reportedly placing orders worth tens of millions of pounds with Rolls- Royce during this period. End of production The production of the Continental R ceased in 2003 and it was the last car still based on the SZ Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit platform (4 door cars based on the same platform had already been superseded in 1998 by the new Bentley Arnage / Rolls Royce Silver Seraph) and with features unique to the company which have disappeared on cars built since, such as floor mounted brake and accelerator pedals, sill level floors and mineral oil suspension and braking systems. The Bentley Continental R has become acknowledged as the end of an era, and a rare modern classic. = Production figures = * Continental R/S: 1,504 ** Continental R (1991‚Äì2002): 1,236 ** Continental S (1994‚Äì1995): 37 ** Continental R California Edition (1998): 6 ** Continental R (2000) Millennium Edition: 10 ** Continental R Mulliner (1999‚Äì2003): 131 ** Continental R 420 (2000‚Äì2003): 38 ** Continental R Le Mans (2001): 46 * Continental T: 350 ** Continental T (1996‚Äì2002): 322 ** Continental T Mulliner (1999): 23 ** Continental T Le Mans (2001): 5 ** Continental SC (1999): 73 ** Continental SC Mulliner (1999): 6 References  External links Continental R Category:Grand tourers Category:Coup√©s Category:Luxury vehicles Category:Flagship vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 1991 ","title":"Bentley Continental R"},{"id":"2362850","text":"Maine Medical Center (commonly abbreviated to MMC or contracted to Maine Med) is a 637 licensed-bed teaching hospital for Tufts University School of Medicine, and previously Robert Larner College of Medicine, located at 22 Bramhall Street in Portland, Maine, United States with a staff of over 6,000 people.

The S1 was derived from Rolls- Royce's complete redesign of its standard production car after World War II, the Silver Cloud. Each was its maker's last standard production car with an independent chassis. The S-series Bentley was given the Rolls-Royce - Bentley L Series V8 engine in late 1959 and named the S2. Twin headlamps and a facelift to the front arrived in late 1962, resulting in the S3. In late 1965 the S3 was replaced by the new unitary construction Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow- derived T series.

The Times, Wednesday, 27 April 1955; pg. 9; Issue 53205; col B and it was noted that the existing Continental model would continue. The new standard steel saloon replaced the R type standard steel saloon which had been in production, with modifications, since 1946. It was a more generously sized five- or six-seater saloon with the body manufactured in pressed steel with stressed skin construction. Doors, bonnet and luggage locker lid were of aluminium. Having a totally new external appearance, although with the traditional radiator grille, the main differences from the R type were: * three inches longer wheelbase * lower build without reducing headroom and with an enlarged luggage boot * softer suspension with electrically operated control of rear dampers * lighter steering and improved braking * engine capacity increased to 4887cc, the same size as used in the Bentley Continental * four-speed automatic gearbox was standard, with ability to select individual ratios if desired. Standard and long wheelbase saloon and chassis As with the preceding Mark VI and R type Bentleys, there was almost no difference between standard Bentley and Rolls-Royce models; this Bentley S differing only in its radiator grille shape and badging from the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud I.

Blanchland was formed out of the medieval Blanchland Abbey property by Nathaniel Crew, 3rd Baron Crew, the Bishop of Durham, 1674‚Äì1722. It is a conservation village, largely built of stone from the remains of the 12th- century Abbey. It features picturesque houses, set against a backdrop of deep woods and open moors. Located near the Derwent Reservoir, it provides facilities for sailing and fishing. The Lord Crewe Arms Hotel has a vast fireplace where 'General' Tom Forster hid during the Jacobite rising of 1715. W. H. Auden stayed at the Lord Crewe Arms with fellow student Gabriel Carritt at Easter 1930, and later remarked that no place held sweeter memories. Writer Emily Elizabeth Shaw Beavan lived and wrote here when her husband worked at Derwent Mines. Blanchland may have been the model for the village in which was set the opening and closing scenes of Auden and Isherwood's play The Dog Beneath the Skin (1935).

Johnson (July 16, 1906September 15, 1998) was an American inventor and computer pioneer. A long-time employee of IBM, Johnson is said to be the \\"father\\" of the hard disk drive. Other inventions include automatic test scoring equipment and the videocassette tape. Biography A native of Minnesota, born to Swedish immigrants, Johnson graduated from Minnehaha Academy (1925) and went on to graduate from the University of Minnesota (BS in Educational Administration, 1929). In the early 1930s, Johnson, then a high school science teacher in Michigan, invented an electronic test scoring machine that sensed pencil marks on a standardized form based on the multiple choice test created by Columbia University professor Benjamin D. Wood. IBM bought the rights to Reynold's invention and hired him as an engineer to work in their Endicott, New York laboratory. The test scoring machine was sold as the IBM 805 Test Scoring Machine beginning in 1937. One of Reynold's early assignments was to develop technology that allowed cards marked with pencil marks to be converted into punched cards. That allowed punched card data to be recorded by people using only a pencil. That \\"mark sense\\" technology was widely used by businesses in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. For example, the Bell System used mark sense technology to record long-distance calls, and utility companies used it to record meter readings. The Federal Government used it under the name \\"electrographic\\" technology. In 1952, IBM sent Johnson to San Jose, California, to set up and manage its West Coast Laboratory. In 1956, a research team led by Johnson developed disk data storage technology, which IBM released as the IBM 305 RAMAC. Although the first disk drive was crude by modern standards, it launched a multibillion-dollar industry. Johnson was working with Sony on another project when he developed the prototype for a half-inch videocassette tape. Lou Stevens noted that \\"Sony was using wider tape on reels. He cut the tape to a half an inch, and put it in a cartridge. The larger tapes weren't easy enough for kids to use, and his interest was in education and building a video textbook for kids.\\" Johnson retired from IBM in 1971. He obtained more than 90 patents. After his retirement, he developed the microphonograph technology used in the Fisher-Price \\"Talk to Me Books.\\" The Talk to Me Books won a Toy of the Year award. This technology was also used by the National Audubon Society to aid bird watchers with songbird identification. He received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Ronald Reagan in 1986. The IEEE Reynold B. Johnson Information Storage Systems Award was established in 1991, and is each year presented to a small team or an individual that has made outstanding contributions to information storage systems. Johnson was awarded the Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit in 1996. Johnson died in 1998, at the age of 92, of melanoma at Palo Alto, California.

Gen. John C. Pemberton's Army of Mississippi. Waul's Legion at Vicksburg Brig. Gen. Thomas N. Waul Waul's Texas Legion Monument, Vicksburg National Military Park Waul's Texas Legion is known for repelling the Union Army breach of Confederate lines during Ulysses S. Grant's largest and final organized assault on the \\"Fortress City\\" of Vicksburg, on May 22, 1863. After Union troops, most notably the 77th Illinois, under the command of John Alexander McClernand, successfully penetrated the Confederate defenses, McClernand urged Grant to follow with his own assault. Unsure of the accuracy of the message, Grant failed to act. Waul's Legion, seeing the Union breach, rushed in. After hours of intense hand-to-hand combat, the Legion put the Union troops to flight and captured two Union banners which had been placed on the fortress parapets. By the time Grant realized there had been a definitive breach of the enemy fortifications, it was too late; Waul's Texas Legion had saved the day. The angered Grant, believing McClernand had recklessly chased glory and thus caused an unnecessary loss of Union soldiers, relieved the politician-general from his post. As this was the second failed assault to capture Vicksburg by storm, Grant decided to starve the Army of Mississippi into submission. After 47 days cut off from food and supplies, the defenders of Vicksburg were forced to surrender to Grant's Army of the Tennessee on July 4, 1863.

Tourism The Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia Museum is located just a block away from the church. In there are a variety of belongings of Francia and other objects from the 19th century. The cavern of Saint Thomas is the place of a legend. This legend narrates that in the area, lived a priest, Pa‚Äôi Sum√©, who is said left marks in his trip through the region. The road that leads to the cavern was venerated by the natives of the area, who told stories of a blond man that came much before the Spanish arrived and showed them how to cultivate the corn. The Franciscan settled in Yaguar√≥n and in the altar of the church they built can be appreciated the Hispanic-Guaran√≠ style of the carvings the natives made by hand. From the Gamarra Oratory, on top of the Yaguar√≥n Hill, the cities Piray√∫, It√°, Paraguar√≠ and Carapegu√° can be well appreciated. left The festivity of Saint Roque on August 16 is celebrated in a chapel built in his honor. Because it is said that this saint is the protector of dogs, in the celebration, people make very particular offerings with the shape of dogs. Musical tradition Yaguar√≥n keeps one of the oldest musical traditions of Paraguay: The ‚ÄúPetete Peteke‚Äù Para‚Äôi Band, from Guayaibity Town, which uses the original musical instruments of the natives. In the top of the Yaguar√≥n Hill there is an Oratory, from where the beautiful landscape can be appreciated. The legend tells that in this hill are the footprints of Saint Thomas.

The Collor Plan (), is the name given to a collection of economic reforms and inflation-stabilization plans carried out in Brazil during the presidency of Fernando Collor de Mello, between 1990 and 1992. The plan was officially called New Brazil Plan (Portuguese:Plano Brasil Novo), but it became closely associated with Collor himself, and \\"Plano Collor\\" became its de facto name. The Collor plan combined fiscal and trade liberalization with radical inflation stabilization measures.Welch, John H. Birch, Melissa. Smith, Russell.ECONOMICS: BRAZIL. Library of Congress.

Inflation stabilization plans Three separate plans to stabilize inflation were carried out during Collor's two years in power. The first two, Collor Plans I and II, were headed by the finance minister, Z√©lia Cardoso de Mello. In May 1991, Z√©lia was replaced by Marc√≠lio Marques Moreira, who carried out a homonymous plan, the Marc√≠lio Plan (Portuguese: Plano Marc√≠lio).Bresser- Pereira, Luiz Carlos.

Retrieved September 8, 2007. =Collor Plan I= Brazil had suffered through several years of hyperinflation: in 1989, the year before Collor took office, average monthly inflation was 28.94%.Resultados Mensais por Grupos - 1979 a 1999 - Brasil e √Åreas. IBGE. Retrieved September 8, 2007. The Collor Plan sought to stabilize inflation by \\"freezing\\" government liability (such as internal debt) and restricting money flow in order to halt inertial inflation. The freeze caused a strong reduction in trade and output of industry. With the reduction in the money supply from 30% to 9% of GDP, the rate of inflation dropped from 81% in March to 9% in June. The government faced two choices: they could either hold the freeze, and risk a recession brought about by the reduction of economic activity, or re-monetize the economy by \\"unfreezing\\" money flow and risk the return of inflation. Rapid, uncontrolled re-monetization of the economy had been named as the cause the failure of the previous economic stabilization plans in controlling inflation. The Collor government would have to \\"throttle\\" the re-monetization in order to keep inflation down.Carvalho, Carlos Eduardo. O fracasso do Plano Collor: erros de execu√ß√£o ou de concep√ß√£o?. ECONOMIA. Niter√≥i. Vol.4, No.2, p.283-331, July‚ÄìDecember 2003. Retrieved September 8, 2007. To do so, it could utilize a wide combination of economic tools to affect the speed of re-monetization, such as taxes, exchange rates, money flow, credit and interest rates. For the next few months after the plan was implemented inflation continued on an upward trend. By January 1991, nine months after the plan began, it had climbed back to 20% a month. The failure of the Plano Color I in controlling inflation is credited by both Keynesian and monetarist economists to the Collor government's failure to control the re-monetization of the economy.Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos. O Plano Collor e a Volta da Infla√ß√£o . Indicadores Econ√¥micos FEE, 18 (2): 55-61. Porto Alegre. August 1990. Retrieved September 8, 2007. The government had opened several \\"loopholes\\" which contributed to the increase of the money flow: Taxes and other government bills issued prior to the freeze could be paid with the old Cruzado, creating a form of \\"liquidity loophole\\" which was fully exploited by the private sector. A number of individual exceptions to individual sectors of the economy were opened by the government, such as retirees' savings and \\"special financing\\" for the government payroll. As the government issued more and more exceptions granting liquidity, these were later dubbed little faucets (Portuguese: torneirinhas). According to Carlos Eduardo Carvalho, from Departamento de Economia da Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica de S√£o Paulo:Scielo, As origens e a g√™nese do Plano Collor The Collor Plan itself began to be formatted by the president-elects advisors at the end of December 1989, after his victory in the runoff election. The final draft was probably strongly influenced by a document discussed by the advisors of PMDB party candidate Ulysses Guimar√£es, and later by advisors of PT party candidate Lu√≠s In√°cio Lula da Silva, during the period between the general election and the runoff. In spite of the differences in their general economic strategies, these competing candidates failed to develop their own stabilization policies at a time of rapid price increases and risk of hyperinflation during the second half of 1989. The proposal to block liquidity originated in academic debate and was imposed upon the main presidential candidacies. Ultimately, the government was unable to reduce spending, reducing its ability to use many of the aforementioned tools. Reasons ranged from an increased share of the federal tax revenue to be shared with the individual states to a \\"job stability\\" clause for government employees in the 1988 Brazilian Constitution which prevented the size reduction as announced at the start of the plan. This vindicated economists such as Luiz Carlos Bresser- Pereira and M√°rio Henrique Simonsen, both former finance ministers, who had predicted at the start of the plan that the government's fiscal situation would make it impossible for the plan to work.Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos.

It included a new freezing of prices and the replacement of the overnight rate with new financial instruments which included in its yield calculation the anticipated rates of both private and federal papers. The plan managed to produce only a short-term drop in inflation, and it began to climb again in May 1991. =Marc√≠lio Plan= On May 10, 1991, Z√©lia was replaced as finance minister by Marc√≠lio Marques Moreira, a Georgetown-educated economist who was at the time of his nomination the Brazilian ambassador to the United States.Ministros de Estado da Fazenda: Marc√≠lio Marques Moreira . Brazilian Finance Ministry. Retrieved September 8, 2007. Marc√≠lio's plan was considered more gradual than its predecessors, utilizing a combination of high interest rates and a restrictive fiscal policy. At the same time, prices were liberalized and, working along with Pedro Malan, a US$2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund secured to shore up internal currency reserves. Inflation rates during the Marc√≠lio Plan remained at hyperinflationary levels. Marc√≠lio left the finance ministry to his successor, Gustavo Krause, on October 2, 1992.Ministros de Estado da Fazenda: Gustavo Krause. Brazilian Finance Ministry. Retrieved September 8, 2007. President Fernando Collor de Mello had been impeached by congress four days earlier, on September 28, 1992, over charges of corruption in an influence-peddling scheme, marking the end of his government's attempts at ending hyperinflation.Lattman-Weltman, Fernando. September 29, 1992: Collor's Impeachment Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas. Retrieved August 17, 2007. Between the end of the Marc√≠lio Plan and the beginning of the next \\"named\\" plan, the Plano Real, inflation continued to grow, reaching 48% in June 1994. Industrial and Foreign Trade Policy (PICE) Running along in parallel with the Collor Plan was the PICE, a program which aimed to both raise real wages and promote economic openness and trade liberalization. Selected policies included the gradual reduction of tariffs (with the selective protection of certain key industries), an export financing mechanism through the creation of a Foreign Trade Bank (similar to the American Ex-Im Bank), reduction in customs duties, implementation of anti-dumping mechanisms and the use of government-generated demand for high-tech sectors. On paper, the PICE had seemingly contradictory goals: to stimulate the entry of foreign companies while increasing local innovation. Later studies by the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA), an independent government think tank, argued that the policy seemed to have produced that very contradictory effect: local production saw improvements in quality and productivity in face of foreign competition, but it simultaneously curbed domestic innovation due to unrestricted competition from imported technology. National Privatization Program (PND) While previous privatizations had been conducted by the government in the 1980s, at time of Collor's inauguration, no large-scale privatization program had been attempted. Sixty-eight different companies were added to the PND and slated for privatization. Unlike traditional privatization programs, which sought to finance a government's deficit, the PND had a stated goal of providing the government with the means with which they could purchase back the public debt. Government bonds were used in large quantities as currency to pay for privatized companies.BNDES: Hist√≥rico do PND . BNDES. December 31, 2002. Retrieved September 9, 2007. Altogether, some 18 companies worth US$4 billion were privatized between 1990 and 1992, mostly in the steel, fertilizer and petrochemical sectors. The PND also ended several government monopolies whose possible negative social impact was expected to be countered by the increased competition. This increased competition, resulting from the aforementioned PICE policies, was thought to reduce the chance of the emergence of oligopolies.

Annan in 2005 as a United Nations General Trust Fund to support democratization efforts around the world. It was welcomed http://www.un.org/womenwatch/ods/A-RES-60-1-E.pdf by the General Assembly in the Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit (A/RES/60/1, paragraphs 136-137). UNDEF created by UN Secretary- General UNDEF supports projects that strengthen the voice of civil society, promote human rights, and encourage the participation of all groups in democratic processes. The large majority of UNDEF funds go to local civil society organizations‚Äîboth in the transition and consolidation phases of democratization. In this way, UNDEF plays a novel and unique role in complementing the UN's other, more traditional work‚Äîthe work with Governments‚Äîto strengthen democratic governance around the world. UNDEF subsists entirely on voluntary contributions from Governments; in 2015, it reached almost 170 million dollars in contributions and counts more than 40 countries as donors, including many middle- and low-income States in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Mission UNDEF supports projects that strengthen the voice of civil society, promote human rights, and encourage the participation of all groups in democratic processes. The large majority of UNDEF funds go to local civil society organizations - both in the transition and consolidation phases of democratization. In this way, UNDEF plays a novel and distinct role in complementing the UN's more traditional work‚Äîthe work with Governments - to strengthen democratic governance around the world. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that UNDEF's focus ‚Äúrecognizes a fundamental truth about democracy everywhere -- that it is ultimately the product of a strong, active and vocal civil society. It is such a civil society that fosters responsible citizenship and makes democratic forms of government work.‚Äù UNDEF Support and Funding In 10 Rounds of Funding so far, UNDEF has supported over 600 projects in more than 100 countries. UNDEF projects are two years long and fall under one or more of seven main areas; * Women's rights and empowerment / Gender equality * Community activism * Rule of Law and human rights * Youth engagement * Strengthening civil society capacity for interaction with Government * Media and freedom of information * Tools for knowledge UNDEF grants range from US$100,000 to US$300,000. Project proposals are subject to a highly rigorous and competitive selection process, as UNDEF receives an average of about 2,000-3,000 proposals a year and only some 50-60 are selected. Funding UNDEF subsists entirely on voluntary contributions from Governments; in 2010, it surpassed US$110 million in cumulative contributions from 39 countries, including a wide range of non- traditional donor countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Contributions to UNDEF qualify as Official Development Assistance, and several donors choose to make multi-year commitments. The United States remain the largest donor. Governance As a secretary-General's Trust Fund located within the UN Secretariat, UNDEF falls under the direct authority of the UN Secretary- General. The secretary-general is guided by the UNDEF Advisory Board , which consists of the seven biggest UNDEF donor countries‚Äîas of 2010, the United States, India, Japan, Qatar, Germany, Australia and Spain; six States from different regions, chosen for their proven commitment to democracy; two representatives of civil society organizations; and three individuals, including the chair of the board. Since 2007, the chair has been Professor Michael Doyle of Columbia University, a former UN assistant secretary-general for policy planning under secretary-General Kofi Annan. All members serve for a two-year term. Within the UN Secretariat, the UNDEF Programme Consultative Group serves as UN inter-agency mechanism that provides expert advice, including on recommendations for project selection. It comprises the Department of Political Affairs, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Peacebuilding Support Office, the UN Development Programme, the UN Development Fund for Women and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. To ensure low overheads, the UNDEF office is managed by a small team of four professionals, led (since 2007) by Roland Rich of Australia, a former diplomat and director of the Centre for Democratic Institutions at Australian National University. Democracy and the United Nations For the UN, the importance of democracy and of democratic values was first highlighted in the United Nations Charter, as well as in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This in turn has been echoed in a variety of documents ‚Äì declarations, conventions, covenants, most notably the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which contains binding obligations on States Parties in respect of elections, freedom of expression and association and assembly and other vital democratic entitlements. In the 1990s, a period characterised by important changes in various parts of the world, democracy has also become a theme of a number of international conferences, and major UN organs, including the General Assembly, pronounced themselves on ways to strengthen democracy. This process was matched by increasing operational activities in support of democratisation processes by the UN System. In particular, in 2000 the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) placed democratic governance at the heart of its development cooperation programme, equipping itself with greater internal expertise in this area and channeling a substantial proportion of its core resources in this direction. Another significant development was the establishment in 1992 of the Electoral Assistance Division within the Department of Political Affairs. The links between international peace and security, sustainable human development and democratization were all embraced again by the international community with the unanimous adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit in 2000.

Although it now sees very little flooding, it was built on marsh lands. However, due to urban growth, it is now an outer suburb of Coventry, near to Ansty and Shilton. Walsgrave on Sowe neighbours the Potters Green, Henley Green, Wyken, Coombe Fields and Mount Pleasant areas of Coventry and is in the Henley ward of the city, although Walsgrave-on-Sowe was formerly in the Wyken Ward prior to ward changes made in 2003 by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England (LGBCE). History The 1914‚Äì1918 war memorial with St Mary's Church in the background St Mary's Church (side view), Walsgrave Walsgrave has reputedly been in existence for approximately 1,000 years. The first mention of a chapel in Walsgrave-on-Sowe (then known as Sowe) was in 1221. It is likely that the chapel would have been built after 1086, as there is no reference in the Domesday Book of a priest serving the area. St Mary's Church currently stands on the site of the former chapel. The original graveyard for the church was covered over and now forms the slope in front of the church, facing onto the main road. Walsgrave grew into a sizeable village commercially based around agriculture and coal mining. Plans for incorporating Walsgrave within the boundaries of Coventry were proposed in the late 1920s, and Walsgrave gradually lost its individual identity owing to new road development, the replacement of much of its older buildings and houses with new housing schemes, and the eventual closure of the pit (Craven Colliery, sited off Henley Road). However, an old weaver's cottage lay directly opposite St. Mary's Church; subjected to fire and weathering, it was restored a number of times but still stands as a reminder of the village's origins. (This cottage became derelict and has now been demolished and now incorporates a row of new cottages). Additional older buildings that still stand can be found on the Hinckley road just east of the war memorial, along Hall Lane and School House Lane and along Woodway Lane close to the former Craven Arms public house. Economy Walsgrave lies south of the M6 and M69 interchange and has a growing commercial area including a Barclays bank call centre, Lloyds Pharmacy Head Office and several other companies important to Coventry. Opposite Paradise Way is the Walsgrave Triangle Retail Park and Cross Point Business Park. Here there is a Premier Inn, Brewers Fayre restaurant named Cross Point, Holiday Inn, a large Tesco store, a Frankie & Benny's restaurant, a Nando's, Showcase Cinema and several more business offices and warehouses. Infrastructure =Health= The former Walsgrave Hospital during demolition on 1 February 2007 Coventry's PFI hospital, University Hospital Coventry, replaced the buildings of the former Walsgrave Hospital. This hospital has a helipad, and receives a large number of patients from all over the Midlands. =Education= Primary Schools within the area are Sir Frank Whittle, Walsgrave CoE Primary School and SS Peter and Paul RC Primary. Nearby schools include Potters Green Primary, there are two secondary schools which are Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School and Language College and Grace Academy, formerly known as Woodway Park School and Community College. Transport The area is served by National Express Coventry bus routes 1, 8, 8A & 20A and Travel DeCourcey bus routes 74, 703, 778 & X6. The 8 & 74 serve Walsgrave Triangle. Walsgrave is the location for junction 2 of the M6 Motorway where it meets the M69 Motorway. The area is by-passed by the A46. Sport A short lived greyhound racing track was opened as 16 November 1929 on the Cowley Road.

Home to approximately 5,000 residents, the community is located east of Rochester proper, and is one of two villages (the other being Gonic) within city limits. The area was a farming community which developed into a small textile and shoe manufacturing mill town during the Industrial Revolution. The Abenaki people called the area's river Newichawannock, meaning \\"river with many falls\\", which in the 19th century became the source of water power for two mills. The first was called the Cocheco Woolen Manufacturing Company, with the second smaller one built upstream and called the White Mill. Between the 1880s and 1920s, \\"Eastside\\" (as it is referred to by locals) achieved its maximum growth. It was served by the Nashua & Rochester Railroad, which later became part of the Boston & Maine Railroad. Called \\"Rindgemere\\", the depot was located on Autumn Street. But during the Great Depression, the mills began to decline, and finally folded in the 1970s. With its principal employers gone, East Rochester slipped in its quality of life. More recently, however, the district has enjoyed a rebirth. Located near major routes and industrial centers, its small village ambience has attracted new residents, and several beautiful Victorian buildings have been restored. East Rochester gets a good percentage of local business from just across the border in Lebanon, Maine. East Rochester consists of a main street with several small shops and a shopping center known as Shoreyville Plaza, named after the original settlement in the area. Also on Main Street are two churches and a small library. In recent years, the old fire station (1902 till the early 1980s) has been converted into a museum, as fire services are now obtained from the main station in Rochester. A three-story block located on Main Street once housed the post office and a clothing store until the early 1980s, when the post office moved into a two-story brick block further north on Main Street. The area no longer has its post office, but East Rochester still has its own ZIP code (03868).

In 1990, La Sierra College of Arts and Sciences separated from Loma Linda University to become La Sierra University, an independent institution. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the Adventist Accrediting Association (AAA). Since becoming independent in 1990, La Sierra University has won multiple national and world titles in the Enactus (formerly Students in Free Enterprise) competition.

History Since its founding in 1922 as La Sierra Academy, La Sierra has morphed through a number of stages. In 1927, the school became known as La Sierra Academy and Normal School when it expanded into offering courses for future teachers. Later that year, after course offerings were expanded, it became known as the Southern California Junior College. In 1939, the school was renamed La Sierra College. In 1940, the high school section split to form La Sierra College Preparatory School. The preparatory school is now named La Sierra Academy and is still located near the university. It was first accredited as a four-year liberal arts college in 1946. In 1964 the city of Riverside annexed much of La Sierra lands and nearby Arlington, placing the college within Riverside's city limits.

The university's Board of Trustees unanimously affirmed the Seventh-day Adventist Church's 28 Fundamental Beliefs but some viewed that as inadequate. In 2010, the regional accreditation agency responsible for La Sierra, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, gave the university an eight-year accreditation extension despite concerns over academic freedom and institutional autonomy.

During 2006, the majority of the Robinsons-May stores were converted to the Macy's or Bloomingdale's nameplate, either as replacements for existing stores, new locations or as expansions of existing locations. Prime locations at South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa and Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego where Macy's already had stores were shuttered in early 2006 and refurbished as Bloomingdale's locations. The change of store signs occurred on September 9, 2006. Already existing Macy's locations in Arizona and Inland Empire regions relocated from their existing spots to Robinson's May.

They are descendants of Bappa Rawal, eighth ruler of the Guhilot Dynasty and founder of the Mewar Dynasty (r. 734-753). The chiefs of Dungarpur bear the title of Maharawal by being descended from Mahup, the eldest son of Karan Singh, the chief of Mewar in the 12th century and claim the honors of the elder line of Mewar. Mahup, disinherited by his father, took refuge with his mother's family, the Chauhans of Bagar,Dungarpur State The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1908, v. 11, p. 379. and made himself lord of that country at the expense of the Bhil chiefs. His younger brother, Rahup, founded a separate Sisodia dynasty. Temple Dev Somnath The town of Dungarpur, the capital of the state, was founded near the end of the 14th century by Rawal Bir Singh, the Sixth descendant of Sawant Singh of Mewar, who named it after Dungaria, an independent Bhil chieftain whom he had been assassinated.

The primary developer of electrographic systems was IBM, who used mark sense as a trade name for both the forms and processing system. The term has since come to be used generically for any technology allowing marks made using ordinary writing implements to be processed, encompassing both optical mark recognition and electrographic technology. The term \\"mark sense\\" is not generally used when referring to technology that distinguishes the shape of the mark; the general term optical character recognition is generally used when mark shapes are distinguished. Because the term mark-sense was originally a trade name, the Federal Government generally used the term electrographic. In the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, mark sense technology was widely used for applications like processing meter readings recordings on turnaround documents and recording long distance telephone calls. Many thousands of pencils were made expressly for mark sense applications by the Dur-O-Lite Pencil Company and by the Autopoint Company. Many of the pencils made for the \\"Bell System\\" were stamped \\"MARK SENSE LEAD\\" and for the Federal Government, \\"US Government Electrographic.\\" In the early 1930s, science teacher Reynold B. Johnson developed an automatic test scoring machine. IBM bought Johnson's invention and hired him as an engineer - the machine was sold as the IBM 805 Test Scoring Machine. The first large-scale use of the IBM 805 was by the American Council on Education's Cooperative Test Service in 1936; in 1947, the Cooperative Test Service became part of the Educational Testing Service. Johnson went on to develop a range of electrographic mark-sense machinery. Various IBM equipment could be used with mark sense cards including the IBM 513 and IBM 514 Reproducing Punches, the IBM 557 Alphabetic Interpreter, and the IBM 519 Electric Document Originating Machine.

He was Governor of Santa Fe from 2007 to 2011.Binner ya es el primer gobernador socialista del pa√≠s . Rosario3, December 11, 2007. Binner is the first Socialist to become the governor of an Argentine province, and the first non-Justicialist to rule Santa Fe since 1983.Gan√≥ Binner y el socialismo sac√≥ al PJ de la Gobernaci√≥n de Santa Fe, Clar√≠n, September 3, 2007 Binner was previously a Deputy of the Civic and Social Progressive Front, a Santa Fe party coalition including the Socialist Party, the Radical Civic Union and other left-wing parties, since the parliamentary elections of October 23, 2005. Biography =Education and background= Binner was born and raised in Rafaela, Santa Fe Province, to a Swiss Argentine family. He attended primary school at St. Joseph's College, and then attended high school at the Rafaela National College, where he began his political activity through participation in the Student Center. At the time (1958) the need for public free non-religious education was being hotly debated in Argentina. Binner moved to Rosario to study Medicine at the Universidad Nacional de Rosario. At 18 he became affiliated with the Argentine Socialist Party and continued to exercise an intense political activity, both as a member of the Student Center and at the institutional level in the Faculty of Medicine. After the 1966 coup d'√©tat, he participated in the movements resisting the military dictatorship of General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, against a background of political and ideological persecution. He graduated in 1970 and continued his militant activism as a Graduate Council Member at the University, as well as working as a union member at the Rosario Medical Association and the Physicians' College. =Political trajectory= Guillermo Est√©vez Boero and Binner co-founded the Popular Socialist Party (Partido Socialist Popular, PSP) in Buenos Aires on April 23, 1972, a merger of the Argentine Socialist Party (PSA) with other left-wing groups. He continued exercising his profession, taking up specialties in anesthesiology and occupational medicine, and starting studies in the field of public health. On the last account he obtained the posts of Sub-Director and Director of public hospitals. Following the 1989 economic crisis that led to the early handover of power by President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n to President-elect Carlos Menem, the UCR Mayor of Rosario Horacio Usandizaga resigned in protest, forcing anticipated municipal elections to be held. The Socialist H√©ctor Cavallero was elected, and he appointed Binner to the office of Public Health Secretary. After Cavallero's term, in 1993, Binner was elected concejal (member of the City Council) for the PSP. From this platform he developed a trajectory that led him to present himself as a candidate for the municipal elections of 1995. =Mayor of Rosario= Binner was elected Mayor of Rosario in 1995 and then re-elected in 1999, ending his second four- year term in 2003. He was candidate to the governorship of the province of Santa Fe, obtaining a larger percentage of the popular vote than any of the other candidates, but the controversial voting system in place at the time (Ley de Lemas) caused the Socialist Party to lose the election to the Peronist Party. The eight years of the Binner administration in Rosario were marked by several guidelines: * Decentralization and emphasis on the citizen's rule: The city was divided into several large districts, moving the bureaucratic structure from the Municipality to the peripheral barrios (neighbourhoods), and implementing mechanisms of direct democracy. * Emphasis on the public sphere (health, education, cultural activities) and public welfare. The administration's Health Plan was acknowledged by the Pan-American Health Organization as a model for the rest of Latin America. * Positioning of Rosario as a strategically placed metropolis with a vast area of economic and geopolitical influence. Binner was a Founding Member and Executive Secretary of Mercociudades (cities of the Mercosur), President of the Ibero-American Center for Urban Strategic Development (CIDEU), and President of the Argentine Municipalities Federation. On December 8, 2003, months after the end of Binner's second term, the United Nations acknowledged the people and the government of Rosario as a model of democratic governance among 257 Latin American cities.Experiencia Rosario Hermes Binner was succeeded in office by one of his former municipal officials, Miguel Lifschitz, who has continued and developed the policies outlined above, and was re-elected in 2007. =Other activities= Binner was a member of the National Table of the Socialist Party and the Secretary General of the Santa Fe Federation for the same. He was also the director of the Rosario's Municipal and Provincial Studies Center, an institution for political and academic formation with professionals of diverse disciplines debating current issues and policies. =National Deputy= Binner was a candidate for a seat in the National Chamber of Deputies (the Lower House of the Argentine Congress) for the Progressive, Civic and Social Front, a Santa Fe political coalition (which includes the Socialist Party (PS), members of the Radical Civic Union (UCR), Support for an Egalitarian Republic (ARI), Democratic Progressive Party, Communist Party and Peronist dissident) in the parliamentary elections of October 23, 2005. He won the seat, together with another six candidates of the Progressive Front, by a 10% margin over the list of candidates led by his closest competitor, the Justicialist Party candidate Agust√≠n Rossi. =Governor of Santa Fe= Binner ran for governor of Santa Fe in 2007, together with former Santa Fe City federal prosecutor Griselda Tessio as vice-governor, against former chancellor and national deputy for Buenos Aires City Rafael Bielsa (chosen in primaries by the Justicialist Front for Victory). He was supported by the left-wing opposition leader Elisa Carri√≥, head of the ARI.Aliado de Kirchner perde elei√ß√£o na 2¬™ prov√≠ncia argentina, BBC, September 3, 2007 Binner won the provincial election of September 2, 2007, by a significant margin (by 48% to 38%) over Bielsa.

Despite his opposition to the Peronist candidate, who was strongly supported by then-President N√©stor Kirchner, Governor Binner maintained a fluid relationship with Kirchner and his wife and successor, President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. Binner joined UCR Congressman Ricardo Alfons√≠n in the Civic and Social Agreement during the early stages of the 2011 general election campaign. Their alliance ended in May, however, and on June 11, Binner formally announced his candidacy for President of Argentina.

The rotational energy typically comes from an engine or electric motor. They are a sub-class of dynamic axisymmetric work-absorbing turbomachinery. The fluid enters the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated by the impeller, flowing radially outward into a diffuser or volute chamber (casing), from which it exits. Common uses include water, sewage, agriculture, petroleum and petrochemical pumping. Centrifugal pumps are often chosen for their high flow rate capabilities, abrasive solution compatibility, mixing potential, as well as their relatively simple engineering. A centrifugal fan is commonly used to implement a vacuum cleaner. The reverse function of the centrifugal pump is a water turbine converting potential energy of water pressure into mechanical rotational energy. History According to Reti, the first machine that could be characterized as a centrifugal pump was a mud lifting machine which appeared as early as 1475 in a treatise by the Italian Renaissance engineer Francesco di Giorgio Martini. True centrifugal pumps were not developed until the late 17th century, when Denis Papin built one using straight vanes. The curved vane was introduced by British inventor John Appold in 1851. How it works Cutaway view of centrifugal pump Like most pumps, a centrifugal pump converts rotational energy, often from a motor, to energy in a moving fluid. A portion of the energy goes into kinetic energy of the fluid. Fluid enters axially through eye of the casing, is caught up in the impeller blades, and is whirled tangentially and radially outward until it leaves through all circumferential parts of the impeller into the diffuser part of the casing. The fluid gains both velocity and pressure while passing through the impeller. The doughnut-shaped diffuser, or scroll, section of the casing decelerates the flow and further increases the pressure. =Description by Euler= A consequence of Newton's second law of mechanics is the conservation of the angular momentum (or the ‚Äúmoment of momentum‚Äù) which is of fundamental significance to all turbomachines. Accordingly, the change of the angular momentum is equal to the sum of the external moments. Angular momentums œÅ√óQ√ór√ócu at inlet and outlet, an external torque M and friction moments due to shear stresses MœÑ are acting on an impeller or a diffuser. Since no pressure forces are created on cylindrical surfaces in the circumferential direction, it is possible to write Eq. (1.10) as: :::\\\\rho Q(c_2 u .r_2 - c_1 u .r_1) = M + M_\\\\tau (1.13) Euler's pump equation Based on Eq.(1.13) Euler developed the head pressure equation created by the impeller see Fig.2.2 :::Yth.g=H_t= c_2u.u_2 - c_1u.u_1 (1) :::Yth=1/2(u_2^2-u_1^2+w_1^2-w_2^2+c_2^2-c_1^2) (2) In Eq. (2) the sum of 4 front element number call static pressure, the sum of last 2 element number call velocity pressure look carefully on the Fig 2.2 and the detail equation.

This rule was helpful to detail Eq.(1) become Eq.(2) and wide explained how the pump works. Fig 2.3 (a) shows triangle velocity of forward curved vanes impeller ; Fig 2.3 (b) shows triangle velocity of radial straight vanes impeller. It illustrates rather clearly energy added to the flow (shown in vector c) inversely change upon flow rate Q (shown in vector cm). =Efficiency factor= \\\\eta = \\\\frac{\\\\rho.gQH}{P_m}, where: :P_m is the mechanics input power required (W) :\\\\rho is the fluid density (kg/m3) :g is the standard acceleration of gravity (9.80665 m/s2) :H is the energy Head added to the flow (m) :Q is the flow rate (m3/s) :\\\\eta is the efficiency of the pump plant as a decimal The head added by the pump (H) is a sum of the static lift, the head loss due to friction and any losses due to valves or pipe bends all expressed in metres of fluid. Power is more commonly expressed as kilowatts (103 W, kW) or horsepower. The value for the pump efficiency, \\\\eta_{pump}, may be stated for the pump itself or as a combined efficiency of the pump and motor system. Vertical centrifugal pumps Vertical centrifugal pumps are also referred to as cantilever pumps. They utilize a unique shaft and bearing support configuration that allows the volute to hang in the sump while the bearings are outside the sump. This style of pump uses no stuffing box to seal the shaft but instead utilizes a \\"throttle bushing\\". A common application for this style of pump is in a parts washer. Froth pumps In the mineral industry, or in the extraction of oilsand, froth is generated to separate the rich minerals or bitumen from the sand and clays. Froth contains air that tends to block conventional pumps and cause loss of prime. Over history, industry has developed different ways to deal with this problem. In the pulp and paper industry holes are drilled in the impeller. Air escapes to the back of the impeller and a special expeller discharges the air back to the suction tank. The impeller may also feature special small vanes between the primary vanes called split vanes or secondary vanes. Some pumps may feature a large eye, an inducer or recirculation of pressurized froth from the pump discharge back to the suction to break the bubbles. Multistage centrifugal pumps Multistage centrifugal pump A centrifugal pump containing two or more impellers is called a multistage centrifugal pump. The impellers may be mounted on the same shaft or on different shafts. At each stage, the fluid is directed to the center before making its way to the discharge on the outer diameter. For higher pressures at the outlet, impellers can be connected in series. For higher flow output, impellers can be connected in parallel. A common application of the multistage centrifugal pump is the boiler feedwater pump. For example, a 350 MW unit would require two feedpumps in parallel. Each feedpump is a multistage centrifugal pump producing 150 l/s at 21 MPa. All energy transferred to the fluid is derived from the mechanical energy driving the impeller. This can be measured at isentropic compression, resulting in a slight temperature increase (in addition to the pressure increase). Energy usage The energy usage in a pumping installation is determined by the flow required, the height lifted and the length and friction characteristics of the pipeline. The power required to drive a pump (P_i), is defined simply using SI units by: Single-stage radial- flow centrifugal pump : P_i= \\\\cfrac{\\\\rho\\\\ g\\\\ H\\\\ Q}{\\\\eta} where: :P_i is the input power required (W) :\\\\rho is the fluid density (kg/m3) :g is the standard acceleration of gravity (9.80665 m/s2) :H is the energy Head added to the flow (m) :Q is the flow rate (m3/s) :\\\\eta is the efficiency of the pump plant as a decimal The head added by the pump (H) is a sum of the static lift, the head loss due to friction and any losses due to valves or pipe bends all expressed in metres of fluid. Power is more commonly expressed as kilowatts (103 W, kW) or horsepower (hp = kW/0.746). The value for the pump efficiency, \\\\eta_{pump}, may be stated for the pump itself or as a combined efficiency of the pump and motor system. The energy usage is determined by multiplying the power requirement by the length of time the pump is operating. Problems of centrifugal pumps These are some difficulties faced in centrifugal pumps: Open Type Centrifugal Pump Impeller * Cavitation‚Äîthe net positive suction head (NPSH) of the system is too low for the selected pump * Wear of the impeller‚Äîcan be worsened by suspended solids * Corrosion inside the pump caused by the fluid properties * Overheating due to low flow * Leakage along rotating shaft. * Lack of prime‚Äîcentrifugal pumps must be filled (with the fluid to be pumped) in order to operate * Surge Pie chart showing what causes damage to pumps. Centrifugal pumps for solids control An oilfield solids control system needs many centrifugal pumps to sit on or in mud tanks. The types of centrifugal pumps used are sand pumps, submersible slurry pumps, shear pumps, and charging pumps. They are defined for their different functions, but their working principle is the same. Magnetically coupled pumps Magnetically coupled pumps, or magnetic drive pumps, vary from the traditional pumping style, as the motor is coupled to the pump by magnetic means rather than by a direct mechanical shaft. The pump works via a drive magnet, 'driving' the pump rotor, which is magnetically coupled to the primary shaft driven by the motor.Pump Handbook:third edition They are often used where leakage of the fluid pumped poses a great risk (e.g., aggressive fluid in the chemical or nuclear industry, or electric shock - garden fountains). They have no direct connection between the motor shaft and the impeller, so no gland is needed. There is no risk of leakage, unless the casing is broken. Since the pump shaft is not supported by bearings outside the pump's housing, support inside the pump is provided by bushings. The pump size of a magnetic drive pumps can go from few Watts power to a giant 1MW. Priming Most centrifugal pumps are not self-priming. In other words, the pump casing must be filled with liquid before the pump is started, or the pump will not be able to function. If the pump casing becomes filled with vapors or gases, the pump impeller becomes gas-bound and incapable of pumping. To ensure that a centrifugal pump remains primed and does not become gas-bound, most centrifugal pumps are located below the level of the source from which the pump is to take its suction. The same effect can be gained by supplying liquid to the pump suction under pressure supplied by another pump placed in the suction line. The process of filling the pump with liquid is called priming. =Self-priming centrifugal pump= In normal conditions, common centrifugal pumps are unable to evacuate the air from an inlet line leading to a fluid level whose geodetic altitude is below that of the pump. Self-priming pumps have to be capable of evacuating air (see Venting) from the pump suction line without any external auxiliary devices. Centrifugal pumps with an internal suction stage such as water-jet pumps or side-channel pumps are also classified as self-priming pumps. Self-Priming centrifugal were invented in 1935. One of the first companies to market a self-priming centrifugal pump was American Marsh in 1938. Centrifugal pumps that are not designed with an internal or external self-priming stage can only start to pump the fluid after the pump has initially been primed with the fluid. Sturdier but slower, their impellers are designed to move water, which is far denser than air, leaving them unable to operate when air is present. In addition, a suction-side swing check valve or a vent valve must be fitted to prevent any siphon action and ensure that the fluid remains in the casing when the pump has been stopped. In self-priming centrifugal pumps with a separation chamber the fluid pumped and the entrained air bubbles are pumped into the separation chamber by the impeller action. The air escapes through the pump discharge nozzle whilst the fluid drops back down and is once more entrained by the impeller. The suction line is thus continuously evacuated. The design required for such a self- priming feature has an adverse effect on pump efficiency. Also, the dimensions of the separating chamber are relatively large. For these reasons this solution is only adopted for small pumps, e.g. garden pumps. More frequently used types of self-priming pumps are side-channel and water-ring pumps. Another type of self-priming pump is a centrifugal pump with two casing chambers and an open impeller. This design is not only used for its self- priming capabilities but also for its degassing effects when pumping twophase mixtures (air/gas and liquid) for a short time in process engineering or when handling polluted fluids, for example, when draining water from construction pits. This pump type operates without a foot valve and without an evacuation device on the suction side. The pump has to be primed with the fluid to be handled prior to commissioning. Two-phase mixture is pumped until the suction line has been evacuated and the fluid level has been pushed into the front suction intake chamber by atmospheric pressure. During normal pumping operation this pump works like an ordinary centrifugal pump.

Combined with its acoustic counterpart \\"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\\", it bookends Young's 1979 album Rust Never Sleeps. The song was influenced by the punk rock zeitgeist of the late 1970s, in particular by Young's collaborations with the American art punk band Devo, and what he viewed as his own growing irrelevance.  Origins  The song \\"Hey Hey, My My...\\", as well as the titular phrase of the album on which it was featured, \\"rust never sleeps,\\" sprang from Young's collaborations with Devo and, in particular, the band's frontman, Mark Mothersbaugh. In 1977, Devo had been asked by Young to participate in the creation of his film, Human Highway,Oh Yes, It‚Äôs Devo: An Interview with Jerry Casale Brian L. Knight, The Vermont Review, Retrieved December 15, 2007 and a scene in the film shows Young playing the song in its entirety with Devo (with Mothersbaugh changing the lyric about \\"Johnny Rotten\\" to \\"Johnny Spud\\"). On May 28, 1978 Young collaborated with Devo on a cacophonous version of \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\\" at the Different Fur studio in San Francisco and, would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse. During the Different Fur studio session, Mothersbaugh added the lyrics \\"Rust never sleeps\\", a slogan he remembered from his graphic arts career that promoted the automobile rust proofing product Rust-Oleum. Young adopted the line and used it in his Crazy Horse version of the song, as well as for the title of his album. The lyrics, \\"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics. The line \\"It's better to burn out than it is to rust\\" is often credited to Young's friend Jeff Blackburn of The Ducks. Some critics viewed Young's career as declining after the release of 1977's American Stars 'N Bars and 1978's Comes a Time. With the explosion of punk rock in 1977, some punks had felt that Young and his contemporaries were becoming obsolete, with Young worrying that they were right. The death of Elvis Presley that same year compounded this, with the British punk band The Clash even stating, \\"No Elvis, Beatles or The Rolling Stones in 1977!\\" in their song \\"1977\\".The Last Gang in Town: The Story and Myth of the Clash, Marcus Gray, 1996, New York: Henry Holt and Company, pp. 187-188  Content  Brad Tyer of Houston Press proclaimed \\"Hey Hey, My My\\" to be \\"proto-grunge grunt rock\\", stylistically.  Legacy  In 1980, the song was used as the title theme of Dennis Hopper's movie Out of the Blue. The song later appeared on Young's Greatest Hits in 2004 and was included at #93 in Bob Mersereau's book The Top 100 Canadian Singles in 2010. Many other bands and singers have recorded covers of the song, including: Oasis (on the album Familiar to Millions in 2000); System of a Down (at the Festival of Hurricane in 2005); Dave Matthews Band; Cross Canadian Ragweed; Battleme (as the closing track of the season 3 finale of Sons of Anarchy); Rick Derringer; Nomeansno (on the FUBAR soundtrack); Mexican rock and roll band El Tri; Finnish glam rock band Negative; Argentine rock band La Renga; Chromatics; Jake Bugg (at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival); Axel Rudi Pell (on his 2014 album Into the Storm); Billy Talent on Covered in Gold 5.0 (2017); Romanian act Fjord (on their 2016 album Textures); Brazilian doom metal band HellLight (on their 2012 covers album The Light That Brought Darkness); and Blixa Bargeld and Teho Teardo (on their 2017 album Fall). =Quotations= The lyrics of the song, particularly the line \\"out of the blue and into the black\\", are an epigraph and are also featured prominently in Stephen King's novel It. The line, \\"It's better to burn out than to fade away\\", was included in Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide note in 1994. It is also referenced in Panic! At The Disco's \\"Nicotine\\", Def Leppard's \\"Rock of Ages\\", Hole's \\"Reasons to be Beautiful\\", Bosse's \\"Sch√∂nste Zeit\\", Meg Myers' \\"Some People\\", and most recently Machine Gun Kelly‚Äôs ‚Äú27‚Äù. It is also spoken by Kurgan (Clancy Brown) in the 1986 fantasy adventure film Highlander in the modern day church scene. This line is used in Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúGimme the Prize (Kurgan‚Äôs Theme)‚Äù from the album A Kind of Magic, which functioned as that film‚Äôs soundtrack. James Joyce expresses a similar sentiment as the lyric near the end of his short story, The Dead: \\"Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age.\\"  References  Sources *  External links  * Song lyrics at Metrolyrics * HyperRust Never Sleeps - a Neil Young database with information and further lyrics * Sonic Youth and Neil Young - details Sonic Youth's involvement with Young during the early 1990s * Ruth Israel, Rachel Auger and Patrick McAllister - Theatrical Blues Performance dedicated to Neil Young Category:Neil Young songs Category:1979 singles Category:Songs written by Neil Young Category:Oasis (band) songs Category:Songs about suicide Category:Song recordings produced by David Briggs (record producer) Category:1979 songs Category:Reprise Records singles Category:Music videos directed by Julien Temple Category:Song recordings produced by Neil Young Category:Crazy Horse (band) songs ","title":"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"},{"id":"2363187","text":"Retired Brigadier General George Mutandwa Chiweshe (born June 5, 1953) is the Chairperson of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission.

Chiweshe retired from the army in April 2001 after being appointed to the bench by President Robert Gabriel Mugabe. In September 2004 Chiweshe was appointed Chairman of the Delimitation Commission of Zimbabwe by Mugabe, a move that was criticised by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as a ploy by ZANU PF to rig the March 2005 parliamentary elections. In January 2005, Chiweshe was appointed Chairman of the new Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (a body that supervises and co-ordinates all elections in Zimbabwe), where he presently serves. In May 2010, President Mugabe swore in George Chiweshe, former chairman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission as Judge President.

The guitarfish are known for an elongated body with a flattened head and trunk and small, ray-like wings. The combined range of the various species is tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters worldwide. Description Guitarfish have a body form intermediate between those of sharks and rays. The tail has a typical shark- like form, but in many species, the head has a triangular, or guitar-like shape, rather than the disc-shape formed by fusion with the pectoral fins found in other rays. Reproduction Guitarfish are ovoviviparous; the embryo matures inside an egg inside the mother until it is ready to hatch. This is typical of rays. Habitat Guitarfish are bottom feeders that bury themselves in mud or sand and eat worms, crabs, and clams. Some can tolerate salt, fresh, and brackish water. They generally live close to the beach/coastline or in estuaries. Evolution Rays, including guitarfish, belong to the ancient lineage of cartilaginous fishes. Fossil denticles (tooth-like scales in the skin) resembling that of today's chondrichthyans date at least as far back as the Ordovician, with the oldest unambiguous fossils of cartilaginous fish dating from the middle Devonian. A clade within this diverse family, the Neoselachii, emerged by the Triassic, with the best- understood neoselachian fossils dating from the Jurassic. This clade is represented today by sharks, sawfish, rays and skates.http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/basalfish/chondrofr.html UCMP Berkeley \\"Chondrichthyes: Fossil Record\\" Classification Nelson's 2006 Fishes of the World recognized four genera in this family: Aptychotrema, Rhinobatos, Trygonorrhina, and Zapteryx; other taxa once placed in the Rhinobatidae, such as Platyrhinoidis and Rhina, have since been moved to their own families. Recently, the genus Glaucostegus has again become recognized as distinct from Rhinobatos. Rhinobatos has been split in three genera based on genetic and morphological considerations: Rhinobatos, Acroteriobatus and Pseudobatos. Tarsistes is dubious and may be a synonym of Pseudobatos, and other genera formerly included in Rhinobatidae have been moved to Glaucostegidae, Rhinidae and Trygonorrhinidae. * Genus Acroteriobatus Giltay, 1928 ** Acroteriobatus annulatus (J.

The island has three villages: Barasil (northernmost), Medhuavah (in the middle) and Kurigam (southernmost). The population of the island was around 2000 in 2013.  History  Most of the history (geological and behavioural) of Fonadhoo and its people has not been recorded. The island is considered a Gaamathee Rah - an island formed on a coral mountain, facing one side to the bay (Etherevari) and the other side to the open sea (Fuhtaru- Huvadhoo Kandu). It is believed that the island has a rich culture and is very much related to the history of the Maldives. Important historical places in the island include the Old Friday Mosque, a few sheltered tombs (Magbarah) and old mosques and cemeteries in many parts of the island.  Geography  The island is south of the country's capital, Mal√©. Being the administrative capital of Laamu Atoll, the atmosphere is vibrant with a lot of vegetation. Demography  Economy  Most of the people are civil servants or work in Kadhdhoo Domestic Airport or in Maandhoo Fisheries Complex. Some are small scale farmers and others self-employed. At present and since the last decade there are no open sea fishing boats. A few boat owners exist with small reef fishing boats and two boats that cargo goods to and from Male'. The island has a low per capita income but has a regular flow of income which contributes to its slow progress.  Education  Starting from the days of Bodu Madharusa, the island has had a government school which includes grades 1 to 12. There are two other preschools (arafa Preschool in Medhuavah and Barru Preschool in Barasil). The island has an average level of education with very few degree and masters holders and no PhD holders to date. Transport The island is connected by causeway to Gan island and Kadhdhoo.  Notable people  One of the important personalities of Fonadhoo is Abdul Kareem Kaleyfaanu of Finivaage. He was among the first batch of Dhaarul Igama (ÿØÿßÿ±ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÇÿßŸÖ€É) students. He served the government for 48 years. Within this period he sincerely served as the Bodu Katheebu (Island Chief) for 37 years. When he died on 31 July 2004, he was a state pensioner holding the post of Raajjethereyge Khaassa Eheetheriyaa (Special Envoy of the islanders) at the Ministry of Atolls Administration (now Ministry of Home Affairs). He contributed to the literature of Maldives by writing articles of different genres for the Faithoora magazine and several poems. Much of his work is not published. He was married to Aminath Ahmed (Aimina Manike) with 7 children and 13 grandchildren.

Database entry includes justification for why this species is near threatened Morphological and genetic variations occur in the mitochondrial DNA in those found in the Gulf of California, evidencing their isolation from the rest. Because of this, the conservation of this species must be carefully managed to preserve the biological diversity. The shovelnose is considered to be a primitively developed ray, with many features of both sharks and rays. Rhinobatos productus has magnetic particles in its vestibular receptors, and the magnetic particles believed to be exogenous in origin. The magnetic particles' spatial arrangement may aid in the sensitivity of the receptors to movements. The visual system of the shovelnose is more extensive and developed than other Elasmobranchii, with multiple large projections connecting to the brain. Almost the entire dorsal and ventral hypothalamus is connected to the visual system, but still maintains a similar lack of differentiation as with sharks. This species has had one documented case of an attack on a diver when a male guitarfish was interrupted during mating. The shovelnose guitarfish was first considered to be a shark because of its dorsal fin's shape.

As Commonwealth Preference, the proposal was later revived in regard to the members of the Commonwealth of Nations. Joseph Chamberlain, the powerful colonial secretary from 1895 until 1903, argued vigorously that Britain could compete with its growing industrial rivals (chiefly the United States and Germany) and thus maintain Great Power status. The best way to do so would be to enhance internal trade inside the worldwide British Empire, with emphasis on the more developed areas Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa‚Äîthat had attracted large numbers of British settlers.Kenneth J. Panton, Historical Dictionary of the British Empire (2015 ) p. 239.  Pre-20th Century  In 1660, the practice of \\"Old Subsidy\\" gave certain imported colonial products a virtual monopoly in England, effectively starting a form of colonial preference for sugar. By 1840, this had been extended such that more than eighty commercial goods were protected, as the Corn Laws protected some colonial agricultural goods. Colonial conferences held throughout the late 19th century arranged closer economic unions between Dominions and the mother country, with the Dominions giving preferences in exchange for defence commitments or common commercial, patent, immigration and shipping policies. David L. Glickman, \\"The British imperial preference system.\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics 61.3 (1947): 439-470.  20th Century  In the late 1800s and especially during the early 1900s, Imperial Preference was considered a method of promoting unity within the British Empire and sustaining Britain's position as a global power as a response to increased competition from the protectionist Germany and United States. The idea was associated particularly with Joseph Chamberlain, who resigned from the government of Arthur Balfour in September 1903 in order to be free to campaign for Tariff Reform. Among those opposing Chamberlain was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Charles Thomson Ritchie, who, guided by the free-trade ideas of the leading economists of the time, such as Sir William Ashley, was vigorously opposed to any scheme of Imperial Preference. This ultimately resulted in a damaging rift within Balfour's Conservative-Unionist coalition government, contributing to its defeat in the 1906 elections. During the 1920s, Imperial Preference became popular once more, mostly through the good will of Lord Beaverbrook and his Daily Express, once Lloyd George was ejected from office. Unfortunately for Beaverbrook, Bonar Law preferred Lord Derby and his fear of opposition to a policy of extra-mural Food Tax, and Beaverbrook was unable to adapt his scheme, perhaps because of the economics: Law died in office before his first year in power was complete, and was succeeded by Stanley Baldwin, who was a tepid supporter of the scheme. He called the 1923 elections specifically to introduce protectionist policies and lost, leading to the first minority Labour government. Baldwin's Conservatives came back to power after the 1924 elections without a protectionist policy. His Colonial and Dominions Secretary, Leo Amery, was one of its strongest supporters and in 1926 established the Empire Marketing Board to encourage Britons to 'buy Empire'. But Winston Churchill, Chancellor of the Exchequer of the Baldwin government, a former Liberal and always a no-holds-barred free trader, was an opponent. Public opposition to protectionism contributed to the Conservative loss of power again in the 1929 elections and the creation of the second Labour government. The 1931 elections supported a National Government nominally led by former Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald but with an overwhelming majority of MPs being Conservatives under Baldwin; these largely supported Imperial Preference as a response to the Great Depression. In 1932, representatives of Britain, the Dominions, and the Colonies held the Commonwealth Conference on Economic Consultation and Co-operation in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. They agreed to implement policies of Imperial Preference for five years. This new policy was based on the principle of \\"home producers first, empire producers second, and foreign producers last\\" In 1935, the Canadian Prime Minister, R. B. Bennett, a Conservative endorsed Imperial Preference. After World War II and the signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, the extension of preferential tariffs was prohibited and the margins reduced. Inflation, combined with the general liberalisation of trade around the world, ended the formal system of imperial preference.  21st Century  Brexit has sparked increased interest in forming trade agreements between the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.  Preference in other Countries  The Italian Empire, Spain, Portugal, France, Japan, and the United States all had varying degrees of preference between their mainland and their colonies.

When a quantity grows towards a singularity under a finite variation (a \\"finite-time singularity\\") it is said to undergo hyperbolic growth.See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006. P. 19-20. More precisely, the reciprocal function 1/x has a hyperbola as a graph, and has a singularity at 0, meaning that the limit as x \\\\to 0 is infinite: any similar graph is said to exhibit hyperbolic growth. Description If the output of a function is inversely proportional to its input, or inversely proportional to the difference from a given value x_0, the function will exhibit hyperbolic growth, with a singularity at x_0. In the real world hyperbolic growth is created by certain non-linear positive feedback mechanisms.See, e.g., Alexander V. Markov, and Andrey V. Korotayev (2007). \\"Phanerozoic marine biodiversity follows a hyperbolic trend\\". Palaeoworld. Volume 16. Issue 4. Pages 311-318. =Comparisons with other growth= Like exponential growth and logistic growth, hyperbolic growth is highly nonlinear, but differs in important respects. These functions can be confused, as exponential growth, hyperbolic growth, and the first half of logistic growth are convex functions; however their asymptotic behavior (behavior as input gets large) differs dramatically: * logistic growth is constrained (has a finite limit, even as time goes to infinity), * exponential growth grows to infinity as time goes to infinity (but is always finite for finite time), * hyperbolic growth has a singularity in finite time (grows to infinity at a finite time). Applications =Population= Certain mathematical models suggest that until the early 1970s the world population underwent hyperbolic growth (see, e.g., Introduction to Social Macrodynamics by Andrey Korotayev et al.). It was also shown that until the 1970s the hyperbolic growth of the world population was accompanied by quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world GDP, and developed a number of mathematical models describing both this phenomenon, and the World System withdrawal from the blow-up regime observed in the recent decades. The hyperbolic growth of the world population and quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world GDP observed till the 1970s have been correlated by Andrey Korotayev and his colleagues to a non-linear second order positive feedback between the demographic growth and technological development, described by a chain of causation: technological growth leads to more carrying capacity of land for people, which leads to more people, which leads to more inventors, which in turn leads to yet more technological growth, and on and on.See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

Vol. 10, pp. 200-209 . It has been also demonstrated that the hyperbolic models of this type may be used to describe in a rather accurate way the overall growth of the planetary complexity of the Earth since 4 billion BC up to the present.The 21st Century Singularity and its Big History Implications: A re-analysis. Journal of Big History 2/3 (2018): 71 - 118. Other models suggest exponential growth, logistic growth, or other functions. =Queuing theory= Another example of hyperbolic growth can be found in queueing theory: the average waiting time of randomly arriving customers grows hyperbolically as a function of the average load ratio of the server. The singularity in this case occurs when the average amount of work arriving to the server equals the server's processing capacity. If the processing needs exceed the server's capacity, then there is no well-defined average waiting time, as the queue can grow without bound. A practical implication of this particular example is that for highly loaded queuing systems the average waiting time can be extremely sensitive to the processing capacity. =Enzyme kinetics= A further practical example of hyperbolic growth can be found in enzyme kinetics. When the rate of reaction (termed velocity) between an enzyme and substrate is plotted against various concentrations of the substrate, a hyperbolic plot is obtained for many simpler systems. When this happens, the enzyme is said to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Mathematical example The function :x(t)=\\\\frac{1}{t_c-t} exhibits hyperbolic growth with a singularity at time t_c: in the limit as t \\\\to t_c, the function goes to infinity. More generally, the function :x(t)=\\\\frac{K}{t_c-t} exhibits hyperbolic growth, where K is a scale factor. Note that this algebraic function can be regarded as analytical solution for the function's differential:See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006. P. 118-123. : \\\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\\\frac{K}{(t_c-t)^2}=\\\\frac{x^2}{K} This means that with hyperbolic growth the absolute growth rate of the variable x in the moment t is proportional to the square of the value of x in the moment t. Respectively, the quadratic-hyperbolic function looks as follows: :x(t)=\\\\frac{K}{(t_c-t)^2}.

Gan, combined with the adjoining island of Maandhoo, is the largest geographical island of the Maldives. It is divided in wards, the northernmost of which is called Thundi, in middle is Mathimaradhu and at the south is Mukurimagu. Gan is connected with Maandhoo, the island at its south. Maandhoo is linked with the regional domestic airport at Kadhdhoo by a short causeway. Kadhdhoo adjoins at its south with Fonadhoo, the capital of the atoll. The causeway, which links between Kadhdhoo and Fonadhoo, is almost one kilometre in length. The four islands of Gan, Maandhoo, Kadhdhoo and Fonadhoo, which is linked with causeways, stretches up to about in length, making up the longest length of dry land in the Maldives. This island should not be confused with other Maldive islands called 'Gan' in Addu Atoll and Huvadhu Atoll. Demography Economy =Development= Gan is the most developed island in the Laamu Atoll. After the 2004 tsunami the French Red Cross and other foreign governments built new buildings, including a new school, a multi-purpose building, a new hospital, bank, primary and secondary schools, water plant, police station and power houses. Tourism has started growing and is going ahead successfully. =Tourism= Gan is the largest island in the atoll and in the Maldives. The island is on the eastern fringes where most islands in the atoll are located. The island Gan is nestled with astounding beaches. The island also has impressive mounds from a pre-historic Buddhist time. The mounds known as ‚ÄúHawitta‚Äù is a pyramid like structure built in pre-Islamic times and have a history of over 600 years. The Reveries Diving Village developed by Bison Maldives Pvt Ltd was officially opened by President Mohamed Nasheed 1 February 2011. As it is the first of its kind in the country due to it being developed on an inhabited island. Reveries with 23 guest rooms, restaurant, internet caf√©, swimming pool, Roof Top Caf√©, Conference facilities, Spa, Padi Certified Dive School and Water Sport facilities will offer a new kind of tourism. =Health Facility= Gan Regional Hospital provides preventive and curative Health services to all the people residing in the South Central Province and also to all the people who request its services. The hospital had a humble beginning as an Atoll Health Centre on 7 November 1993. The demand for services increased and it expanded to an Atoll Hospital on 11 June 2001. Further upgrades took place in the form of facilities and staff. On 1 August 2002, it achieved Regional Hospital status.

Visual Learners can utilize graphs, charts, maps, diagrams, and other forms of visual stimulation to effectively acquire information. The Fleming VAK/VARK model also includes kinesthetic learning and auditory learning.Leite, Walter L.; Svinicki, Marilla; and Shi, Yuying: Attempted Validation of the Scores of the VARK: Learning Styles Inventory With Multitrait‚ÄìMultimethod Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models, pg. 2. SAGE Publications, 2009. Techniques A review study concluded that using graphic organizers improves student performance in the following areas: ; Retention : Students remember information better and can better recall it when it is represented and learned both visually and verbally. ; Reading comprehension : The use of graphic organizers helps improve the reading comprehension of students. ; Student achievement : Students with and without learning disabilities improve achievement across content areas and grade levels. ; Thinking and learning skills; critical thinking : When students develop and use a graphic organizer their higher order thinking and critical thinking skills are enhanced. Areas of the brain affected Various areas of the brain work together in a multitude of ways in order to produce the images that we see with our eyes and that are encoded by our brains. The basis of this work takes place in the visual cortex of the brain. The visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe of the brain and harbors many other structures that aid in visual recognition, categorization, and learning. One of the first things the brain must do when acquiring new visual information is recognize the incoming material. Brain areas involved in recognition are the inferior temporal cortex, the superior parietal cortex, and the cerebellum. During tasks of recognition, there is increased activation in the left inferior temporal cortex and decreased activation in the right superior parietal cortex. Recognition is aided by neural plasticity, or the brain's ability to reshape itself based on new information.Poldrack, R., Desmond, J., Glover, G., & Gabrieli, J. The Neural Basis of Visual Skill Learning: An fMRI Study of Mirror Reading. Cerebral Cortex. Jan/Feb 1998. Next the brain must categorize the material. The three main areas that are used when categorizing new visual information are the orbitofrontal cortex and two dorsolateral prefrontal regions which begin the process of sorting new information into groups and further assimilating that information into things that you might already know.Vogel, R., Sary, G., Dupont, P., Orban, G. Human Brain Regions Involved in Visual Categorization. Elsevier Science (USA) 2002. After recognizing and categorizing new material entered into the visual field, the brain is ready to begin the encoding process ‚Äì the process which leads to learning. Multiple brain areas are involved in this process such as the frontal lobe, the right extrastriate cortex, the neocortex, and again, the neostriatum. One area in particular, the limbic-diencephalic region, is essential for transforming perceptions into memories.Squire, L. Declarative and Nondeclarative Memory: Multiple Brain Systems Supporting Learning and Memory\\". 1992 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 4.3. With the coming together of tasks of recognition, categorization and learning; schemas help make the process of encoding new information and relating it to things you already know much easier. One can remember visual images much better when they can apply it to an already known schema. Schemas actually provide enhancement of visual memory and learning.Lord, C. \\"Schemas and Images as Memory Aids: Two Modes of Processing Social Information\\". Stanford University. 1980. American Psychological Association. Infancy =Where it starts= Between the fetal stage and 18 months, a baby experiences rapid growth of a substance called gray matter. Gray matter is the darker tissue of the brain and spinal cord, consisting mainly of nerve cell bodies and branching dendrites.Google definition. (2013, November 12). Retrieved from Google. It is responsible for processing sensory information in the brain such as areas like the primary visual cortex. The primary visual cortex is located within the occipital lobe in the back of infant's brain and is responsible for processing visual information such as static or moving objects and pattern recognition. =The four pathways= Within the primary visual cortex, there are four pathways: the superior colliculus pathway (SC pathway), the middle temporal area pathway (MT pathway), the frontal eye fields pathway (FEF pathway), and the inhibitory pathway. Each pathway is crucial to the development of visual attention in the first few months of life. The SC pathway is responsible for the generation of eye movements toward simple stimuli. It receives information from the retina and the visual cortex and can direct behavior toward an object. The MT pathway is involved in the smooth tracking of objects and travels between the SC pathway and the primary visual cortex. In conjunction with the SC pathway and the MT pathway, the FEF pathway allows the infant to control eye movements as well as visual attention. It also plays a part in sensory processing in the infant. Lastly, the inhibitory pathway regulates the activity in the superior colliculus and, later, is responsible for obligatory attention in the infant. The maturation and functionality of these pathways depends on how well the infant can make distinctions as well as focus on stimuli. =Supporting studies= A study by Haith, Hazan, & Goodman in 1988 showed that babies, as young as 3.5 months, are able to create short-term expectations of situations they confront. Expectations in this study refer to the cognitive and perceptual ways in which an infant can forecast a future event. This was tested by showing the infant either a predictable pattern of slides or an irregular pattern of slides and tracking the infant's eye movements.Haith, M. M., Hazan, C., & Goodman, G. S. (1988). Expectation and Anticipation of Dynamic Visual Events by 3.5 Month Old Babies. Child Development, 59, 467-479. A later study by Johnson, Posner, & Rothbart in 1991 showed that by 4 months old, infants can develop expectations, but was tested through anticipatory looks and disengagement with stimuli. For example, anticipatory looks exhibit the infant is able to predict the next part of a pattern which can then be applied to the real world scenario of breast- feeding. Infants are able to predict a mother's movements and expect feeding so they can latch onto the nipple for feeding. Expectations, anticipatory looks, and disengagement all show that infants can learn visually, even if it is only short term.Johnson, M. H., Posner, M. I., & Rothbart, M. K. (1991). Components of Visual Orienting in Early Infancy: Contingency Learning, Anticipatory Looking, and Disengaing. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 335-344 David Roberts (2016) tested multimedia learning propositions, he found that using certain images dislocates pedagogically harmful excesses of text, reducing cognitive overloading and exploiting under-used visual processing capacities In early childhood From the ages 3‚Äì8 visual learning improves and begins to take many different forms. At the toddler age of 3‚Äì5, children's bodily actions structure the visual learning environment. At this age, toddlers are using their newly developed sensory-motor skills quite often and fusing them with their improved vision to understand the world around them. This is seen by toddler's using their arms to bring objects of interest close to their sensors, such as their eyes and face, to explore the object further. The act of bringing objects close to their face affects their immediate view by placing their mental and visual attention on that object and just blocking the view of other objects that are around them and out of view. There is an emphasis placed on objects and things that are directly in front of them and thus proximal vision is the primary perspective of visual learning. This is different from how adults utilize visual learning. This difference in toddler vision and adult vision is attributable to their body sizes, and body movements such that their visual experiences are created by their body movement. An adults view is broad, due to their larger body size, with most objects in view because of the distance between them and objects. Adults tend to scan a room, and see everything rather than focusing on one object only.Smith, L.B., Yu, C., & Pereira, A. F. (2011). Not your mother's view: The dynamics of toddler visual experience. Developmental science, 14(1), 9-17. The way a child integrates visual learning with motor experiences enhances their perceptual and cognitive development.Bertenthal, B. I., Campos, J. J., & Kermoian, R. (1994). An epigenetic perspective on the development of self- produced locomotion and its consequences. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 3(5), 140-145. For elementary school children, aged 4‚Äì11, intellect is positively related to their level of auditory-visual integrative proficiency. The most significant period for the development of auditory- visual integration occurs between ages 5‚Äì7. During this time, the child has mastered visual-kinesthetic integration, and the child's visual learning can be applied to formal learning focused towards books and reading, rather than physical objects, thus impacting their intellect. As reading scores increase, children are able to learn more, and their visual learning has developed to not only focus on physical objects in close proximity to them, but also to interpret words and such to acquire knowledge by reading.Birch, H. G., & Belmont, L. (1965). Auditory-visual integration, intelligence and reading ability in school children. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 20(1), 295-305. In middle childhood Here we categorize middle childhood as ages 9 to 14. By this stage in a child's normal development vision is sharp and learning processes are well underway. Most studies that have focused their efforts on visual learning have found that visual learning styles as opposed to traditional learning styles greatly improve the totality of a student's learning experience. First off, visual learning engages students and student engagement is one of the most important factors that motivated students to learn. Visuals increase student interest with the use of graphics animation and video. Consequently, it has been found that students pay greater attention to lecture material when visuals are used. With increased attention to lesson material, many positive outcomes have been seen with the use of visual tactics in the classrooms of middle-aged students. Students organize and process information more thoroughly when they learn visually which helps them to understand the information better. Students are more likely to remember information that is learned with a visual aid.Beeland, W. \\"Student Engagement, Visual Learning, and Technology: Can Interactive Whiteboards Help?\\" (2001). Theses and Dissertations from Valdosta State University Graduate School. When teachers used visual tactics to teach middle-aged students they found that students had more positive attitudes about the material they were learning.Farkas, R. \\"Effects of Traditional Versus Learning-Styles Instructional Methods on Middle School Students\\" The Journal of Educational Research. Vol. 97, No. 1 (Sep. - Oct., 2003), pp. 42-51. Students also exemplified higher test performance, higher standard achievement scores, thinking on levels that require higher-order thinking, and more engagement. One study also found that learning about emotional events, such as the Holocaust, with visual aids increase middle aged children's empathy. In adolescence =Brain maturation into young adulthood= Gray matter is responsible for generating nerve impulses that process brain information, and white matter is responsible for transmitting that brain information between lobes and out through the spinal cord. Nerve impulses are transmitted by myelin, a fatty material that grows around a cell. White matter has a myelin sheath (a collection of myelin) while gray matter doesn't, which efficiently allows neural impulses to move swiftly along the fiber. The myelin sheath isn't fully formed until around ages 24‚Äì26.Wolfe, Pat. (2001). Brain Matters: Translating the Research to Classroom Practice. ASCD: 1-207 This means that adolescents and young adults typically learn differently, and subsequently often utilize visual aids in order to help them better comprehend difficult subjects. Learning preferences can vary across a wide spectrum. Specifically, within the realm of visual learning, they can vary between people who prefer being given learning instructions with text as opposed to those who prefer being given instructions with graphics. College students were tested in general factors like learning preference and spatial ability (being able to be proficient in creating, holding, and manipulating spatial representations).Mayer, R. E., & Massa, L. J. (2003). Three Facets of Visual and Verbal Learners: Cognitive Ability, Cognitive Style, and Learning Preference. Journal of educational psychology, 95(4), 833. The study determined that college-age individuals report efficient learning styles and learning preferences for themselves individually. These personal assessments have proved accurate, meaning that self-ratings of factors such as spatial ability and learning preference can be effective measures of how well one learns visually. =Gender differences= Studies have indicated that adolescents learn best through 10 various styles; reading, manipulative activity, teacher explanation, auditory stimulation, visual demonstration, visual stimulation (electronic), visual stimulation (just pictures), games, social interaction, and personal experience.Eiszler, C. F. (1982). Perceptual Preferences as an Aspect of Adolescent Learning Styles. According to the study, young adult males demonstrate a preference for learning through activities they are able to manipulate, and young adult females show a greater preference for learning through teacher notes visually or using graphs, and through reading. This suggests that Women are more visually stimulated, interested in information that they can have physical direct control over. Men, on the other hand, learn best through reading information and having it explained in an auditory fashion. Lack of evidence Although learning styles have \\"enormous popularity\\", and both children and adults express personal preferences, there is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes, and there is significant evidence that the widely touted \\"meshing hypothesis\\" (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for that student's learning style) is invalid. Well-designed studies \\"flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis\\". Rather than targeting instruction to the \\"right\\" learning style, students appear to benefit most from mixed modality presentations, for instance using both auditory and visual techniques for all students.Coffield, F., Moseley, D., Hall, E., Ecclestone, K.

Japan undertook major naval building efforts in the mid to late 16th century, during the Sengoku period, when feudal rulers vying for supremacy built vast coastal navies of several hundreds of ships. The largest (and generally most dangerous) of these ships were called atakebune. Around that time, the Japanese daimy≈ç Oda Nobunaga had made, according to the diary of the Abbot of the Tamon-I, six iron-covered big atakebunes in 1578. These ships were called \\"Tekk≈çsen\\" (ÈâÑÁî≤Ëàπ), literally meaning \\"iron ships\\", which is not to imply they were of iron, but that their superstructure may have been reinforced with iron plates against cannon and fire arrows. However, no iron covering was mentioned in the account of the Jesuit missionary Lu√≠s Fr√≥is, who had also seen and described the ships.Stephen Turnbull, \\"Samurai Warfare\\" (London, 1996), Cassell & Co , p.102 However, in the letter from Jo√£o Rodrigues to Lu√≠s Fr√≥is in 1593, full iron-covered atakebune build by Toyotomi Hideyoshi was mentioned. Hideyoshi made those ships to invade Korea and their superstructure was fully covered by iron plates. \\"Atakemaru\\" (ÂÆâÂÆÖ‰∏∏), the big atakebune made by Mukai Sh≈çgen Tadakatsu for Tokugawa Hidetada and Tokugawa Iemitsu was fully covered by copper plates.Arai Hakuseki,„ÄåÂÆâÂÆÖÂæ°Ëàπ‰ªïÊßòÂ∏ñ„Äç„ÄåÂÆâÂÆÖÂæ°ËàπË´∏Ëâ≤Ê≥®ÊñáÂ∏ñ„Äç,1711 The atakebune were armed with a few cannons and numerous large-caliber arquebuses. Oda defeated Mori's navy with them at the mouth of the Kizu River, Osaka in 1578 in a successful naval blockade. These ships, the best of the atakebune, were used somewhat in contrast to Japanese naval tactics of the time, which viewed naval combat as a battle between the crews of ships, rather than between the ships themselves (which contributed to the primary Japanese naval tactic of drawing near and boarding opposing ships, as the Japanese crews excelled at hand-to-hand combat). These vessels may be regarded as floating fortresses rather than true warships, and were only used in coastal actions. They used oars for propulsion, as their full iron cladding, if it existed, as well as their bulk (i.e. the armament and people they were carrying) likely impeded wind-based propulsion via sails. In the Japanese invasion of Korea the shortcomings of these ships became pronounced as they proved to be of no match to the superior build and fire power of the Korean navy's Panokseon ships, which could accommodate far more number of cannons due to sturdier structure and thus were employed in a distance engagement by cannon tactics rather than the grappling tactics of the atakebune-based Japanese navy.

He held office as the Mayor of Matamoros from 1993 to 1995, and the Governor of Tamaulipas from 1999 to 2005. Yarrington sought nomination for the presidential elections for the PRI in 2005. Yarrington graduated with bachelor's degrees in economics and law from the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies and the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le√≥n respectively. He also received a master's degree in public administration from the University of Southern California. In 1991 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies and from 1993 until 1995 he served as mayor of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Later on he headed the local branch of the Revolutionary Institutional Party, joined the cabinet of Manuel Cavazos Lerma as state secretary of finance and served as governor of Tamaulipas (1999‚Äì2004). After leaving the governorship, Yarrington entered the presidential primaries by mid-2005. He was accused in early 2012 for laundering money for Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, after a drug cartel member was apprehended and informed the DEA that Yarringnton had ties with the leaders of the drug trafficking organizations. In addition, Yarrington was accused of plotting the assassination of Rodolfo Torre Cant√∫, the former candidate for state governor in Tamaulipas, along with the Gulf Cartel, which reportedly carried out the ambush that killed the politician. He was arrested in Florence, Italy, on 9 April 2017. Organized crime allegations Yarrington's accusations of his criminal activities began in November 2011, when the slain body of a businessman and rancher named Alfonso Pe√±a-Arg√ºelles was publicly displayed in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. Along with the body was a message left by Los Zetas accusing Pe√±a-Arg√ºelles' brother of laundering money for Yarrington. On 30 January 2012, the Attorney General of Mexico issued a communiqu√© ordering the past three governors of Tamaulipas ‚Äì Manuel Cavazos Lerma, Eugenio Hern√°ndez Flores, and Tom√°s Yarrington ‚Äì to remain in the country because they were being investigated for possible correlation with the Mexican drug cartels. After a court case in San Antonio, Texas, the U.S. federal agency known as the DEA accused Yarrington of laundering money for Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel from 1999 to 2004, his time as governor. This information was obtained after Antonio Pe√±a-Arg√ºelles, an alleged high-ranking drug cartel member, was arrested and claimed that Yarrington had \\"direct personal relationship with Zeta leaders.\\" In addition, Yarrington was accused of plotting the assassination of Rodolfo Torre Cant√∫, the former candidate for governor in Tamaulipas' 2010 elections; the ambushed that killed Torre Cant√∫ was allegedly carried out by Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez, the supreme leader of the Gulf cartel. According to the DEA's protected witness, Torre Cant√∫ was assassinated because he affected the interests of a construction company that the Gulf cartel was sponsoring. Moreover, Exc√©lsior notes that Torre Cant√∫ was also killed because he did not have a good relationship with Yarrington and did not guarantee agreements with the cartels. However, Egidio Torre Cant√∫, the brother of Rodolfo, took his place and became the governor of Tamaulipas after his assassination, and allied with the Mexican Armed Forces to combat the cartels in hopes of avoiding what happened to his brother. Yarrington was also accused of allegedly receiving money from Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former drug boss of the Gulf cartel, to finance his political campaign for the presidential campaign in 2005 against Roberto Madrazo; according to the reports of Animal Pol√≠tico, Osiel asked Costilla S√°nchez and Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, his associates, to send millions of dollars to Yarrington's collaborators, with hopes of escaping from prison if Yarrington became president, just like Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera (a.k.a. El Chapo). In a civil forfeiture lawsuit filed in Corpus Christi on 12 May 2012, Yarrington is said to face forfeiture of a condominium he owns in South Padre Island that federal authorities believe he purchased with \\"illegally obtained funds\\" and under another name to avoid detection by law enforcement. Court records say that Yarrington used $450,000 from the Gulf cartel to pay the 14th floor unit. The indictment also alleged that a Mexican businessman known as Fernando Alejandro Cano Mart√≠nez used several corporate entities in Texas to launder money by the Gulf Cartel to pay top politicians in Tamaulipas. These bribes were then paid to the politicians in Tamaulipas in exchange for little to no police intervention in the Gulf Cartel's trafficking and money laundering activities. Cano Mart√≠nez is also accused of bank fraud because he obtained several bank loans with false information. The U.S. authorities are trying to confiscate Yarrington's condominium in South Padre Island and a 46-acre property in San Antonio, Texas. All these properties are believed to have been bought by Yarrington with drug proceeds from the Gulf Cartel, a criminal organization headquartered in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas (where he served as mayor). The laundered money is believed to have granted the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas \\"political influence\\" in the state of Tamaulipas. Nonetheless, Yarrington has publicly acknowledged that he is subject of the probe but denied any links to organized crime. Yarrington's lawyer, in addition, said that the ex-governor has no connection with organized crime, and that the accusations against him are attempts made by other people in federal investigations to \\"improve their own situations.\\" Yarrington has not been officially charged with any crimes, but U.S. federal prosecutors filed two civil forfeiture cases against him, seeking to seize more than $7 million U.S. dollars in properties. =Yarrington's associates= Fernando Alejandro Cano Mart√≠nez, a businessman from Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, and an alleged financial operator of the Gulf cartel, was indicted for conspiracy to launder money and commit bank fraud on 22 May 2012. The indictment charges Cano Mart√≠nez with using a number of corporations in Texas to launder money for the Gulf Cartel, a drug trafficking organization in Mexico, to then using millions of dollars as bribes for politicians in Tamaulipas. The bribes, which were paid directly to the politicians since 1998 or earlier, were used to convince the authorities to not intervene in the illegal activities of the Gulf cartel. Cano-Mart√≠nez controlled the bribes directed to the politicians, and established corporal entities in Texas to hide the nature of his criminal activities. Court records show that he had \\"one or more unindicted co-conspirators\\" working with him that helped him obtain a $6.7 million loan to buy a 46-acre property in San Antonio, Texas. Prosecutors are seeking a $40 million forfeiture from Cano-Mart√≠nez's assets. The indictment also alleges that Cano Mart√≠nez used millions of dollars in loans from a number of U.S. banks to invest in real estate and for an airplane of his own. From the years 2007 and 2009, Cano Mart√≠nez and his associates used at least 10 different bank accounts in Mexico to move millions of dollars to a Mexican money transmitter, and then moved that cash to U.S. bank accounts. If convicted, Cano Mart√≠nez may face up to 20 years in prison for the money laundering charges against him. Warrants have been issued for his apprehension in both the U.S. and Mexico, since he is currently at large. On 24 May 2012, the Mexican military raided the house and workplace of the Mexican businessman Napole√≥n Rodr√≠guez de la Garza in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Rodr√≠guez was the treasurer of Yarrington during his time as mayor of Matamoros and the straw man purchaser of the condominium in South Padre Island, Texas. The condo was bought under Rodr√≠guez to avoid detection from federal agents, but prosecutors believe Yarrington is the actual owner. They also allege that Yarrington gave the money back after Rodr√≠guez bought the $450,000 condo and that Yarrington pays the annual taxes and fees for maintenance. In addition, Rodr√≠guez is believed to have assisted Yarrington during his political campaigns and received contracts to supply Matamoros and the state of Tamaulipas with supplies from his hardware company. Rodr√≠guez was taken to SIEDO for further questioning; he was detained by the PGR on 28 May 2012 and will remain under custody for 40 days. Nonetheless, he accepted to be a straw purchaser for Yarrington. The U.S. authorities began the investigation of other functionaries that worked for the ex-governor of Tamaulipas and close associate of Yarrington, Eugenio Hern√°ndez Flores. According to government reports, a man known as Alberto Berlanga Bolado ‚Äì owner of the GMC, SA de CV and former functionary during Hernandez's time in office, was linked to money laundering and bribes from the Gulf cartel on 26 May 2012. Berlanga's construction company was one of the most prominent during Hern√°ndez's governorship, and served as the major contract seller for public works at a state and federal level. During the investigation, the DEA raided an office with the insignias \\"GMC\\" in San Antonio, Texas the night of 22 May 2012. In another case in the city of Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, on 29 May 2012, the Mexican authorities detained Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Berlanga (La Conga), the owner of Constructora Janambres SA de CV and alleged money launderer and straw purchaser of Yarrington. He reportedly owns several ranches with over 4,940 acres (2,000 hectares), including one with an airstrip. The Mexican military also raided the houses and workplaces of Yarrington and his associates' in Ciudad Victoria and Matamoros, Tamaulipas: the properties of Cano-Mart√≠nez, the alleged money launderer; of Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Berlanga, former employee of Yarrington; and of Faruk Faterni Corcuera, associate of the ex-governor. Rodr√≠guez de la Garza's property was raided along with Yarrington's home in the city of Matamoros. In another incident early in the morning on 30 May 2012 in the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, several banners appeared throughout the city blaming Francisco Garc√≠a Cabeza de Vaca, the former mayor of Reynosa and current candidate for the Senate of Mexico, for being one of Yarrington's associates. The banner linked Cabeza de Vaca with other people who are investigated by the U.S. authorities for money laundering, including Manuel Bribiesca and Antonio Pe√±a Arg√ºelles. The banners also stated that Yarrington helped Cabeza de Vaca become mayor of Reynosa. In addition, Cabeza de Vaca is believed to have favored Cano Martinez's construction companies during his time as mayor; Pe√±a Arg√ºelles declared in front of the U.S. authorities that he had a close connection with the mayor. The National Action Party (PAN), however, claimed that the banners were put up by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) because Cabeza de Vaca (the PAN candidate for the Senate) is leading the elections and above Manuel Cavazos Lerma, a member of the PRI who is also running for a seat in the Senate too. =Suspension from the PRI= Following the accusations he is facing for allegedly accepting bribes from the Gulf Cartel during his time as governor, Yarrington was suspended from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) on 23 May 2012. He will remain suspended from the party until all the accusations against him are cleared up. The PRI distanced itself from Yarrington and said that it will not defend a former governor accused of accepting millions of dollars in bribes from drug trafficking organizations. Below is the statement issued by the PRI, translated from Spanish: Los Angeles Times states that these drug trafficking charges may \\"summon the ghosts\\" of the PRI's corrupt and dark past. It may remind the Mexican voters of the grafts that marked the party's rule before it was tossed from the presidency in the year 2000 after seven decades of near- absolute regime control. The PRI's rule ‚Äì which lasted for 71 years ‚Äì was seen as \\"tainted by corruption,\\" and critics have accused the PRI of making deals with the cartels to maintain peace in the country. Mexico's vast criminal underworld and illegal drug trafficking industry took hold during the reign of the PRI, often with the help of corrupt officials. =SIEDO investigations= According to the investigations of the SIEDO, Yarrington received more than $8.5 million from the Gulf Cartel and the Ju√°rez Cartel in eleven separate payments to finance his campaign for Governor of Tamaulipas in 1998. The agency report, issued on 1 August 2012, indicates that a political campaign manager of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) personally met with several cartel leaders because they \\"needed the money.\\" In exchange, the drug trafficking organizations received protection from Tamaulipas' police. Arrest A Mexican judge ordered the arrest of Yarrington on 29 August 2012; the Interpol was searching his whereabouts in over 150 countries. He was finally arrested in Florence, Italy, on 9 April 2017. Personal life Yarrington was born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. He is married to Maria Antonieta Morales and has two children: Mar√≠a Antonieta and Tom√°s Antonio. In addition, during Yarrington's time as mayor of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, he developed a close friendship with George W. Bush, former governor of Texas and ex- president of the United States.

Shehan and Mancasola were two high school friends studying at the University of California, Davis. Guitarist Jason Bokros and bass guitarist Rod Meyer completed the line-up. In 1994, the band recorded a single for the independent label Goldenrod Records and signed with Alias Records later that year. Their first album, Silver Sweepstakes, was released in 1995. They then toured extensively playing with bands such as Pavement, Rocket from the Crypt, Jawbox and Drive Like Jehu. Bokros left the group before the release of their second album, Day Three of My New Life, in 1997. Rod Meyer left the group after this release and was replaced by Sergie Loobkoff of Samiam. Their third album, This Conversation is Ending Starting Right Now, was released in 1998. Shehan went on to form The Jealous Sound after the band broke up in 2000. Knapsack reunited in fall 2013 to mark the 15th anniversary of their final US tour. The band played several shows, including a stop at the Fest, in Gainesville, Florida, making this their first-ever Florida appearance. However, according to Blair Shehan, and Groezrock festival in Belgium in 2015, Knapsack has no plans to release new music.

The town was a stop on the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela - a local cross marking the way is shown at . It belonged to the seigneurie of Montlu√ßon at the beginning of the 13th century but when the le Bourbonnais (part of the Massif Central essentially co-terminous with the modern Allier) became a Duchy in 1327 it passed into of the hands of the Bourbons.

An acoustic song, it was recorded live in early 1978 at the Boarding House in San Francisco, California. Combined with its hard rock counterpart \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\\", it bookends Young's 1979 album Rust Never Sleeps. Inspired by electropunk group Devo, the rise of punk and what Young viewed as his own growing irrelevance, the song significantly revitalized Young's career. The line, \\"it's better to burn out than to fade away,\\" became infamous after being quoted in Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide note. Young later said that he was so shaken that he dedicated his 1994 album Sleeps with Angels to Cobain.  Legacy  Young compared the rise of Johnny Rotten with that of the recently deceased \\"King\\" Elvis Presley, who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an icon. Rotten returned the favour by playing one of Young's songs, \\"Revolution Blues\\" from On the Beach, on a London radio show, an early sign of Young's eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians. The song may best be known for the line \\"It's better to burn out than to fade away\\" (actually only spoken in full in the acoustic \\"My My, Hey Hey\\" and the Human Highway film recording ). Kurt Cobain's suicide note ended with the same line, shaking Young and inadvertently cementing his place as the so-called \\"Godfather of Grunge\\". Ex-Beatle John Lennon commented on the message of the song in a 1980 interview with David Sheff from Playboy: Young would reply two years later when asked to respond to Lennon's comments: > The rock'n'roll spirit is not survival. Of course the people who play > rock'n'roll should survive. But the essence of the rock'n'roll spirit to me, > is that it's better to burn out really bright than to sort of decay off into > infinity. Even though if you look at it in a mature way, you'll think, > \\"well, yes ... you should decay off into infinity, and keep going along\\". > Rock'n'roll doesn't look that far ahead. Rock'n'roll is right now. What's > happening right this second. Is it bright? Or is it dim because it's waiting > for tomorrow‚Äîthat's what people want to know. And that's why I say that. Oasis covered the song on their 2000 world tour, including it on their live album and DVD Familiar to Millions. The band acknowledged Cobain's attachment to the song by dedicating it to him when they played it in Seattle on the sixth anniversary of his death.Retrieved December 15, 2007 Scottish band Big Country recorded a version, which can be heard on their Under Covers album, and the remastered edition of their live album Without the Aid of a Safety Net. It is also used as live-intro to System of a Down's \\"Kill Rock 'n Roll\\" in some live performances. It is included on Neil Young's Greatest Hits album. Many other bands and singers have played or recorded covers of this song: System of a Down (Festival of Hurricane in 2005), Dave Matthews Band, Cross Canadian Ragweed, Battleme (closing track of the Sons of Anarchy Season 3 finale), Rick Derringer, Nomeansno (FUBAR soundtrack), Mexican rock & roll band El Tri, Finnish glam rock band Negative, Argentine rock band La Renga, Chromatics, Jake Bugg (played live at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival), Axel Rudi Pell on his 2014 album Into the Storm. Romanian act Fjord covered the song for their 2016 album Textures. Brazilian doom metal band HellLight recorded a version for an album of covers (The Light That Brought Darkness in 2012). Blixa Bargeld and Teho Teardo covered the song on their 2017 album Fall. The song is the title theme of Dennis Hopper's movie Out of the Blue. The song was included at number 93 in Bob Mersereau's book The Top 100 Canadian Singles (2010). =Quotations= Courtney Love, singer for Hole and Cobain's widow, alludes both to this song and her husband's suicide note in the song \\"Reasons To Be Beautiful\\" from the album Celebrity Skin. In \\"Reasons To Be Beautiful,\\" she changes the verse to \\"It's better to rise than fade away.\\" Def Leppard begins their song \\"Rock of Ages\\" with the lines \\"I got something to say / It's better to burn out than fade away\\"; the same lines were used in the movie Highlander by The Kurgan and used in the Queen song \\"Gimme The Prize (Kurgan's Theme)\\" on their A Kind Of Magic album. Metalcore band Killswitch Engage have quoted the line in their song \\"New Awakening\\". The lyrics of the song, in particular \\"out of the blue and into the black\\", are an epigraph and also a prominent feature in Stephen King's It. Lana Del Rey mentions the song through the lyrics \\"out of the black, into the blue\\" on her song \\"Get Free\\" from her fifth studio album Lust for Life (Lana Del Rey album).

Instead of mechanical buttons, the touch-sensitive topshell (mentioned below) and the pressure- sensing trackball allow the mouse to detect which side is being touched or whether the trackball is being held in. The mouse emits a faint clicking sound when the scroll ball is rolled or the side squeeze sensors are depressed, but this is not directly caused by the ball moving or side buttons being pressed; the sound is actually produced by a tiny speaker inside the mouse.MacDailyNews. Apple's new 'Mighty Mouse' provides audio feedback for clicking and scrolling. There is no way to disable this feature other than physically disabling the speaker inside the mouse.Macworld. Apple Mighty Mouse Input Device Review. See the last paragraph under the \\"All those buttons\\" section. Currently, Mac OS X is the only operating system that fully supports the mouse without third-party software. When used with Mac OS X, the sensors can be set to launch applications or trigger features of the Apple operating system, such as Dashboard and Expos√©. If not used with Mac OS X, the mouse behaves as a four \\"button\\" mouse with a vertical and horizontal scroll wheel. There are third-party drivers (XMouse, AppleMAppleM Pro - Ê®™„Çπ„ÇØ„É≠„Éº„É´ÂØæÂøú „Éû„Ç§„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„Éû„Ç¶„Çπ(Mighty Mouse)„ÅÆ„Éâ„É©„Ç§„Éê ) that provide more functions to users of other platforms such as Windows. The Mighty Mouse does not report whether the right and left sensors are activated simultaneously. In fact, it reports a right- click only when there is no finger contact on the left side of the mouse. Thus a right-click requires lifting the finger off the mouse, then right-clicking. This also means that the Mighty Mouse cannot support mouse chording, used by CAD software, games, and other applications where multiple functions are mapped to the mouse.  Versions and sell dates  * On August 2, 2005, Apple introduced Mighty Mouse, at the suggested retail price of US$49. * On October 12, 2005, Apple began shipping a Mighty Mouse with every iMac, and on October 19, 2005, with the PowerMac G5 line as well. The user has a choice to upgrade to an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Apple Wireless Mouse. The only option to not purchase this mouse offered at the time was with the Mac Mini. * On July 25, 2006, Apple released a wireless Mighty Mouse (part numbers MA272LL/A and MB111LL/A) which uses Bluetooth 2.0. The new version uses two AA batteries, but can run on a single AA battery to reduce weight. Wireless Mighty Mouse was priced at $69. * On August 7, 2007, Apple slightly updated the Mighty Mouse, changing the color of the squeeze areas to white. As of September 2009, the wired version of the Mighty Mouse costs $49, while the wireless version costs $69. * On October 20, 2009, Apple was forced to rename the Mighty Mouse the Apple Mouse (part number MB112LL/A) due to legal issues regarding the name. This version of mouse was continued to bundle with Mac Pro till July 27, 2010, when new models included the Magic Mouse. ** On the same day, Apple announced and released a completely new mouse called the Apple Magic Mouse, built with an aluminum base with a multitouch panel. Like the trackpads on the Macbooks, this new version also introduced new interface gestures. This version uses two AA batteries and was priced at $69.  Technical features  * Touch-sensitive top shell * Trackball * Force-sensing side \\"squeeze\\" areas * Optical (LED) tracking (wired version) * Laser tracking (wireless version) * Compatible with Macintosh, Windows, and Linux PCs * Programmable functions for the four \\"buttons\\" * Auditory feedback with built-in speaker\\"On the bottom half of the mouse, we observed the presence of a speaker\\" from Dissecting Mighty MouseVideo showing presence of speaker on wireless version of the mouse:  Criticism  Although the Mighty Mouse can sense both right and left clicks, it is not possible to press both sensors simultaneously. The user must learn to lift the left finger off the sensor surface before attempting a right-mouse click. The scroll ball will eventually become clogged with dirt and require cleaning. While there are methods to clean the ball without dismantling the mouse some users have complained that the Mighty Mouse is difficult to clean because the scroll ball mechanism is hard to take apart.  Name  Prior to launching the device, Apple received a license to the name \\"Mighty Mouse\\" from Viacom, and subsequently CBS Operations, as owner of the Mighty Mouse cartoon series, the title having been registered in the US as a trademark with respect to various merchandise (such as T-shirts and multivitamins) associated with the character. However, the trademark did not cover computer peripherals, and CBS did not apply to trademark the term in the US with respect to computer mice until mid-2007.USPTO record for trademark application no. 77224649, filed July 9, 2007, \\"abandoned after an inter partes decision by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board\\" on June 4, 2009 On May 21, 2008, it was announced that Man & Machine Inc., a supplier of keyboards and mice to laboratories and hospitals, had sued Apple Inc. for trademark infringement over its use of the name Mighty Mouse. Man & Machine Inc. had four registered or pending trademarks on various computer pointing related technologies, including \\"Cool Mouse\\", \\"Really Cool\\", and \\"Man and Machine and Design\\". The particular Mighty Mouse trademark in dispute was first filed by Man & Machine Inc., on December 18, 2007, with the description \\"Computer cursor control devices, namely, computer mice\\"‚Äîafter CBS's filing, but claiming first use in 2004, before the introduction of the Apple device. There also was another scroll mouse named Mighty Mouse developed by NTT and ETH Z√ºrich in 1985. Following opposition proceedings on both sides against the other, CBS subsequently withdrew its application, allowing Man & Machine to register the US trademark for computer mice.PCWorld. \\"Apple Mighty Mouse Caught in Trademark Trap.\\" October 9, 2009. As a result, Apple stopped selling mice under the \\"Mighty Mouse\\" name on October 20, 2009, when it introduced the wireless Magic Mouse and renamed the existing wired mouse the \\"Apple Mouse\\". Incidentally, CBS was successful in registering \\"Mighty Mouse\\" as a trademark for computer mice in some other countries, including Canada, although Apple nevertheless chose to change its product name internationally.

The freeway connects Interstate 94 (I-94), County Road 81 (CR 81), and CR 130 in northern Hennepin County to U.S. Highway 10 (US 10) in southern Anoka County. MN 610 crosses the Mississippi River on the Richard P. Braun Bridge between suburban Brooklyn Park and Coon Rapids. The highway is long. The freeway was authorized in 1975, and most of the sections were completed by 2000 (); the section westward to CR 81 in Maple Grove was completed and opened in 2011. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) opened the last segment extending to I-94 on December 9, 2016. Route description MN 610 starts at a partial interchange with I-94/US 52 in Maple Grove; eastbound traffic on I-94/southbound US 52 can exit to MN 610, and westbound traffic on MN 610 merges onto westbound I-94/northbound US 52. From there, the freeway continues eastward through an interchange with Maple Grove Parkway, and it turns southeasterly to its interchange with CR 81 in Maple Grove. From this point, the freeway runs eastbound through the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities. MN 610 is four lanes in width and has several interchanges with local streets and county roads before expanding to six lanes and meeting the northern terminus of MN 252 on the west bank of the Mississippi River. After MN 252 interchange, the MN 610 freeway turns to the northeast and crosses the Mississippi River on the dual-span, eight-lane Richard P. Braun Bridge. Across the river, the freeway runs along the south side of the Coon Rapids Dam Regional Park before curving around to the east. It continues through suburban Coon Rapids as a six-lane freeway to a partial interchange with northbound MN 47\\\\. This interchange is used by eastbound traffic transitioning to westbound US 10\\\\. The final section east to US 10 in Blaine is four lanes. The second interchange along this section of the freeway with University Avenue is used to connect with MN 47 southbound. The last interconnected interchange is at the eastern terminus as traffic defaults onto US 10 eastbound. Legally, MN 610 is defined as Route 333 in the Minnesota Statutes ¬ß 161.115(264). The highway is not marked with this legislative route number along the actual highway. The entire route of MN 610 has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar with other dignitaries breaking ground on the MN 610 extension MN 610 was proposed in the middle of the 1960s as a \\"North Crosstown\\" freeway. Studies for the highway started in the 1970s. The highway was first authorized on June 2, 1975. The westbound span of the Mississippi River bridge was built in 1985, and, along with the existing freeway east of MN 252, was opened in October 1987. Officials in Minnesota proposed tolls as a means to fund the construction on the highway in 1989. Local officials supported the highway construction, but opposed the tolling plans. West of MN 252, the freeway construction started in June 1997. The freeway was opened to traffic in 2000, with a traffic light at the intersection of MN 610 and US 169 initially. Construction on the second bridge over the Mississippi River for eastbound traffic started in 1999, to be completed in 2002. Construction of the portion between US 169 and CR 81 was estimated to cost $48 million in 2010, of which $27 million is being funded by federal stimulus money. The project began in October 2009, and it was scheduled to be completed in July 2011. The remainder of the highway to I-94 was not on a MnDOT schedule to be built. The new western terminus was to be located at Elm Creek Boulevard in Maple Grove. The freeway continued westward from this point in the median of CR 81, but this section was to be an unused stub end past the ramps that connect to CR 81 During the 2011 Minnesota state government shutdown, construction on MN 610 was halted for 20 days. Until work stopped on July 1, 2011, a ribbon-cutting ceremony had been scheduled to open the new freeway section on July 12. The ribbon cutting ceremony was on August 17 and the road opened on August 19. MN 610 was originally planned to extend west to I-94 in Maple Grove, and the freeway's mile markers reflected these plans, with the zero point calibrated to this terminus. A portion of this section is very unusual; it is routed down the middle of the median of CR 81 in Maple Grove, forming a roadway within a roadway. On April 4, 2016, construction started on an interchange with Maple Grove Parkway. The final segment to I-94 opened on December 9, 2016. Future MnDOT officials have plans to extend MN 610 westward to connect to CR 30 in Corcoran, and officials are working to secure funding to build the missing ramps at the I-94/US 52 interchange.

Forsyth, (1848‚Äì1921) was a Scottish theologian.  Biography  The son of a postman, Forsyth studied at the University of Aberdeen and then in G√∂ttingen (under Albrecht Ritschl). He was ordained into the Congregational ministry and served churches as pastor at Bradford, Manchester, Leicester and Cambridge, before becoming Principal of Hackney College, London (later subsumed into the University of London) in 1901.  Theology  An early interest in critical theology made him suspect to some more 'orthodox' Christians. However, he increasingly came to the conclusion that liberal theology failed to account adequately for the moral problem of the guilty conscience. This led him to a moral crisis which he found resolved in the atoning work of Christ. The experience helped to shape and inform a vigorous interest in the issues of holiness and atonement. Although Forsyth rejected many of his earlier liberal leanings he retained many of Adolf von Harnack's criticisms of Chalcedonian Christology. This led him to expound a kenotic doctrine of the incarnation (clearly influenced by Bishop Charles Gore and Thomasius). Where he differed from other kenotic theologies of the atonement was the claim that Christ did not give up his divine attributes but condensed them; i.e., the incarnation was the expression of God's omnipotence rather than its negation. His theology and attack on liberal Christianity can be found in his most famous work, The Person and Place of Christ (1909), which anticipated much of the neo-orthodox theology of the next generation. He has sometimes been coined the 'Barthian before Barth', but this fails to account for many areas of divergence with the Swiss theologian's thought. While many of Forsyth's most significant insights have largely gone ignored, not a few consider him to be among the greatest of English-speaking theologians of the early twentieth century. In his Christian Theology: An Introduction, Alister E. McGrath describes Forsyth's Justification of God (1916). The book > represents an impassioned plea to allow the notion of the ‚Äújustice of God‚Äù > to be rediscovered. Forsyth is less concerned than Anselm for the legal and > juridical aspects of the cross; his interest centers on the manner in which > the cross is inextricably linked with ‚Äúthe whole moral fabric and movement > of the universe.‚Äù The doctrine of the atonement is inseparable from ‚Äúthe > rightness of things.‚ÄùAlister E. McGrath, Christian Theology: An Introduction > (Wiley-Blackwell, 5th ed, 2010), 330. Also see McGrath, Historical Theology: > An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought (Wiley-Blackwell, 2nd > edition, 2012), 227. In his Theology and the Problem of Evil, Kenneth Surin points to Forsyth's Justification of God as offering a theodicy based on the cross. God can be justified for creating a world with so much pain and suffering ‚Äúonly if he were prepared to share the burden of pain and suffering with his creatures.‚Äù Surin concurs with Forsyth.Quoted in Kenneth Surin, Theology and the Problem of Evil (Basil Blackwell, 2004), 67, as cited in Karen Kilby, ‚ÄúEvil and the Limits of Theology,‚Äù Theologyphilosphycentre.co.uk, Accessed October 23, 2009.

Encyclopedia.com. (January 10, 2010). http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-WW1.html. \\"To calculate the total losses caused by the war is impossible. About 10 million dead and 20 million wounded is a conservative estimate. Starvation and epidemics raised the total in the immediate postwar years.\\" Through the lens of biblical faith, Forsyth saw even ‚Äúa world catastrophe and judgment of the first rank like the war‚Äù as ‚Äústill in the hand and service of God.‚Äù Forsyth, The Justification of God, 11. Before the start of World War I, widely held views about God and human progress muted the theodic question. ‚ÄúPopular religion‚Äù had preached a God whose sole purpose was ‚Äúto promote and crown [human] development.‚ÄùForsyth, The Justification of God, 25. The ‚Äúdoctrine of progress‚Äù (first formulated by Abb√© de Saint-Pierre) dominated Europe.Christopher Dawson, Progress and Religion: An Historical Inquiry (Sheed and Ward, 1929; reprint Catholic University of America, 2001), 3. As Forsyth observed, but the war's ‚Äúrevelation of the awful and desperate nature of evil‚Äù exploded these optimistic views and raised the theodic question about the goodness of God to full force.Forsyth, The Justification of God, 28. There was no theodicy extant to which Forsyth could turn. In spite of his extensive theological studies, he could find no satisfactory ‚Äúphilosophical theodicy or vindication of God's justice.‚ÄùForsyth, The Justification of God, v. From this, Forsyth concluded that \\"no reason of man can justify God in a world like this. He must justify Himself, and He did so in the Cross of His Son.\\"Forsyth, The Justification of God, 122. Forsyth began formulating what he called \\"God's own theodicy\\"Forsyth, The Justification of God, 6. with Romans 1:17: \\"the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith\\". There he found the righteousness of God revealed in the Christ who \\"is the theodicy of God and the justifier both of God and the ungodly.\\"Forsyth, The Justification of God, 169. > [Christ] brings God's providence to the bar of God‚Äôs own promise. In Christ, > God is fully justified by Himself. If any man thinks he has anything to > suffer in the flesh, God more. In all their afflictions He was more > afflicted.Forsyth, The Justification of God, 130. For Forsyth, \\"God's own theodicy\\" stood in contrast to theodicies devised by humans.Forsyth, The Justification of God, 14. God's own theodicy provided Forsyth no philosophical answers to why in God's \\"creation must the way upward lie through suffering?\\"Forsyth, The Justification of God, 136. \\"The tactics of providence cannot be traced,\\" but \\"His purpose we have, and His heart. We have Him.\\"Forsyth, The Justification of God, 23. God's own theodicy is a theodicy of reconciliation and relationship, a theodicy that enables trust in God in spite of unanswered questions. Forsyth's understanding of \\"God's own theodicy\\" as enabling a right relationship with God rather than a philosophical justification of God correlates with the two connotations of the word theodicy. Theodicy derives from the Greek words theos and dikƒì. Theos is translated ‚ÄúGod.‚Äù Dikƒì can be translated as either (a) just (and its derivatives justice, justified) or (b) right (and its derivatives righteousness, righteoused). Righteoused is an obsolete verb meaning ‚Äúmade righteous.‚ÄùWebster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913), s.v. ‚Äúrighteoused.‚Äù Online at http://dictionary.die.net/righteoused.

The Scythians and their allies the Rhoxolanoi suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Pontic general Diophantus and accepted Mithridates as their overlord.Philip Matyzak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp 13-18 The young king then turned his attention to Asia Minor, where Roman power was on the rise. He contrived to partition Paphlagonia and Galatia with King Nicomedes III of Bithynia. Yet it soon became clear to Mithridates that Nicomedes was steering his country into an anti-Pontic alliance with the expanding Roman Republic. When Mithridates fell out with Nicomedes over control of Cappadocia, and defeated him in a series of battles, the latter was constrained to openly enlist the assistance of Rome. The Romans twice interfered in the conflict on behalf of Nicomedes (95‚Äì92 BC), leaving Mithridates, should he wish to continue the expansion of his kingdom, with little choice other than to engage in a future Roman-Pontic war. By this time Mithridates had resolved to expel the Romans from Asia.Philip Matyzak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp 19-24 The next ruler of Bithynia, Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, was a figurehead manipulated by the Romans. Mithridates plotted to overthrow him, but his attempts failed and Nicomedes IV, instigated by his Roman advisors, declared war on Pontus. Rome itself was involved in the Social War, a civil war with its Italian allies. Thus, in all of Roman Asia Province there were few Roman troops available. The Romans therefore mustered a great number of Asian levies and combined with Nicomedes' army they invaded Mithridates' kingdom in 89 BC. Mithridates won a decisive victory, scattering the Roman-led forces. His victorious forces were welcomed throughout Asia Minor. The following year, 88 BC, Mithridates orchestrated a massacre of Roman and Italian settlers remaining in several Anatolian cities, essentially wiping out the Roman presence in the region. 80,000 people are said to have perished in this massacre. The episode is known as the Asiatic Vespers.Philip Matyzak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp 25-47 The Romans responded by organising a large invasion force (this time sending their own legions) to defeat him and remove him from power. The First Mithridatic War, fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, saw Lucius Cornelius Sulla force Mithridates out of Greece proper. After being victorious in several battles Sulla, being declared an outlaw by his political opponents in Rome, hurriedly concluded peace talks with Mithridates. As Sulla returned to Italy Lucius Licinius Murena was left in charge of Roman forces in Anatolia. The lenient peace treaty, which was never ratified by the Senate, allowed Mithridates VI to restore his forces. Murena attacked Mithridates in 83 BC, provoking the Second Mithridatic War from 83 BC to 81 BC. Mithridates defeated Murena's two green legions at the Battle of Halys in 82 BC before peace was again declared by treaty.Philip Matyzak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp 57-100 Prelude The period between the Second and Third wars of Rome and the Pontic Kingdom (81‚Äì75 BC) is discussed under the Kingdom of Pontus. There it can be seen how the long piracy wars were a development out of the First Mithridatic War and especially of the alliance between Mithridates VI and Sertorius, which in joining those two threats into a unity much larger than its parts had the serious potential of overturning Roman power. The immediate cause of the Third War was the bequest to Rome by King Nicomedes IV of Bithynia of his kingdom upon his death (74 BC). Mithridates, who had been rebuilding his forces, launched an invasion of Bithynia.Philip Matyzak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp 101-102  Forces and initial deployments, 74‚Äì73 BC  Having launched an attack at the same time as a revolt by Sertorius swept through the Spanish provinces, Mithridates was initially virtually unopposed. The Senate responded by sending the consuls Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Marcus Aurelius Cotta to deal with the Pontic threat. The only other possible general for such an important command, Pompey, was in Hispania to help Metellus Pius crush the revolt led by Sertorius. Lucullus was sent to govern Cilicia and Cotta to Bithynia.Anthon, Charles & Smith, William, A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography, 1860, pg. 226 According to Appian and Plutarch Lucullus had 30,000 infantry and 1,600-2,500 cavalry while Mithridates was rumoured to have as many as 300,000 men in his force.Appian, Mithridatica, XI.72; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 8. The original plan was that Cotta should tie down Mithridates' fleet, while Lucullus attacked by land. Cotta was therefore ordered to station his fleet at Chalcedon, while Lucullus marched through Phrygia with the intention of invading Pontus. Lucullus had not advanced far when news came through that Mithridates had made a rapid march westward, attacked and defeated Cotta at the Battle of Chalcedon, and forced him to flee behind the walls of Chalcedon. Sixty-four Roman ships had been captured or burnt, and Cotta had lost three thousand men.Holmes, T. Rice, The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire, Vol. I, 1923, pg. 180Appian Mithridates. 71; Plutarch. Lucullus. 8 There Cotta was forced to remain until Lucullus could come to his rescue.T. Robert S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II (1952), pg. 99 Mithridates's defeat in western Asia, 73‚Äì72 BC Having made his way to Nicomedia, Cotta watched in frustration as Mithridates marched on taking Nicaea, Lampsacus, Nicomedia and Apameia, all major cities in the region. Only nearby Cyzicus held to the Roman cause, probably because many of its citizens (serving in Cotta's army as auxiliaries) had died fighting against Mithridates at Chalcedon. The Pontic army marched on Cyzicus and began a siege.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's indomitable Enemy, pp 106-113; Plutarch Life of Lucullus, 8. Lucullus was camped somewhere along the Sangarius river in Bithynia when he received news of Cotta's defeat. His soldiers urged him to leave Cotta to his own folly and march on undefended Pontus with its rich potential for loot. Lucullus ignored them and headed toward Chalcedon. Marcus Marius, a Roman rebel cooperating with Mithridates, blocked and confronted him. They faced off at Otroea near Nicaea (present-day Iznik).Keaveney, Lucullus, p. 77. Although Lucullus commanded 30,000 infantry and 2,500 horse, he was daunted by the size of the opposing army and reluctant to engage. The arrival of an omen, as reported by Plutarch, was thus fortuitous:Plutarch, Lucullus 8. No battle occurred. For Marius, delay posed a logistical problem. He had only a few days of supplies for his troops. Lucullus learned of the shortage through prisoner interrogations and decided to wait him out. Marius was forced to move on without the fight he had sought. =The Siege of Cyzicus= While Mithridates was besieging Cyzicus, Lucullus and his army arrived; the Romans, with the help of some turncoats, were able to establish a counter-siege, trapping Mithridates' army on the Cyzicus peninsula. During the siege Mithridates sent his cavalry away, with the sick and the wounded, but they were ambushed and slaughtered at the river Rhyndacus. In the middle of a snowstorm, Lucullus met these forces with ten cohorts and attacked them in mid-crossing on both sides of the river. Plutarch and Appian record 15,000 men and 6,000 horses as being captured during the battle.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, p. 60; Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, p. 112. The disaster at the Rhyndacus combined with the famine and a plague which had struck his main army forced Mithridates to completely abandon his position, sailing north while his army marched overland. Lucullus pursued the army and defeated them at the confluence of the Aesepus and Granicus Rivers, slaughtering many (20,000 were killed while crossing the river Granicus). Eventually, of the 300,000 who had set out for Bithynia, only 20,000 effective troops remained. The siege of Cyzicus and the subsequent retreat could be considered an unmitigated disaster.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp 112-113. =The naval campaign= Marcus Marius, having survived the Cyzicus campaign, had taken to the sea. Along with Mithridates's admirals Alexandros the Paphlagonian and Dionysios Eunuchos (\\"the Eunuch\\"), he was placed in joint command of 50 ships and 10,000 handpicked men, among them, in the words of Mommsen, \\"the flower of the Roman emigrants.\\"Theodor Mommsen, The History of Rome, vol. 4, p. 329. Their intention seems to have been to sail east into the Aegean, but Lucullus mounted an attack against them. He captured a detachment of 13 ships between the island of Tenedos and the mainland harbor of the Achaeans. The main Pontic force, however, had drawn their ships to shore at a site difficult of approach, the small island of Neae between Lemnos and Scyros; Lucullus then sent infantry by land across Neae to their rear, killing many and forcing the rest back to sea.Keaveney, Lucullus, p. 85. Lucullus sunk or captured 32 ships of the royal fleet provided by Mithradates and additional transport vessels. Dionysios committed suicide, but Alexandros was captured and held for display in Lucullus's anticipated triumph. Among the dead were a number of men who had been on Sulla's proscription lists. Marius at first escaped, possibly from a sinking ship, since he was later found ashore taking refuge in a cave.Orosius 6.2.21‚Äì22. Like Sertorius himself, Marius at some point had lost an eye; when Lucullus gave the order to track down enemy survivors, he specified that no one-eyed men should be killed, so that he could personally oversee the renegade's death: \\"Lucullus wished Marius to die under the most shameful insults.\\"Plutarch, Lucullus 12.5. Orosius reports that he atoned for his rebellious spirit with penalties he earned.Orosius 6.2.2. While Lucullus and Cotta prepared to invade Pontus, Mithridates gained control of the strategically important city of Heraclea Pontica and garrisoned it with 4,000 men.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror p. 159; Memnon, History of Heraclea, 29. Hearing of the situation at Heraclea, Lucullus and Cotta decided that Cotta would march on Heraclea while Lucullus would move through the Galatian highlands and invade Pontus from there.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror p. 159. Lucullus's invasion and conquest of Pontus 71‚Äì69 BC In 72 BC, while Cotta moved against Heraclea and Triarius managed naval affairs, Lucullus marched his army through Galatia and into Pontus. The Galatians were only too happy to supply the Romans because they detested Mithridates and were keen to see the Roman legions pass through their country without being plundered.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 14. Once Lucullus was in the Pontic heartland and he let his troops plunder the rich and fertile area. Mithridates could do nothing to stop the despoiling of his lands for he had to rebuild his army. He eventually assembled 40,000 men (4,000 cavalry) near Cabira and waited for Lucullus.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 119; Appian, Mithridatica, 78. =Themiscyra= Upon entering Pontus, Lucullus lay siege to Themiscyra, the legendary home of the amazons, on the River Thermodon. Lucullus's forces erected siege towers and dug great tunnel passages underneath the walls; the tunnels were so large that significant battles were fought underground. The Themiscyrans are said to have introduced bears, other large animals, and even swarms of bees into the subterranean passages to fight off Lucullus's men.Fratantuono, Lucullus, p. 64; Appian, Mithridatica, XI.78. =Cabira= After careful manoeuvering Lucullus occupied an old fortress on the heights overlooking Cabira. This was a secure and very defensible position, but its location meant the Romans were cut off from their recent conquests in Pontus and their supply lines now had to come north from Cappadocia, a Roman ally to the south of Pontus. Since Mithridates dominated the countryside, Lucullus had to send out heavily armed convoys to get supplies. One of those supply convoys, escorted by no less than ten cohorts of infantry (3,000‚Äì5,000 men), under the command of the legate Sornatius was attacked by the Pontic cavalry. The Roman infantry stood their ground and held off the attack inflicting terrible losses on the Pontic horsemen. When a second supply convoy, also heavily armed, under the command of the legate Marcus Fabius Hadrianus made for Lucullus's camp Mithridates decided to use a combined arms (infantry and cavalry) attack. A force of 4,000 cavalry and infantry fell upon the convoy, unfortunately, the Romans realized the narrow valley at the scene limited the effectiveness of their opponents' cavalry and they counter-attacked wiping out half the attacking force.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy p. 121; Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror p. 69. With the Romans re-supplied and his attack-force decimated (c. 2000 casualties) Mithridates decided to retreat. During the preparations for the retreat a panic broke out among his troops, Lucullus became aware of what was happening, mustered his army, and attacked Mithridates's camp at this point the Pontic army broke and disintegrated.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy pp 121-122; Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror p. 69. After the Battle of Cabira, Mithridates fled Pontus, he went to Armenia seeking his son-in-law king Tigranes' support. Joined by Lucullus at Nicomedia in 73 BC, Cotta was assigned the task of securing Lucullus' rear by taking Heraclea Pontica, which Mithridates had reinforced with 4,000 troops.Holmes, T. Rice, The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire, Vol. I, 1923, pg. 184 After reducing the Pontic coast, Cotta began besieging Heraclea itself, which took him two years to complete, sacking the city in 71 BC.T. Robert S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II (1952), pgs. 110, 116 & 122 During this time he was forced to dismiss one of his quaestors, Publius Oppius, charging him with bribery and conspiracy.T. Robert S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II (1952), pg. 110 Lucullus himself consolidated Roman control over Pontus. First returning to the siege of Amisus. =Amisus= With Mithridates out of his reach Lucullus set about consolidating his hold on Pontus. Amisus, an important Greek city in Pontus, was still holding out against Murena whom Lucullus had put in charge of the siege. Mithridates had sent the Greek Callimachus, a master of siege warfare, to Amisus to help with its defence. Callimachus created a number of mechanical defensive devices which gave the Romans a lot of hardships. Lucullus took over from Murena and proved his tactical genius once again by launching an attack at precisely the right time (when Callimachus let his defenders take a rest) and took Amisus, but not without regret; his soldiers ransacked the city and turned it into a ruin. Lucullus, a great admirer of Greek culture, lamented that Sulla had been blessed because he was able to save Athens, while the gods had ordained the faith of Lucius Mummius Achaicus, the destroyer of Corinth, for him.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: The Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, p. 72; Keaveny, Sulla, the Last Republican, p.124. =Sinope= After Amisus Lucullus besieged Sinope, Pontus' main port city, which was also holding out against the Romans. There was significant resistance; the garrison was doing well in defending the coastal city on water as well as land. Lucullus kept up the pressure and finally the defenders gave up, they burned their heavier ships while escaping on lighter vessels. Lucullus granted the city its freedom because the real resistance had not come from the Sinopians themselves but from Cilician troops Mithridates had garrisoned there.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror pp 73-74; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 13; Orosius, Historiae Adversus Paganos, VI 3.2-3.3. While Lucullus stayed in the East, Cotta returned to Rome in 70 BC, where he at first was widely acclaimed for his victory at Heraclea.T. Robert S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II (1952), pg. 127 However, around 67 BC he was accused of appropriation of war booty by Gaius Papirius Carbo. He was convicted of the offence and expelled from the Senate.T. Robert S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II (1952), pgs. 127 & 144 The First Roman- Armenian War, 69‚Äì67 BC After the Battle of Cabira Mithridates fled to his father-in-law Tigranes II the king of the Armenian Empire. Lucullus, busy mopping up resistance in Pontus and Armenia Minor (also part of Mithridates's former dominions), sent his brother-in-law Appius Claudius Pulcher as an emissary to the Armenian king demanding he hand over Mithridates. Since handing over his son-in-law would make him look like nothing more than a puppet of Rome Tigranes had no other choice than to refuse and prepare for war.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, pp 123-125; Lee Frantatuono, Lucullus, p. 77. In the spring of 69 BC Lucullus marched his army from Cappadocia across the Euphrates into Greater Armenia (the Armenian Empire's heartland) and the Roman-Armenian War began.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, p. 126; Lee Frantatuono, Lucullus, p. 77. Tigranes sent one of his nobles, Mithrobarzanes, with 2,000-3,000 cavalry to expel the invader. Mithrobarzanes charged the Romans while they were setting up their camp, but was met by a 3,500-strong sentry force and his horsemen were routed. He perished in the attempt.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, pp 127-128; Lee Frantatuono, Lucullus, pp 83-84; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, XII.84. =Battle of Tigranocerta= Tigranes the Great's empire c. 80 BC. Lucullus began a siege of the new Armenian imperial capital of Tigranocerta in the Arzenene district. Tigranes, with his main host, returned from mopping up a Seleucid rebellion in Syria, and sought battle with the Romans. Lucullus' army annihilated the Armenian host, despite odds of about more than two to one against him. This was the famous battle of Tigranocerta. It was fought on the same (pre-Julian) calendar date as the Roman disaster at Arausio 36 years earlier, the day before the Nones of October according to the reckoning of the time (or October 6),Plutarch Camillus 19.11, Lucullus 27.8-9 which is Julian October 16, 69 BC.See Roman calendar, sub-heading Conversion of pre-Julian dates) Tigranes then retired to the northern regions of his kingdom to gather another army and defend his hereditary capital of Artaxata. Meanwhile, Lucullus moved off south-eastwards to the kingdom of the Kurds (Korduene) on the frontiers of the Armenian and Parthian empires. During the winter of 69-68 BC both sides opened negotiations with the Parthian king, Arsaces XVI, who was presently defending himself against a major onslaught from his rival Phraates III coming from Bactria and the far east. =Battle of Artaxata= In the summer of 68 BC Lucullus marched against Tigranes and crossed the Anti-Taurus range heading for the old Armenian capital Artaxata. Once again Tigranes was provoked to attack and in a major battle at the Aratsani River Lucullus defeated the Armenian army. Soon he left this campaign and when winter came on early in the Armenian tablelands, his troops mutinied, refusing to go further, and he was forced to withdraw southwards back into Arzenene. From there he proceeded back down through Korduene into old Assyria (Northern Mesopotamia) and in the late autumn and early winter besieged Nisibis, the main Armenian fortress city and treasury in Northern Mesopotamia.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, pp 101-104. =Nisibis= The Armenian garrison at Nisibis was under the command of Tigranes's brother Gouras and the Greek defence expert Callimachus. At first Lucullus besieged the city to no avail; it was strongly fortified, with two walls of brick and a moat. But in the winter of 68/67 BC, during a terrible storm ‚Äî when the defenders relaxed their guard ‚Äî Lucullus launched a surprise attack and captured the city and its treasury. It made no difference, Mithridates and Tigranes stuck to their strategy and refused to march against Lucullus; Tigranes was in the process of taking back southern Armenia and Mithridates invaded Pontus.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p. 139; Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, pp. 104‚Äì105; Eutropius, Breviarium, 6.9.1. Mithridates return to Pontus In the spring of 67 BC, while Lucullus was laying siege to Nisibis, Mithridates suddenly returned to Pontus.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, p.140. The Romans had not expected Mithridates to strike at them in Pontus and he caught several small Roman detachments unaware. The legate Gaius Valerius Triarius who was nearby bringing two legions to reinforce Lucullus took command of all Roman forces in Pontus. After several skirmishes and small battles, a major battle took place on a plain near Zela (the Battle of Zela); the Romans were defeated, leaving 7,000 dead, including 24 tribunes and 150 centurions. As a result, Mithridates was back in control of Pontus.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, the Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, p.108; Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp 140-142; Mayor, p. 311; Appian, Mithridatica, 89; Cassius Dio, Roman History, 36.12. During the winter of 68-67 BC, at Nisibis, Lucullus's authority over his army was seriously undermined by the efforts of his young brother-in-law Publius Clodius Pulcher, apparently acting in the interests and pay of Pompey the Great, who was eager to succeed Lucullus in the eastern command. Lucullus was able to persuade his army to march back to Asia Minor to protect Roman interests there, but they refused to march against Mithridates. They were tired of constant campaigning for little profit. They threw their purses at Lucullus's feet and accused him that he was the only one making a personal profit of this war and told him to continue it on his own.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 35. Since his army refused to campaign against Mithridates, Lucullus withdrew to Galatia leaving Mithridates to consolidate his power and rebuild his army in Pontus. In 66 BC, the Senate sent Pompey (who had been lobbying for the command against Mithridates) to succeed Lucullus. The lull allowed Mithridates and Tigranes to retake part of their respective kingdoms. Pompey in command Early in 66 the tribune Gaius Manilius proposed that Pompey should assume supreme command of the war against Mithridates and Tigranes. He should take control from the provincial governors in Asia Minor, have the power to appoint legates himself and the authority to make war and peace and to conclude treaties on his own discretion. The law, the Lex Manilia, was approved by the Senate and the People and Pompey officially took command of the war in the east.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 75; Cicero, Cassius Dio, Roman History, 36.43.2. On the approach of Pompey, Mithridates retreated into the centre of his kingdom trying to stretch and cut off the Roman supply lines but this strategy did not work (Pompey excelled at logistics). Eventually Pompey cornered and defeated the king at the river Lycus (see: battle of Lycus). As Tigranes II of Armenia, his son-in-law, refused to receive him into his dominions (Greater Armenia), Mithridates fled to Colchis, and hence made his way to his own dominions in the Cimmerian Bosporus. Pompey marched against Tigranes, whose kingdom and authority were now severely weakened. Tigranes then sued for peace and met with Pompey to plead a cessation of hostilities. The Armenian Kingdom became an allied client state of Rome. From Armenia, Pompey marched north against the Caucasian tribes and kingdoms who still supported Mithridates. In 65 BC, Pompey had set out in pursuit of Mithridates, meeting opposition from the Albanians who tried to overrun his camps and the Iberians whom he defeated at the battle of the Pelorus. After defeating the Albanians and Iberians he advanced into Colchis as far as Phasis, where he met up with Servilius, the admiral of his Euxine fleet. From Phasis, Pompey marched east again for he had heard the Iberians were gathering their army again, he caught them at the river Abas where he decisively defeated them (see: battle of Abas). =Complete Roman victory= After his defeat by Pompey in 65 BC, Mithridates VI fled with a small army from Colchis to Crimea and attempted to raise yet another army to take on the Romans but failed to do so. In 63 BC, he withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum. His eldest son, Machares, now king of Cimmerian Bosporus, whose kingdom had been reorganized by the Romans, was unwilling to aid his father. Mithridates had Machares murdered and took the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom, intent on retaking Pontus from the Romans. His younger son, Pharnaces II, backed by a disgruntled and war weary populace, led a rebellion against his father. This betrayal, after the decisive defeat in battle, hurt Mithridates more than any other and seeing his loss of authority he attempted suicide by poison. The attempt failed as he had gained immunity to various poisons from taking tiny doses of all available poisons throughout his life to guard against assassination.A History of Rome, LeGlay, et al. 100 According to Appian's Roman History, he then ordered his Gallic bodyguard and friend, Bituitus, to kill him by the sword: Mithridates' body was buried in either Sinope or Amaseia, on the orders of Pompey.

This version was released on 23 February 2015, as part of the remastering process of all nine albums. Led Zeppelin never performed \\"In the Light\\" in concert. Reception In a contemporary review of Physical Graffiti, Jim Miller of Rolling Stone gave \\"In the Light\\" a mixed review, saying that while the track was \\"one of the album's most ambitious efforts\\", the track \\"fizzles down the home stretch.\\" Miller continues \\"the problem here is not tedium but a fragmentary composition that never quite jells: When Page on the final release plays an ascending run intended to sound majestic, the effect is more stilted than stately.\\" In a retrospective review of Physical Graffiti (Deluxe Edition), Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound called \\"In the Light\\" one of his favorite Zeppelin songs; Hadusek believed the song's arrangement \\"shouldn't work, but it does\\". Describing the track, Hadusek said the track \\"erratically builds from solo organs and doom riffs to a cheerful chorus of major scales.\\" In an interview he gave to rock journalist Cameron Crowe, Plant stated that this song was one of Led Zeppelin's \\"finest moments\\".Liner notes by Cameron Crowe for The Complete Studio Recordings.

Kaju means cashew; Barfi is often, but not always, made by thickening milk with sugar and other ingredients (such as dry fruits and mild spices). Kesar kaju katli is a kaju katli recipe that includes saffron. The dish is prepared with cashew nuts soaked in water for a considerable period of time (usually overnight), which are then ground to a paste. Sugar solution is boiled down until a single thread forms when two fingers are dipped into it and pulled apart, after which it is added to the ground cashews kaju. Ghee, saffron (kesar), and dried fruits may also be added. The paste is then spread and flattened in a shallow, flat-bottomed dish and cut into bite-sized diamond-shaped pieces. The pieces are usually decorated with edible silver foil. The finished sweet is usually white or yellow in color depending on the ingredients used for the paste and the proportions of each used. Katli is traditionally eaten during Diwali. Kaju katli can also be prepared by replacing the sugar syrup with crystallised sugar and heating the entire dough instead of the sugar-water syrup. Kaju katli is not a long lasting dessert, in winter it can last up to 7 days, but in summer one should consume it within 3-4 days. Due to its popularity in India, many vendors such as Bikaner and SweetDabba have made a sugar free version of this sweet.

It is on the north-facing coast and is about one hour's drive from Aberdeen. Etymology The name Pennan was recorded in 1587 as Pennand. It is possibly derived from the Brittonic element *pen meaning \\"head, end, promontory\\" (Welsh pen). However, there is no certain instance of this element north of the Antonine Wall. Area history Pennan portrayed the fictional village of Ferness in Local Hero ‚Äî the red telephone box is visible Aerial view of Pennan village Pennan seems to have come into existence as a fishing village in the 18th century. Until the 1930s, the population of the village seems to have come under three main surnames - Watt, Gatt and West. The people of Pennan were dependent on the sea. Most families had small boats for their own personal use. Where the men would catch the fish, it was usually down to the women and children to try to sell it to clients in the country. In the last 50 years, most of the native families have moved out and most of the houses have been bought as holiday homes. Pennan became famous in the 1980s for being used as one of the main locations for the film Local Hero, and representing the fictional village of Ferness. Film enthusiasts have come from all over the world to make a phone call in the red telephone box which featured in the film. The phone box was in fact originally put there only as a prop for the film, and then removed, but as a result of public demand a genuine telephone box was installed a few metres from the original spot (+44 (0)1346 6210), and has been a listed building since 1989. Landslips, especially one in 2007, have been damaging the village.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/north_east/8365494.stm In 2009 a 25-foot crack appeared on the cliff side, sparking calls for the village to be evacuated.

After the explosion of his gunpowder mill in 1837, in 1838 J.M. Merrow built a knitting mill on the same site. The company developed crocheting machines for its own use and by 1887 evolved to design, build and market sewing machines exclusively. During its early decades it was organized as a partnership under various names: established in 1838 as Joseph M. Merrow & Sons by J. Makens Merrow, then Pitkin, Merrow, & Co., renamed Merrow Manufacturing Co. in 1857, then Merrow and Millard in 1863, J.B. Merrow and Sons in 1870, and incorporated as The Merrow Manufacturing Company in 1893.Merrow family papers and records, 1800-1948 (archive description) Originally all of its manufacturing was done at facilities in Merrow, Connecticut, and then in Hartford, Connecticut, after 1894.

Southwick's interviews, written in 1868 = In the early 19th Century Mr. Joseph Makens Merrow became interested in the manufacture of gunpowder and purchased a powder mill 24 miles from Hartford, Connecticut. After the Mill was destroyed by explosion, in 1837 it was decided to build a knitting factory on the same site using water power from an adjacent river. At first the knitted goods were made largely of native wool which was sorted, scoured and dyed, picked, carded and spun into yarn and knitted into hosiery. Later, cotton goods were knitted. The products were sold through commission merchants in New York and delivered to retail stores throughout New England by two-horse wagons. Following the gold rush of 1849 shipments of goods began to sail to San Francisco. As business increased, a small machine shop was started to support the equipment in the factory. = The first overlock machine\\"Company History\\", a letter from the company's Treasurer, dated May 22, 1958, pg. 1 = In conjunction with the knitting business, the first crochet machines were constructed for finishing around the tops of men's socks in place of handwork. The Merrow machine as it is now known, was an invention of Mr. Joseph M. Merrow, who was president of the company until his death in 1947 at age 98. The Merrow Machines were constructed under his direction prior to 1876 with numerous patents granted. The machines were so useful that business was undertaken to introduce the equipment to other textile manufacturers. In 1887 the knitting mill was destroyed by fire and the company moved to Hartford and reorganized concentrating on the manufacture of overlock sewing machines. = The Merrow Machine Company = In Hartford the company focused on building lines of industrial overlock sewing machines that were used to overedge fabric, add decorative edging and support the fabric processing trade by joining fabrics. Between 1893 when the company was renamed the Merrow Machine Company, and 1932 when a line of \\"A Class\\" machines was introduced, Merrow had a significant impact on the textile industry. The technology and rate of innovation in this time, spearheaded by Joseph M. Merrow was unequaled in the industry. As a consequence there were several high profile legal confrontations, including Merrow v. Wilcox & Gibbs in 1897. Sales for overlock sewing machines were strong and Merrow grew to employ more than 500 people in Hartford Ct. The company also excelled developing international distribution and by 1905 had agents in 35 countries and printed manuals in at least 12 languages. In 1955, Merrow patented the Merrow MG-3U Emblem Machine. In the mid 1960s Merrow opened a manufacturing facility in Lavonia GA to reduce costs and maintain proximity to an American textile market that was moving from New York City to the American South East. In the 1990s Merrow developed a new overlock machine called the Delta Class, but was never able to gain traction with the new model. In 2004 shareholders of the Merrow Machine Co. agreed to a buyout of the company by Charlie Merrow, and it was renamed the Merrow Sewing Machine Company. = The Merrow Sewing Machine Company = After the reorganization in Massachusetts, the company released notice that it would continue supporting most models of sewing machines manufactured after 1925, and would re-release to market new versions of its most popular models. The company has capitalized on the trademarks \\"merrowed\\" and \\"merrowing\\", working with manufacturers who use Merrow machines to brand and market \\"merrow\\" stitching. In 2008 Merrow developed a social network for stitching named merrowing.com, and introduced series of rich media web based tools to help people research and understand the myriad of stitches produced by Merrow machines. = Present day = The Merrow Sewing Machine Company is now based in Fall River, Massachusetts, and is managed by Charlie Merrow and Owen Merrow, great-great-nephews of Joseph M. Merrow. The company continues to build many models of overlock sewing machines. In addition to being one of the most recognized brands of textile equipment in the world, it remains the oldest manufacturer of sewing machines still made in the United States. = Activeseam = In 2008 Merrow introduced the Activeseam stitch as a technical improvement to flatlock and coverstitching for technical apparel. ActiveSeam is a branded stitch that Merrow markets as technically superior and more comfortable than flatlock. According to the company \\"for the first time in apparel, ActiveSeam creates a protected and marketable space around the seam of a garment or accessory with both aesthetic and technical advantages.\\" ActiveSeam is a family of stitches created on the newest platform of MB class machines from Merrow. An ActiveSeam may be: Minimal (disappearing in the garment), Slim (a narrow flat seam), Comfort (a wide flat seam), or Infused 3D (a three-thread variant that exposes a hidden color in the seam when it stretches).

He is a recurring foe of the Flash with considerable technical expertise and skills involving the use of mirrors. Three individuals have donned the guise of Mirror Master (with a couple being members of the Rogues at different times). In 2009, Mirror Master was ranked as IGN's 79th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master has been portrayed in live-action by David Cassidy in the 1990 The Flash series and by Grey Damon in the 2014 The Flash series, while Efrat Dor portrays a gender-swapped version of the Evan McCulloch version of Mirror Master renamed Eva in the 2014 The Flash series. Publication history The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master first appears in The Flash #105 and was created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino. The Evan McCulloch version of Mirror Master first appears in Animal Man #8 and was created by Grant Morrison and Chas Truog. Fictional character biography =Sam Scudder= Mirror Master (Scudder) in his first appearance. Samuel Joseph Scudder is a simple convict, but has the goal to learn how to get inside the reflection of a mirror. Stumbling into a hall of mirrors, he experiments and discovers a way to get in his own reflection. He uses this power to become the criminal Mirror Master, and is a frequent foe of the Flash. Scudder dies around the same time as Barry Allen, alongside the Icicle during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Later, Captain Boomerang briefly assumes Scudder's identity, becoming the second Mirror Master. He uses this as an alternate identity with which to commit crimes, thus not alerting his teammates in the Suicide Squad to his extracurricular activities. Pre-Crisis, he studies mirrors after someone's reflection is held inside a mirror he was working on in the prison workshop. He then learns how to create creatures of light. In the Blackest Night crossover event, Sam Scudder is reanimated as an undead Black Lantern during the Blackest Night and is preparing an attack on the Rogues with the other deceased members, who are also reanimated.Blackest Night: The Flash #1 (February 2010) The Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words In Case of Flash: Break Glass.

The procedure went awry, causing an explosion at the facility. Golden Glider, who was also at the facility, was caught in the explosion. The five were given superpowers but each in a twisted manner. Heat Wave gains pyrokinesis but at the cost of his body being burned, Weather Wizard becomes emotionally tied to his weather wand causing constant depression, Sam would be forever trapped in Mirror World, and Golden Glider becomes an astral projection of herself. It is implied that Sam is in a romantic relationship with her. The Rogues blame Captain Cold for this and have turned against him because of it.The Flash Annual #1 =Evan McCulloch= Alan Weiss.

After firing his shot, he recognizes the target as his father. At the funeral, Evan sees his mother. Over the next few days, he tries to work up the courage to see her, but visits her too late, discovering that she has committed suicide. Stricken with grief at the loss of both parents, Evan decides to turn himself in but is instead picked up by a consortium of U.S. government and big business interests, who offer him the costume and weapons of the original Mirror Master in exchange for his services.Flash: Rogues His first assignment is to scare Animal Man into abandoning his animal-rights stance, a mission he fails thanks to the hero's wife.

However, after witnessing Barry's selfless heroism when their attempt to arrest him is interrupted by Captain Boomerang, the future version of the Top explains that Barry will kill Mirror Monarch because he mistook him for Mirror Master; the 'In Case of Flash' mirror will release the powerful demons known as the Mirror Lords, one of which will possess Iris, with Barry being forced to kill Mirror Master in order to send the demons back into the mirror or face Iris being permanently possessed by the Mirror Lord, only to kill Mirror Monarch by accident.The Flash (vol. 3) #4 (July 2010) When the Flash enters the gateway of unveil a giant mirror, but there are no demons or Mirror Lords only for it to show him a vision of his mother and he is caught by the Renegades.

McCulloch orders his men to torch the house before he and his men retreat into his mirror dimension with the Kents in tow. When Superman arrives at his parents burning house Mirror Master greets him through a mirror, mocking Superman, unfazed by his threats. He tells Superman that he will never see his parents again but that they are safe, despite the fact Scudder had to rough up Superman's father.

He goes on, telling Superman \\"Simple message: Stop what you're doing.\\" He advises Superman to stay out of government business and that if he persists, they will start \\"Sending little pieces of one of them. Maybe we'll even let you choose which one.\\" Mirror Master is the subject of a Justice League manhunt in Central City, with several of the Flash's Rogues Gallery being interrogated by the League for McCulloch's location. It is ultimately Captain Cold who reveals where Mirror Master is: a bar in Keystone City. The Flash and Wonder Woman crash the bar and make for McCulloch sitting at the bar, but it is revealed that it is not Mirror Master but a projection from the nearby wall mirror. Mirror Master mocks Flash, but the Speedster has the last laugh when Raven appears behind McCulloch and forces him out halfway from the mirror. Wonder Woman forces the location of Superman's parents out of Mirror Master with her Lasso of Truth and the threat of smashing the mirror he is only halfway out of. Mirror Master quickly reveals that the Kents are in Bolivia. Wonder Woman then orders Mirror Master to strip himself of his weapons so they can use his tech to free the Kents. Though he is not seen after this, he is most likely incarcerated. He then reappears in Year Five, where he is one of the thousands of villains released from Superman's prison by Plastic Man. He is next seen along his fellow Rogues as their new leader, due to Captain Cold going into hiding, as they meet with Batman, who offers them to help him take down Superman's Regime, due to the Rogues' code against killing, which Batman respects. Mirror Master, along with Weather Wizard, Heat Wave, and Golden Glider, attack several Regime buildings in a coordinated attack around the world. They then attack a Regime base in Central City, evacuating the soldiers first before they set to blow it up. Bizarro though shows up and attacks them. During the fight, Scudder gets knocked unconscious, leaving Golden Glider to try to figure out how to use his belt to escape while Heat Wave and Weather Wizard distract Bizarro. But, when Weather Wizard calls Bizarro a fake, an angry Bizarro lashes out and incinerates him and Heat Wave with his heat vision. Golden Glider, though, manages to escape through a mirror portal with Scudder and they report about what happened to Batman as they mourn Rory and Mardon. They are then seen holding a memorial for Rory and Mardon at a bar, where it is revealed that Scudder and Glider are in a relationship as they share a kiss. The Flash then visits the bar to pay his respects, but Scudder and Glider angrily berate him, thinking he has come to brag and turn them in, but Flash reveals that he has always respected the Rogues and came by to pay his respects. He also agrees to not turn them in as he, Scudder, and Glider share a beer together. In other media =Television= Live-action The Flash (1990 TV series) * The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master appeared in The Flash 1990 TV series, portrayed by David Cassidy. This version is a criminal who uses holograms projected by small mirrored disks to commit his heists. In the episode \\"Done with Mirrors\\", he steals a crystal from S.T.A.R. Labs and attempts to kill his ex-partner Stasia Masters, a high school girlfriend of Barry Allen. The Flash, with help from Tina McGee, uses a high-powered spotlight to blind Scudder and drown out his illusions, allowing the Flash to capture him. * Several variations of Mirror Master appear in The Flash 2014 TV series. ** Sam Scudder appears in the third season, portrayed by Grey Damon. He is a metahuman with the ability to travel through reflective surfaces (similar to the New 52 version) as well as trap people inside such objects after being trapped in a mirror for three years. He briefly traps Barry Allen in a window during a chase, but the speedster's allies are able to free Barry by slowing down the molecules of the 'wormhole' Scudder creates in the mirrors so that Barry can vibrate through it. Barry subsequently isolates Scudder by trapping him in a circle of mirrors; allowing Barry to knock him out until he can be moved to an Iron Heights cell with no reflective surfaces. ** A company called McCulloch Technologies appears in the fifth season that developed a mirror gun which Team Flash uses to destroy Cicada's dagger. A female version of Evan McCulloch named Eva McCulloch appears as a series regular in the sixth season's second half, portrayed by Efrat Dor. A quantum engineer, co-founder of McCulloch Technologies, and wife of its CEO Joseph Carver, she was also trapped inside a mirror like Scudder, though she was trapped for six years. After learning Carver stole her tech and used it to create the terrorist organization Black Hole, McCulloch developed and honed her abilities over the years to get revenge. During her sixth year in the mirrorverse, she trapped several key figures with her and used mirror duplicates of them as her proxies to procure technology so she could eventually escape the mirrorverse. Once she did, she used her ability to travel through reflective surfaces and manipulate mirror shards to kill Carver and retake her company. Animation * Mirror Master appeared in Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, voiced by Casey Kasem. The Flash doesn't appear in this episode. In the episode \\"Reflections in Crime\\", Mirror Master sets about trapping the Super Friends inside mirrors called the sixth dimension.

Mirror Master as seen in Justice League Unlimited. * An amalgamated version of Mirror Master appears in the Justice League animated series and Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Alexis Denisof. In the episode \\"Eclipsed\\", an actor hired to play him is seen as part of the Flash's Lightspeed energy bar commercial. The actual version is an amalgamation of Sam Scudder and Evan McCulloch; he is clearly American like Scudder as well as being a simple criminal and not a hitman but his mirror abilities are tilted more towards McCulloch's enhanced, almost supernatural skills like a Mirror Dimension. In the episode \\"Flash and Substance\\", he seemed to act as the Rogues' de facto leader, convincing the others to exact revenge upon the Flash for repeatedly thwarting their plots and bringing them to jail, joining forces with Captain Boomerang, Captain Cold, and Trickster. It was also mentioned by Captain Boomerang that the Flash made Mirror Master eat his own Laser-Kaleidoscope, though Mirror Master dismissed this as being false saying \\"That's a rumor! A complete exaggeration. Besides, it was a laser pistol\\". The Rogues later demolish the newly opened Flash Museum upon entering through Linda Park's compact mirror. In his battle with Flash, Batman, and Orion, Mirror Master ended up trapped in the broken shards of the mirror after Batman's Batarang is thrown at one of the mirrors that Mirror Master used. Forensics were shown collecting the pieces of the mirror. Mirror Master had a cameo as a member of the Secret Society in the episode \\"The Great Brain Robbery\\". The Batman. * The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master appeared in the fifth season of The Batman animated series, voiced by and modeled after John Larroquette. This version is a brilliant but mad optical physicist and is said to be the most powerful of the Flash's foes. In \\"A Mirror Darkly\\", he employed mirror versions of Batman, Flash, and Robin to steal components for his Mirror Portal Ray. He used it to trap Gotham's citizens in any reflective surface--mirrors, windows, even a silver serving tray. On a side note, he has a female assistant named Smoke (voiced by Amanda Anka). In \\"Lost Heroes\\", he fights Flash and Green Arrow in a circus fun house only for Green Arrow to cut off his reflection by a slime-emitting arrow. * The Evan McCulloch version of Mirror Master appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Tom Kenny. He and Captain Cold are mentioned in \\"The Golden Age of Justice\\" as having been recently defeated by Batman. Mirror Master makes a non-speaking cameo in \\"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster\\" where he traps Batman and Barry Allen in a trap only for Batman to cut him and Allen out of the trap and then for Flash to redirect a beam back to Mirror Master, supposedly knocking him out. In the anthology-only episode \\"Four Star Spectacular!\\" in the vignette \\"Double Trouble\\", Mirror Master traps the Flash using a mirror maze and attacks him with a horde of mirror duplicates. Flash eventually realizes which of the images is the one real Mirror Master and knocks him out. * Mirror Master appears in the Robot Chicken DC Comics Special, voiced by Breckin Meyer. He appears as a member of the Legion of Doom. In one segment, he and the Riddler pressure Sinestro to shave off his mustache in the bathroom, which leads to Sinestro gushing blood from his upper lip. Mirror Master escapes in a mirror in horror. He next appears in the final segment where he participates in the battle between the Justice League and the Legion of Doom. =Film= * The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master appears as an antagonist in Justice League: Doom with Alexis Denisof reprising his role from the Justice League animated series. He is recruited into Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom before the film's events begin. He sneaks into the Batcave using the Batmobile's rear view mirror and steals Batman's contingency plans from the Batcomputer. He is chosen by Savage to kill The Flash. Mirror Master gets Flash's attention by robbing a moving train and taking everyone aboard hostage. Flash manages to destroy all of his holograms, but Mirror Master manages to plant a bomb through Flash's wrist while disabling a bomb inside a glass box containing an old woman (actually another hologram). The bomb would go off in 60 seconds should Flash do nothing, try to take it off, and, should he run, if he decelerates. Flash eventually escapes by vibrating molecules though an iceberg, leaving the bomb trapped in the iceberg before it explodes. He toasts Savage at their victory celebration and signs on for his true, genocidal plan. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, he fight The Flash by taking the battle outside and forcing Flash to fight a multitude of solid holograms and new holograms that seem to be made of glass. Eventually Flash takes out all of his holograms and knocks out Mirror Master in one punch. * Mirror Master appears in Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox in a non-speaking role. In the film's beginning, he and the Rogues are attacking the Flash, but Professor Zoom betrays the Rogues and attaches bombs to the Rogues which cannot be removed. When the Justice League arrive and manage to dispose the bombs, Green Lantern takes Mirror Master to space's upper limits where Green Lantern's ring is shielding while Batman uses a laser cutter to remove the bomb which later drops in space from the bomb radius, saving Mirror Master's life. His appearance is notable because his physical body is noticeably bulkier than previous animated incarnations; it is unknown whether this is due to muscle, bone structure, or body fat. * In Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, an alternate version of Lex Luthor mentions Mirror Master being head of the police. =Video games= * The Evan McCulloch incarnation of Mirror Master appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Brandon Young. * Mirror Master makes a cameo appearance in Injustice: Gods Among Us.

It was Lords' final adult film in the industry. It was produced in Cannes, France, two days after her 18th birthday. As her only film produced after she turned 18, it is the only one legally available in the United States, due to child pornography laws. The film has been another aspect of controversy to Lords' life. It was the third and final film by her then self-titled production company (Traci Lords Company). She had sold the rights for a reported $100,000, profiting from her former profession post-scandal, while consistently regretting making adult films and criticizing the porn industry. But In her 2003 autobiography, Underneath It All, she explained her actions: She retained the rights to the film again in 1996 and has not allowed it to be sold, though some old copies are still available in used markets.  Plot  In the film, Lords is the reigning queen of \\"good girl gone bad.\\" This is a story of a glamor photographer's fixation with a beautiful model named Traci. A French film festival is the setting, where Traci arrives and gets the attention of photographers. She gets the special attention of Jean-Paul (Gabriel Pontello), who sees her as his favorite nude model. Jean Paul finds Traci to be the very essence of sensuality. She finally agrees to pose for him and they begin a love affair, where he helps her to explore her sexuality through his underworld connections in the Arena of Pleasure. Traci discovers true love and the ultimate sex adventure. First, Traci has sex with a casting agent. She becomes a topless dancer, and Jean-Paul secretly watches in the audience. Off stage, she gets a necklace from Jean-Paul with her name engraved, which makes her remember another sexual encounter. On that night, with an audience watching, she ends up in an orgy with Leanna, Diana, Monique (Marilyn Jess) and a group of strange men dressed in all black. Jean-Paul watches from the audience before joining. Traci's presence arouses the audience members who finally get involved. After remembering, Traci takes the necklace to meet Jean-Paul in a car. He puts his gift around her neck, then Traci opens her legs to reveal she is not wearing any panties.

Roland Suso Richter directed the film. The theatrical release is 20 minutes shorter than the original television version. The subtitled English version was released in 2005.  Plot  The central character of the film is Harry Melchior, based on the real tunneler, Hasso Herschel. Despite being imprisoned for several years for his role in the June 1953 uprising in East Germany, Melchior competes for and wins the national swimming championship in 1961. With the aid of a false passport and disguise, Harry succeeds in fleeing to West Berlin. His best friend, Matthis, manages to escape through the underground sewer, but Matthis's pregnant wife Carola is caught and remains in East Berlin. Harry's beloved sister, Lotte, and her husband and daughter are ambivalent about leaving the confines of the GDR. Committed to getting their loved ones out of the GDR but knowing that ground routes are heavily guarded, Harry and Matthis have the idea of going underground. Matthis is an engineer by training. They link up with a small circle of others, initially Vittorio 'Vic' Constanza and Fred von Klausnitz. They find an unused factory building close to the Wall that has ample underground space. They are eventually joined by Fritzi Scholz, whose fianc√©, Heiner, is also trapped in the east. The work is slow, hard and sometimes dangerous, and the group reluctantly agrees to take in several more helpers. Over a span of months, the tunnel takes shape following Matthis' design, with the necessary shoring, lights and even a railbed. Discovering a film crew from NBC in the city one day, the leaders convince the network to fund their efforts in exchange for exclusive footage of the digging and eventual escape. In the meantime, communication with the would-be rescuees in the east is necessary but hazardous. Vic, an American citizen, can pass through the border freely. He is in contact with Lotte and with Carola. The latter, however, has been blackmailed by the Stasi to inform; if she does not cooperate, the state will take her soon-to-be-born baby. Carola informs on Vic and he is detained when trying to cross back to West Berlin. He is released after a while but cannot go back to the east. Fritzi's love, Heiner, makes a futile attempt to cross the barbed wire and walls, but is shot by the East German border guards and left to die in a scene mirroring the true case of Peter Fechter. The American soldiers prevent Harry from climbing the wall to help Heiner. Overseeing the efforts to thwart tunnelers and other efforts at \\"illegal emigration\\" is Colonel Kr√∂ger. Finally the pieces are all in place for the planned escape of about 30 people. Word is spread by surreptitious means, though the Stasi are watching closely. They go to the home of Fred's widowed mother to take her into custody, but she takes her own life first. Carola has admitted to Lotte that she has been an informant but swears she can now be trusted. In a ruse that means leaving her baby with Lotte's family, she leads her Stasi tail to a remote location far from the actual escape site. Fritzi has crossed the border with a fake passport and Harry has entered through the tunnel. Surprising a border guard, Harry takes his uniform, steel helmet and gun, and blends into the troops swarming through the area. The would-be escapees gather in a caf√© across from the building where the tunnel begins, and Fritzi gradually escorts them over. Tense moments ensue as Colonel Kr√∂ger closes in, and pursues the escapees through the tunnel. A sign has been erected in the tunnel marking the boundary of the French sector, and the pursuing guards have the political sense to know they can go no further.

CMA starts with the idea that human health is a biosocial and political ecological product. Consequently, CMA is critical of the tendency to naturalize the process of health and illness in the health and social sciences. CMA dates to the 1980s, but has deeper roots in critical theory concerning the social determinants of health. CMA adds an anthropological dimension to traditional critical approaches, thereby avoiding a top-down perspective. In other words, CMA recognizes that there is interaction between the macro-level of social structure, the meso-level of social organization and agentive action, and the micro-level of individual experience and health. During the early years of medical anthropology‚Äôs formation, explanations within the discipline tended to be narrowly focused on explaining health-related beliefs and behaviors at the local level in terms of specific ecological conditions, cultural configurations, or psychological factors. While providing needed insight about the nature and function of traditional and folk medical models, the initial perspectives in medical anthropology tended to ignore the wider causes and determinants of human decision making and behavior. Explanations that are limited to accounting for health-related issues in terms of the influence of human personalities, culturally constituted motivations and understandings, or even local ecological relationships, emergent critical medical anthropologists began to argue, are inadequate because they tend not to include examination of the structures of social relationship that unite (commonly in an unequal fashion) and influence far-flung individuals, communities, and even whole nations. A critical understanding, by contrast, involves paying close attention to what has been called the ‚Äúvertical links‚Äù that connect the social group of interest to the larger regional, national, and global human society and to the configuration of social relationships that contribute to the patterning of human behavior, belief, attitude, and emotion. Consequently, what came to be called critical medical anthropology focused attention on understanding the origins of dominant cultural constructions in health, including which social class, gender, or ethnic group‚Äôs interests particular health concepts express and under what set of historic conditions they arise. Further, CMA emphasizes structures of power and inequality in health care systems and the contributions of health ideas and practices in reinforcing inequalities in the wider society. Moreover, CMA addresses the social origins of illness, such as the way in which poverty, discrimination, industrial pollution of the environment, social violence, and fear of violence contribute to poor health. Critical medical anthropologists argue that experience and ‚Äúagency,‚Äù that is, individual and group decision making and action, are constructed and reconstructed in the action arena between socially constituted categories of meaning and the political-economic forces that shape the context [and texture] of daily life. In other words, people develop their own individual and collective understandings and responses to illness and to other threats to their well-being, but they do so in a world that is not of their own making, a world in which inequality of access to health care, the media, productive resources (e.g., land, potable water, clean air), and valued social statuses play a significant role in their daily options. Additionally, while recognizing the fundamental importance of physical (including biological) reality in health, such as the nature of particular pathogens or the release of toxins into the environment, CMA emphasizes the fact that it is not merely the idea of ‚Äúnature‚Äù‚Äîthe way external reality is conceived and related to by humans‚Äîbut also the very physical shape of nature, including human biology, that has been deeply influenced by an evolutionary history of social inequality, overt and covert social conflict, and the operation of both physical power and the power to shape dominant ideas and conceptions in society and internationally through processes of globalization, control of production and reproduction, and control of labor.

It carries an urban adult contemporary radio format and is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. WDAS-FM is widely regarded as one of the originators of the Urban AC format, mixing R&B; hits of the last 40 years with non-rap contemporary R&B.; The studios and offices are located in Bala Cynwyd. WDAS-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 16,500 watts as a Class B station. The transmitter is located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia, off Wygard Avenue near the Schuylkill River.Radio- Locator.com/WDAS-FM WDAS-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format, with a simulcast of WTEL 610 AM airing the Black Information Network (BIN) on the station's digital subchannel. History WDAS-FM is considered a legendary radio station in Philadelphia, pioneering a format for adults in the African- American community. Widely regarded as an originator of the Urban Adult Contemporary format, WDAS-FM continues to be among the most popular stations in the Delaware Valley. =Early Years= On September 1, 1959, WDAS-FM signed on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-218 It mostly simulcast its AM sister station, 1480 WDAS. The two stations were owned by Max Leon, who had acquired WDAS 1480 in 1950. Classical music was featured on Sundays on WDAS- FM, breaking away from the AM station's programming. By mid-1960s, FM stations were encouraged by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to air programming separate from their co-owned AM stations. WDAS-FM station moved to a classical music format exclusively. In April 1968, the format changed to an \\"underground\\" free form sound. This short-lived period introduced much of the new voices of \\"progressive rock\\" radio including Michael Tearson and Ed Sciaky. Other voices included popular Top 40 disc jockey Hy Lit from 990 WIBG, and later a popular nighttime show by owner Max Leon's son Steve, who called himself \\"My Father's Son\\" on the air. Folk music host Gene Shay also did his program from WDAS-FM at this time. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, radio stations were under increased pressure by the Nixon Administration through the FCC to censor music that involved drug content. Steve Leon ignored this directive and continued to play the music that was popular at the time. While playing Arlo Guthrie's \\"Coming Into Los Angeles\\", which referenced smuggling marijuana, Leon charged into the station and ripped the turntable arm off the record. Leon then fired his son and the other on-air staff. To fill the void, the AM station's staff were used as replacements. =Philadelphia Soul and Disco= AM 1480 WDAS had been a popular outlet for R&B; music throughout he 1960s and 70s. In March 1971, WDAS-FM decided to capitalize on that success. Management launched the station's new Urban Contemporary format. The station playlist included R&B;, soul and funk, playing what would become the classics of their genre and launching careers of \\"Philadelphia Soul\\" acts such as The O'Jays, The Stylistics, Patti LaBelle and Teddy Pendergrass. WDAS-FM's rising success paralleled the red-hot popularity of the new R&B; sound developed at Philadelphia International Records. By 1975, as the Philly Sound laid the musical groundwork for disco, the station began to integrate more dance music into the station's playlist to go along with its rising popularity. By the end of the decade, WDAS-FM introduced its listenership to new sounds of Rap with artists such as Sugarhill Gang, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and Kurtis Blow as well showcasing local talent like Frankie Smith (of \\"Double Dutch Bus\\" fame). By 1980, WDAS-FM was the number one music station in Philadelphia. WDAS-FM's activist voice was as powerful as its musical one. Legendary broadcasters George \\"Georgie The Man With The Goods\\" Woods and Edward \\"Ed\\" Bradley shaped the political voice of the station. WDAS-FM earned its position as the \\"voice of the Black community.\\" Interestingly, its program director and afternoon DJ was a white radio professional, Joe \\"Butterball\\" Tamburro. He had a knack for knowing the records that would become successful hits among Philadephia's young black fans. Tamburro, nicknamed \\"Butterball\\" for his rotund size, guided the station through several decades. =Competition from WUSL= The station was sold in November 1979 to Black-owned Unity Broadcasting Network, and it honed the Urban Contemporary format in 1980. But in 1982 a brand new competitor arrived, WUSL \\"POWER 99fm\\". WUSL's popularity forced WDAS-FM to go into a CHUrban/Crossover format, playing more dance hits from the Mainstream Top 40 charts. WDAS-FM kept Rap and R&B;, but it also added some Pop and Dance music to the playlists. It also further leveraged its community involvement and public affairs programming aimed at both the black and white communities. As the Disco Era faded, the station moved away into more Rap, R&B; and Hip Hop music. The station also introduced a new slogan: \\"105.3 WDAS-FM, We've Got The Juice!\\" inspired by Attitudes' song of the same name. Despite these efforts, WUSL, which played every type of Black, White, Latin, Canadian, and even British artists geared to both black, Latino and white audiences, had won the CHUrban ratings battle. By 1989 WDAS-FM evolved into a successful, black community oriented Urban AC format after its AM station flipped to Urban Gospel. In 1994, Unity Broadcasting sold both WDAS stations to the Beasley Broadcast Group. In 1995, when the Tom Joyner Morning Show went into nationwide syndication through ABC, WDAS-FM became a founding network affiliate. =Changes in Ownership= In May 1996, Beasley sold WDAS-AM-FM to Evergreen, which also owned WUSL, making them sister stations. In 1997, Evergreen and Chancellor merged to form Chancellor Media and later restructured in 1999 as AMFM, Inc. In 2000, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) acquired AMFM. In 1998, the Tom Joyner Morning Show moved to a different Urban AC station, 100.3 WRNB. WDAS-FM subsequently picked up The Steve Harvey Morning Show as a replacement. The station also carried Michael Baisden in afternoon drive time until it dropped the show in January 2013. Since 1979, WDAS-FM has sponsored Unity Day, an annual summer gathering on Benjamin Franklin Parkway. This ended with the death of longtime WDAS-FM program director Joe \\"Butterball\\" Tamburro. Tamburro passed away in July 2012 at age 70. Short Spacing WDAS-FM is short spaced to country music station WIOV-FM in Ephrata, Pennsylvania, near Reading. The two stations operate on first adjacent channels (105.3 MHz and 105.1 MHz). The distance between the two stations' transmitter sites is only 50 miles apart. The minimum distance between two Class B stations operating on first adjacent channels according to current FCC rules should be 105 miles. The two stations have been operating with this close spacing for decades, so the arrangement is grandfathered.

The game emphasises on commanding a group of six AH-64 Apache crews of the US Army in battles against the Communist FARC insurgents in Colombia and the Russian military in Latvia. Team Apache was at first developed by Simis under Eidos Interactive. When Simis' two lead developers, Jonathan Newth and Ian Baverstock bought the company back from Eidos, they became an independent development team once more and Mindscape purchased the publishing rights of the game.  Flight modelling  The cockpit, sensor and flight modelling aspects of the game are a lot simpler than those of the Comanche series and the Longbow flight simulators. Cockpit renders are not very advanced, and instruments are difficult to read. This applies to the rendered cockpit and the floating cockpit. The clear cockpit view is the easiest to use, but there are no sensor overlays. The gunner selects the targets most of the time, and players have reported some issues with his/her AI. ECM, radars and lasers cannot be toggled on or off. The flight modelling is not the most accurate on the helicopter sim market. For example, unwise maneuvres that warrant a crash can be performed without a hitch. In addition, hovering is a lot simpler than in the Comanche and Longbow games.  Gameplay  Team Apache is a different breed of helicopter flight simulator. Unlike most flight sims, Team Apache focuses less on the realism of flight and weapons systems modelling, and more on the gameplay aspects - consisting of command, tactics and battlefield realism. Team Apache is unique among simulations in that it gives the player unparalleled control over his/her combat unit. The player is not just flying missions- he is also managing the morale of his/her men, supply and maintenance, and the tactical planning that takes place before the mission. Although the player's control over these factors is rather basic, few, if any, simulations have as much depth as Team Apache. The geopolitical causes of Team Apache's wars, related in both the game's manual and the \\"daily\\" newspaper, are both sophisticated and plausible. Detailed military-style SITREPs create a thorough picture of the tactical situation, and ground forces can be seen in the game fighting each other all throughout the theater using fairly realistic deployments and movements. These details provided by the game, combined with the player's control over his/her men and his/her equipment, make Team Apache one of the most immersive combat simulations ever published in some player's opinions. Perhaps the biggest drawback of the game is the lack of time compression. During the Colombian campaign missions are short, lasting less than 15 minutes in most cases, but the Latvian campaign missions may involve travelling more than 100 kilometers round-trip. The player may turn on autopilot during these long transit periods but must still stay alert for enemy contact. Depending on your point of view, this either increases the immersion experience or wastes time. Players should not be concerned about playing the same long mission over and over again, though, because the campaigns, although linear, can be played by accepting your defeats and team's casualties and moving on to the next mission. An interesting fact is that in the Colombian campaign you can fly the other direction overseas and may get captured by intercepter planes from another country which even warn you to not fly further or you will be shot down.  Plot  The storyline in Team Apache is highly developed. It develops through FMV sequences, in mission briefings and newspaper articles. = Colombian Campaign = In 1998, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia‚ÄìEj√©rcito del Pueblo or FARC-EP (Spanish for \\"Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia‚ÄìPeople's Army\\") has staged a large-scale guerrilla offensive against the government of Colombia. In its wake comes a wave of kidnappings and assassinations of high-ranking officials and their families. The corrupt and inefficient military of Colombia and police cannot hold their own against the insurgents, and need help from the United States. The United States needs to safeguard Colombia's oil industry and eliminate FARC's illegal cocaine industry. = Latvian Campaign =  Modes of play  Team Apache contains a host of play modes, including a multiplayer mode and a mission building application. = Training = The Training missions give players the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the mechanics of flying the Apache helicopter. They are instructed by an artificial, gruff flight officer, one pilot McNabbit. While the learning curve in the actual game takes no more than two hours, the training missions are extremely rigid, and each instruction must be performed to precision. = Instant Action = This mode instantly plunges the player into arcade-style combat. The player has no team to command or get support from, and there is no mission structure. The objective is to simply engage and destroy as many enemy vehicles and troops as the player can around a circular course that leads back to the base each time. = Combat Missions = The Combat Missions are a series of realistic, structured missions during which the player takes command of a team of Apaches. They are much like the Campaign missions themselves, but they are independent of one another and can be repeated upon completion. These are the following mission types: Air to Air In the Colombian scenario, the player must lead the company to hunt down FARC 500MD Defender light helicopters. In the Latvian version, a large group of Mil Mi-24, Mi-28 and Ka-50 attack helicopters are approaching to destroy the Apache company's base. Deep Strike Route Recon Search and Rescue Search and Destroy Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) While there are different mission types, the objective remains the same for each. However, the weather, the time of day, the location of the mission, the number of Apaches accompanying the player, and the difficulty can be adjusted. The player begins the mission on the ground, takes off, and follows a route dotted with Aerial Check Point (ACP) destinations to find and eliminate the target or rendezvous with an ally and achieve the objective. Auto-pilot can be activated to easily navigate and find the APCs. = Campaign = This mode allows the player to take control of a company of six Apache helicopters - plus a spare. Under the player's command are eight pilots, eight co-pilot/gunners, and sixteen crew chief personnel. The player can choose a name with limited characters, and can also select the division and company the team will belong to: Army Attack Helicopter Units * 82nd Airborne Division * 101st Airborne Division * 1st Armored Division * 227th Aviation Regiment Company The player can roam around a pre-rendered army base, and enter a building by highlighting the title above it and clicking it. The areas that can be accessed include the repair hangar, the pilot's barracks, the briefing room, the commander's quarters, and the landing strip to start the mission. The pilots under your command are realistic, and each has a rich background well described in their biographies. However, their catchphrases are not so convincing. The player will need to weigh their strong points against their weaknesses, and from their assessment select the best pilots for the team. The damage report tells the commander what parts need to be repaired, and can judge how many crew chiefs will be needed to make the repairs in time for the next mission. The player can tell them whether to load AGM-114 Hellfire missiles or Hydra 70 rockets. = Mission builder = Team Apache comes with a fairly simple mission creator utility. The user is allowed to set the takeoff and landing points of his/her helicopter unit and place enemy and friendly ground units. It's possible to give initial orders to ground units, but no sea units can be placed, and the only air units other than the player's helicopters that can be placed are enemy helicopter flights, which hover over their location and can't be given orders in the mission creator. The user then sets point values for the Major Defeat, Defeat, Draw, Victory, and Decisive Victory win levels. He or she can adjust the default weapons load for the mission and can set a briefing. The user saves the mission and opens it in the game in the \\"Combat Mission\\" screen, where he can then adjust the mission's weather, time, difficulty, and the number of aircraft in his flight each time he plays. The mission creator is not full-feature and does not have all of the functions present in the missions that come with the game. = Multiplayer =  Other forces  = Friendly forces = The player cannot communicate with ground or air units outside his wing, but he can request reinforcements and artillery strikes. Many friendly ground and air forces are present in each mission. Friendly units include: Aircraft * A-10 Thunderbolt II Close Air Support * F-15 Eagle tactical fighters * F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-role fighters * UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopters = Enemy forces = There are two main adversaries Team Apache will face. The first is that of the FARC. These are the equipment they use in the Colombian Campaign: Aircraft * McDonnell Douglas 500MD Defender II light gunship and multi-role helicopter * Cessna drug- transport aircraft Ground units * Hand-held SAM * Infantry * EE-9 and EE-11 scout vehicles captured from the Colombian army The Russian forces have the following equipment: Aircraft * MiG-27 'Flogger-J' ground attack fighter * Mil Mi-8 'Hip' transport helicopter * Mil Mi-24 'Hind' heavy gunship helicopter * Mil Mi-28 'Havoc' attack helicopter Air Defense * ZSU-23-4 Shilka mobile gun * 2S6 Tunguska SAM/AAA vehicle * SA-3, SA-6, SA-8, SA-9, SA-11, SA-12 and SA-13 SAMs Armored Fighting Vehicles' * T-62, T-72 and T-80 tanks * BMP-1, BMP-2, and BTR-80 armored personnel carriers Ships * Cruiser * Patrol boat  Comparable games  * Ka-52 Team Alligator - the 'sequel' to Team Apache, developed by Simis. * Comanche series *  References   External links  * Combatsim.com Team Apache interview A site dedicated to combat simulations, with an interview with Bryan Walker, the original concept developer for Team Apache. * Gamespot review * *Migman's Team Apache info Category:1998 video games Category:Simis games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Team Apache"},{"id":"2363650","text":"Treaty of Indian Springs can refer to either of two treaties signed between the Muscogee and the United States in what is now Indian Springs State Park: *Treaty of Indian Springs (1821) *Treaty of Indian Springs (1825) ","title":"Treaty of Indian Springs"},{"id":"2363657","text":"Frances Ford Seymour Fonda (April 4, 1908 ‚Äì April 14, 1950) was a Canadian- born American socialite.

There are a variety of styles of cradleboard, reflecting the diverse artisan practises of indigenous cultures. Some indigenous communities in North America still use cradleboards. Structure Atikamekw cradleboard Cradleboards are used for the first few months of an infant's life, when a portable carrier for the baby is a necessity. Some cradleboards are woven, as with the Apache. Woven cradleboards are made of willow, dogwood, tule, or cattail fibres. Wooden cradleboards are made by the Iroquois and Penobscot. Navajo cradleboards are made with a Ponderosa pine frame with buckskin laces looped through the frame. Whatever materials are used to make cradleboards, they share certain structural elements. Cradleboards are built with a broad, firm protective frame for the infant's spine. A footrest is incorporated into the bottom of the cradleboard, as well as a rounded cover over the infant's head that arcs out from the cradleboard, similar to a canopy or a modern-day baby carriage hood. The purpose of this headpiece is to provide shade for the infant, since it could be covered with an animal skin, or a blanket in winter to protect against the elements in colder climates. The headpiece also provides extra head protection in case anything bumps against the cradleboard. Ornaments and sacred amulets are often attached to the headpiece as well, for example \\"beaded umbilical cord cases, and dream catchers or medicine wheels\\", to amuse and help the infant develop his or her eyesight. The inside of the cradleboard is padded with a lining of fresh plant fibres, such as sphagnum moss, cattail down, or shredded bark from juniper or cliffrose. The lining serves as a disposable diaper, although the Navajo could clean and reuse the lining made of shredded juniper or cliffrose bark. These plant fibres have antiseptic properties, and thus nurture healthy skin in the infant. The Chippewa tradition was to make a lining for the cradleboard usually from moss growing in cranberry marshes, which is smoked over a fire to kill insects, then rubbed and pulled to soften it. In cold weather, the infant's feet may be wrapped in rabbit skin with the fur facing inward. The moss lining is surrounded by a birch bark tray insert placed into the cradleboard, which could be removed for cleaning. Use Iroquois cradle board James Quesace, his wife and their infant in north west Manitoba, Canada, in 1886. Kiowa cradle board in the Indianapolis Children's Museum Cradleboards have been used in cultures ranging from the sub-Arctic regions of present-day Canada, down to Mexico and Central America. In Arctic regions, cold weather does not make a cradleboard feasible for the infant's survival, and infants are carried by being placed in a sling worn under the mother's parka. Cradleboards were widely used by indigenous people across present-day North America. Cradleboards are used by the Kickapoo people in Mexico and were used by Aztecs and the Seri people and Mayan communities as far south as Belize. In present- day South America, most indigenous cultures used slings or pouches, sometimes called a rebozo, for carrying infants rather than cradleboards. Cradleboards were used in the southernmost part of the continent, however, in the Patagonia region. Cradleboards were used during periods when the infant's mother had to travel or otherwise be mobile for work, and needed to protect the infant. The cradleboard could be carried on the mother's back, using support from \\"tumplines\\", or \\"burden straps\\" that would wrap around her forehead, chest or shoulders; if she carried a pack as well as the cradleboard, the pack strap would go around her chest and the cradleboard strap would go around her forehead. The cradleboard can also be stood up against a large tree or rock if the infant is small, or hung from a pole (as inside an Iroquois longhouse), or even hung from a sturdy tree branch. They were also used when longer travel was required, as the cradleboard could be attached to a horse for transportation. In the southwest United States and northern Mexico, among cultures such as the Hopi and Apache, infants would spend most of their day and night in the cradleboard, being taken out of it for progressively longer periods, for up to five times per day. When the infant reaches the age when it can sit up unsupported, it is then gradually weaned from the use of the cradleboard, and spends progressively less time in it. At this time, the infant may use a second, larger cradleboard that replaces the first. By the time the infant is a year old and begins to walk, they are generally finished with cradleboard use. Cradleboard use and its effect on mother-infant interaction has been studied in Navajo communities. It has been shown that cradleboard use has no significant negative effect on this development. In the first few months of infancy, cradleboards have a soothing effect on babies. After 6 months of age or more, infants begin to resist being placed in cradleboards more vigorously as they become more mobile, and they are often placed in the cradleboard with their arms and hands free, so that they can play with objects hung from the cradleboard for their amusement. Developmental dysplasia of the hips Cradleboard use has been associated with increased incidence of developmental dysplasia of the hip. The technique requires straightening the legs, which encourages dislocation of the femur and malformation of the acetabulum. This can be avoided by placing padding between the baby's legs to keep the knees slightly bent with the hips angled outwards. Some modern cradleboard users contend that the small 1968 study of Navajo babies was intentionally designed to denigrate a traditional cultural practice.

Ahern became involved with the Irish Countrywomen's Association (ICA), becoming the organisation's president, and she also served on the board of Bord F√°ilte. Political career Ahern's political role came in 1964 when she was nominated to Seanad √âireann by the Taoiseach, Se√°n Lemass, to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Senator P√°draig √ì Siochfhradha. Ahern contested the D√°il elections of 1965, 1969 and 1973, but was unsuccessful on all three occasions. However, she retained her Seanad seat, initially as a Taoiseach's nominee, and in 1969 and 1973 she was elected on the Cultural and Educational Panel. After her re-election in 1973, she was nominated by Fianna F√°il senator Brian Lenihan for the post of Leas- Chathaoirleach of the 13th Seanad. The post had traditionally been held by a member of an opposition party, but the incoming National Coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party decided that it wanted a Labour deputy to Fine Gael Cathaoirleach James Dooge. Labour's Evelyn Owens was elected as Leas-Chathaoirleach, but Ahern won the support not just of her Fianna F√°il colleagues but also of Mary Robinson then an independent senator, and later President of Ireland. She was also a member of Kerry County Council, to which she was first elected in 1967, and from 1977 to 1978 she was the Councils' first woman Cathaoirleach (chairperson). D√°il success came with Fianna F√°il's landslide victory at the 1977 general election, when she was elected as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Kerry North. It was also the first time that two Fianna F√°il TDs had been elected in the Kerry North constituency, the other deputy being Tom McEllistrim. Ahern only served one term as in D√°il √âireann, as she lost her seat at the 1981 general election and retired from national politics. After retirement, she joined the Progressive Democrats in 1985. Ahern was a lifelong promoter of the Irish language and the aunt of the famous Kerry Gaelic footballer Eoin Liston. She was also President of the Kerry Historical and Archaeological Society. When she died in Tralee, aged almost 93, she was the oldest surviving former member of the Oireachtas. Her husband Dan, a national school teacher, had died before her. Her cousin, Fianna F√°il Senator Ned O'Sullivan described Ahern as a highly principled woman, and said that \\"Kit Ahern had more integrity in her little finger than most of us have in our entire bodies\\".

Partly inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's work and nonviolent resistance in general, he is notable for his series of one-man protests against the Berlin Wall during the 1980s. These culminated in the construction of a largely symbolic, car-mounted battering ram. This particular action landed him with an 18-month prison sentence from the East German authorities. He was released after three months. The battering ram is exhibited in the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. Runnings was born on a homestead in Manitoba, Canada. His mother died of influenza when he was about one year of age. His father, who now had several children to care for alone, decided, as Runnings put it, to \\"farm out\\" most of the children to relatives. Runnings' father's sister, who lived in southern Ontario, reluctantly agreed to become Runnings' guardian until he came of age. Runnings lived on her farm until about age 25, when he realised he had failed to register for the draft, so, during 1943, he was drafted. He became a stretcher-bearer, and served on the western front, mostly in the Allied invasion of Belgium, France and Germany, seeing many of his fellow soldiers die and often coming quite close to being hit by artillery bombardment. After the war he decided to join his brother, who lived in Seattle. Around age 30, he met his future wife, Louise. They eventually joined the Quakers. They married when Runnings was in his early 30s and continued to live in Seattle. They eventually had four children: Bryan, Runnings' first child, was named after John - \\"Bryan\\" meaning \\"John\\" in Irish Gaelic. His other children are Morgan, Gwyneth and Anna. About 1980 Runnings, along with other Quakers, got involved in the \\"Stop Trident\\" {nuclear submarines} movement in Bangor, Washington. After being arrested a few times, Runnings began to develop a perspective of his own as regards the problems associated with the Cold War. He began to advocate a totally new method during this period, when Cold War threats had become more dangerous to life on earth than at any other time in human history. He suggested a movement to federate the United States and the Soviet Union. He also suggested that all should be considered \\"world citizens\\" rather than \\"citizens of specific nations.\\" For this reason, he refused to apply for a passport prior to his decision to travel to Moscow in 1985. He first attempt at \\"international civil disobedience\\" action began with a plan to make a friendly gesture to the Soviet Union by attempting to visit Odessa, in a large boat he repaired for that purpose. Unfortunately this plan failed because Runnings' partner decided to drop out of the plan and keep the boat entirely for his own after Runnings had done most of the repairs himself. Runnings considered taking civil action but finally decided it would take too much energy away from his overall mission. A year after the Odessa plan, Runnings decided he would attempt to go to Berlin without a passport and there begin to take a sledgehammer to the Berlin Wall, hoping to inspire Germans to do the same. Several times in the early 1980s he attempted to fly out of New York and Boston airports with this intention. Each time he was arrested for persistent attempts to board commercial jets without a passport. On one occasion, he was sentenced to a period in Deer Island Prison near Boston, but was released early because of his persistence in going on hunger strikes and inspiring other prisoners to do the same. After a number of similar imprisonments, Runnings decided in 1985 that he would apply for a passport. He planned to first visit Moscow during 1985 and the following year, he would use a passport to visit Berlin. Once convinced to get a passport, Runnings went on to Moscow and leafletted all around Red Square for nearly a week. The Soviet authorities would have him taken to a police station about once every day or two and they would try to convince him to quit his leafletting. In his words, he would not say either \\"yes sir\\" or \\"no sir\\", but each time they released him, he would go back to leafletting, sometimes near Red Square, and sometimes he would take a subway to the suburbs. Finally, after nearly two weeks of \\"playing this police station game\\", the Soviet authorities got \\"really tired\\" of Runnings' persistence. One day they told him they wanted to move him to another \\"more convenient\\" hotel. They came with an Intourist vehicle, picked him up (he co- operated because he believed them) and took him to the Moscow airport where they put him on board a jet with no passengers, only stewardesses - about 150 seats and he was the only passenger. The plane took off and the next thing he noticed was they were coming in for landing over an expanse of what seemed like endless forests and lakes. It was Helsinki, but as he could see, the Soviets wanted him out of Moscow. A year later, Runnings went to Berlin to knock chunks out of the Wall and finally got arrested by East German guards and put in their jail for over three months. At the time, his back was injured, and Runnings was in extreme chronic pain. They finally released him through a West Berlin gate.

These conditions all produce elevation of interleukin-6, which stimulates hepcidin production and release from the liver, which in turn shuts down ferroportin, a protein that controls export of iron from the gut and from iron storing cells (e.g. macrophages). As a consequence, circulating iron levels are reduced. Other mechanisms may also play a role, such as reduced erythropoiesis. Anemia of chronic inflammation is the preferred term since not all chronic diseases are associated with this form of anemia. Classification Anemia of chronic disease is usually mild but can be severe. It is usually normocytic, but can be microcytic. The presence of both anemia of chronic disease and dietary iron deficiency results in a more severe anemia. Pathophysiology Anemia is defined by hemoglobin (Hb) concentration * < 13.0 g/dL (130 g/L) in males * < 11.5 g/dL (115 g/L) in females In response to inflammatory cytokines, increasingly IL-6, the liver produces increased amounts of hepcidin. Hepcidin in turn causes increased internalisation of ferroportin molecules on cell membranes which prevents release from iron stores. Inflammatory cytokines also appear to affect other important elements of iron metabolism, including decreasing ferroportin expression, and probably directly blunting erythropoiesis by decreasing the ability of the bone marrow to respond to erythropoietin. Before the recent discovery of hepcidin and its function in iron metabolism, anemia of chronic disease was seen as the result of a complex web of inflammatory changes. Over the last few years, however, many investigators have come to feel that hepcidin is the central actor in producing anemia of chronic inflammation. Hepcidin provides a unifying explanation for the condition, and more recent descriptions of human iron metabolism and hepcidin function reflect this view. In addition to effects of iron sequestration, inflammatory cytokines promote the production of white blood cells. Bone marrow produces both white blood cells and red blood cells from the same precursor stem cells. Therefore, the upregulation of white blood cells causes fewer stem cells to differentiate into red blood cells. This effect may be an important additional cause for the decreased erythropoiesis and red blood cell production seen in anemia of inflammation, even when erythropoietin levels are normal, and even aside from the effects of hepcidin. Nonetheless, there are other mechanisms that also contribute to the lowering of hemoglobin levels during inflammation: (i) Inflammatory cytokines suppress the proliferation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow.;Maury CPJ, Andersson LC, Teppo AM et al. Mechanism of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis: Demonstration of raised interleukin-1 beta concentrations in anemic patients and of interleukin-1 mediated suppression of normal erythropoiesis and proliferation of human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells in vitro. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 47 (1988) 972-978. (ii) inflammatory cytokines inhibit the release of erythropoietin (EPO) from the kidney; and (iii) the survival of circulating red cells is shortened. In the short term, the overall effect of these changes is likely positive: it allows the body to keep more iron away from bacterial pathogens in the body, while producing more immune cells to fight off infection. Almost all bacteria depend on iron to live and multiply. However, if inflammation continues, the effect of locking up iron stores is to reduce the ability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. These cells require iron for their massive amounts of hemoglobin which allow them to transport oxygen. Because anemia of chronic disease can be the result of non-infective causes of inflammation, future research is likely to investigate whether hepcidin antagonists might be able to treat this problem. Anemia of chronic disease may also be due to neoplastic disorders and non-infectious inflammatory diseases. Neoplastic disorders include Hodgkin‚Äôs disease lung and breast carcinoma and non-infectious inflammatory diseases include celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Anemia of chronic disease as it is now understood is to at least some degree separate from the anemia seen in kidney failure in which anemia results from reduced production of erythropoietin, or the anemia caused by some drugs (like AZT, used to treat HIV infection) that have the side effect of inhibiting erythropoiesis. In other words, not all anemia seen in people with chronic disease should be diagnosed as anemia of chronic disease. On the other hand, both of these examples show the complexity of this diagnosis: HIV infection itself can produce anemia of chronic disease, and kidney failure can lead to inflammatory changes that also can produce anemia of chronic disease. Diagnosis While no single test is reliable to distinguish iron deficiency anemia from the anemia of chronic inflammation, there are sometimes some suggestive data: * In anemia of chronic inflammation without iron deficiency, ferritin is normal or high, reflecting the fact that iron is sequestered within cells, and ferritin is being produced as an acute phase reactant. In iron deficiency anemia ferritin is low. * Total iron- binding capacity (TIBC) is high in iron deficiency, reflecting production of more transferrin to increase iron binding; TIBC is low or normal in anemia of chronic inflammation. Treatment The ideal treatment for anemia of chronic disease is to treat the chronic disease successfully, but this is rarely possible. Parenteral iron is increasingly used for anemia in chronic renal disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Erythropoietin can be helpful, but this is costly and may be dangerous.Anemia of chronic disease at Mount Sinai Hospital Erythropoietin is advised either in conjunction with adequate iron replacement which in practice is intravenous, or when IV iron has proved ineffective. Limiting some microbes' access to iron can reduce their virulence, thereby potentially reducing the severity of infection. Blood transfusion to patients with anemia of chronic disease is associated with a higher mortality, supporting the concept.

Synopsis The cartoon begins as Huey, Dewey and Louie visit their wealthy Uncle Scrooge McDuck in his bank vault and explain that they want to deposit their money, which totals a considerable $1.95. Scrooge discusses the history of money, explaining that ancient Roman soldiers were paid in salt that was called \\"salarium,\\" which lead to the phrase \\"worth his salt\\" and where the word \\"salary\\" came from. He then adds that a Spanish piece of eight is made up of smaller \\"bits,\\" and that ancient Greek obols were tiny enough to be carried in the mouth, thus the phrase \\"cough up.\\" Scrooge also shows his nephews a large stone wheel from the Island of Yap and going even further back in time, he explains that earliest cavemen attempted to trade goods with one another but soon realized that they \\"needed money,\\" or a stable standard of value at which to price different items. Many different objects of silver, copper, bronze and gold were used as currency until eventually coins and paper bills were invented, and cheques and credit cards came along when it became impractical to carry one's cash around at all times. When the nephews suggest simply printing \\"a few billion more dollars,\\" Scrooge explains that a billion is actually far more than they think and that making more money would lead to dangerous inflation. He describes that it's what you can buy with what you've got is what counts, and that it's a question of economics, and how one must balance one's budget like the pieces of a pie to live comfortable, adding that income tax pays for everything from schools to roads and must be factored in as well. He clarifies that his enormous vault holds only \\"petty cash\\" and that money must circulate \\"like ocean currents\\" to keep the world moving, and advises his nephews to invest their money very wisely to make it grow. He then agrees to deposit it for them - for a 3¬¢ fee. Scrooge concludes that investing wisely is an art.

Macleans.com He resigned suddenly from the Senate due to ill health on August 2, 2013. Early life Born in Kuroki, Saskatchewan, he received a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Saskatchewan in 1973. Business career From 1979 to 1983, he was Vice President of Corporate Communications for CanWest Capital Corporation. He was then Director of Marketing and Communications for the Manitoba Lotteries Foundation (1985‚Äì1993). From 1989 to 1991, he was president of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and from 1981 to 1993 he was a member of the board of directors for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He served as Vice President for the Festivals for the Pan American Games Society Inc. from 1995 to 1998. Before being appointed to the Senate, he was the President of The Gatehouse Corporation, a position he has held since 1993. Political career From 1968 to 1971, Zimmer was an assistant to Cyril MacDonald, the Liberal Minister of Welfare in Saskatchewan, for most of the 1970s he was an assistant to James Richardson, the Minister of Defence. He was the Manitoba chair for the federal Liberal campaign in 1980. In 1999, Zimmer was reportedly among the final two candidates for the posting of Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien chose the other finalist, Peter Liba. Zimmer was a member of the fundraising committee for Paul Martin‚Äôs leadership campaign in 2003 and revenue chair for the Liberal Party of Canada in Manitoba from 2004 to 2006.

Barca is a lifelong resident of the Kenosha area. Barca represented the northern part of the city of Kenosha and surrounding areas in the Wisconsin State Assembly for nine terms, covering the years 1985 through 1993 and 2009 through 2019, and was the Democratic floor leader from 2011 through 2017. He also served as a member of the 103rd U.S. Congress between 1993 and 1995, and was the Midwest Regional Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration during the presidency of Bill Clinton. Early life and education Barca was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 7, 1955, and spent his entire youth in the Kenosha area. He graduated from Mary D. Bradford High School in 1973 and earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. He attended Harvard Graduate School and went on to earn an M.A. in public administration and educational administration from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1983. Starting his career as a teacher of the emotionally disturbed and a team leader for students with special needs, Barca went on to become the Director of the Friendship Camp, a camp for children with disabilities. He also served as an employment specialist. Wisconsin State Assembly Barca entered politics in 1984 when he won his first election to the State Assembly, succeeding Joseph Wimmer in the 64th District. At the time, the 64th District had just been redrawn to cover the northern half of the city of Kenosha and the town of Somers. During his initial tenure in the State Capitol, Barca authored and passed a wide variety of proposals covering issues such as economic development, protection for seniors and the disabled, education, employment and job training, criminal justice, and environmental protection. He also worked closely with the Kenosha delegation to help pass legislation that led to the creation of the Lakeview Corporate Park. Barca also chaired several special legislative committees that led to Wisconsin‚Äôs nationally recognized welfare reform program, implemented the award-winning 'one stop shop' employment and training systems, and developed the roadmap for rail services between Kenosha and Milwaukee. In 1991 and 1993, Barca was elected Majority Caucus Chairperson in the State Assembly. Barca resigned his seat in 1993 after being elected to U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Congress In early 1993, newly-inaugurated President Bill Clinton appointed 22-year incumbent congressman Les Aspin as United States Secretary of Defense. Aspin therefore had to resign his seat in Wisconsin's 1st congressional district and a special election was called to fill the balance of his term in the 103rd United States Congress. Barca narrowly won a competitive Democratic Primary election, fending off fellow State Assemblymembers Jeffrey A. Neubauer of Racine and Wayne W. Wood of Janesville. In the general election, Barca faced Republican Mark Neumann, who had been Aspin's opponent in November 1992. Barca won by only 675 votes, mainly due to a weak showing in Racine. Neumann, in turn, defeated Barca in the regular 1994 election 17 months later. Post- Congressional career After Barca narrowly lost his re-election bid, President Clinton appointed him to serve as Midwest Regional Administrator to the U.S. Small Business Administration. He also served as National Ombudsman to the SBA. Barca was also leader of the National Regulatory Fairness Program, an initiative which included more than fifty company presidents throughout the country aimed at making regulatory enforcement small business friendly. He later went on to become Vice President and then President of Aurora Associates International, an international project management company. Return to politics In November 2008, after a 14-year absence, Barca was elected to represent the 64th District once again. He was again chosen to be Majority Caucus Chairperson, and served as co-chair of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, and chair of the Partnership for a Stronger Economy. As chair of the Partnership for a Stronger Economy, Barca traveled the state meeting with various small businesses owners and economic development professionals to craft an economic plan for Wisconsin. The Partnership led the way in helping to pass over 50 economic initiatives in the 2009‚Äì10 legislative session, including the Small Business Capital Access Program and the Entrepreneurial Assistance Grant Program, both authored by Barca. In the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans won complete control of government in Wisconsin. Following the election, Barca was elected by his colleagues to serve as Assembly Democratic Leader in the 100th Wisconsin Legislative Session. He remained leader of the Democratic minority until September 2017, when he stepped down to focus more attention on his own constituency. In the 2011 legislative session, Barca rose to national prominence as a leader in the struggle against Governor Scott Walker's proposed changes to collective bargaining in Wisconsin. Barca also led Assembly Democrats in protesting the Republicans' alleged violation of open meetings laws. Barca authored legislation to ban text messaging while driving in Wisconsin.Patrick Marley, \\"Texting ban for drivers begins\\". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 11/30/2010 On January 7, 2019, newly-inaugurated Governor of Wisconsin Tony Evers nominated Mr. Barca to serve as Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. Barca resigned his Assembly seat the next day. The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Revenue and Financial Institutions unanimously approved his nomination on February 22, 2019, and the full Senate confirmed his appointment on October 8, 2019. Redistricting For most of his career representing the 64th District, his constituency was drawn to cover the northern half of the city of Kenosha and a portion of the town of Somers, in Kenosha County. In 2011, however, the new Republican majority used their power to redraw the state's legislative maps. Barca's district was altered to add southern portions of Racine County, including the village of Elmwood Park, as well as parts of the village of Mount Pleasant and the city of Racine. The redrawn map was designed by the new Republican majority to remove Democratic-leaning precincts from what had been the 62nd assembly district, and by doing so, also removing those precincts from the 21st senate district, which is defined by the boundaries of the 61st, 62nd and 63rd assembly districts. This, along with other changes, successfully gerrymandered the previously-competitive 62nd assembly and 21st senate districts into safely Republican seats.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 6, 2005. In the sixteenth annual Treehouse of Horror, the Simpsons replace Bart with a robot son after Bart falls into a coma, Homer and various other male characters find themselves on a reality show where Mr. Burns hunts humans for sport, and costumed Springfieldians become whatever they are wearing, thanks to a witch who was disqualified from a Halloween costume contest. It was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by David Silverman. Terry Bradshaw and Dennis Rodman guest star as themselves. Around 11.63 million Americans tuned in to watch the episode during its original broadcast. Plot In the opening, Kang hopes to speed up an exceedingly slow and boring baseball game, despite Kodos' protests, but ends up destroying the universe when the baseball players go so fast, they turn into a killer vortex which sucks up the universe, even God. When Kodos berates Kang off-camera for destroying the universe, Kang responds by leaving a post-it note on the white void, revealing the title of the episode. =B.I. Bartificial Intelligence= In this Spoof of A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Bart winds up in a two-week coma after attempting to jump out of a window into a swimming pool. The family takes in a robotic boy, named David, who quickly proves to be a better son. Bart wakes up from his two-week coma and competes against David for the affection of the rest of his family. However, Bart is dumped on a road by Homer, who decides to keep David instead. When Bart finds a group of old rusty robots, he steals their parts to become a cyborg, returns home and saws David in half with a chainsaw when David tries to use Homer as a shield, and Bart (angry that Homer abandoned him) cuts through both of them. Although the family is now together again, Homer is angry that he has to be fused with David's lower half, which soon collapses due to Homer's weight. Suddenly, the whole scenario is revealed to be a dream conjured by Homer's demonically possessed mind as he is being exorcised. Marge reluctantly says she will call work and tell them Homer cannot make it in, much to his delight. =Survival of the Fattest= In a parody of the 1924 Richard Connell short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", men from Springfield arrive at Mr. Burns' mansion to go hunting. Unbeknownst to them, they are the prey to be hunted and broadcast on television. Homer manages to survive the night while the others are killed left and right, but Burns closes in on him in the morning. Just as he is about to be shot, Burns and Smithers are knocked out by Marge with a frying pan in each hand, who then hits Homer on the head for being away from home for 18 hours without calling, before they end up having make-up sex behind the astonished newscasters. =I've Grown a Costume on Your Face= In a parody of Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge, the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode \\"Halloween\\" and the classic Twilight Zone episode \\"The Masks\\", the citizens of Springfield dress in their Halloween costumes for a costume contest that involves courage, bravery and happiness. The winner is declared to be a strange old witch with a green skin and a black-and-red suit. When given the award and asked who she is, she is forced to admit that she is a real witch. As a result, her reward is rescinded because she is not in actual costume and is sentenced to four weeks in jail as a punishment for admitting a secret silliness. In anger of such harsh punishment, she turns everyone into their costumed characters, just before being put into custody. The only person who can reverse the spell is Maggie, who was costumed as a witch. Maggie turns them all into pacifiers with their normal heads instead, flying off on a broom to seek help after this mistake she made. The segment ends as Moe and a transformed Dennis Rodman talk to the audience about the importance of reading, before Maggie returns and casts another spell, presumably turning everyone back to normal.

It was the last attempt to extract performance from the basic Polikarpov I-16 design.Green 1973, p. 165. The development cycle was plagued with problems,Abanshin and Gut 1994, p. 52.Gordon and Khazanov 1998, p. 111. especially with the death of the star Soviet test pilot Valery Chkalov in one of the prototypes. Design and development The I-180 represented a further development of the basic I-16 design in order to take advantage of the new radial engines coming into service. It was designed to meet a requirement of the Soviet Air Force of January 1938 for a new interceptor aircraft with a radial engine. It was preceded by a series of projected I-16 variants with a more powerful Tumansky M-88 two-row radial engine: I-161, I-162, I-163, I-164, I-165, I-166 and I-167. The I-180 was a single-engine, low-wing monoplane aircraft of mixed construction with a duraluminum frame covered in plywood and fabric. The pilot sat near the tailfin in an open cockpit with a windshield similar to the I-16. The landing gear was retracted pneumatically, including the tail wheel. The main visual difference between the I-180 and I-16 was a new wing with a perpendicular straight leading edge, and an aerodynamically refined fuselage with a longer slim engine cowling. The new fighter was to be powered by an 820 kW (1,100 hp) M-88 engine, a development of the license- built Gnome-Rh√¥ne Mistral Major (known as M-85 in the USSR), and represented the next step in evolution from the 1937 I-165-11 prototype. The proposed armament consisted of four 7.62 mm (0.3 in) ShKAS machine guns and 200 kg (440 lb) of bombs. Dmitriy Tomashevich was assigned as the lead designer. The ill- fated development of the I-180 started early on. The only version of the M-88 available at the time used reduction gear requiring a very large propeller, at least in diameter ‚Äì massive for an aircraft that in layout and dimensions resembled an I-16 with an elongated nose. Even before leaving the drawing board, the fighter had to be redesigned for an M-88R engine with reduction gear and a constant-speed propeller. The projected top speed fell from 572 km/h (355 mph) to 557 km/h (345 mph). The first prototype, however, was eventually fitted with a similar M-87 950 hp engine, because the M-88R was not ready.Maslov 2003 The prototype was built at Number 156 Factory in Moscow. Testing and evaluation The VISh-23Ye propeller was delayed, and early test runs were conducted using a different propeller with manual pitch control (VISh-3Ye). Consequently, the engine was prone to overheating, and to compensate for this the cowling flaps restricting airflow around the engine were removed. Despite these problems, and the fact that the prototype had not completed all ground tests, the authorities were demanding a test flight as soon as possible. Polikarpov himself objected to flying the prototype before it would be ready, around February 1939, but he could not stop it. The series of events which took place on 15 December 1938, while not entirely clear, are tragic. Neither Polikarpov nor Tomashevich approved the initial flight, and no one had signed the form releasing the prototype from the factory. The famous Soviet test pilot Valery Chkalov took off and made a low-altitude circuit around the airfield. For the second circuit, Chkalov flew farther away, climbing to over 2,000 m (6,560 ft), even though the flight plan specifically forbade exceeding 600 m (1,970 ft). Chkalov apparently miscalculated his landing approach and came in short of the airfield but, when he attempted to correct, the engine stalled. The pilot was able to avoid several buildings but crashed into a power line. Chkalov was thrown from the cockpit, badly injured, and died two hours later. The official government investigation concluded that the engine stalled because it became too cold in the absence of the cowl flaps. Others hypothesized that Chkalov rapidly advanced the throttle and flooded the engine. As the result of the crash, Tomashevich and several other officials, including Arms Industry Department director S. Belyakin, who urged the first flight, were immediately arrested. Years later, fellow test pilot M.M. Gromov blamed the designers for flawed engine cooling and Chkalov himself for deviating from the flight plan. Chkalov's son also claimed that a plot to assassinate his father had been brewing in the months preceding his death, but the circumstances of the crash make foul play unlikely. Regardless, with Chkalov's death Polikarpov's reputation with Joseph Stalin suffered a blow from which he would never recover. Nevertheless, work on the I-180 continued. The second prototype I-180-2 with a bigger wingspan of 10.09 m (33 ft 1 in) and M-87A engine flew on 27 April 1939, and participated in the May Day parade a few days later. Later, the engine was changed to the M-87B and the wing construction was strengthened. The prototype demonstrated a top speed of 540 km/h (335 mph) and was recommended for mass production with the M-88 engine. Then, on 5 September 1939, I-180-2 piloted by Tomas Suzi crashed during high- altitude testing, killing the pilot. Again, the exact circumstances of the crash were unclear. According to eyewitnesses, the aircraft dove steeply (others claimed it fell in a spin) to 3,000 m (9,840 t) where it leveled out, then entered a spin again, leveling out once more at 300 m (985 ft). The pilot then abandoned the aircraft but did not use his parachute. No definite explanation was ever given but hypotheses include blinding of the pilot by oil from a leaking oil cooler, a heart attack, or loss of consciousness due to the failure of oxygen equipment. Preparations were carried out in 1940 to produce the first batch of 10 aircraft at Factory No.21 in Gorki, engaged in manufacturing the I-16. However, their production was extremely slow, without much attention of the aviation authorities, with the first 10 aircraft taking more than eight months. One of the reasons for this was that the local OKB led by M.M. Pashinin was designing their own I-16 based fighter, the Pashinin I-21 and factory management had devoted all of their resources to the hometown favorite, with only six brand new engineers assigned to production of the I-180. While this was being investigated, the third prototype I-180-3, powered by a more powerful M-88R engine and fitted with a stressed skin wing (replacing the I-16 type wing structure of the previous prototypes) was completed, flying on 10 February 1940.Gunston 1995, p. 307. It was armed with two 12.7 mm Berezin BS and two 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns on a common gunbed over the engine. The second Polikarpov I-180S (production series) crashed at Khodynka Aerodrome on 26 May 1940 Finally in April 1940, three aircraft designated I-180S were completed, these being similar to the I-180-3, but reverting to an open cockpit and the I-16 type wing structure.Gunston 1995, p. 308. Their test flights were favorable. The new fighter resembled I-16 in agility but was more stable. Top speed was 575 km/h (357 mph). Major criticisms included the open canopy and poor build quality. It was believed that fixing these defects would raise the top speed to 600 km/h (373 mph). However, the I-180-3 prototype crashed on 6 July 1940, when it entered an inverted spin due to pilot error. The pilot was able to safely bail out. In preparation for production, Polikarpov produced the definitive I-180-5 with several modifications and M-88A engine without reduction gear. The aircraft could also accept the new M-89 engine with 1,007 kW (1,350 hp) (up to 1,165 kW (1,560 hp) with fuel injection) which would raise its top speed to over 650 km/h (404 mph). There was also a proposal for the I-180Sh with improved main landing gear. Then, near the end of 1940, Polikarpov was suddenly informed that the I-180 was being cancelled, and that Factory no.21 would manufacture LaGG-3 fighters instead. The reason for this was a misconception of the Ministry of Aviation Industry, that radial engines in NACA cowlings were poorly suited for aircraft with top speeds of over 500 km/h (310 mph), owing to high drag. Former government officials later admitted that the fascination with liquid-cooled engines stemmed in part from attempts to imitate the then state-of-the-art Messerschmitt Bf 109. Stalin's dislike for Polikarpov after Chkalov's death probably also played a role. According to some recent historians, such as Mikhail Maslov, the cancellation of the I-180 was caused by personal and non content-related reasons and might be considered an error.Guglya and Ivanov Especially after Chkalov's death, the Soviet authorities started to promote young designers, in preference to Polikarpov, despite the fact that the I-180 was the best performing Soviet fighter at the time of its cancellation and that it was faster than the Bf 109. One prototype series I-180 developed a speed of 585 km/h, that could be improved after projected changes, such as adding a closed canopy. The next best fighter, Yakovlev's I-26 (Yak-1 prototype), suffered from a troublesome and protracted development cycle, but Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev was one of Stalin's favorites, which most probably saved his design. In addition, the I-180 could have been available much earlier than the Yak-1 and LaGG-3 types, and there was the possibility of producing it with a temporary M-87 engine, until the M-88 could be improved. Crashes of I-180 prototypes were mostly accidental, and should not be regarded as disqualifying the design. Moreover, the I-180 showed much fewer \\"teething problems\\" than its counterparts, especially the Yak-1, confirming Polikarpov's competence in aircraft design. Another advantage was that the construction of the I-180 was similar to the I-16, which was familiar to the Soviet industry and pilots, but handling of the I-180 was even easier and it was more stable. The same situation recurred with Polikarpov's next design, the advanced I-185, based on the I-180 design.

Beato and Felice Antonio Beato are collective signatures used by the brothers Felice Beato and Antonio Beato, who were both pioneering photographers in the 19th century. They were noted for their depictions of everyday life in Orient. Description The brothers sometimes worked together, signing their photographs collectively. Consequently, it was long assumed that such photographs were the work of one photographer who somehow managed to photograph at the same time in places as distant as Egypt and Japan. It was only in 1983 that the truth of the matter was revealed, in a paper by Italo Zannier.Zannier, Italo. Verso oriente: Fotografie di Antonio e Felice Beato, Florence: Alinari, 1986. The confusion arising from the signatures continues to cause problems in identifying which of the two photographers was the creator of a given image. Both signatures may refer to either or both photographers. The brothers were active in the Middle East and Asia from the early 1850s through to the early 20th century and were among the very first photographers to take photographs of the Orient. At that time, tourist travel to Middle East created strong demand for photographs as souvenirs. The Beato brothers were part of a group of early photographers who made their way to the East to capitalise on this demand. These pioneering photographers included Frenchmen, F√©lix Bonfils (1831-1885); Gustave Le Gray (1820-1884) and Hippolyte Arnoux, brothers Henri and Emile Bechard and the Greek Zangaki brothers, many of whom were in Egypt at the same time and entered into both formal and informal working partnerships.Jacobson, K., Odalisques and Arabesques: Orientalist Photography, 1839-1925, London, Bernard Quaritch, 2007, p. 277. These early photographers, including the Beato Brothers, were among the first commercial photographers to produce images on a large scale in the Middle East. From time to time, the brothers split up and joined with other pioneering photographers for specific projects. In 1855, one of the brothers, Felix, teamed up with the pair's brother-in-law, James Robertson and travelled to the Crimea where they assumed responsibility for war photography.Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, p. 128; Greenough, p. 21; Pare, \\"Roger Fenton\\", p. 226. and made their reputation by depicting the destruction and death associated with the conflict. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.Gartlan, L., \\"James Robertson and Felice Beato in the Crimea: Recent Findings,\\" History of Photography, Vol. 29, No. 1, 2005, pp 72-80 In July 1858 Antonio joined Felice in Calcutta. Felice had been in India since the beginning of the year photographing the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but Antonio left India the following year for health reasons, and headed for Malta by way of Suez. By the early 1860, Antonio was in Cairo where he opened a photographic studio and went into partnership with the French photographer, Hippolyte Arnoux.Jacobson, K., Odalisques and Arabesques: Orientalist Photography, 1839-1925, London, Bernard Quaritch, 2007, p. 277. By 1863 Felice was living and working in Japan.Bennett, T., History of Photography in China, 1842‚Äì1860, London, Bernard Quaritch, 2009, p. 141 and 241. The Beato Brothers images of Egypt were distinctly different to those of other pioneering photographers working in the Orient. Whereas most photographers focussed on the grandeur of monuments and architecture, the Beatos concentrated on scenes of everyday life.Hannavy, J.

August Joseph Ignaz Toepler (7 September 1836 ‚Äì 6 March 1912) was a German physicist known for his experiments in electrostatics. Biography August Toepler was born on 7 September 1836. He studied chemistry at the Gewerbe- Institut Berlin (1855‚Äì1858) and graduated from the University of Jena in 1860. Later Toepler turned to experimental physics. August Toepler was a lecturer of chemistry and physics at the Academy Poppelsdorf (1859-1864). He received a chair of chemistry and chemical technology at the Polytechnic Institute of Riga and he hold this position between 1864 and 1868. In 1864, he applied Foucault's knife-edge test for telescope mirrors to the analysis of fluid flow and the shock wave. He named this new method schlieren photography, for which he is justifiably famous. He also developed the Toepler machine, an electrostatic influence machine (high voltage generator) in 1865, which would one day find use in early medical x-ray machines. Improved versions were produced by Wilhelm Holtz, Roger and J. Robert Voss. In 1868, he became a professor at the University of Graz in Austria, where under his administration a new physical institute has appeared. In 1876, Toepler came to Dresden where he was offered the chair of Experimental Physics. He was a director of the Physical Institute at the Dresden Technical University till his retirement in 1900. His son Maximilian Toepler continued the scientific work independently. Toepler is remembered as an inventor of electrostatic machines, and for his work with air pumps and acoustic waves. Toepler described also a symmetrical machine (1866) that is a sectorless machine and a similar device is used as a voltage multiplier. Toepler‚Äôs electrostatic machines were made by different people and companies, e.g. a Toepler machine can be found in a Welch Scientific Company (Chicago, USA) catalog. The differences between a Toepler machine, a Holtz machine, and a Toepler-Holtz machine are unclear even in books written when they were vital, modern technology. Sometimes such a machine is called a Holtz-Toepler machine simply because it was made by Holtz, but the original design is still the same as the Toepler machine. This model of an electrostatic induction generator, very much in vogue for electromedical purposes towards the end of the nineteenth century, is based on the principles of electrophorus and duplicator function. It is derived from the mechanical improvements made between 1865 and 1880 by the physicist August Topler, the German physicist Wilhelm Holtz (1836-1913) and by J. Robert Voss, a mechanician from Berlin. Voss devised this self-excitation model in 1880, perfecting a machine presented by Topler the previous year. The machine rests upon a footed walnut base. A column horizontally supports the axis of rotation. Two thin, shellacked, parallel glass disks in close proximity one to the other are vertically hinged to this axis. The larger of the two (the rear one), is a fixed disk and rests on the base along the groove of an ebonite insulation disk; the other (the front one), is a smaller mobile disk and rotates by means of a crank that controls a pair of pulleys connected by a cord. On its outer side, the fixed disk carries the inductors, two strips of tinfoil glued in the middle of two, broad paper shields placed diametrically, one beside the other. The mobile disk carries the Toepler-Voss self-excitation system consisting of six metallic buttons, each surrounded by a ring of tinfoil, placed equidistantly in a circle. Two small metal brushes rub against the buttons; the brushes are fixed to a curved conductor (covered with ebonite) that is clamped to the disks at opposite points and is in contact with the inductor‚Äôs tinfoil strips. In front of the buttons, fixed to the edge of the mobile disk towards the horizontal diameter, two brass collection combs, each having 10 points, are positioned in the direction of the disk. The combs are in contact with the inner shields of two Leiden jars, and with the arms of the spark-gap, two brass bars equipped with spherules and insulation handles, into which the sparks are released. The outer shields of the Leiden jars rest on two brass disks electrically connected by a metallic wire, which passes along the base. A second pair of collection combs, facing the mobile disk, each with eight points and a central metal brush that rubs against the buttons, comprises the so-called ‚Äúdiametrical conductor‚Äù. The ‚Äúdiametrical conductor‚Äù is inclined at 45¬∞ with respect to the horizontal diameter and allowed for the polarity of the linings to be maintained unaltered, especially when the exciting dynamos moved farther away than their normal explosive distance. Not even a weak initial charge is needed to start the machine; the self-excitation system automatically starts by turning the mobile disk clock- wise (when viewed from the front of the machine) using the special crank. The quantity of charge captured through induction by the combs is collected by the two mobile, brass collection rings, the terminal spherules of the spark-gap are each charged by the opposite sign with respect to the sign of the comb with which they are in contact. In this manner the machine is able to produce sparks, at times very long ones, especially if the poles of the spark-gap are in contact with the internal shields of the two Leiden jars. Standard direct current was not always available at the turn of the century so that Toepler- Holtz electrostatic generators were used to provide physicians with current for treatment as well as to power the first x-ray devices. They were fairly common and advertised in the Sears catalogue with numerous accessories. This machine built in an oak-and-glass cabinet is a Toepler-Holtz generator made by the Betz company of Chicago ( 1900). It was intended for medical use, and has an X-ray tube controller as an integral part. This machine is of the Toepler- Holtz design and comes from the late 1890s. It was sold to practicing physicians as a potential source for the excitation of X-ray tubes. For this it works quite well, yielding about 1 mA at 80 kV at moderate rates of rotation. Accessories to be found in the drawers are for ‚Äúelectrical treatment‚Äù for such things as baldness, lameness, etc. Most are systems of points designed to produce brush discharges. A low table with glass legs is included for electric isolation of the patient. Some of the devices look as though they are instruments of torture even without the application of electricity. The case enclosing the plates should not be opened except for repairs. The machine is operated by turning the crank counterclockwise as one looks at the front. A rotary switch at the center connects or disconnects the Leyden jars to the terminals. The pictured generator is one of the larger types and is made up of 24 glass plates, 6 sets of four each, which were rotated to produce current for therapy. It was made by an unknown maker (Wagner?), 1910. August and Maximilian Toepler started research in the field of gas discharge physics at the Dresden University of Technology. This research particularly resulted in the development of the Schlieren technique. With the application of the ‚Äústreak method‚Äù Toepler succeeded as the first scientist in making acoustic waves in the air visible. This method was found to be also important for the high-speed cinematography. Motion pictures have also been used to study phenomena that occur so fast that they cannot be recorded on normal cameras. An immense amount of ingenuity has been applied to the solution of many problems in this field. Schlieren optical system The principal of Toepler's Schlieren photography, known as the Foucault knife-edge test, was originally developed as a sensitive test for lenses, mirrors, and other optical components by L√©on Foucault in 1859. Toepler was the first to modify the principle for real time observation of liquid or gaseous flow and sound waves, where it continues to be widely used. Trivia Toepler's son Maximilien Toepler was also a physicist, and worked independently in the same field. Toepler was also famous for inventing the Toepler Pump as seen in the bottom right hand picture.

They have long been regarded as closely related or even ancestral to jawed vertebrates, but the few characteristics they share with the latter are now considered as basal traits for all vertebrates. Characteristics Various pteraspidomorphs Pteraspidomorphs are characterized by their massive dermal head armour having large, median, ventral and dorsal plates or shields.Janvier, Philippe (1997) Pteraspidomorphi The Tree of Life Web Project. The fossils show extensive shielding of the head. Many had hypocercal tails in order to generate lift to increase ease of movement through the water for their armoured bodies, which were covered in dermal bone. They also had sucking mouth parts and some species may have lived in fresh water. Most pteraspidomorphs were marine, but lived very near to the shore, in lagoons and deltas. Some groups are thought to have been fresh water-dwelling. They were certainly bottom-dwellers, as shown by traces of abrasion of the ventral surfaces of their headshields. Classification Pteraspidomorphs have been first regarded as related to bony fishes, then to sharks, then ancestral to hagfishes, and finally as the closest jawless relatives of the gnathostomes. This last theory was based on the fact that they seem to have a paired olfactory organ and a sensory-line pattern which is quite similar to that of the gnathostomes. These characteristics are, however, likely to be general for either the vertebrates or, at any rate, for the ensemble of all ostracoderms and the gnathostomes. Other ostracoderms, such as the Galeaspida are now known to have a paired olfactory organ. Current phylogenetic analysis using a large number of characteristics now place pteraspidomorphs as the sister-group of all other ostracoderms and the gnathostomes. =Phylogeny= Based on the work of Mikko Haaramo.

The earliest were written by Jacqueline Lichtenberg (also creator of the Sime~Gen Universe books) beginning in 1969 and continuing through the first few years after the cancellation of the original TV series. As such, Kraith represents some of the earliest Star Trek fan fiction. The stories are named after the kraith, a goblet or chalice used in the performance of certain Vulcan rituals, featuring prominently in several of the stories in the sequence.  Background  The first few stories were published in the T Negative fanzine, under the editorship of Ruth Berman, beginning with Spock's AffirmationSpock's Affirmation, entire text online at simegen.com, page found 2010-05-09. in T-Negative 8. As interest grew, later stories were published in a wider range of outlets, and other authors began to make contributions to the sequence of stories. Over fifty amateur and professional authors have now contributed to Kraith.Bacon-Smith, Camille, \\"Spock Among the Women\\". New York Times, November 16, 1986, specifically mentions Kraith and its \\"story tree\\" collaborations among amateur writers. The universe portrayed in Kraith is not canon Star Trek, but its emphasis on stories with sociological, psychological and emotional plotlines had, and continues to have, a substantial impact on Star Trek fan fiction. A high proportion of early contributors to the Kraith storyline were women, and this has continued to be reflected in the high proportion of female fan writers.Bacon-Smith, Camille, Enterprising Women, Television Fandom and the Creation of Popular Myth (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1992). Expansion of her New York Times article.

Plot  The story of Kraith is ostensibly \\"Spock finds a wife,\\" but this is only a trivial incident compared to the thoughts and ideas presented in the series. The central premise concerns the fact that in the original Star Trek, humans were portrayed as the dominant race throughout the galaxy. In many episodes, Kirk was shown as imposing not just human values, but his particular version of human (that is to say, white, male and 20th-century American) values, on a number of alien cultures, supposedly for their own good or to save them from being conquered by the Klingons.David Gerrold discusses this aspect of Star Trek in his book The World of Star Trek (Ballantine, 1973). Lichtenberg presents this imposition as reflecting the overall attitude of the Earth- dominated Federation toward unaffiliated and member worlds. How would alien races respond to such treatment? How would they feel about the aggressive capitalism practiced by Earth companies, the influx of human residents on their worlds, the influence of human cultural values, and the eventual threat to their cultures as a result? Even if they were happy to have their world belong to the Federation, what would happen when their young people tried to join Starfleet, only to find that starships like the Enterprise are designed with only human comfort in mind? Lichtenberg, Jacqueline, Federation Centennial, chapter 3. Page found 2010-05-02. Vulcan, with its monoculture derived from the Reforms of Surak, has been deeply affected by contact with other races. Many Vulcans feel the changes are not for the better, and a major plot arc in Kraith concerns a proposal that Vulcan secede from the Federation. It is officially voted down, but there are still many who agree with the idea. Lichtenberg's goal was to show that the Vulcan culture we saw on the show was not perfect, and that contact with other civilizations would help post-Reform culture evolve from its present, static form, to \\"what it ought to become\\". The friendship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy became a microcosm reflecting these changes. Lichtenberg, \\"Author's Preface\\", Kraith Collected, p. 4. Lichtenberg tackled these issues in depth and with complexity. She is on record as having believed at the time that most people were incapable of accepting the ideas she proposes, because they were far too radical or ahead of their time. In the \\"Author's Preface\\" to Kraith Collected I, p. 3, she explains the necessity of \\"gently introducing\\" readers to her ideas over a multi-story series: \\"The concepts are radical and very strange. Not one in five hundred would be able to accept them.\\" Today, readers might see them as postmodern, or at least as bearing the seeds of critical race theory and critical cultural studies, or perhaps in terms of accommodation. Kraith took a different turn with the input of Sondra Marshak as Lichtenberg's chief collaborator. One of Lichtenberg's plot arcs concerned the idea that James T. Kirk, having been in contact with a number of telepathic alien species, had begun to be telepathic himself. To learn control and proper use of his new abilities he came to Vulcan to attend a psychic school. For this and other reasons, some politically complex, he was adopted by Sarek and educated in the Vulcan way of life. This education had occasionally involved a \\"Warder-Liege compact\\" between Kirk and Spock, in which Kirk accepted Spock as his mentor and obeyed his commands (or vice versa, as in the Kraith novel Federation Centennial). Marshak evidently saw further plot possibilities in the Warder- Liege, and revived and expanded on its implications. Later Kraith stories are rife with BDSM undertones, and in one entry, Joan Winston's \\"The Maze\\" (published in Metamorphosis 2), Spock is depicted as giving Kirk a sound spanking for disobeying an order (in favor of saving Spock's life) while under Warder-Liege restrictions.  Legacy  Although the classic Kraith stories are not slash fiction, some commentators have seen Kraith as a precursor to some forms of slash: hurt/comfort themes, and themes of emotional and mental closeness, as well as the BDSM implications later in the series, are clearly closely related to themes found in many slash stories. Lichtenberg is perhaps best known for her Sime ‚Äì Gen Universe series, which she began writing in 1969. She also worked on Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover series. As of 2010, she is at work on a series of original vampire slash novels with Jean Lorrah.

It is the longest state highway in Texas at almost 542 miles, but is only the 9th longest of any highway classification in the state. Before the 1939 renumbering, SH 4 was the longest state highway.  Route description  State Highway 16, Duval County, Texas, USA. (16 April 2016) SH 16 begins at an intersection at US 83 in Zapata. The route continues through south Texas ranchlands, then to the north through San Antonio's far south side. The routes enters San Antonio from the southeast, and goes around the west side of the city concurrent with Interstate 410. The route veers to the northwest as it passes through Bandera, Kerrville, and Fredericksburg, and then reaches the Texas Hill Country. After passing through the cities of Comanche and Llano, it continues north through ranchland and farms. Its next intersection is with I-20 south of the town of Strawn. It continues to the northwest, wrapping around the northern and eastern sides of Possum Kingdom Lake. It reaches an intersection with US 380 in the town of Graham. In North Texas, the highway reaches its northern terminus between Antelope and Windthorst, almost 542 miles from its starting point. Previous routes left left SH 16 was one of the original twenty five state highways proposed on June 21, 1917, overlaid on top of the Fort Worth-Oklahoma Highway. From 1917 the routing mostly followed present day Interstate 35W from Fort Worth to Denton. It continued on, routed along present day Interstate 35 from Fort Worth through to Oklahoma. A spur, SH 16A, went from Denton to Dallas. On March 18, 1919, the route and SH 16A were cancelled, as both routes became part of SH 40. SH 16 was then reassigned to the future route of U.S. Highway 181 (which was routed over it in 1926) from San Antonio to Corpus Christi on August 21, 1923. SH 16 then went west on SH 44 to Robstown, south on U.S. Highway 77, and west on SH 285. This route replaced portions of SH 9 and SH 12. On January 20, 1930, SH 16 Spur was created in Sinton. SH 16 was extended on January 19, 1932 following SH 9 to Brady, replaced SH 107 to Santa Anna, following SH 7, SH 4, SH 30, and SH 18 to Sagerton, then replaced SH 51 to the Oklahoma State line. On February 10, 1937, the southern section of SH 16 was rerouted northwest and northeast to Fredericksburg, replacing part of SH 81. On September 26, 1939, the section from Brady to Santa Anna was promptly reassigned to U.S. Highway 183. The section from San Antonio to Corpus Christi, which was cosigned with US 181, was cancelled. The section from Corpus Christi to Robstown was transferred to rerouted SH 44, south of Robstown to rerouted SH 96 (now US 77), and from there to Falfurrias became an extension of SH 285. The section from Sagerton to the Oklahoma State line was renumbered as SH 283. The sections cosigned with other state highways had their co-designation of SH 16 removed. SH 16 was rerouted north to south of Graham, replacing SH 81 and part of SH 120. SH 16 Spur was renumbered Spur 72. On August 31, 1965, the road was significantly extended via its current routing to Zapata, replacing State Highway 346 from San Antonio to Jourdanton, and also replaced portions of SH 173 and FM 496. On November 16, 1965, it was rerouted over Interstate 410 in San Antonio. On January 31, 1969, SH 16 was extended north to US 281, replacing portions of SH 254 and FM 61. The section of SH 16 from Loop 1604 to Eckhert Road (former FM 1517) was proposed for decommissioning in 2014 (SH 16 would have been rerouted over Loop 1604, and Spur 421 and Spur 422 would have been extended over old SH 16) as part of TxDOT's San Antonio turnback proposal, which would have turned back over 129 miles of roads to the city of San Antonio, but the city of San Antonio said no to that proposal. Future The section of SH 16 between Loop 1604 and Triana Parkway in Helotes is in the process of being upgraded into a superstreet. The main focus of the project includes reconstructing the intersections at Loop 1604 and FM 1560 / Circle A Trail. Construction at the Loop 1604 intersection is projected to be finished sometime in 2019.

It first appeared in The X-Men #1 (September 1963) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The facility is depicted as built for the X-Men as part of the various incarnations of the X-Mansion. Its primary purpose is to train the X-Men, initially using traps, projectile firing devices, flamethrowers, and mechanical dangers such as presses and collapsing walls. These were replaced by holographics, when the Danger Room was rebuilt using Shi'ar technology. It gained sentience in Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men as Danger. Publication history An obstacle course in which the X-Men train appears in The X-Men #1 (September 1963), but the Danger Room is never mentioned by name. The name \\"Danger Room\\" is first used in The X-Men #2 (November 1963). According to X-Men writer/editor/co-creator Stan Lee, \\"the Danger Room was Jack Kirby's idea. I thought it was great because we could always open with an action sequence if we needed to.\\" Early designs Beast training. Art by Jack Kirby. In the early books it was filled with traps, projectile firing devices, flamethrowers, and mechanical dangers such as presses, collapsing walls and the like intended to challenge the trainee. Meanwhile, an observer is in the overhanging control booth managing the room's mechanisms to oversee the exercise while manually ensuring the subject's safety. Later the Danger Room was upgraded with machines and robots for the X-Men to fight against. After befriending the Shi'ar the X-Men rebuilt the Danger Room with Shi'ar hard-light holographic technology. These upgrades were largely added by Dr. Hank McCoy (Beast). The Danger Room is located in the X-Mansion; every destruction of the latter led to a rebuilding, and usually upgrading, of the Danger Room. The training facility has endured extensive damage over the years, usually from X-Men training or X-Men going rogue, as Colossus did during The Muir Island Saga. Supervillains have dealt critical damage to it as well as taking over the facility, especially Arcade. The security and safety protocols that ensure the safety of anyone using the Danger Room have frequently been disrupted, tampered with by villains, failed, or have been completely negated in all the years of its use, each time happening more frequently as the room began to get more and more upgraded. It is suggested in the X-Men Official Guide that the objects in the Danger Room are holograms surrounded by force fields, supposedly confirmed in Astonishing X-Men when a student managed to kill himself by jumping from a holographic cliff face. It is also revealed that the Danger Room can display holograms in only 32-bit color. Sentience =Gaining self-awareness= In Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men, the Danger Room developed self-awareness as \\"Danger\\". It is mentioned by Wolverine as 'acting twitchy all semester'. The first thing it does is convince Wing, who has recently been depowered by Ord's cure, to kill himself.Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 #7 The next thing it does is take control of an old, broken Sentinel robot and knock out all the psychics within the X-Mansion. During the Sentinel's attack, Cyclops orders Shadowcat and the students to go hide in the Danger Room for safety. While there, they find the corpse of Wing. The Danger Room reanimates the corpse and attacks the students.Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 #8-9 Apart from Wing, there are no additional fatalities among the students. After being freed from its prison, it takes the form of a woman. She is dubbed Danger and attacks the X-Men. After defeating them, she travels to Genosha to kill Professor Xavier.Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 #10 Xavier was revealed to have known of the Danger Room's sentience and chosen not to reveal it, much to the dismay of the X-Men who seem to view this deception as taking on one of Magneto's former ideals. During the battle on Genosha, she takes control of Cassandra Nova's second Wild Sentinel and engages Beast in a vicious and brutal fight while the other X-Men take on the Wild Sentinel. After Beast destroys her body, Danger's consciousness was presumed to still exist within the conflicted consciousness of the Wild Sentinel.Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 #11-12 =Ord and the Breakworld= Later, Danger reappears in a new humanoid form, similar to her previous one, in which she infiltrated S.W.O.R.D. headquarters to speak with Ord of the Breakworld and offer her assistance.Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 #15 Danger and Ord both ended up on Breakworld, along with the X-Men and S.W.O.R.D., and after the robot encountered Emma Frost and an unconscious Cyclops, Emma told the robot that despite its supposed enmity it has let the mutants live too often, meaning it hasn't overcome its parent programming, so it cannot kill any mutant. Cyclops recovers, and Emma tells Danger to help the X-Men in Breakworld, and in exchange, it will be given Professor Xavier. Danger later attacks some of Breakworld's inhabitants and sides with the X-Men and S.W.O.R.D.Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 #21-24, Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men #1 =Revenge= After the Breakworld incident, S.W.O.R.D. takes Danger into custody. When the S.W.O.R.D. headquarters is destroyed during Secret Invasion, Danger escapes and goes to Australia, taking on the form of an anthropologist from Melbourne University. She approaches Rogue in her disguise but is targeted by a low flying Shi'ar salvage spacecraft, where she reveals who she really is and that she is going to use Rogue as a conduit so she can get her revenge on Professor Xavier.X-Men: Legacy #220 After being damaged by the crew, she warps the entire area with her holographic projections of past moments within Rogue's life as well as other famous moments from the X-Men's history.X-Men: Legacy #221-222 Xavier confronts Danger and she reveals she intended to make Rogue absorb all his powers and memories permanently, leaving him crippled and useless. Xavier reveals that when she first said Where am I?, he consulted her Shi'ar makers who assured him it was not possible she could have gained self-awareness and that he had no way of knowing what she was or would become. He tried to free her but because she was really billions of lines of machine code, he didn't know which lines to erase without lobotomizing her. Because of not knowing what she was capable of, if he had freed her, she might have killed his X-Men because she had the knowledge and power, so instead he did nothing and watched her suffer. Xavier ends her suffering by repairing her. She then sides with Xavier, Rogue, and Gambit and takes out the Shi'ar salvage crew. Afterwards, with Xavier, she helps Rogue gain full control over her powers.X-Men: Legacy #223-224 =Utopia= Danger joins Rogue and Gambit to help the X-Men settle the unrest in San Francisco. She saves a child who mistakes her for a Transformer. She comes to aid Rogue and Gambit during a fight with Ares and later departs with them to find Trance and any other students still out during the riots.X-Men: Legacy #226 After locating Trance, they are attacked by Ms. Marvel who manages to seriously damage her shoulder.X-Men: Legacy #227 After the events of Utopia, Danger is seen being repaired by Madison Jeffries when they are attacked by Emplate. Danger tries to defend Madison only to be further damaged by Emplate. After being repaired, at the request of Cyclops, she informs the inhabitants of Utopia who Emplate is and his history.X-Men: Legacy Annual #1 (2009) She works alongside Madison, Rogue and the X-Club on erasing Legion's many personalities,New Mutants vol. 3 #5 and is offered the position of warden of Utopia by Emma Frost, which she accepts because it also allows her to study the best and the worst of what humanity has to offer.Uncanny X-Men #515 Danger's first job was to interrogate Scalphunter, who was forced into bringing five Predator Xs to Utopia.Uncanny X-Men #517 Armor confronts Danger, due to her being responsible for Wing's death. The get into a tussle. Danger was able to discover Armor's weakness and insists that they talk. Armor angrily expresses to Danger that her presence with the X-Men pisses on Wing's memory. Danger tells Armor, that she constantly reboots herself, but can't wipe out Wing's image in her memory. Armor is surprised that Danger can experience feelings of guilt, and she proceeds to tell her about Wing. =Necrosha= As warden of Utopia, some of the prisoners she guards include Empath, Sebastian Shaw and Donald Pierce. She uses her Virtual Reality technology in an attempt to rehabilitate them.Uncanny X-Men #515 During the invasion from Selene's forces, she detects an energy source, but then malfunctions and crashes. Then, Shinobi Shaw and Harry Leland, who have been resurrected by the T-O virus, appear, ready to kill Shaw for preventing Selene's ascent to godhood.Necrosha One-shot However, Danger is able to adapt to the mass increase and severed Shinobi's hand before he could kill his father.X-Force vol.3 #21 =Second Coming= Danger appears to have been compromised as she is not aware that Donald Pierce has free rein to sabotage Utopia's defenses. =Wolverine and the X-Men= Beast rebuilds the Westchester School at the behest of Wolverine at the aftermath of the Schism event. Built on the ruins of the previous Xavier Institute, the school is rechristened the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and is built with state of the art Shi'ar Technology, gifted to him by the current Emperor of the Shi'ar Empire Gladiator (Kallark) whose son Kid Gladiator is enrolled (presumably to learn control over his vast powers.) The school incorporates a decentralized Danger Room that is integrated into the entire building itself instead of just one room. This is seen in the first issue of Wolverine and the X-Men when hidden defense weapons are activated in the boys' bathroom. Whether the danger room's holographic functions are fitted throughout the school as well remains to be seen. =All-New X-Factor= Danger reappears in the All- New X-Factor series. She appears as a prisoner of a member of the Thieves Guild, which Gambit is running, and when he discovers this, he orders her freed. After restoring her memory which was lost due to the imprisonment, he invites her to join the new X-Factor team.All-New X-Factor #4 =X-Men: Blue= Danger appears in the form of the Blackbird jet plane and is used as the main transport for the original time-displaced X-Men.X-Men: Blue #1-4 During the Secret Empire storyline, Danger takes Jean Grey and Jimmy Hudson to a prison stronghold to rescue their captured teammates. During the ensuing battle, she reveals her true form and projects holograms of the adult X-Men to keep the guards occupied.X-Men: Blue #8 Powers and abilities As Danger gained self-awareness and adopted a more humanoid appearance, she has shown enhanced strength and durability, create hard-light holographic projections that can affect entire areas, emit modulated energy waves for blasts, binding and protection, flight capability, mechanical regeneration & shapeshifting; with which to alternate her physical form as well as rebuild herself after her body is destroyed (at one point even rebuilding herself with butterfly-like wings which are soon destroyed by Beast), control and assimilate machinery and cybernetic components into herself via thought. She is able to bring other machines into self-awareness and upload her consciousness into foreign digitized and/or mechanical systems to build, operate or otherwise commandeer new bodies. Danger also possesses more detailed knowledge of the X-Men and their combat skills than any other source, having trained against them as the Danger Room for generations. Danger Cave With the Danger Room gone, the X-Men have resorted to using the empty room to train with their students. Also, the student Prodigy, using the borrowed knowledge from several X-Men, built a \\"Danger Cave\\" underneath the X-Mansion that is a giant stone room with a large metal circle control center. The Danger Cave is similar to the Danger Room, but what makes the Danger Cave unique is that it uses holograms to train the students by re-enacting renowned battles the X-Men were involved in, like Inferno, Broodworld, Planet X, or Onslaught, even going so far as to dress the participants up in what the X-Men wore at that time. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= The Danger Room equivalent in the Age of Apocalypse reality was the Killing Zone. The facility was located in Mount WundagoreX-Men Chronicles #1 (1995) and was apparently destroyed by Nemesis. Later, it was Dazzler who replaced the Danger Room and acted as a one-woman training facility for the fully fledged X-Men. =Ultimate Marvel= The X-Men from the Ultimate Marvel universe also have a Danger Room with similar technology, including smaller holographic training rooms in the hidden safehouses prepared by Professor X. However, these are prone to malfunctions, such as a fight sequence producing Hasidic rabbis instead of ninjas (though to no less of an effect towards the latter intent). = What If? =  Danger became Ultron's wife  In the alternate universe of What If? Astonishing X-Men, the Danger Room got a body of her own and betrayed the X-Men. She eventually married Ultron and the two conquered Earth, the Shi'ar Empire and the entire universe.What If?

However, eriptychiids differ from all other pteraspidomorphs in having a massively calcified endoskeleton, pervaded by canals for blood vessels.

Now an imprint of IDW Publishing, Top Shelf is based in Marietta, Georgia. Top Shelf publishes comics and graphic novels by authors such as Alan Moore, Craig Thompson, James Kochalka, Andy Runton, Jeffrey Brown, Nate Powell, Eddie Campbell, Alex Robinson, Jeff Lemire, and Matt Kindt. History Brett Warnock during the How to Put Together a Comics Anthology panel at the Stumptown Comics Fest 2006. The company was founded by Chris Staros and Brett Warnock after discussions between the pair at the 1997 Small Press Expo. Previously Warnock had used the Top Shelf name as the title for a self-published anthology, whilst Staros had worked in the industry representing Eddie Campbell in the United States and self-published a number of comics-based zines. The partnership evolved from combining Warnock's design skills and marketing abilities with Staros' talents for editing and book- keeping. The duo started publishing under the name Primal Groove Press, but soon changed the name to Top Shelf.St-Louis, Herv√©. \\"Interview With Chris Staros of Top Shelf Comix\\". Comic Book Bin. (January 6, 2008). Retrieved December 2, 2008. The first title to be published by the new imprint was Pete Sickman-Garner's Hey, Mister: After School Special, a collection of Garner's previously self-published comic books along with two new tales. Works by James Kochalka followed, and then in 1999 the company published Good-bye, Chunky Rice, a work which saw its creator, Craig Thompson, win a Harvey Award and which helped establish Top Shelf's reputation for publishing works of merit, with it being chosen as a book of the year by The Comics Journal (#220) alongside the Top Shelf-distributed From Hell. Staros and Warnock have aimed to give their imprint a style \\"that is quite hip, but also quite endearing\\", and Staros regularly signs correspondence with the tagline \\"Your friend thru comics\\". The company launched at a recessional period for comics, and saw themselves as, together with Fantagraphics, Drawn and Quarterly, and the now- defunct Highwater Books, attempting to \\"change the public perception and face of comics altogether\\". In 2000 Staros delivered the keynote speech at the Ignatz Awards, and argued that the industry must focus more on content, and that more works of the merit of From Hell and Jimmy Corrigan would help the public re-evaluate their perceptions of the medium. In April 2002 the collapse of the bookstore distributor LPC caused severe financial problems for the company. A $20,000 check the distributor had issued bounced. Investigation by Top Shelf revealed an LPC filing for Chapter 11, a move which left Top Shelf in a perilous state: The company had issued checks based on the LPC check clearing. The company called upon the goodwill it had previously established in the comics market and issued a communication asking for help. They asked former customers to \\"find it in your hearts to each spend around fifty bucks ... this would literally pull us through\\". The communication swiftly spread across the internet, with both Neil Gaiman and Warren Ellis disseminating the appeal through their online presences. The move created such an atmosphere that rival publisher and fellow LPC client Dark Horse felt moved to issue a statement to the effect that they were \\"in a profitable position.\\" Top Shelf were unprepared for the response, with a volunteer drafted to help pack the orders. A second communication was issued a day later, declaring \\"Top Shelf Saved by Comics Community Record 12 Hours.\\" The move was greeted with envy by rival publishers, Tom Devlin of Highwater told The Comics Journal that although he viewed the move initially as maybe \\"a little pathetic\\", he later realized it as \\"the most remarkable marketing scheme\\", although qualifying that he didn't feel \\"there was a cynical moment\\" in Top Shelf's actions. Top Shelf have slowly expanded their line and typically aim to launch works at conventions in order to generate a buzz. The 2004 Comic Con International saw the company launch 8 books, of which two were immediate sell-outs. This has at times caused unrest with retailers, particularly when Blankets was launched at the 2003 Comic Con International. The company also followed this route with Alan Moore and Melinda Gebbie's Lost Girls, launching it at the 2006 Comic Con International. The work had long been on the schedules of Top Shelf, initially intended as a three volume affair scheduled for a 2002 release. The eventual publication proved controversial, with Moore himself describing the work as \\"pornography\\" and Chris Staros admitting that publication was \\"putting the whole company on the line\\". Before publication fears were raised that the book would prove hard to sell given its nature, and that there may be legal implications. However, the work received good reviews and the initial print run sold out in one day. The work has yet to be distributed in the United Kingdom, as the Great Ormond Street Hospital currently owns the copyright to Peter Pan. Top Shelf agreed not to distribute the work in the UK until after that copyright expired at the end of 2007. They do, however, refute that the work breaches the copyrights held. On 6 January 2015, IDW Publishing announced that it had acquired Top Shelf Publishing. Top Shelf co-founder Warnock announced his retirement from comics publishing, while Staros stayed on as Top Shelf's editor-in-chief.Melrose, Kevin. \\"IDW PUBLISHING ACQUIRES TOP SHELF PRODUCTIONS,\\" Comic Book Resources (January 6, 2015) Titles =Pete Sickman-Garner= Titles by Pete Sickman-Garner are: *Hey Mister- Afterschool special *Hey Mister- Celebrity Roast *Hey Mister- The Fall Collection =Alan Moore= Titles by Alan Moore include: *Lost Girls (with Melinda Gebbie, 2006) *From Hell (with Eddie Campbell, 1999) *Voice of the Fire (1996) *The Mirror of Love (with Jose Villarrubia) *The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century (with Kevin O'Neill, 2009) * The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic (with co-writer Steve Moore and artists including Kevin O'Neill, Melinda Gebbie, John Coulthart, and Jos√© Villarrubia, 320 pages, hardcover, 2009, ) =Craig Thompson= Titles by Craig Thompson include: *Blankets *Good-bye, Chunky Rice *Carnet de Voyage =Andy Runton= Titles by Andy Runton include: *Owly ** The Way Home ** Just A Little Blue ** Flying Lessons ** A Time To Be Brave =Jeffrey Brown= Titles by Jeffrey Brown include: *Clumsy *Unlikely *Aeiou *Every Girl Is The End Of The World For Me *I Am Going To Be Small *Be a Man *Minisulk *Bighead *Feeble Attempts *Incredible Change-Bots =James Kochalka= Titles by James Kochalka include: *SuperF*ckers *Monkey vs. Robot *American Elf *Pinky & Stinky *Conversation *Magic Boy and the Robot Elf *The Perfect Planet =Alex Robinson= Titles by Alex Robinson include: *Tricked *Box Office Poison *Bop! - More Box Office Poison *Too Cool To Be Forgotten *Alex Robinson's Lower Regions =Nate Powell= Titles by Nate Powell include: *Please Release *Swallow Me Whole *Any Empire =Ren√©e French= Titles by Ren√©e French include: *The Ticking *The Soap Lady *Micrographica =Jason Hall= Titles by Jason Hall include: *Pistolwhip (with Matt Kindt): ** Pistolwhip ** The Yellow Menace ** Mephisto & The Empty Box =Matt Kindt= Titles by Matt Kindt include: *2 Sisters *Pistolwhip (with Jason Hall): ** Pistolwhip ** The Yellow Menace ** Mephisto & The Empty Box *Super Spy =Jeff Lemire= Titles by Jeff Lemire include: * Essex County Trilogy: ** Tales From The Farm (Top Shelf Productions, 2008) ** Ghost Stories (Top Shelf Productions, 2008) ** The Country Nurse (Top Shelf Productions, 2009) ** The Collected Essex County (Top Shelf Productions, 2009) ***Contains the three main stories \\"Tales From The Farm\\", \\"Ghost Stories\\" and \\"The Country Nurse\\" ***Added short stories \\"The Essex County Boxing Club\\" and \\"The Sad and Lonely Life of Eddie Elephant Ears.\\" ***Bonus materials, such as: unused promotion art, a deleted scene, character designs and so on. * The Underwater Welder =Nicolas Mahler= Titles by Nicolas Mahler include: *Lone Racer *Van Helsing's Night Off =Tom Hart= Titles by Tom Hart include: *Hutch Owen: ** The Collected ** Unmarketable =Rich Koslowski= Titles by Rich Koslowski include: *The King *Three Fingers =Tony Consiglio= Titles by Tony Consiglio include: *110 Per¬¢ *Doublecross =Dan James= Titles by Dan James include: *Mosquito *The Octopi & The Ocean =Max Estes= Titles by Max Estes include: *Coffee & Donuts *Hello, Again =David Yurkovich= Titles by David Yurkovich include: *Less Than Heroes *Death By Chocolate: Redux =Miscellanea= Congressman John Lewis at a signing for his graphic novel autobiography by Top Shelf, March.

Once the smallest debt is paid off, one proceeds to the next larger debt, and so forth, proceeding to the largest ones last. ‚Äì Get Out of Debt With a Debt Snowball This method is sometimes contrasted with the debt stacking method, also called the \\"debt avalanche method\\", where one pays off accounts on the highest interest rate first. The debt-snowball method is most often applied to repaying revolving credit such as credit cards. Under the method, extra cash is dedicated to paying debts with the smallest amount owed.\\"How a \`debt snowball\` plan works\\" , All About Money Methodology The basic steps in the debt snowball method are as follows: # List all debts in ascending order from smallest balance to largest. This is the method's most distinctive feature, in that the order is determined by amount owed, not the rate of interest charged. However, if two debts are very close in amount owed, then the debt with the higher interest rate would be moved above in the list. # Commit to pay the minimum payment on every debt. # Determine how much extra can be applied towards the smallest debt. # Pay the minimum payment plus the extra amount towards that smallest debt until it is paid off. Note that some lenders (mortgage lenders, car companies) will apply extra amounts towards the next payment; in order for the method to work the lenders need to be contacted and told that extra payments are to go directly toward principal reduction. Credit cards usually apply the whole payment during the current cycle. # Once a debt is paid in full, add the old minimum payment (plus any extra amount available) from the first debt to the minimum payment on the second smallest debt, and apply the new sum to repaying the second smallest debt. # Repeat until all debts are paid in full. In theory, by the time the final debts are reached, the extra amount paid toward the larger debts will grow quickly, similar to a snowball rolling downhill gathering more snow, hence the name. The theory works as much on human psychology; by paying the smaller debts first, the individual, couple, or family sees fewer bills as more individual debts are paid off, thus giving ongoing positive feedback on their progress towards eliminating their debt. Example An example of the debt-snowball method in action is shown below. In a real payoff scenario the different interest rates on debts will affect payoff times and might make the debt-snowball method less efficient than other plans. However, for the sake of illustrating the method, the example ignores accruing interest. A person has the following amounts of debt and additional funds available to pay debt (the debt is listed with the smallest balance first, as recommended by the method): * Credit Card A ‚Äì $250 balance ‚Äì $25/month minimum * Credit Card B ‚Äì $500 balance ‚Äì $26/month minimum * Car payment ‚Äì $2500 balance ‚Äì $150/month minimum * Loan - $5000 balance ‚Äì $200/month minimum * The person has an additional $100/month which can be devoted to repayment of debt. First two months ‚Äì under the debt-snowball method, payments would be made to the creditors as follows: * Credit Card A ‚Äì $125 ($25/month minimum + $100 additional available) * Credit Card B ‚Äì $26/month minimum * Car payment ‚Äì $150/month minimum * Loan ‚Äì $200/month minimum Third month balance (presuming the person has not added to the balances, which would defeat the purpose of debt reduction) - Credit Card A would have been paid in full, and the remaining balances as follows: * Credit Card B ‚Äì $448 * Car payment ‚Äì $2200 * Loan ‚Äì $4600 Third month payments ‚Äì the person would then take the $125 previously used to pay off Credit Card A and apply it as additional payment to the Credit Card B balance, which would make payments for the next three months as follows: * Credit Card B ‚Äì $151 ($26/month minimum + $125 additional available) * Car Payment ‚Äì $150/month minimum * Loan ‚Äì $200/month minimum Three more months (six total) ‚Äì Credit Card B would be paid in full (the final payment would be $146), and the remaining balances would be as follows: * Car Payment ‚Äì $1750 * Loan ‚Äì $4000 Then the person would take the $151 previously used to pay off Credit Cards A & B and apply it as additional payment to the car loan balance, which would make payments as follows: * Car Payment - $301 ($150/month minimum + $151 additional available) * Loan - $200/month minimum It would take six months to pay the car loan (the final payment being $240), whereupon the person would then make payments of $501/month toward the loan (which would have a $2800 balance) for six months (with the last payment at $234). Thus in 17 months the person has repaid four loans, with two of them being paid in five months and three within one year. Effectiveness In situations where a debt has both a higher interest rate and higher balance than another debt, the debt-snowball method will prioritize the smaller debt even though paying the larger debt would be more cost-effective. Several writers and researchers have considered this contradiction between the method and a strictly mathematical approach. Writing in Forbes, Rob Berger noted that \\"humans aren‚Äôt really rational creatures\\" and stresses that research tends to support the debt snowball method in real-world scenarios.Debt Snowball Versus Debt Avalanche: What The Academic Research Shows The primary benefit of the smallest-balance plan is the psychological benefit of seeing results sooner, in that the debtor sees reductions in both the number of creditors owed (and, thus, the number of bills received) and the amounts owed to each creditor. In a 2012 study by Northwestern‚Äôs Kellogg School of Management, researchers found that \\"consumers who tackle small balances first are likelier to eliminate their overall debt\\" than trying to pay off high interest rate balances first.http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news_articles/2012/snowball- approach.aspx A 2016 study in Harvard Business Review came to a similar conclusion: Author and radio host Dave Ramsey, a proponent of the debt- snowball method, concedes that an analysis of math and interest leans toward paying the highest interest debt first. However, based on his experience, Ramsey states that personal finance is \\"20 percent head knowledge and 80 percent behavior\\" and he argues that people trying to reduce debt need \\"quick wins\\" (i.e., paying off the smallest debt) in order to remain motivated toward debt reduction.Dave Ramsey (2009). The Total Money Makeover: A Proven Plan for Financial Fitness. Thomas Nelson Inc, Research by Moty Amar and colleagues (2011)Moty Amar, Dan Ariely, Shahar Ayal, Cynthia Cryder, and Scott Rick (2011), \\"Winning the Battle but Losing the War: The Psychology of Debt Management,\\" Journal of Marketing Research. agreed that debtors are inclined to pay small debts first, which they attributed to \\"debt account aversion,\\" the desire to reduce the number of outstanding debts regardless of balance or interest expense. However, they also found that when debtors are restricted from fully paying debts and are shown the interest that will accrue as a result of their choice, they make the mathematically optimal decision.

It is also a common starting point for bismuth chemistry. It is found naturally as the mineral bismite (monoclinic) and sphaerobismoite (tetragonal, much more rare), but it is usually obtained as a by-product of the smelting of copper and lead ores. Dibismuth trioxide is commonly used to produce the \\"Dragon's eggs\\" effect in fireworks, as a replacement of red lead. Structure The structures adopted by Bi2O3 differ substantially from those of arsenic(III) oxide, As2O3, and antimony(III) oxide, Sb2O3.Wells, A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry. 5th. London, England: Oxford University Press. p.890 Existence domains of the four polymorphs of Bi2O3 as a function of temperature. (a) The Œ±-phase transforms to the Œ¥-phase when heated above 727 ¬∞C, which remains the structure until the melting point, 824 ¬∞C, is reached. When cooled, the Œ¥-phase transforms into either the Œ≤-phase at 650 ¬∞C, shown in (b), or the Œ≥-phase at 639 ¬∞C, shown in (c). The Œ≤-phase transforms to the Œ±-phase at 303 ¬∞C. The Œ≥-phase may persist to room temperature when the cooling rate is very slow, otherwise it transforms to the Œ±-phase at 500 ¬∞C. Bismuth oxide, Bi2O3 has five crystallographic polymorphs. The room temperature phase, Œ±-Bi2O3 has a monoclinic crystal structure. There are three high temperature phases, a tetragonal Œ≤-phase, a body-centred cubic Œ≥-phase, a cubic Œ¥-Bi2O3 phase and an Œµ- phase. The room temperature Œ±-phase has a complex structure with layers of oxygen atoms with layers of bismuth atoms between them. The bismuth atoms are in two different environments which can be described as distorted 6 and 5 coordinate respectively. Œ≤-Bi2O3 has a structure related to fluorite. Œ≥-Bi2O3 has a structure related to that of Bi12SiO20 (sillenite), where a fraction of the Bi atoms occupy the position occupied by SiIV, and may be written as Bi12Bi0.8O19.2. Œ¥- Bi2O3 has a defective fluorite-type crystal structure in which two of the eight oxygen sites in the unit cell are vacant. Œµ- Bi2O3 has a structure related to the Œ±- and Œ≤- phases but as the structure is fully ordered it is an ionic insulator. It can be prepared by hydrothermal means and transforms to the Œ±- phase at 400 ¬∞C. The monoclinic Œ±-phase transforms to the cubic Œ¥-Bi2O3 when heated above 729 ¬∞C, which remains the structure until the melting point, 824 ¬∞C, is reached. The behaviour of Bi2O3 on cooling from the Œ¥-phase is more complex, with the possible formation of two intermediate metastable phases; the tetragonal Œ≤-phase or the body-centred cubic Œ≥-phase. The Œ≥-phase can exist at room temperature with very slow cooling rates, but Œ±- Bi2O3 always forms on cooling the Œ≤-phase. Even though when formed by heat, it reverts to Œ±- Bi2O3 when the temperature drops back below 727 ¬∞C, Œ¥-Bi2O3 can be formed directly through electrodeposition and remain relatively stable at room temperature, in an electrolyte of bismuth compounds that is also rich in sodium or potassium hydroxide so as to have a pH near 14. Conductivity The Œ±-phase exhibits p-type electronic conductivity (the charge is carried by positive holes) at room temperature which transforms to n-type conductivity (charge is carried by electrons) between 550 ¬∞C and 650 ¬∞C, depending on the oxygen partial pressure. The conductivity in the Œ≤, Œ≥ and Œ¥-phases is predominantly ionic with oxide ions being the main charge carrier. Of these Œ¥- Bi2O3 has the highest reported conductivity. At 750 ¬∞C the conductivity of Œ¥- Bi2O3 is typically about 1 Scm‚àí1, about three orders of magnitude greater than the intermediate phases and four orders greater than the monoclinic phase. Œ¥- Bi2O3 has a defective fluorite-type crystal structure in which two of the eight oxygen sites in the unit cell are vacant. These intrinsic vacancies are highly mobile due to the high polarisability of the cation sub-lattice with the 6s2 lone pair electrons of Bi3+. The Bi-O bonds have covalent bond character and are therefore weaker than purely ionic bonds, so the oxygen ions can jump into vacancies more freely. The arrangement of oxygen atoms within the unit cell of Œ¥-Bi2O3 has been the subject of much debate in the past. Three different models have been proposed. Sill√©n (1937) used powder X-ray diffraction on quenched samples and reported the structure of Bi2O3 was a simple cubic phase with oxygen vacancies ordered along<111>, i.e. along the cube body diagonal. Gattow and Schroder (1962) rejected this model, preferring to describe each oxygen site (8c site) in the unit cell as having 75% occupancy. In other words, the six oxygen atoms are randomly distributed over the eight possible oxygen sites in the unit cell. Currently, most experts seem to favour the latter description as a completely disordered oxygen sub-lattice accounts for the high conductivity in a better way. Willis (1965) used neutron diffraction to study the fluorite (CaF2) system. He determined that it could not be described by the ideal fluorite crystal structure, rather, the fluorine atoms were displaced from regular 8c positions towards the centres of the interstitial positions. Shuk et al. (1996) and Sammes et al. (1999) suggest that because of the high degree of disorder in Œ¥- Bi2O3, the Willis model could also be used to describe its structure. =Use in Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)= Interest has centred on Œ¥- Bi2O3 as it is principally an ionic conductor. In addition to electrical properties, thermal expansion properties are very important when considering possible applications for solid electrolytes. High thermal expansion coefficients represent large dimensional variations under heating and cooling, which would limit the performance of an electrolyte. The transition from the high-temperature Œ¥- Bi2O3 to the intermediate Œ≤- Bi2O3 is accompanied by a large volume change and consequently, a deterioration of the mechanical properties of the material. This, combined with the very narrow stability range of the Œ¥-phase (727‚Äì824 ¬∞C), has led to studies on its stabilization to room temperature. Bi2O3 easily forms solid solutions with many other metal oxides. These doped systems exhibit a complex array of structures and properties dependent on the type of dopant, the dopant concentration and the thermal history of the sample. The most widely studied systems are those involving rare earth metal oxides, Ln2O3, including yttria, Y2O3. Rare earth metal cations are generally very stable, have similar chemical properties to one another and are similar in size to Bi3+, which has a radius of 1.03 √Ö, making them all excellent dopants. Furthermore, their ionic radii decrease fairly uniformly from La3\\\\+ (1.032 √Ö), through Nd3+, (0.983 √Ö), Gd3+, (0.938 √Ö), Dy3+, (0.912 √Ö) and Er3+, (0.89 √Ö), to Lu3+, (0.861 √Ö) (known as the ‚Äòlanthanide contraction‚Äô), making them useful to study the effect of dopant size on the stability of the Bi2O3 phases. Bi2O3 has also been used as sintering additive in the Sc2O3\\\\- doped zirconia system for intermediate temperature SOFC. Preparation Bismuth trioxide is commercially made from bismuth subnitrate. The latter is produced by dissolving bismuth in hot nitric acid. Addition of excess sodium hydroxide followed by continuous heating of the mixture precipitates bismuth(III) oxide as a heavy yellow powder. Also, the trioxide can be prepared by ignition of bismuth hydroxide. Bismuth trioxide can be also obtained by heating bismuth subcarbonate at approximately 400 0C. Reactions Oxidation with ammonium persulfate and dilute caustic soda gives bismuth tetroxide. The same product can be obtained by using other oxidizing agents such as potassium ferricyanide and concentrated caustic potash solution. Electrolysis of bismuth(III) oxide in hot concentrated alkali solution gives a scarlet red precipitate of bismuth(V) oxide. Bismuth(III) oxide reacts with mineral acids to give the corresponding bismuth(III) salts. Reaction with acetic anhydride and oleic acid gives bismuth trioleate. (a) Sill√©n model; vacancies ordered along<111>, (b) Gattow model; vacancies completely disordered in oxygen sub-lattice, with each oxygen site having 75% occupancy, (c) Willis model; oxygen atoms displaced from regular 8c sites (for example, the atom marked A in (b)) along<111> to 32f sites. The Bi3+ ions labelled 1‚Äì4 in (c) correspond to those labelled 1‚Äì4 in (b). Atmospheric carbon dioxide or CO2 dissolved in water readily reacts with Bi2O3 to generate bismuth subcarbonate. Bismuth oxide is considered a basic oxide, which explains the high reactivity with CO2. However, when acidic cations such as Si(IV) are introduced within the structure of the bismuth oxide, the reaction with CO2 do not occur. Medical device usage Bismuth oxide is occasionally used in dental materials to make them more opaque to X-rays than the surrounding tooth structure. In particular, bismuth (III) oxide has been used in hydraulic silicate cements (HSC), originally in \\"MTA\\" (a trade name, standing for the chemically- meaningless \\"mineral trioxide aggregate\\") from 10 to 20% by mass with a mixture of mainly di- and tri-calcium silicate powders. Such HSC is used for dental treatments such as: apicoectomy, apexification, pulp capping, pulpotomy, pulp regeneration, internal repair of iatrogenic perforations, repair of resorption perforations, root canal sealing and obturation. MTA sets into a hard filling material when mixed with water. Some resin-based materials also include an HSC with bismuth oxide. Problems have allegedly arisen with bismuth oxide because it is claimed not to be inert at high pH, specifically that it slows the setting of the HSC, but also over time can lose color by exposure to light or reaction with other materials that may have been used in the tooth treatment, such as sodium hypochlorite.

The legation was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on January 8, 1981. U.S. Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt subsequently designated it a National Historic Landmark on December 17, 1982. It is the only listing or designation in a foreign country, excluding those in countries that grew out of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

Diplomatic history Entrance American Legation Seal above door Dining room Conference Hall The legation is an elaborate Moorish-style building of stuccoed masonry. This complex structure contains the two-story mud and stone building presented to the United States in 1821 by Sultan Moulay Suliman. The first property acquired abroad by the United States government, it housed the United States Legation and Consulate for 140 years, the longest period any building abroad has been occupied as a United States diplomatic post. It is symbolic of the 1786 Moroccan‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Friendship, which is still in force today. The complex expanded over the years as the surrounding houses were bought up. During World War II it served as headquarters for United States intelligence agents. After the move to Rabat as the diplomatic capital in 1956, when the country gained its independence, the Legation was abandoned as a diplomatic building. Over the years the United States government proceeded to use it as consul offices and Peace Corps offices, among other things. In time it became neglected and threatened with demolition. Present In 1976 a group of American citizens established a public, non-profit organization to save the Old American Legation (as it is known locally). Today the Tangier American Legation Museum Society rents the structure, which is still owned by the United States government. The Tangier American Legation Institute for Moroccan Studies (TALIM) is a museum and cultural center for the study of Morocco and Morocco‚ÄìUnited States relations, and it has many paintings by Marguerite McBey and other artists. In 2010, TALIM expanded the original Paul Bowles room to The Paul Bowles Wing, three rooms devoted to the expatriate writer and composer Paul Bowles. In 1999, the Legation received its initial donation of furniture, photographs and documents for the original Paul Bowles Room compiled by Gloria Kirby, a permanent resident of Tanger and friend of Bowles. The museum also has a research library and conference room. TALIM's community outreach programs include Arabic literacy courses for women living in the Tangier medina. John Davison is the current museum director.

It is a continuation of The Pink Panther film series. Directed by Blake Edwards, it stars Roberto Benigni as Inspector Clouseau's illegitimate son. Also in this film are Panther regulars Herbert Lom, Burt Kwouk and Graham Stark and a star of the original 1963 film, Claudia Cardinale. It was the final film in the original Pink Panther film series (which had started with the original 1963 film), as well as the final film for both director Blake Edwards and composer Henry Mancini; Mancini died in 1994 and Edwards retired from movie making a year later. There wouldn't be another Pink Panther film until 13 years later in 2006 with the release of The Pink Panther starring Steve Martin.  Plot  Princess Yasmin of Lugash (Debrah Farentino) is abducted in French territorial waters off the coast of Nice by terrorists led by a mercenary named Hans (Robert Davi) in order to force her father to abdicate and allow her disgraced stepmother's lover, a military general with terrorist ties to an unfriendly neighboring kingdom, to claim the throne. Police Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is tasked with solving the case of the kidnapped princess. While investigating her disappearance in the South of France, he has a run-in with the kidnappers, and a local gendarme, named Jacques Gambrelli (Roberto Benigni). Gambrelli opens the rear doors of the kidnapper's van and unknowingly spies the Princess who he believes is the driver's sister en route to the hospital. Hans becomes aware that Gambrelli witnessed the Princess in the back of his van and sends his henchmen to kill Gambrelli as a routine precaution. Dreyfus follows Gambrelli to the hospital where he observes the bumbling Gambrelli's antics with stumbling around as well as getting his bicycle stuck in a wet cement sidewalk outside the hospital. When Hans' henchmen arrive and chase after Gambrelli on his bicycle, Dreyfus intervenes and saves the klutzy policeman. He then takes Gambrelli to his home where he lives with his mother Maria (Claudia Cardinale) whom Dreyfus recognizes as a suspect in a murder case 30 years ago. During the casual encounter with Maria, Dreyfus learns from her Gambrelli is in fact the illegitimate son of the late Inspector Jacques Clouseau. When Hans' men attempt to plant a bomb under the Gambrelli house, it leads to Dreyfus becoming injured instead and sent to the hospital. While Maria decides to stay beside the injured Dreyfus at the hospital to see him recover, they both reveal Gambrelli's origins to him as the only known offspring of the late Inspector Clouseau. Gambrelli finally decides to set off to rescue Princess Yasmin and prove himself his father's true heir and legacy. Gambrelli recognizes one of Hans' henchmen at the hospital who is inquiring about a doctor for Hans who is injured after Yasmin had attempted to escape. Impersonating a doctor, Gambrelli gains access to Hans hideout and clumsily attempts to treat the injured Hans. Jacques accidentally stabs himself in the cheek with a needle filled with Novocaine, and gets locked up with the princess. Hans decides to move his safe house out of France and to Lugash, and sends his men to kill Gambrelli by placing him in a van and rolling it down a steep road off a cliff, but Gambrelli manages to escape. Seeking help, Gambrelli travels to Paris to look up Clouseau's old friends and soon meets his late father's former manservant Cato Fong (Burt Kwouk) who directs him to Inspector Clouseau's former costumer Professor Auguste Balls (Graham Stark) to assist them with making new disguises for themselves to travel to Lugash to rescue Princess Yasmin. Gambrelli and Cato fly to Lugash where they meet a government agent at a local restaurant to point them the location of Hans' new hideout. While being followed by the Lugash Army, as well as Cato, Gambrelli ventures to a castle located outside the Lugash capital city where in a climatic gun battle, Gambrelli gains access to the castle with the assistance of the army and after confronting Hans and his henchmen, defeats them, with a little of Cato's help and rescues Princess Yasmin. After returning to France, Gambrelli is promoted to detective and transfers to Paris' metro police force as a full Police Inspector. He attends the wedding of Maria and Dreyfus whom have gotten engaged during their time together while Dreyfus recuperated at the hospital. During the reception, Dreyfus is uncomfortably shocked when Gambrelli's twin sister Jacqueline Gambrelli (Nicoletta Braschi) appears and who turns out to be just a clumsy and dim-witted as her brother, as Maria tells Dreyfus that she in fact had twins from her one-time tryst with Inspector Clouseau. The final scene has Inspector Gambrelli attending a ceremony in Lugash attended by King Haroak and Princess Yasmin who award him with a special medal for his rescue of Yasmin which is attended by Maria, Dreyfus, Cato, Prof. Balls and Jacqueline Gambrelli where his clumsy antics disrupt the proceedings just like his father's Inspector Clouseau's antics used to do in previous Pink Panther films. Gambrelli closes the film with the line: \\"That felt good!\\" following by the image of Gambrelli freezing as the animated Pink Panther walks across the still of Jacques, until an animated Gambrelli suddenly cuts away the head of live-action Gambrelli and pops out of the hole, dropping the head on the Panther's foot. Having been made a fool by Gambrelli once again, the enraged Panther chases him into fading blackness, closing the series.

Here she returns as Maria Gambrelli, the part originally played by Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark.  Production  This was the first Pink Panther film in a decade, following two unsuccessful attempts to continue the series following the death of Peter Sellers, who originated the character of Clouseau. Considered a relaunch of the series, the plan was for Roberto Benigni‚Äîa popular Italian comedian who had yet to be discovered in America‚Äîto continue on where Sellers had left off. However, Benigni was not Edwards' first choice for the role. Kevin Kline was attached for a while. He was a fan of the series and loved Edwards' work, but decided after reading the script that the project just wouldn't work. Kline and Edwards were to work together on a project called Luck (not an Edwards script) that William Morris packaged as a replacement project for the duo, but after this film flopped the project fizzled. Rowan Atkinson was also offered the part, but declined (his star having risen considerably in the ensuing decade since Curse of the Pink Panther was offered to him). Atkinson loved Sellers' work and the Panther films, but was sure no one could replace Sellers. G√©rard Depardieu was the next casting choice for Clouseau's son and was announced in the trades. When Giancarlo Paretti took control of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, he backed out of the project. Edwards sued the studio again for not allowing him to arrange outside financing. When Alan Ladd, Jr. came aboard, MGM settled out of court with Edwards. Ladd greenlit the film but Depardieu was now doing Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise and was no longer available. After the controversy over his rape remarks to an American journalist, MGM was also having second thoughts about Depardieu's suitability for a family-friendly comedy series. Edwards then wanted Roberto Benigni after viewing Down by Law and Johnny Stecchino. While Benigni deliberated over the script, Tim Curry was kept in the wings as a potential back-up. Bronson Pinchot wanted the role, but MGM passed (probably because Blame it on the Bellboy tanked). There is early concept art for the theatrical poster showing Curry's moustachioed, frizzy- haired Gambrelli in cartoon form (in the baby carriage or pram that Benigni's cartoon visage would inherit). Curry also talked to the press about his desire for the role. Securing Benigni in late 1991 found the film much-needed third party financing from Aurelio De Laurentiis (Dino's nephew). The film's budget of $28 million came partly from MGM (then under Alan Ladd Jr.) and with $13.8 million from Aurelio De Laurentiis' company, Filmauro. Filming started 8 June 1992 and production finished 4 months later, taking place in Pinewood Studios and the country of Jordan. Kroyer Films made the animated Pink Panther character and the animated persona of Clouseau Jr. in a live action sequence for the intro. The opening Pink Panther sequence cost an estimated $1 million.  Soundtrack  Perhaps appropriately, this was the final film scored by Henry Mancini (he makes a cameo appearance of himself in the opening titles, giving his baton to the Panther who conducts the film's variation of the Theme). The soundtrack album was released by Milan Records. # The Pink Panther Theme - arranged and performed by Bobby McFerrin (3:10) # Son of the Pink Panther (1:33) # The Snatch (2:22) # God Bless Clouseau - music by Henry Mancini, lyrics by Leslie Bricusse (2:01) # Samba de Jacques (2:24) # The Gambrelli Theme (2:23) # The Bike Chase (1:52) # The Dreamy Princess (3:58) # Riot at Omar's (2:40) # Mama and Dreyfus (1:43) # Rendez-vous with Cato (1:53) # The King's Palace (1:47) # The Showdown (3:31) # The Pink Panther Theme (tenor sax solo: Phil Todd) (4:18)  Reception  The Radio Times Guide to Films gave the film only 1 star out of 5. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating of 6% based on 34 reviews; the website's consensus states that \\"Roberto Benigni is an undeniably gifted physical comic, but [the film] betrays his energetic efforts with a painfully unfunny script\\". Accessed 24 August 2009 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"C+\\" on scale of A+ to F. Benigni's performance in the film earned him a Razzie Award nomination for Worst New Star. The movie itself was nominated for Worst Picture and The Sequel Nobody Was Clamoring For at the 1993 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. The film was a box office hit in Italy, despite tanking everywhere else. Son of the Pink Panther failed to generate critical or commercial success. In 1996, MGM approached Robin Williams and Jim Carrey about the series. MGM would cut a deal for a reboot with Edwards (allowing the film to proceed without his participation) in 1997. The series was rebooted in 2006 with the release of The Pink Panther starring Steve Martin as Inspector Jacques Clouseau and Kevin Kline (previously considered for the role of Clouseau) as Charles Dreyfus. The Pink Panther 2 saw Kline's Dreyfus replaced by John Cleese. This is the last film of the original iteration of the Pink Panther franchise. This was the last film to be directed by Edwards, who also co-wrote and produced all the previous Pink Panther films except for Inspector Clouseau. It is also the last film to be scored by Henry Mancini.

The route intersects the Business Route of US 181 and Texas State Highway 80 as it passes through town. The road continues north through farmlands before reaching an intersection with US Route 87 in Stockdale. The route continues north through ranchlands until Seguin. Reaching Seguin, Texas State Highway 46 begins, peeling off to the northwest toward New Braunfels. SH 123 continues around the eastern edge of Seguin, where it is known locally as \\"the Bypass\\", and there it intersects US 90 Alt., US 90, and Interstate 10. The highway continues north, reaching its northern terminus at Interstate 35 in San Marcos. The route has two business segments: Business 123-B, largely on Austin St, through historic downtown Seguin, and Business 123-D in Karnes City. Route history The route was initially proposed on April 12, 1927 from Stockdale to San Marcos with a proposed extension south to Karnes City. On September 21, 1931, it was rerouted to end in Floresville. On August 4, 1932, it was restored to Karnes City, and the old route was renumbered as SH 168. On November 6, 1934, it was rerouted to Yorktown. On February 16, 1935, its south end was changed back to Karnes City. On November 18, 1938, SH 123 Loop was designated in Karnes City. On September 26, 1939, SH 123 Loop was renumbered as Loop 17. Paving was completed in the mid-1940s.

In the United States, lift chairs qualify as Durable Medical Equipment under Medicare Part B. In a February 1989 report released by the Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services, it was found that: lift chairs might not possibly meet Medicare's requirements for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and lift chair claims need to be re-regulated. The report was stimulated by an increase in lift chair claims between 1984 and 1985 from 200,000 to 700,000. A New York Times article stated that aggressive TV ads were pushing consumers to inquire about lift chairs and, once consumers called in, a form was sent to them for their physicians to sign. Some companies would ship lift chairs before receiving a physician's signature; therefore, forcing the physicians to sign or else their patient will be forced to pay for the chair. Medicare may only cover the cost of the lift-mechanism rather than the entire chair. Before Medicare can be considered for covering the cost, patients will need to have a visit with their physician to discuss the need for this particular equipment. The DME provider will then request a prescription and a certificate of medical necessity (CMN). The CMN typical involves five questions that the physician needs to answer. Typically, the questions are (1) Does the patient have severe arthritis, (2) Does the patient have a neuromuscular disease, (3) Is the patient incapable of getting up from a regular chair in their home, (4) Can the patient walk once standing, and (5) Have all other therapeutic measures been taken? If any of the questions are answered \\"NO\\", it may likely result in a denial of the claim. Typically, DME providers require full payment for the lift chair and will offer reimbursement upon approval from Medicare. DME providers cannot bill Medicare without first providing the equipment.

Background The concerto was dedicated, as was Othmar Schoeck's concerto for the same instrument, to the violinist Stefi Geyer, with whom Bart√≥k was in love. Geyer could not reciprocate Bart√≥k's feelings and rejected the concerto. It was revived after both Bart√≥k and Geyer had died. Geyer's copy of the manuscript was bequeathed to Paul Sacher to be performed by him and Hansheinz Schneeberger. The concerto was later championed by David Oistrakh. Acclaimed recordings include Oistrakh with Gennady Rozhdestvensky conducting, as well as versions by Maxim Vengerov and Gy√∂rgy Pauk. Structure The composition strays from the path of the traditional concerto, having two rather than three movements: # Andante sostenuto # Allegro giocoso Far from being an innovation, the two-movement form is the traditional design of the rhapsody: a slow movement followed by a fast one. Bart√≥k had already used this form in 1904 for his first concertante work, the Rhapsody, Op. 1, for piano and orchestra . Bart√≥k used the Andante as the first of the Two Portraits, Op. 5, representing Stefi Geyer. It has been speculated that the second movement is a self-portrait of the composer . The retrospective assignment of \\"No. 1\\" to this concerto (and the consequent redesignation of the Violin Concerto Bart√≥k composed in 1936‚Äì39 as \\"No. 2\\") has met with some resistance, especially from Hungarian scholars and musicologists, on grounds that the composer had \\"annulled\\" this concerto, not only by excluding it from his list of mature works but also by extracting the first movement and reworking it in 1911 as the first of Two Portraits, Op. 5. The objection has also been made that, even though an early String Quartet, composed in Pozsony, and an early Sonata for Violin and Piano have been published, the traditional numberings of the String Quartets and the Violin Sonatas have not been changed .

Geography The island is south of the country's capital, Mal√©. Guraidhoo is an inhabited island in the south of Male, Maldives. Due to the rapid increase of the population the government had decided to increase the land area of this tiny island. So in 2014 the government had more than of land reclaimed from the western side of the island. Due to this, the island will experience more economic development. Climate A tropical climate throughout the year yet raining seasons come accordingly. Rainy season also comes according to the climate of Maldives. In rainy seasons roads get flooded with mud and water caused by undeveloped roads. Demography Economy The islanders most economical activity is fishing and some agricultural activities. Also small businesses are increasing rapidly in Thaa Guraidhoo. \\"Guraidhoo Store\\" is an island council owed shop which imports most necessary goods required by the community. An industrial ice plant is located which makes it a central commercial island for fishing industry in the area. In addition Thaa Guraidhoo port is well built that makes it a destination to stop by for travellers. Recently, a new resort called Maalifushi was opened in that atoll where by Guraidhoo is the closest island to resort. This new resort has given many job opportunities for the youth of Guraidhoo. The island can be described as a trading point to the other islands in the atoll. The infrastructure and development in the island is an example for other islands of the Maldives. The island's port is well built and it is a transit point to many boats coming and going from Male', especially for the Boats from Addu Laamu Atoll, G.dh, G.Alifu, Addu Atoll and Yaviyani Atoll. The council of the island along with the government is working towards building an economic hub in this atoll. For this, the island had forward a perfect proposal to the government. That includes; *Establishment of an international airport. *International transit port. *International yacht marina. With the above projects, this island will be the most developed island in the Maldives. These projects may be commenced in 2020. Guraidhoo is famous for its development and it is the most developed island in the Atoll. The island's health facility is increasing day by day. Today the island has a health post giving medical care for its islanders as well as the nearby island which is also managed by its women. Tha Guraidhoo women had been involving its economic, social and development work significantly, where they contribute to the island. The land reclamation project had been compelted few years ago. The land use plan has been sent to the ministry of planning for approval, Recently, the Harbour develent project has been started and expected to complete the harbor project within 3 months time which were conducted by MTCC.  Education  The island has a secondary school named Thaa Atoll School. It provides education to both boys and girls from grade 1 to grade 10. It had created some successful students who are amongst NATIONAL TOP TEN ACHIEVERS ON THE GCE O/LEVEL EXAMS! It also has a pre-school giving education which was previously managed by its people especially the women. Lately pre-school was named \\"Guraidhoo Pre-School (GPS)\\" which is managed under island council. Higher education opportunities are not available, therefore a huge number of the island's population migrates to capital city (Male') for educational development.

The Clifford algebra Cl3,0(R) has a faithful representation, generated by Pauli matrices, on the spin representation C2; further, Cl3,0(R) is isomorphic to the even subalgebra Cl(R) of the Clifford algebra Cl3,1(R). APS can be used to construct a compact, unified and geometrical formalism for both classical and quantum mechanics. APS should not be confused with spacetime algebra (STA), which concerns the Clifford algebra Cl1,3(R) of the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Special relativity =Spacetime position paravector= In APS, the spacetime position is represented as the paravector : x = x^0 + x^1 \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + x^2 \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + x^3 \\\\mathbf{e}_3, where the time is given by the scalar part , and e1, e2, e3 are the standard basis for position space. Throughout, units such that are used, called natural units. In the Pauli matrix representation, the unit basis vectors are replaced by the Pauli matrices and the scalar part by the identity matrix. This means that the Pauli matrix representation of the space-time position is : x \\\\rightarrow \\\\begin{pmatrix} x^0 + x^3 && x^1 - ix^2  x^1 + ix^2 && x^0-x^3 \\\\end{pmatrix} =Lorentz transformations and rotors= The restricted Lorentz transformations that preserve the direction of time and include rotations and boosts can be performed by an exponentiation of the spacetime rotation biparavector W : L = e^{\\\\frac{1}{2}W} . In the matrix representation the Lorentz rotor is seen to form an instance of the SL(2,C) group (special linear group of degree 2 over the complex numbers), which is the double cover of the Lorentz group. The unimodularity of the Lorentz rotor is translated in the following condition in terms of the product of the Lorentz rotor with its Clifford conjugation : L\\\\bar{L} = \\\\bar{L} L = 1 . This Lorentz rotor can be always decomposed in two factors, one Hermitian , and the other unitary , such that : L = B R . The unitary element R is called a rotor because this encodes rotations, and the Hermitian element B encodes boosts. =Four-velocity paravector= The four-velocity, also called proper velocity, is defined as the derivative of the spacetime position paravector with respect to proper time œÑ: : u = \\\\frac{d x }{d \\\\tau} = \\\\frac{d x^0}{d\\\\tau} + \\\\frac{d}{d\\\\tau}(x^1 \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + x^2 \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + x^3 \\\\mathbf{e}_3) = \\\\frac{d x^0}{d\\\\tau}\\\\left[1 + \\\\frac{d}{d x^0}(x^1 \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + x^2 \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + x^3 \\\\mathbf{e}_3)\\\\right]. This expression can be brought to a more compact form by defining the ordinary velocity as : \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\frac{d}{d x^0}(x^1 \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + x^2 \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + x^3 \\\\mathbf{e}_3) , and recalling the definition of the gamma factor: : \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}^2}{c^2}}} , so that the proper velocity is more compactly: : u = \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{v})(1 + \\\\mathbf{v}). The proper velocity is a positive unimodular paravector, which implies the following condition in terms of the Clifford conjugation : u \\\\bar{u} = 1 . The proper velocity transforms under the action of the Lorentz rotor L as : u \\\\rightarrow u^\\\\prime = L u L^\\\\dagger. =Four-momentum paravector= The four-momentum in APS can be obtained by multiplying the proper velocity with the mass as : p = m u, with the mass shell condition translated into : \\\\bar{p}p = m^2 . Classical electrodynamics =The electromagnetic field, potential and current= The electromagnetic field is represented as a bi-paravector F: : F = \\\\mathbf{E}+ i \\\\mathbf{B} , with the Hermitian part representing the electric field E and the anti-Hermitian part representing the magnetic field B. In the standard Pauli matrix representation, the electromagnetic field is: : F \\\\rightarrow \\\\begin{pmatrix} E_3 & E_1 -i E_2  E_1 +i E_2 & -E_3 \\\\end{pmatrix} + i \\\\begin{pmatrix} B_3 & B_1 -i B_2  B_1 +i B_2 & -B_3 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\,. The source of the field F is the electromagnetic four- current: : j = \\\\rho + \\\\mathbf{j}\\\\,, where the scalar part equals the electric charge density œÅ, and the vector part the electric current density j. Introducing the electromagnetic potential paravector defined as: :A=\\\\phi+\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\,, in which the scalar part equals the electric potential œï, and the vector part the magnetic potential A. The electromagnetic field is then also: : F = \\\\partial \\\\bar{A} . The field can be split into electric : E = \\\\langle \\\\partial \\\\bar{A} \\\\rangle_V and magnetic : B = i \\\\langle \\\\partial \\\\bar{A} \\\\rangle_{BV} components. Where : \\\\partial = \\\\partial_t + \\\\mathbf{e}_1 \\\\, \\\\partial_x + \\\\mathbf{e}_2 \\\\, \\\\partial_y + \\\\mathbf{e}_3 \\\\, \\\\partial_z and F is invariant under a gauge transformation of the form : A \\\\rightarrow A + \\\\partial \\\\chi \\\\,, where \\\\chi is a scalar field. The electromagnetic field is covariant under Lorentz transformations according to the law : F \\\\rightarrow F^\\\\prime = L F \\\\bar{L}\\\\,. =Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force= The Maxwell equations can be expressed in a single equation: : \\\\bar{\\\\partial} F = \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\epsilon} \\\\bar{j}\\\\,, where the overbar represents the Clifford conjugation.

History The company was established by Fred Dawes, as a chain of television and radio rental shops, in the 1950s. The business was initially named Fred Dawes. All ninety of the Fred Dawes High Street stores became electrical retailers instead and, in 1971, Thorn acquired an Essex and Hertfordshire group of shops called Sidney Rumbelow's, and Fred Dawes stores were renamed Rumbelows. Several other regional chains were bought around this time, including two chains that were already large and popular in North West England, NEMS and Strothers. As with Fred Dawes, these stores too were renamed Rumbelows. Combining previously unrelated chains occasionally created competing Rumbelows stores within yards of each other. Centralised control was established from the Nantwich, Cheshire, headquarters, which suffered as much as it benefited from being an early adopter of computerised accounting. Several of the former Strothers and NEMS stores also sold records, musical instruments and hi fi equipment. The Rumbelows store in Whitechapel, Liverpool had been the heart of the NEMS Enterprises empire during the 1960s, when NEMS was owned by the manager of the Beatles, Brian Epstein. =Demise= In 1989, the business was sold to Radio Rentals (which had merged with Thorn Electrical Industries in 1968), and all the rental accounts were transferred to Radio Rentals. Thorn EMI (as Thorn Electrical Industries had become) transferred all of Rumbelows' rental accounts to their Radio Rentals chain, bolstering its market position. With its core business removed, Rumbelows sought a new identity as a more conventional (non rental) retailer, even adding computers to the product mix. In 1992, Thorn converted some of the remaining Rumbelows shops into DER, Multibroadcast or Radio Rentals branches. Few observers were surprised by the reduction in profitability that resulted from this unconventional business tactic, and fewer still were surprised when Thorn closed the remaining 285 Rumbelows shops in February 1995. Rumbelows had been losing ¬£12 million a year, and had never made a profit in its twenty four years of existence. Some stores were sold to the German retail chain of PCs, Escom. In July 1996, Escom itself subsequently folded, following financial difficulties. In the 1980s, Martin Dawes (born c.1945), Fred's son, would carry on the family name in the electrical and electronic retailing sector, with his mobile phone business, which he sold to Cellnet in March 1999 for ¬£130 million. Football sponsorship For two seasons, from 1990 to 1992, Rumbelows were the title sponsor of the English Football League Cup, a professional association football competition.

He received his Ph.D. (1978) from the department of mathematics at the University of Oregon for work with Richard Barrar on singularity theory, with a dissertation entitled Singularities in the N-Body Problem. Swimme was a faculty member in the department of mathematics at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, 1978‚Äì81. He was a member of the faculty at the Institute in Culture and Creation Spirituality at Holy Names University in Oakland, California, 1983‚Äì89. Swimme brings the context of story to our understanding of the 14 billion year trajectory of cosmogenesis. His published work includes The Universe is a Green Dragon (Bear and Company, 1984), The Universe Story (Harper San Francisco, 1992), written with Thomas Berry, The Hidden Heart of the Cosmos (Orbis, 1996), and The Journey of the Universe (Yale University, 2011), written with Mary Evelyn Tucker. Swimme is the producer of three DVD series: Canticle to the Cosmos, The Earth‚Äôs Imagination, and The Powers of the Universe. Swimme teamed with Mary Evelyn Tucker, David Kennard, Patsy Northcutt, and Catherine Butler to produce Journey of the Universe, an Emmy-winning HD film released in 2011. They draw together scientific discoveries in astronomy, geology and biology, with humanistic insights concerning the nature of the universe. Background Swimme is an evolutionary cosmologist on the graduate faculty of the California Institute of Integral Studies in the Philosophy, Cosmology and Consciousness Program, an area of study within the Philosophy and Religion Program. It is designed to help shape the intellectual, moral and spiritual leadership of its students. retrieved 4/4/2011 Swimme's primary field of research is the nature of the evolutionary dynamics of the universe. He has developed an interpretation of the human as an emergent being within the universe and earth. His central concern is the role of the human within the earth community, the cultural implications of the Epic of Evolution, and the role of humanity in the unfolding story of earth and cosmos. Toward this goal, he founded the Center for the Story of the Universe in 1989. His published work includes The Universe is a Green Dragon (Bear and Company, 1984), The Universe Story (Harper San Francisco, 1992) written with Thomas Berry, and The Hidden Heart of the Cosmos (Orbis, 1996). Swimme‚Äôs books have been translated into eight different languages. Swimme was featured in the television series Soul of the Universe (The BBC, 1991) and The Sacred Balance produced by David Suzuki (CBC and PBS, 2003). He is the producer of a twelve-part DVD series Canticle to the Cosmos, which has been distributed worldwide. Other DVD programs featuring Swimme‚Äôs ideas include The Earth‚Äôs Imagination and The Powers of the Universe. Swimme founded the international Epic of Evolution Society in 1998. This was a result of his participation in the conference Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion organized by the American Association for the Advancement of Science the year before.American Association for the Advancement of Science retrieved 4/4/2011 Philosophy Thomas Berry introduced Swimme to the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Swimme's passion for understanding is deeply influenced by Teilhard's ideas. Swimme describes his discovery of Teilhard in his foreword to Sarah Appleton - Weber's new translation of The Human Phenomenon: He adopted Teilhard‚Äôs thinking that everything in existence has a physical as well as a spiritual dimension. He believes the universe is a deep transfiguration process. Love, truth, compassion and zest--all of these qualities regarded as divine become powerfully embodied in the universe. In this way, the universe is imagined as evolving with a telos of Beauty. Suzanne Taylor, founder of Mighty Companions, says Swimme is a charismatic person who seeks to place scientific technology in its context of the infancy of the earth community as it struggles for reconnection to its sacred source. She believes that he sweeps us into the grand picture of human beings as the current culmination of the still-evolving universe. Swimme tells the story of the evolution of the universe and attempts to pull us into a universe of meaning, where there is not only connectivity, but directionality as well.Brian Swimme retrieved 4.4.2011 In Canticle to the Cosmos he says \\"If you look at the disasters happening on our planet, it's because the cosmos is not understood as sacred... a way out of our difficulty is a journey into the universe as sacred.\\"Canticle to the Cosmos Harvard astrophysicist Eric Chaisson writes that Swimme, a mathematician by training, seeks a larger, warmer, more noble science story. Our story is not merely a collection of facts; science should be a student‚Äôs guide to a grand world view, including, if possible, meaning, purpose and value. He sees the cosmological perspective as one to which all modern scientists can subscribe, yet the meaning and purpose of its being a subjective outgrowth of an individual‚Äôs reflections upon that cosmology remains.Eric Chaisson, Tae-Chang Kim, The Thirteenth Labor: Improving Science Education, CRC Press, 1999, p. 9, In a 2007 interview with Robert Wright, Swimme says > ... if you take Buddhism and Christianity and so forth there's a kind of > battle ‚Äî a subtle sort of struggle taking place because they're not standing > in a common ground but... take the Earth or ecology then suddenly they can > begin to explore what they have to offer.

And they > will flourish to the degree that they will move into the context of planet > and universe.Interview with Robert Wright (2007) Full transcript online Full > video online Pacific Sun magazine reports that Swimme is at the forefront of a new movement that integrates science and spirituality. Swimme believes there is a new story, the Epic of Evolution, a cosmological narrative that begins with the Big Bang, which started the whole process, and proceeds to the evolution of the universe and life on earth. This manner of study, which engages heart and mind together, seems to teeter on the brink of religion. He believes that science, holistically, has a soul-shaking impact on people. Big history science is filled with little mysterious coincidences, upon which our entire existence rests. Swimme notes that this inspires awe and humility, and that this cosmology puts people in their proper place. He thinks that the popular view is that the earth is like a gravel pit or a hardware store, that the earth is just stuff to be used.Excerpt from Pacific Sun (newspaper) retrieved 3-07-09 He believes that consumerism has become the dominant world faith, exploiting the riches of the earth. His fundamental aim is to present a new cosmology--one grounded in a contemporary understanding of the universe but nourished by ancient spiritual convictions that help give it meaning.Center for a New American Dream retrieved 5.22.2015 \\"This is the greatest discovery of the scientific enterprise: You take hydrogen gas, and you leave it alone, and it turns into rosebushes, giraffes, and humans.\\"Comprehensive Compassion - An Interview with Brian Swimme retrieved 4.5.2011 This statement by Swimme has been widely quoted.

The island is famous for its rich unique Maldivian culture and traditions that have been preserved to date. The Eid celebrations and wedding traditions of Kinbidhoo are unique to the island and have been practiced since the days of the ancestors of Kinbidhoo. Kinbidhoo is a lively island with a certain uniqueness to it. The people of the island carry out the traditional activities of thatch making and coir rope producing. All the raw materials required for this, such as dry coconut palm leaves and coconut husks are obtained from nearby islands or from Kinbidhoo itself. In addition, some islanders go to the reef to collect exotic sea cucumbers which are then treated and sent to the capital island for exportation. Kinbidhoo has always been the educational hub of Thaa atoll. Students from all over the atoll and nearby islands used to come to Kinbidhoo to obtain the good quality education provided by Kinbidhoo School. Kinbidhoo School is known countrywide for the quality of education provided, outstanding results obtained in exams, and the implementation of their own teaching module known as the KS method. Kinbidhoo School was also a pilot school for implementing the new Maldivian curriculum which is used to teach all schools of Maldives now. History =Archaeology= There were important Buddhist ruins in an area of this island. The islanders call this place Veyru. The most conspicuous was a large Stupa whose stones had been removed and looked like a very steep small hill. Muhammad IsmƒÅƒ´l Dƒ´dƒ´, led a Maldivian expedition to this island in order to explore the Buddhist ruins in the 1960s. Some excavations were conducted and a report on the Buddhist remains of Kimbidu Island was published.Divehi TƒÅrƒ´khah Au Alikameh. There is a chapter on Kimbidu Stupa with pictures. Unfortunately the Buddhist site was not protected after excavation and has been heavily vandalized in recent times.

History = WTOA = On November 22, 1940, the Federal Communications Commission granted Mercer Broadcasting Company a construction permit for a new station, licensed to serve Trenton, New Jersey, on 44.7 MHz on the original 42-50 MHz FM broadcast band. On January 29, 1942, the FCC granted Mercer Broadcasting a change to 49.9 MHz. After the FCC created the current FM broadcast band on June 27, 1945, the station was reassigned to 97.5 MHz on July 10, 1947. The station was granted its first license on September 27, 1949 with the WTOA call sign. The Trenton Times Corporation purchased the station effective June 28, 1962. Nassau Broadcasting Company, owner of then- new AM outlet WHWH, purchased the station effective December 12, 1964.Broadcasting Yearbook 1969 page 109 = WPST = On September 13, 1971, WTOA's call sign was changed to WPST as the station rebranded as \\"Passport Stereo\\". The station's format was middle of the road music. In August 1975, Nassau Broadcasting owner Herb Hobler hired Phil Gieger as the General Manager. Gieger and morning host/station manager Tom Taylor revamped the station. They initially established an Adult Top 40 format, not as youth- oriented as Top 40 stations heard on AM radio at the time. By Fall 1975, the station took off and eventually became the number one station in the market. Over time, the format moved to Mainstream Top 40 music. Taylor remained the morning host until 1987. Other WPST DJs over the years included John Mellon (aka Walt Ballard), Ed Johnson, Doug James, John Brown, Eddie Davis, Trish Merelo, Andy Gury, Brian Douglas, Mel \\"Toxic\\" Taylor, Jay Sorensen, Dave Hoeffel, Tom Cunningham, Michelle Stevens, Eric Johnson, Mark Sheppard, Andre Gardner, Phil Simon, Steve Trevelise, Joel Katz, Rich DeSisto, Lee Tobin, Steve Kamer, Lori Johnson, Mark DiDia, Bob Sorrentino, and Scott Lowe. = WTHK = On February 14, 2005, at 5 p.m., 97.5 swapped call signs and formats with sister station 94.5 WTHK. Branded on air as \\"The Hawk\\", WTHK had a classic rock format. Like WPST, WTHK was owned by Nassau Broadcasting and licensed as a station serving Trenton. In August 2005, WTHK's city of license was changed from Trenton to Burlington, a community just up the Delaware River from Philadelphia. These changes were the first two steps of a three-step process designed to maximize the value of the licenses for 94.5 and 97.5. The reallocation of the 97.5 frequency from Trenton to Burlington moved it into the larger and more lucrative Philadelphia radio market and made it possible to move the 97.5 transmitter to a site much closer to Philadelphia. This made 97.5 a much more valuable property, one ripe for sale to a major-market broadcast company regardless of what format it might currently be running. Meanwhile, WPST continued to operate as a popular and profitable Trenton- market station on the 94.5 frequency, which could not be moved. = Sale to Greater Media = Nassau Broadcasting chose to leave the final necessary step, the actual relocation of the 97.5 transmitter, to the eventual buyer, which would turn out to be Greater Media. Since Greater Media already had a Philadelphia classic rock station in 102.9 WMGK, it was almost certain a new format would be chosen for 97.5. Clear Channel's decision to drop smooth jazz from 106.1 left a format hole in the market, and Greater Media decided to fill it with a new version of WJJZ on 97.5. WTHK signed off on November 15, 2006, at 7 p.m. Shortly after that, Greater Media began airing a simulcast of WMGK, the Hawk's former competitor, on 97.5 as a placeholder. Before WJJZ was to take over, messages urged listeners to reprogram their radios to 102.9 WMGK to continue enjoying classic rock. = Smooth Jazz = WJJZ 106.1 ended its smooth jazz format at noon on August 10, 2006, and flipped to a rhythmic adult contemporary format, branded as Philly's 106.1. Many former Smooth Jazz 106.1 listeners protested when the format was abandoned in Philadelphia. Much to the delight of fans, Greater Media announced in late October that it would pick up the Smooth Jazz format for 97.5. The official transfer of ownership took place on November 15, when WTHK signed off and shut down its Trenton transmitter. The new WJJZ launched on Friday, November 17, 2006 at 6 p.m. After a minute of silence, a recording of smooth jazz artists greeted listeners was played (the same recording that was played at the closing of the old WJJZ). Then Dave Koz announced the premiere of the new home of WJJZ. The first song played on the new frequency was the Grover Washington, Jr. tune \\"Protect the Dream.\\" The new WJJZ began broadcasting from the same tower used by the old WJJZ, located on Mermaid Lane in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. At the station's start, it used Broadcast Architecture's syndicated \\"Smooth Jazz Network,\\" with musician Dave Koz as the afternoon host, Program Director Michael Tozzi handling middays and Ramsey Lewis' morning show on WNUA simulcast from Chicago. DJs from the old WJJZ were added over time, Bill Simpson, Frank Childs and Desirae McCrae. Also heard were Al Winters and Lisa Fairfax. =WNUW Now 97.5= WJJZ's lack of ratings success fueled rumors of a format change. In the summer of 2008, Greater Media began doing listener research to change the station. Among the formats tested was Soft AC, Hot AC, All News on FM, FM Talk, and a AAA format similar to WIOQ of the early 80s. On September 5, 2008, at 6:00 p.m., after playing Boyz II Men's \\"I'll Make Love to You\\", The station then began stunting with a loop of 15 songs, ranging from Blondie's \\"Heart of Glass\\" to Avril Lavigne's \\"Complicated\\". Three days later, on September 8, at 9 a.m., \\"Now 97.5\\" made its debut as a Hot AC station, and positioned itself as \\"a younger approach to today's soft rock,\\" competing with the market AC leader, WBEB (\\"B-101\\"). The first song was \\"Who Knew\\" by Doylestown native P!nk. On October 31, 2008, at 5:00 p.m., the station switched to all-Christmas music. During WNUW's first week in the all-Christmas format, competitor B101 announced it would be sprinkling in Christmas tunes during the weekend of November 8‚Äì9, obviously in reaction to WNUW. Then on November 13, B101 flipped to all- Christmas. It was the earliest that B101 made the switch. Shortly thereafter, adult standards AM station WHAT also started playing an all-Christmas format. Then on November 26, in a surprise move, classic hits 98.1 WOGL changed its format to all-Christmas for the first time. Including WJBR-FM in nearby Wilmington, Delaware, it gave the Philadelphia market five Christmas formatted stations in 2008. The first on-air personality to be hired by WNUW was Glenn Kalina, whose morning show debuted on January 5, 2009. After finishing at #3 in the 2008 Holiday ratings, the station's audience fell off when it returned to its Hot AC format. WNUW trailed every other commercial Philadelphia FM and even Trenton station WPST, and Wilmington station WSTW in its last ratings period. =\\"The Fanatic\\" Sports Radio= On October 9, 2009, at 5 p.m., after playing Streetcorner Symphony by Rob Thomas, WNUW flipped to an FM simulcast of WPEN, with the new identity of \\"97.5 The Fanatic, Powered by ESPN.\\" The call sign was switched from WNUW to WPEN-FM. Some of the time, the two stations would simulcast; during national live game broadcasts from ESPN Radio or another network, the AM side would carry the games, while WPEN-FM would feature Philadelphia-focused sports talk. On December 21, 2012, AM 950 was sold to Family Radio and became WKDN. After the completion of the sale on January 10, 2013, WPEN-FM was assigned the WPEN call sign by the FCC. WPEN-FM was Philadelphia's only FM sports station for its first two years until CBS Radio owned rival WIP moved to FM, replacing WYSP. Beginning with the 2012 NBA Playoffs, WPEN-FM became the flagship station for the Philadelphia 76ers, moving away from WIP-FM, where they were aired for years. Less than a week later, the Philadelphia Flyers announced they too were leaving WIP-FM for WPEN. In 2016, WPEN began airing Philadelphia Soul regular season games, in the Arena Football League. On July 19, 2016, the Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WPEN) for $240 million.Beasley Acquires Greater Media The FCC approved the sale on October 6, and the sale closed on November 1.Beasley Closes on Greater Media Purchase; Makes Multiple Staff Moves Signal note WPEN is short-spaced to WENJ 97.3 ESPN (licensed to serve Millville, New Jersey) as they operate on first adjacent channels (97.5 and 97.3) and the cities they are licensed to serve are only 47 miles apart.

Demography Population structure of Thimarafushi, as of June 2006 The island has a recorded population of 4253 people as of July 2013. =Women= The number of women in the island is comparatively small compared to the population of males. The number of females under 18 years of age was 422. While the age group of 18-65 comprised 611 women, the elderly females numbered 46. Therefore, the total population of females in the island is 1934. =Men= Statistical records as of June 2006 showed that the number of boys (aged below 18) was 520. The adult male population (18-65) was 745, and the male senior citizens (65+) were 64. Therefore, the male population of the island was 1,329. According to the population chart shown here, the small island of Thimarafushi has a developing community's population structure. Economy Though the islanders of this beautiful island mainly depend upon the primary sector of the economic activities, they are also involved in the secondary and tertiary sectors. While fishing has become their main source of income, contract work, shipping and business have also taken their place in the economic activities of the island. =Services= The people of Thimarafushi collect rainwater for their daily consumption. There are 39 public rainwater tanks and 325 private rainwater tanks located in the island. The sewerage system in the island is not connected to the sea, which lowers the chances of polluting the sea water surrounding the island. According to recorded statistics as of June 2006, the number of houses with toilets was 298. The number of houses with water pumps was 171. Healthcare According to the information as of April 2016, it was recorded that the island has one health centre, which is owned by the government, employing two doctors, eleven nurses, two community health workers, two family health workers, twenty administrative staff and one midwife. Thimarafushi also has two pharmacists and one public private pharmacy. The standards of western medicine are considered good in the island. Sport In Thimarafushi there is a youth centre which provides many indoor games, like table tennis, billiard, badminton, and futsal. It's not for school students after 6pm. There is a bashi court for women, and a volley court for males and females. and a new basket ball court is to be opened. Transportation Thimarafushi has 164 bicycles, of which 162 are privately owned while the remaining two are owned by the government. One pick-up truck is also owned by the government, four motorcycles are privately owned, and two other vehicles are registered under private ownership. As Maldives is famous for its surrounding sea and its bountiful treasures under water, Thimarafushi has its own sea transport vehicles. It owns two launches used for various purposes and nine mechanized dhoani used for fishing. No sailing dhoani, vadhu dhoani, bokkuraa nor sathari dhoani were recorded in the statistics sheets of the Maldives in June 2006. It has three other boats which travel between Mal√© and atolls. In September 2013, built on reclaimed land, Thimarafushi Airport was opened in the island. The size of the island increased to following this project, that also added a new neighborhood.

His brother Hal Scott was also a sportscaster. Early life and career A native of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Scott began his broadcasting career on local radio in the late 1930s. (Fellow announcer Bill McColgan, in his introduction of Ray Scott for the radio broadcast of the 1957 NFL Championship Game, stated that Scott started broadcasting when he was only 17 years old.) Following a stint in the U.S. Army during World War II, he moved to Pittsburgh, where he did play-by-play for Carnegie Tech and University of Pittsburgh football and Duquesne University basketball. Green Bay Packers and CBS Sports Scott's first NFL broadcasts came in 1953 over the DuMont network; three years later he began doing play-by-play on Packers broadcasts for CBS,\\"Ray Scott, 78, Voice of Packers During Glory Seasons in the 60's,\\" The New York Times, Sunday, March 29, 1998. Scott was paired primarily with Tony Canadeo on Packers telecasts. As the team's play-by-play announcer, Scott broadcast Super Bowl I and II for CBS, along with the brutally cold \\"Ice Bowl\\" NFL championship game of 1967. It was during this period that his terse, minimalist style (e.g. : \\"Starr . . . Dowler . . . Touchdown, Green Bay!\\") developed its greatest following. It also earned him a reputation as \\"King of Understatement\\". Scott was also known for only occasionally using team names while broadcasting, more often identifying them by their city. In 1968, CBS ended its practice of assigning dedicated announcing crews to particular teams. Scott became the play-by-play announcer on CBS' lead NFL broadcast team. He was partnered with Paul Christman in 1968 and 1969 and Pat Summerall from 1970 to 1973. During his tenure with CBS he called four Super Bowls, seven NFL (later NFC) championship games, and the 1961 Orange Bowl; he also called major college bowl games for ABC and NBC during this period. Baseball broadcasting Scott was the lead television and radio announcer for Major League Baseball's Minnesota Twins from to , calling the 1965 World Series on NBC television alongside Vin Scully, the voice of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Scott's famous minimalist style was evident in his call of Lou Johnson's home run that broke a scoreless tie and proved to be the game winner (\\"Kaat's pitch, uh-oh, it's a long fly down the left field line. Home run\\"). After Sandy Koufax struck out his tenth hitter for the final out of the series, Scott stated \\"every pitcher likes to end a game with a strikeout. But this was not just any game. It was the 7th game of the World Series.\\" After leaving Minnesota he called games for the Washington Senators in 1970-71 before returning to the Twins as a part-time announcer in 1973-75\\\\. Scott also called Milwaukee Brewers telecasts in 1976-77\\\\. Later life and career CBS dismissed Scott in 1974, replacing him with his color commentator, Summerall. He was subsequently employed as a local radio announcer by the Kansas City Chiefs (1974-75), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1976-77), and Minnesota Vikings (1978-82). Scott also served as a narrator for the NFL Films Game of the Week in the 1970s and called play-by-play of Phoenix Suns basketball in 1974-75, syndicated broadcasts of Penn State football from 1975-81, the USFL's Arizona Wranglers in 1983 and 1984, and the Portland Breakers in the 1985 season. In 1988, Scott was one of several veteran announcers to call some September NFL telecasts for NBC, while many of the network's regular broadcasters were working at that year's Summer Olympics in Seoul. Scott also called UCLA, Arizona, Minnesota, and Nebraska football in the '80s, broadcast college basketball and golf at various points in his career, and teamed with Patrick Ryan while doing high school and college football in and around Billings, Montana. From 1986-88 he called the annual Peach Bowl game for the Mizlou Television Network. In the later years of his life he hosted a syndicated talk show on the short-lived SportsAmerica Radio Network. In addition to sportscasting, Ray Scott also read newscasts at WCCO- FM in Minneapolis in the late 1970s and early '80s. Scott died in 1998 at age 78 in Minneapolis following a long illness. He was survived by his second wife, Bonnie, and his first wife, Eda and their five children.http://www3.jsonline.com/packer/sbxxxiii/news/ray32398.stm Awards and honors Scott was twice named National Sportscaster of the Year by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, was given regional awards by that organization 12 times in four different states, and was inducted into its Hall of Fame in 1982. Posthumous honors include induction into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame in 1998, receipt of the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000, and induction into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame as a contributor in July 2001. Scott was ranked 28th in the American Sportscasters Association's list of the Top 50 Sportscasters of All Time in 2009.http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/top50sportscasters.html His bare-bones style has inspired many sportscasters.

They are otherwise civilians, and in peacetime have careers outside the military. Reservists usually go for training on an annual basis to refresh their skills. This person is usually a former active-duty member of the armed forces, and they remain a reservist either voluntarily, or by obligation. In some countries such as Israel, Norway, Finland, Singapore, and Switzerland, reservists are conscripted soldiers who are called up for training and service when necessary.  History  Belgian Reservists leaving the Gare du Nord in Paris, 1914 The notion of a reservist has been around, in many forms, for thousands of years. In ancient times, reservist forces such as the Anglo-Saxon Fyrd and the Viking Leidangr formed the main fighting strength of most armies. It was only at the end of the 17th century that professional standing armies became the norm. Historically reservists played a significant role in Europe after the Prussian defeat in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. On 9 July 1807 in the Treaty of Tilsit, Napoleon forced Prussia to drastically reduce its military strength, in addition to ceding large amounts of territory. The Prussian army could no longer be stronger than 42,000 men. The Kr√ºmpersystem, introduced to the Prussian army by the military reformer Gerhard von Scharnhorst, arranged for giving recruits a short period of training, which in the event of war could be considerably expanded. With this the reduction of the army's strength did not have the desired effect, and in the following wars Prussia was able to draw up a large number of trained soldiers. By the time of the Second Reich reservists were already being given so-called \\"war arrangements\\" following the completion of their military service, which contained exact instructions relating to the conduct of reservists in time of war.  By country  =Canada= = Germany = Every conscript which has served at least a day in the Bundeswehr is a reservist, unless he is declared ineligible for military service or has made a claim of conscientious objection. Soldiers of enlisted ranks with a limited contract (either 4, 8 or 12 years) or professional soldiers, who have filled their tour of duty, are likewise part of the reserve. This is also the case for women, but on the basis of the Soldatengesetz (Eng: Soldier Bill), not the Wehrpflichtgesetz (Conscription Bill). Every soldier follows his rank with the initials \\"d.R.\\" (\\"der Reserve\\"‚Äî\\"in the reserve\\"). So it does not affect whether the soldier is called up, placed in an inactive formation, or not. Only professional soldiers use the appellation \\"a.D.d.R\\" (\\"au√üer Dienst, der Reserve\\"‚Äî\\"out of service, in the reserve\\") after the end of their service. All others (part-time soldiers and conscripts) strictly use \\"d.R.\\" until the end of their lives. Reservists are an integral part of the Bundeswehr. They are essential for the capability of the armed forces in time of war. Reservists can be active in the Bundeswehr in addition to their mandatory service. This mostly happens through (mostly voluntarily) military exercises or official events. Apart from that the Bundeswehr organises reservist unions as particularly representative supporting organisations of \\"voluntarily reservist work\\". Eligibility for compulsory military service for soldiers and other servicemen of low rank ends at the end of the 45th year of age. Thereafter the conscript is no longer part of the reserve. Despite that the appellations \\"a.D.\\" and/or \\"d.R.\\" may still be used. Conscription for non- commissioned officers (NCOs) and officers lasts until the 60th year of age. Until the 32nd year of age every conscript is subject to military inspection. Recognised conscientious objectors, who have completed their civil service, are nonetheless part of the reserve and in the event of war will be given a suitable non-combatant role outside the Bundeswehr, such as emergency medical services, clearing debris or minesweeping. All conscripts who have not done their service belong to the Ersatzreserve (replacement reserve). =Singapore= All male able-bodied Singapore citizens and second-generation permanent residents upon reaching the age of 18 are obliged by law to serve National Service compulsorily as a national duty to defend the Singapore city- state island. They must serve a mandatory two-year active period as Full-Time National Servicemen (NSFs), deployed to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Police Force (SPF), or the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). When a Singapore conscript completes his active service, he attains the status of being an \\"operationally ready\\" citizen-soldier, and is thereafter known as an Operationally-Ready National Serviceman (NSman). NSmen are the equivalent of other militaries' reservists. The slight difference in nomenclature is as to these NSmen will form the main fighting personnel of the Singapore Armed Forces upon wartime or any national exigencies. In practice, Operationally- Ready NSmen of all the tri-service (SAF, SPF and SCDF) are all routinely called up annually for reservist duty until they complete their reservist cycle obligations or upon the legally statutory discharge age of 40 for Warrant Officers, Specialists and Enlistees ( WOSEs) and 50 for Officers.https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/site/faq?group=mindef-nsmen&topic;=faqs- for-mindef-reserve-ex-nsmen =Spain= Reservistas Voluntarios (Volunteer Reservists) provide the Spanish Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air Force) branches of qualified civilian professionals essentially required for each army. The training is divided in two phases. The first stage it's the Basic Training in military knowledge. The time for this phase are normally two weeks. The second stage, which typical time are one week, it's the Specific Training, in this phase the applicant for Reservist develop the specific tasks in his military unit. When the Applicant approve the two stages acquires the Reservist title and the rank of Soldier, Sergeant or Second Lieutenant (Alf√©rez). The time of the Reservist commitment is three years, with extensions until 58 years of age for Officers and NCO and 55 years old for ordinary soldiers. = United Kingdom = British Army Reservists applying camouflage during a training exercise. All three branches of the British Armed Forces have volunteer reserves. Reservists hold civilian jobs and train on a stipulated number of weekends monthly. They are generally assigned to an administrative corps or specialist trade according to their occupations and location in the country. *Army Reserve *Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Marines Reserve *Royal Auxiliary Air Force = United States = All five branches of the United States armed forces have their own Reserve Forces, whose reservists can be called upon to serve anywhere at any time: *United States Army Reserve *Marine Forces Reserve (U.S. Marine Corps) *United States Navy Reserve *Air Force Reserve Command (U.S. Air Force) *United States Coast Guard Reserve There is also the United States National Guard, which is under dual Federal/State control, and is traditionally intended for homeland defense and domestic disaster relief (although large numbers have been deployed in the War on Terror, and as such the distinction between National Guardsmen and Reservists has become blurred). The National Guard is divided into: *Army National Guard (U.S. Army) *Air National Guard (U.S. Air Force) During peacetime, Reservists and National Guardsmen spend a minimum of one weekend a month, two weeks a year annually in training. Reservists and National Guardsmen in front tier combat organizations, such as aviation units flying combat aircraft and combat support aircraft, will be funded for additional military drill duty or active duty for training in order to maintain skill levels. They may also perform additional duty in support of the active duty forces and/or in lieu of their active duty counterparts. Some states also maintain non-federal state defense forces as a small reserve for their National Guard units. These units cannot be deployed beyond the borders of their states and cannot be federalized. =Israel= Israeli officers in reserve duty before parachuting exercise. Reserve service may continue until the age of 51Israel Defense Forces (IDF)‚ÄîAn IntroductionJewish Virtual Library After personnel complete their regular service, the IDF may call up men for: * reserve service of up to one month annually, until the age of 40‚Äì45 (reservists may volunteer after this age) * active duty immediately in times of crisis In most cases, the reserve duty is carried out in the same unit for years, in many cases the same unit as the active service and by the same people. Many soldiers who have served together in active service continue to meet in reserve duty for years after their discharge, causing reserve duty to become a strong male bonding experience in Israeli society. Although still available for call-up in times of crisis, most Israeli men, and virtually all women, do not actually perform reserve service in any given year. Units do not always call up all of their reservists every year, and a variety of exemptions are available if called for regular reserve service. Virtually no exemptions exist for reservists called up in a time of crisis, but experience has shown that in such cases (most recently, the 2006 Lebanon War) exemptions are rarely requested or exercised; units generally achieve recruitment rates above those considered fully manned. =Finland= Finnish reservists in a training exercise. The Finnish Defence Forces is based on a universal male conscription. All men above 18 years of age are liable to serve either 6, 9 or 12 months. Yearly about 27,000 conscripts are trained. 80% of the males complete the service. The conscripts first receive basic training, after which they are assigned to various units for special training. Privates who are trained for tasks not requiring special skills serve for 6 months. In technically demanding tasks the time of service is 9, or in some cases 12 months. Those selected for NCO (non-commissioned officer) or officer training serve 12 months. At the completion of the service, the conscripts receive a reserve military rank of private, lance corporal, corporal, sergeant or second lieutenant, depending on their training and accomplishments.The Finnish legislation concerning conscription has been completely overhauled in 2007. The new legislation which has already been approved by the Parliament of Finland will, most likely, come into force 1-1-2008. No changes are made to the service periods, which are given in Conscription Act (452/1950), 5¬ß and in the new Conscription Act, 37¬ß. (Both laws in Finnish) After their military service, the conscripts are placed in reserve until the end of their 50th or 60th living year, depending on their military rank. During their time in reserve, the reservists are liable to participate in military refresher exercises for a total of 40, 75 or 100 days, depending on their military rank. In addition, all reservists are liable for activation in a situation where the military threat against Finland has seriously increased, in full or partial mobilization or in a large-scale disaster or a virulent epidemic. The males who do not belong to the reserve may only be activated in case of full mobilization, and those rank-and-file personnel who have fulfilled 50 years of age only with a specific parliamentary decision.The reserve obligation is listed in the ¬ß¬ß6‚Äì7 of the Conscription Act (452/1950) () and in ¬ß¬ß49‚Äì50 of the new Conscription Act (. The old Conscription Act mandates the activation of the reserve only in case of full or partial mobilization (¬ß10). The new Conscription Act allows for selective activation of reservists even in situations which do not require even partial mobilization (¬ß¬ß78‚Äì89).

Route description Texas State Highway 46 west of its intersection with Loop 337 SH 46 begins at its western terminus at SH 16, east of Bandera in Bandera County. The highway heads to the northeast, crossing over into Kendall County on its way to Boerne where it intersects with I-10 and US 87. SH 46 carries the street name of Bandera Road from I-10 until US 87. At US 87, there is a short break in the highway with SH 46 continuing again further north with the name River Road. SH 46 leaves the city limits of Boerne to the east and follows an east-northeast routing through rural Kendall County. An intersection with FM 3351 occurs just prior to heading into Comal County. Continuing to the east, SH 46 passes FM 2696 before coming into the city of Bulverde. In Bulverde, SH 46 intersects with US 281 at a diamond interchange, which provides access to San Antonio to the south. The highway continues to the east-southeast, passing several farm-to- market roads with FM 3159 and RM 2722 providing access to Canyon Lake. As it enters New Braunfels, Texas, it intersects and becomes concurrent with Loop 337, providing the northern and eastern arcs of the loop around New Braunfels. In New Braunfels, the highway passes over the Guadalupe River and intersects I-35. Continuing to the south-southeast, it heads towards Seguin as it passes into Guadalupe County and roughly parallels the Guadalupe River to the east. In Seguin, SH 46 passes I-10 and US 90 before ending at SH 123 just south of Seguin.

Divers is a word of Latin origin (diversus) that is still commonly used in modern French language; it literally means \\"many and varied\\". This usage of the word Divers can be found in the Bible and other older texts, but it is not commonly used in modern English. The phrase is still used to refer to the authorship of plays, essay collections, and short story collections by multiple authors.  Divers hands in the past  The oldest usage of the term to date online is William Strachey A True Reportory of the Wrack (1610) \\"Fowl there is great store, small birds, sparrows fat and plump like a bunting, bigger than ours, robins of divers colors green and yellow, ordinary and familiar in our cabins, and, other of less sort;\\" There does not appear to be the use of 'divers hands' in the English bible itself, but often in scholarly works about the bible. There are several uses of the word 'divers', however. For example, in the King James version of the Bible, \\"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.\\" The very rare alternative spelling 'dyvers hands' was historically used, for instance in the parish records of St John in Bedwardine, Worcestershire, England \\"that 'thro' dyvers hands it came to Mr. Thomas Hall of Henwyke, the father of John Hall.\\"  Divers hands and the Cthulhu Mythos  The most common modern-day usage of divers hands is found in the stories of the Cthulhu Mythos, created by H. P. Lovecraft and expanded by other authors. How the term originated and why it regularly came to be used to refer to Cthulhu Mythos stories is unknown. It was originated either by Lovecraft himself or by his prot√©g√© August Derleth, who first published many of Lovecraft's works. Derleth's publishing company, Arkham House, was the first to codify this usage with their publication of The Shuttered House and Other Rooms (1959), and later The Dark Brotherhood and Other Pieces (1966). Each was bylined \\"H. P. Lovecraft and Divers Hands\\", and each included original stories and poems by H. P. Lovecraft as well as derivative works and essays by other notables, including Fritz Leiber and Jack L. Chalker. The phrase can be found in reference to many of the original weird fiction writers, including not just Lovecraft but also Clark Ashton Smith. It has also been used in many modern collections, such as the Call of Cthulhu books.  Divers hands today  The most common non-Chthulhu Mythos usage of the term 'divers hands' is \\"By (someone's real name) and Divers Hands\\", which tells people that the principal author wants to give credit to all the others who contributed. Example: * Notes on League of Extraordinary Gentlemen hardcover edition, by Jess Nevins and divers hands This is deeply annotated study of all the eclectic literary references from the comic book. The second most common usage of 'divers hands' is when you need to list name an author in an alphabetic list and when there isn't any author's name, use 'divers hands'. * For instance, in the index for the magazine Baryon there are many entries for the author 'Divers Hands' * In this SF Fiction Mags Index 'divers hands' is listed in Stories by Author - Section D Otherwise, most of the usage seen for 'divers hands' is in literary criticism, for instance: * From Happy Knack: \\"Depending on how the next volume pans out, the complete Life is going to be at least treble and possibly quadruple the size of your average biography of Auden, Eliot or Pound, and might even outdo the Bible, which was of course written by divers hands, over a 1500-year period, and may have been assisted in its composition by the Spirit of God Him or Herself.\\" * Essays by Divers Hands: Being the Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature New Series, XLIV Category:Cthulhu Mythos ","title":"Divers hands"},{"id":"2364105","text":"Hognut or pignut can mean any of a number of unrelated plants: * Bunium bulbocastanum (black cumin) or Conopodium majus (kippernut) of the Apiaceae * rushpeas, particularly Hoffmannseggia glauca (Indian rushpea) and Hoffmannseggia densiflora, of the Fabaceae * Carya glabra (pignut hickory) of the Juglandaceae * Hyptis suaveolens (chan) of the Lamiaceae ","title":"Hognut"},{"id":"2364118","title":"Rokk √≠ Reykjav√≠k (soundtrack)"},{"id":"2364123","text":"Rail transport in Singapore mainly consists of a passenger urban rail transit system spanning the entire city-state: a rapid transit system collectively known as the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system operated by the two biggest public transport operators SMRT Trains (SMRT Corporation) and SBS Transit, as well as several Light Rail Transit (LRT) rubber-tyred automated guideway transit lines also operated by both companies. In addition, local specialised light rail lines are in operation in places such as the Singapore Changi Airport and Sentosa. A short remaining section of the railway originally built during the British colonial period is connected to the Malaysian rail network, and is operated by Malaysian railway company Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM). The Singapore section of the railway now serves only inter-city passenger services; until 2011 the railway also carried freight between Malaysia and the Port of Singapore at Tanjong Pagar. Two other international rail connections are currently planned: the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail and the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System. Although Singapore is not a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC) given the nature of Singapore as a city-state and its lack of a national railway proper, SMRT Corporation, SBS Transit and the Land Transport Authority are members of the International Association of Public Transport (UITP). SMRT Corporation is also a member of the Community of Metros (CoMET) benchmarking group. History =Early railways in the 19th century= A steam tram as used in 1880s Singapore The first railway in Singapore was a steam railway dating back to 1877 that was used by the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company to \\"aid the labour of unloading vessels\\"; this railway ran along the mile-long wharf was served using 0-4-0ST shunters supplied by Dick & Stevenson. The foundations for the first tramway in Singapore were first laid in 1882 with the formation of the London-based Singapore Tramway Company following an approval under the 1882 Tramways Ordinance to construct five steam tramway lines across Singapore Town. On 8 December 1883, the Singapore Tramway Company launched a prospectus to construct and build tramways for the transport of passengers and goods in Singapore. The first rails were laid on 7 April 1885, and the first regular service from Tanjong Pagar to Johnston's Pier began on 3 May 1886. The tramway was operated using 16 (initially 14) 0-4-0ST steam tram engines from Kitson and Company and double-deck passenger trailer cars. However, the tramway proved to not be competitive against other modes of transport like the rickshaws and was discontinued in 1894. The first electric railways in Singapore began in 1891 as a 180 feet-long demonstration line built along New Harbour (present-day Keppel Harbour) by Charles Buckley with anticipation that an electric tramway between the Town and Kranji be built eventually. Several distinguished figures, including the Sultan of Johore were invited to witness the experiment and the Sultan rode on a makeshift tramcar up and down the line. This was followed by the Kranji Electric Line built near the residence of the Johore Sultan in 1892. Despite initial positive reception on the opening of the Line, little materialised out of the demonstrations. =Singapore-Kranji Railway, 1900s= Tank Road station, the original town terminus of the Singapore Government Railway Plans to build a railway line through Singapore, primarily to service the New Harbour had been mooted as early as 1869 by Engineer W. J. du Port of the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company but the project to build a railway line was only approved by Governor Charles Bullen Hugh Mitchell only in 1899 after then Governor Cecil Clementi Smith raised the need for it in an 1889 Legislative Council meeting. Construction works were then initiated, with the groundbreaking ceremony held on 16 April 1900. Chinese labour was employed principally. C. E. Spooner, general manager of the Federated Malay States Railway (FMSR), was appointed the supervisor of the project. At a total cost of $1,967,495, the Singapore-Kranji Railway (also known as the Singapore Government Railway), running from Singapore to Kranji, was completed in 1903. The first section was launched on 1 January 1903. It stretched from Singapore station at Tank Road to Bukit Timah and consisted of four stations along the line: Singapore, Newton, Cluny and Bukit Timah. According to a newspaper report the following day, ‚Äúa total of 557¬Ω passengers were carried‚Äù on the opening day. The second section, which extended the line to Woodlands, was completed three months later when the Woodlands station was opened on 10 April 1903. In 1903, there were a total of 426,044 passengers. By 1905, this had increased to 525,553. Soon after, work began on the extension of the railway line from a point near Tank Road where a new through station was built in 1906/7 to the wharves at Pasir Panjang. The extension was completed and opened on 21 January 1907. With the extension, the stations along the line were Woodlands, Mandai, Bukit Panjang, Bukit Timah, Holland, Cluny, Newton, Tank Road, Borneo Wharf and Pasir Panjang. Rolling stock-wise, the railway initially used four 4-4-0 steam locomotives from Hunslet Engine Company and in 1907, acquired another two of such engines. The Singapore- Kranji Railway initially ran nine trains every day: six through-trains between Woodlands and Tank Road and three trains stopping at Bukit Timah. The last train of the day left Tank Road for Bukit Timah at 6.40 pm. By 1904, there were eight runs per day with all trains running between Tank Road and Woodlands. At a speed of 16 to 29 km/h, trains now took 54 to 55 minutes to reach Woodlands from the Town as opposed to two hours on other transport modes like the bullock cart, horse carriage or rickshaw. =Return of the tramway, 1905-1926= Singapore Traction Company (STC) took over the fledging tramway network in 1925. A third-class tram as operated by STC circa mid-1920s Meanwhile, tramways were experiencing a construction boom across many urban areas following improvements for electric tramways by Frank J. Sprague in 1888. With high hopes of exporting the electric tram beyond domestic markets, Singapore Tramways Ltd was established in 1901 to build an electric tramway for Singapore. The Tramways Ordinance of 1902 was subsequently enacted, granting rights to the company to build and run a tramway in Singapore. Five lines, which both ran along the original steam tram alignment and extended beyond the original steam tram network, were planned but another line running between High Street and Orchard Road and a connecting line to a depot at Mackenzie Road were also built. In 1905, a power station was built to provide electricity supply for the overhead lines of the tramway; the same station also powered the electric street lighting of the municipality. The electric tramway was to operate both passenger services and freight services. To this extent a variety of rolling stock was acquired from the United Electric Car Company, namely cross-bench tramcars and \\"Californian\\" tramcars for passenger services and freight motors, open wagons and vans for freight transport. On 29 March 1905, the Singapore Tramways was officially acquired by the Singapore Electric Tramways Limited. The electric tramways opened to public on 24 July 1905 to little fanfare. Run-ins with bullock carts and rickshaw drivers as well as vandals troubled the electric tram operations. The growth of the island's commerce provided the impetus for increased hauls, which included passengers, though human traffic on the trams saw slow growth. The competition from rickshaws remained stiff. Nonetheless, the reduction in tram fares increased ridership to 32,000 in 1909; at the end of that year, the company was in the black ‚Äì albeit with an ultra-modest profit of ¬£134.26. The tram operators faced the strain of having to replace the tracks and maintain the generators. By 1913, all the tracks required replacement and the generators were worked to full capacity. The outbreak of the First World War restricted the overhauling efforts; by 1921, Singapore Electric Tramways was making losses of ¬£50,000 annually. It sought professional advice from the successful Shanghai Electric Construction Company, and then undertook a complete rehabilitation in a last-ditch effort to keep the system alive. The trams were rebuilt and the fare scales revised. Fares for short-distance travellers (less than approximately 2.4 km) were reduced and the result was dramatic. There was a 235-percent increase in ridership and revenues increased by 95 percent. Singapore Electric Tramways saw a profit of ¬£23,000 in 1923.28. Just as the system started becoming viable, however, the municipal commissioners refused to extend tramway concessions. They cited incompatibility of the parties‚Äô interests over the state of the roads on which the trams ran and were embarrassed that the reconstructed tracks ran on fine, metalled surface while the outside lanes were battered. On 1 October 1925, the electric tramways was taken over by the Singapore Traction Company (STC), which was tasked to convert from trams to trolley buses. The last trams ran on the streets in 1927. =Subsequent developments, 1910-1941= Tanjong Pagar served as the railway terminus from 1932 to 2011. In 1904, the Sultan of Johore signed off a 194 km line between Gemas and Johor Bahru which was completed in 1909. There was now an almost continuous rail link between Singapore and Penang excluding the crossing of the Straits of Johor, which was served using two boats named Singapore and Johore. In 1913, the Singapore-Kranji Railway was sold off to FMSR at a price of $4.136 million in anticipation of eventual connections between the two railways. This connection was finally fulfilled in 1923 with the opening of the Causeway. From 1929 to 1932, the portion of the railway between Bukit Timah and Pasir Panjang was deviated from its original alignment to a new route running through Tanglin and Alexandra to Tanjong Pagar to eliminate the level crossings along the original alignment. Military railways, 1920s-1930s Hawthorn Leslie 0-4-0ST 3865 \\"Singapore\\" The Admiralty Military Railway was a line that branched off the main line near Woodlands and was built in the 1930s to serve the Naval Shipyard at Sembawang. Three of the locomotives were 0-6-0Ts built by Hunslet in 1929 and numbered SL18-20. In November 1941 they were transferred to the FMSR as the second Class A, later becoming 331 class before being sold to the Port Of Singapore in 1946. In addition to the metre gauge line there was a standard gauge system and two of the locomotives which operated this system were returned to the UK in 1955. One of these, Hawthorn Leslie 3865 of 1936, an 0-4-0ST named \\"Singapore\\", has been preserved. The Changi Military Railway was a 4-mile long standard gauge line built by the FMSR for the War Department, for the protection of Singapore's new Naval Base at Sembawang. The fortifications for the Naval Base were laid at the entrance to the Old Strait, at Changi, where one 15-inch gun, one 9-inch battery, one 6-inch battery and search lights were installed. The artillery installations were supplied with underground ammunition depots and loaded with armour piercing shells. On the beach, concrete machine emplacements and wire were installed. Airfields in Sembawang, Seletar and Tengah were to provide air cover for the Base. Bagnalls of Stafford supplied an 0-6-0ST, number 2547 of 6/1936, to the War Office department, Changi, Singapore. It had 16\\" x 22\\" cylinders and 3' 4\\" driving wheels. It was last seen derelict in 1947 but its fate is unknown. The railway ran from Fairy Point pier to the battery with a short branch to a depot. =Post-war developments, 1950s-1995= Disused railway bridge in the defunct KTM Jurong Line. A map of the initial MRT system used from 1987‚Äì1996 By the time the Second World War ended in 1945, the FMSR was still operating six stations along the line: Tanjong Pagar, Tanglin Halt, Bukit Timah, Bukit Panjang, Kranji and Woodlands. In 1946, the FMSR closed Tanglin Halt, Bukit Panjang and Kranji to allow for faster travel between Woodlands and Tanjong Pagar. Meanwhile, FMSR was renamed as Malayan Railways in 1948 after the formation of the Federation of Malaya; in 1962 it was renamed again as Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM). In 1953, a proposal was made to convert the existing Malayan Railway line into a double-tracked electrified light rail transit system to resolve the congestion problem; diesel railcars could be used should this not be economic. Nothing materialised out of the proposal however. When STC bus drivers went on strike in 1956, a local supplementary train service had to be provided by the Malayan Railways to provide relief for commuters affected by the strike. In 1961 the Singapore Harbour Board had 16 miles of tracks in its 950-acre site, which were connected to the main line west of Tanjong Pagar station. By the 1970s it had been renamed to the Port of Singapore Authority and owned a number of diesel shunters. Following full internal self-governance of Singapore in 1959, the new government under the People's Action Party pursued an aggressive industrialisation policy to resolve unemployment problems, one of which included building Jurong Industrial Estate in 1960. Keen on tapping the economic hinterland of Malaya, a freight-only Jurong Line was built in 1963 and was opened in 1965. Trains would run west from Bukit Timah under Clementi Road, through Ulu Pandan, under a roundabout at Upper Ayer Rajah Road and Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim and branched out into three lines that penetrated into Jurong Industrial Estate. Despite high expectations of having 2-3 million tons of good moved every year, a shaky merger with Malaysia from 1963 to 1965 led to under-utilisation of the line's potential. The Jurong Line eventually closed in the 1990s despite renewed calls from the Automobile Association of Singapore and various members of the public to upgrade the line for passenger service. Use of steam locomotives was discontinued in Singapore in 1972. Electrification was planned since the late 1970s but plans never come to fruition. KTM trialled railbus services using experimental vehicles from BRE-Leyland and Ganz Mavag of Hungary between Singapore and Johor Bahru in 1988. In 1982, a closed loop monorail line commenced operations at the resort island of Sentosa following the approval of plans to build it in 1979. The same year, the green light was also given to the construction of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) following a three-phase study conducted from 1972 to 1982 and a debate on an all-bus system against a bus- rail system. The initial MRT network opened in phases from 1987 to 1990, two years ahead of the original deadline of 1992. In 1990, an rubber-tyred automated people mover, the Changi Airport Skytrain, was opened in Changi Airport to connect between Terminal 1 and the then newly-opened Terminal 2 on both the landside and airside. Like many of its contemporaries such as the Tampa International Airport People Movers and the Gatwick Airport Shuttle Transit, the Skytrain initially used the fully automated Westinghouse-Adtranz C-100 system. In 1995, the statutory board in charge of the MRT, the MRTC, was merged with several other statutory boards in charge of other land transport matters to form the Land Transport Authority. =Last train out of Tanjong Pagar, 2011= Since 2011, KTM trains stop at Woodlands instead of Tanjong Pagar. The government of Singapore greatly coveted the 217 hectares of land used for the KTM line that was under Malaysian jurisdiction. In 1990, Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew and Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin signed a landmark Points of Agreement (POA) where KTM would withdraw north to Woodlands from Tanjong Pagar in return for three parcels of Singapore land by a company jointly owned by Singapore and Malaysia. However, several terms of the POA came under disagreement between the two governments and little progress was made. In 1998, Singapore moved its CIQ facilities to Woodlands from Tanjong Pagar but Malaysia did not follow suit. It was only in 2010 when an agreement was reached between the Prime Ministers Lee Hsien Loong and Najib Razak to close the loops in the POA. In the end, KTM was shortened to Woodlands Train Checkpoint, while any plans south of Woodlands Train Checkpoint were removed. A cross-border metro system was also agreed upon by the two governments. On 30 June 2011, Tanjong Pagar railway station saw its last train out before it was closed the next day. =Contemporary developments, 1990s onwards= Bayfront MRT station is one of the newer MRT stations in the network and was opened in 2012. The old timber sleepers on the two oldest MRT lines were replaced with concrete ones from 2013 to 2016. Since the completion of the initial MRT system in 1990, the Singapore government has taken steps to further expand the city-state's urban rail network; said expansions have been highlighted in many plans such as the 1996 White Paper and various Land Transport Master Plans, the latest of which intends to bring the length of the MRT network up to almost 400 km by 2040. The first of such extensions was the Woodlands extension connecting Sembawang, Woodlands and Kranji to Yishun and Choa Chu Kang in 1996. In 2002, a spur line connecting Changi Airport to the main MRT network via Singapore Expo was fully completed while a new infill MRT station, Dover MRT station, also commenced operations. In 2003, the first fully automated heavy rail metro line (there are several older fully automated medium capacity urban rail systems in cities such as Lille) opened between Punggol and Harbourfront. Following studies on the feasibility of urban applications of automated people mover systems as feeder transport in the 1990s, a Light Rapid Transit (LRT) line was built between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang and was opened in 1999. However, this LRT line was plagued with many problems such as damaged guide rails. The subsequent LRT lines built in Sengkang and Punggol in the early 2000s hence used the Mitsubishi Crystal Mover instead; said technology was also adopted for the Changi Airport Skytrain in 2007 to replace the original C-100 system when the system was renewed further expanded to serve the new Terminal 3. Several LRT systems were also planned for many other new towns but were either cancelled or planned as new MRT lines instead. In 2002, construction of the Circle Line, which was previously conceived as separate LRT lines, commenced and was to connect the sub-regional centres of Bishan, Paya Lebar and Buona Vista together. However, construction was impeded by the collapse of Nicoll Highway in 2004 that claimed four lives and injured another three. Operations of the fully automated medium capacity line only commenced in 2009 and the original line was fully completed by 2012. The second medium-capacity MRT line, the Downtown MRT line, was built from 2008 and was opened in stages from 2013 to 2017. In January 2020, the sixth MRT line, the Thomson-East Coast MRT Line, commenced operations. In 2005, the original Sentosa monorail was closed down due to plans to redevelop Sentosa with an integrated resort by 2010. A new Sentosa Express built by Hitachi commenced operations two years later. The MRT system was hit by a series of serious disruptions in the 2010s, the most serious cases occurring in December 2011, July 2015 and October 2017. To address the problems, the government has sought to renew and expand the network as well as expand the workforce in the rail industry. This has included replacement of sleepers, third rail, power supply, signalling and track circuits on the North South and East West MRT Lines, procurement of new rolling stock for existing lines and building of new lines to relieve congestion on the existing lines. The Singapore Rail Academy was also inaugurated in 2017 to better train railway engineers and a new integrated train testing centre is to be built by 2022 to rigorously test new rail technologies. These efforts are starting to pay off with the reliability of the MRT lines improving by almost ten-fold by 2019. Urban rail transit =Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)= Mass Rapid Transit The Mass Rapid Transit, which opened in 1987, is a heavy rail metro system that serves as the major backbone of Singapore's public transport system along with public buses; as of 2020, the network has a length of and 122 stations. The Land Transport Authority plans to provide a more comprehensive rail transport system by expanding the rail system to a total of by the year 2030, with eight in ten households living within a 10-minute walking distance of an MRT station. The current MRT network consists of six main lines: the North South Line, East West Line, Circle Line and Thomson‚ÄìEast Coast Line operated by SMRT Trains (SMRT Corporation) and the North East Line and Downtown Line operated by SBS Transit. Two more lines, the Jurong Region Line and the Cross Island Line, will open in stages from 2026 and 2029 respectively. =Light Rail Transit (LRT)= Light Rail Transit In several new towns, automated rubber-tyred light rail transit systems function as feeders to the main MRT network in lieu of feeder buses. The first LRT line, which is operated by SMRT Light Rail, opened in Bukit Panjang in 1999 to provide a connection to Choa Chu Kang in neighbouring Choa Chu Kang New Town. Although subsequently hit by over 50 incidents, some of which resulted in several days of system suspension, similar systems albeit from a different company were introduced in Sengkang and Punggol in 2003 and 2005 respectively, both operated by SBS Transit. =Trams= Trams twice operated in Singapore: a steam tram from 1886 to 1894 and an electric tram from 1905 to 1927. Both attempts were unsuccessful and the second attempt was replaced with trolley buses. Airport people mover Changi Airport Skytrain Changi Airport, the main international airport of Singapore, is served by an automated rubber-tyred Skytrain system which first opened in 1990 to connect both the landside and airside of Terminals 1 and 2 when the latter terminal opened the same year. From 2004 to 2007, the original Adtranz C-100 system was replaced with the Mitsubishi Crystal Mover when the system was upgraded and expanded to Terminal 3. In 2019, six more vehicles were phased in and three-car services between Terminals 2 and 3 were introduced to expand the capacity of the system. An underground airport people mover system will also be built to serve the new Terminal 5. Other local rail lines Singapore has had other various forms of light railway systems, such as the monorail system on Sentosa island, which opened in February 1982. This 6.4 km, 6-station system was closed in March 2005 and a new Sentosa Express system was built by December 2006. The Jurong BirdPark previously featured an air-conditioned panorail which closed in 2012. A two-feet gauge railway using diesel-powered \\"steam locomotives\\" had also previously operated at the Singapore Zoo in the mid-1990s. Historically Singapore had also operated several industrial railways at the Port of Singapore and the Mandai Quarry and several military railways at military bases at Admiralty and Changi. International rail links =KTM West Coast railway line= A KTM Intercity train at Woodlands Train Checkpoint Eastern and Oriental Express The sole mainline railway line providing direct international connections is the Malaysian West Coast railway line which runs across the Johor‚ÄìSingapore Causeway from Johor Bahru to Woodlands Train Checkpoint, the southern terminus of the line. The metre-gauge single track previously ran all the way to the Tanjong Pagar railway station in southern Singapore, running through Kranji, Bukit Timah and Buona Vista. The line was however closed on 30 June 2011 and train services, which were provided by Keretapi Tanah Melayu, ended at Woodlands instead. The railway tracks were progressively removed. All KTM Intercity train services used to cross the Causeway and end at Woodlands. However, from 1 July 2015, a shuttle service began running between Johor Bahru Sentral railway station (JB Sentral) in Johor Bahru and Woodlands. Intercity train services formerly serving Woodlands Train Checkpoint terminated at JB Sentral. The shuttle service will be replaced by the Johor Bahru‚ÄìSingapore Rapid Transit System by 2024 when it is expected to become operational. The Eastern and Oriental Express luxury train runs between Woodlands and Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur. =Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail= Plans to build a high-speed rail link between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur have been mooted in recent years. A proposal was brought up in 2006 by YTL Corporation Berhad, builder and operator of the Express Rail Link in Kuala Lumpur, however it was not further acted upon due to the Malaysian government's lack of interest at that time. In 2013, the governments of Singapore and Malaysia officially agreed to build the Kuala Lumpur‚ÄìSingapore High Speed Rail between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore by 2020 at a meeting between Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak in Singapore. The high-speed rail link will cut travel time between the two cities from seven hours on existing rail lines, to about 90 minutes. Malaysia's Land Public Transport Commission chairman, Syed Hamid Albar, announced seven stops in Malaysia for the high speed railway, namely Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Seremban, Ayer Keroh, Muar, Batu Pahat and Nusajaya. In May 2015, the Singapore government announced Jurong East to be the site of the HSR terminus in Singapore, 600 metres away from the current Jurong East MRT station. Construction of the railway was expected to start in 2018. In May 2018, the new Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad initially announced that the line was to be cancelled, but later said that the project was merely delayed. An agreement for a two-year suspension was made, and the line is now expected to open by January 2031. =Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System= The idea of an MRT link across the border to Johor Bahru has been mooted since the first MRT line was built in the 1980s. In 2010 when the relocation of the KTM terminus to Woodlands was agreed, it was also announced that a rapid transit system would be built to enhance connectivity across the border and to relieve congestion on the Johor-Singapore Causeway. The RTS is currently envisioned as a two-station line. Singapore RTS terminus will be at Woodlands North, providing interchange with the Thomson-East Coast MRT Line. The Johor Bahru RTS terminus will be at Bukit Chagar, next to Johor Bahru Sentral railway station and Sultan Iskandar CIQ Building. The two stations will each have combined Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) facilities of both countries, similar to the current arrangement at Woodlands Train Checkpoint. Passengers will clear both countries' border controls before boarding the RTS train, and need no further checks upon arrival at the other station. The RTS link was planned to be operational by 2024, but the project was postponed under the request of the Malaysian government for review, and its completion was pushed to end-2026, with construction starting in 2021. After the completion of the RTS link, train services to Woodlands Train Checkpoint will cease operations, completing KTM's withdrawal from Singapore. Technical specifications =Trackwork and structure gauge= Elevated rail tracks in the MRT network have guard rails for safety purposes. Historically, railway lines from the colonial period, such as the now-defunct trams and the KTM rail lines, used the metre gauge of 1,000mm. However several military railways in former British military bases also used the standard gauge of 1,435mm. The contemporary MRT system uses the 1,435mm standard track gauge with the elevated lines also having guard rails to prevent a derailed vehicle from striking fixed obstructions and viaduct parapets by keeping derailed wheels adjacent to the running rails. Three types of rail tracks are used on the MRT: ballasted track, fixed slab track and floating slab track; floating slab tracks are used at sections of the rail network located beneath densely populated and built-up areas to alleviate vibration and noise transmission to neighbouring buildings, by means of interposing rubberised supports between the tunnel wall and the tracks. When initially built, the MRT used swingnose crossings for 26 out of 131 railway points to minimise noise. From July to November 2000, these swingnose crossings were replaced with conventional ones for reliability reasons. The structure gauge of the MRT is based upon the kinematic envelope such that each point on the perimeter of the kinematic envelope is enlarged vertically upwards by 50mm and horizontally by 100mm. The Sengkang-Punggol LRT and Changi Airport Skytrain use a 1,880mm broad gauge guideway while the Bukit Panjang LRT line relies on a central guide rail. =Coupling= KTM uses AAR couplers on its trains. All trains on the MRT network, including work trains, use Scharfenberg type 35 couplers. The Bukit Panjang LRT uses BSI (Bergische Stahl Industrie) couplers whereas the Mitsubishi Crystal Mover vehicles used on the Sengkang and Punggol LRT use the compact tight coupler from Japan Steel Works. =Railway electrification= Guideway of the Punggol LRT, with the third rail located to the right of the guideway. The entire MRT network uses the 750V DC third rail with the exception of the North East Line, which uses 1,500V overhead catenary. The Bukit Panjang LRT uses a 650V three phase AC third rail located between the guide beams whereas the Sengkang and Punggol LRT use a side-mounted 750V DC third rail. =Railway signalling= Token signalling as used at KTM Bukit Timah station The KTM was known to use token signalling in Singapore as the main line between Woodlands and Tanjong Pagar was a single track line. In contrast the MRT system uses contemporary technology for its signalling systems such as computer-based interlocking, automatic train protection, automatic train operation and automatic train supervision. Although the original signalling system used on the North South and East West MRT lines were previously fixed-block, newer MRT lines use a moving block system and the former two lines have also been migrated to a moving block system. Although all MRT lines are automated and correspond to a Grade of Automation (GOA) 4, degraded modes in the form of Coded Manual and Restricted Manual are available for emergency and shunting purposes. =Railway standards= In the 1980s the railway standards adopted on the MRT network were from the United Kingdom and Japan, with the former being for railway signalling and train control systems and the latter for rolling stock. The NFPA 130 Standard for Fixed Guideway Transit and Passenger Rail Systems from the USA were also initially adopted as no local standards for a rapid transit system existed then until the development of the Standard for Fire Safety in Rapid Transit Systems (SFSRTS) by LTA and the Singapore Civil Defense Force in 2000. Subsequent railway standards for subsequent MRT lines were adopted from CENELEC of Europe; LTA also ensures that these new lines are compliant to standards laid out under ISO TC 269 and IEC TC 9, the latter which LTA is also a participating member.

He was a controversial general in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812. On August 24, 1814, as a brigadier general, he led American troops in their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Bladensburg, which led to the Burning of Washington by British troops. Winder was court-martialed for his role in the battle, but acquitted of any wrongdoing. He later became a leading attorney of the Baltimore bar. Early life and career Winder was born in Somerset County, Maryland. He was the nephew of Levin Winder. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and from 1798 to 1812, practiced law in Baltimore.NIE Winder testified at the impeachment trial of Associate Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804. War of 1812 Winder was commissioned as a colonel in the U.S. Army at the start of the War of 1812. He participated in the battle of Frenchman's Creek in 1812. Promoted to brigadier general, he took command of the 3rd Brigade in Henry Dearborn's Army of the North and led his brigade in the amphibious landing on the Niagara Peninsula during the Battle of Fort George. He was one of two acting commanders of the American army at the Battle of Stoney Creek in July 1813, where he was captured, along with fellow commander, John Chandler. =Battle of Bladensberg= Exchanged the following year, Winder was appointed commander of the new 10th Military District, which composed the defenses of Washington and Baltimore, by fourth President James Madison on July 4, 1814. He received little logistical support from the government, especially Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr. who received much blame for the upcoming disaster and was later fired. In August, the British Maj. Gen. Robert Ross with several thousand troops advanced from the Royal Navy ships anchored in the upper Patuxent River at Benedict, Maryland (in Prince George's County) upon Washington along with a simultaneous small naval expedition under Capt. James Gordon up the Potomac River to attack the port at Alexandria, (then in the southeast corner of the ten-mile square District of Columbia, previously and later returned to the Commonwealth of Virginia), and provide naval support to Ross's troops once they reached the American capital, across the river to the northwest. Winder had only a few hundred regulars, and a mob of some thousands of two state and District militia units to oppose them. He made no attempt to skirmish or slow down the advancing British and decided on an all-or-nothing set piece defensive battle at Bladensburg. The Americans met the British at the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814. He failed to show effective command in the battle, although he received virtually no support from the newly designated Secretary of War and continuing Secretary of State, James Monroe (later fifth President), who actually interfered with his command by repositioning some of the militia regiments, which may have had a significant contribution to the ensuing rout. He clearly did not support U.S. Naval Commodore Joshua Barney's second line at the center of the American forces along the Washington-Bladensburg Road that actually repulsed the 85th Regiment of Foot after the rout of the American first line following the Red Coats crossing under fire of the small creek of the Eastern Branch of the Potomac River (now the Anacostia River). As a result of the battle, the rough unfinished national capital fell easily into the hands of the invaders who marched in that evening looking for some authorities to surrender the town. Winder was afterward court-martialed, but was acquitted of all blame. After the debacle of Bladenburg, Winder was quickly maneuvered by the skittish Baltimoreans' municipal, business and military leaders out of having any significant command at Baltimore in favor of the highly competent Samuel Smith, a former Revolutionary War officer and commander, wealthy city merchant and shipper, former U.S. Representative, then Senator for Maryland (later in life elected Mayor of Baltimore) and so was relegated under protest to the command of limited troops on the southwestern and western approaches to Baltimore which were not considered a likely route for the British naval and military attack from the Chesapeake Bay to the east. Winder would have participated in the possible battle at the extensive dug-in fortifications (planned and supervised by Smith in a fortunate premonition and foresight), on \\"Loudenschlager's Hill\\" and \\"Hampstead Hill\\" (now site of Patterson Park in East Baltimore), on the eastern heights, from the City, had the British decided to carry forward the attack and had the bombardment on Fort McHenry, on September 13‚Äì14, been successful. Later life and death John H. Winder. After the war, Winder became a leading attorney of the Baltimore bar, joined an influential literary social group called the Delphian Club, and took fellow Delphian, John Neal as an apprentice while he studied law. Winder was married to Gertrude Polk-who was a 1st cousin about 4 times removed to Colonel Ezekiel Polk grandfather of US President James Knox Polk.Polk family genealogy One of Winder and Gertrude's sons, John H. Winder, [1800-1865] was a brigadier general in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. Winder died in 1824.

Jones, (October 16, 1847 - October 15, 1906) was an American lawyer and businessman from Georgia who became a prominent Southern Methodist revivalist preacher across the Southern United States. In his sermons, he preached that alcohol and idleness were sinful. He was known for his admonition, \\"Quit Your Meanness.\\" http://www.ugapress.org/index.php/books/laughter_in_amen_corner Early life Samuel Porter Jones was born on October 16, 1847 in Oak Bowery, Alabama. His father, John Jones, was a lawyer and real estate entrepreneur. His mother, Queenie Jones, was a homemaker. His paternal grandfather, Samuel Gamble Jones, was a Methodist preacher. His great-grandfather was also a Methodist preacher. Additionally, four of his uncles were Methodists. In 1855, when he was eight years old, his mother died, and he moved with his father to Cartersville, Georgia. During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, Jones joined up with union troops traveling to Kentucky. Upon his return, Jones studied the Law, was admitted to the Georgia bar in 1868, and became known locally as a brilliant lawyer; however, Jones was a notorious alcoholic. After his father died, Sam Jones had a great and miraculous experience of conviction and quit his drinking, and focused on his Methodist faith. Evangelistic career Jones was ordained as a Methodist preacher by the North Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. He became a traveling circuit preacher in October 1872,\\"Incident of Jones' Life,\\" Indianapolis Star, vol. 4, no. 133 (Oct. 16, 1906), p. 2. tending the Van Wert circuit, a group of five churches spread over four counties. He became the South‚Äôs most famous evangelist and preacher in the late nineteenth century. He aimed his messages especially at men, often regarded as the most difficult demographic group to reach. His evangelistic style was considered coarse, daring and even admirable, as in this contemporaneous description ‚ÄúSam Jones is a remarkable man. Uneducated and in many respects absolutely ignorant, he has the faculty of striking that chord of nature that makes him one with the audience before him, which he sways with a wasteful hand. The terseness of his language is bold and biting, and in a vague sort of way calls to mind the exhortations and anathemas of the stern old Jewish prophets. How absurd yet striking was an expression made by this wild preacher in the course of a sermon on honesty! Said he: 'God will put his angels on half rations rather than see an honest man starve.' On another occasion he apostrophized the rich men of the community and reproached them for their grasping miserliness. 'Why,' said he,'you men could be tolled to hell by laying a nickel every ten feet along the path!' Such phrases, which in many cases are almost vulgar, give an air of sensation to his meetings‚Ä¶‚Äù In 1885, he headlined a revival in Nashville, Tennessee, where he converted Thomas Green Ryman, who, along with Jones built the Union Gospel Tabernacle, later named the Ryman Auditorium (home to the Grand Ole Opry) after Ryman's death. In 1886, at his own expense, he had a large open-air structure called \\"The Tabernacle\\" built for inter-faith meetings. Until his death in 1906, he held services there each September, bringing to his hometown the co-workers who assisted him in the great revivals he held throughout the country. Meanwhile, Jones raised funds for the Methodist Orphan Home in Decatur, Georgia. He went on to preach not only across the South, but also in New York City, Boston, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Los Angeles and Canada. Over the years, it is estimated that Jones preached to three million Americans. In his sermons, Jones preached that alcohol, dances, and the theater, were sinful. He became known for his admonition, \\"Quit Your Meanness.\\" As an example of his preaching, once in an evangelistic Campaign in San Antonio, Texas, Jones hollered that the only difference between San Antonio and hell was that there was a river running down the middle of it. Personal life Jones married Laura McElwain of Kentucky. They resided at Roselawn, a mansion in Cartersville, Georgia. By 1895, the two story house had been lifted up with an enormous first floor added underneath. Also on the property were a schoolhouse, greenhouse, smokehouse, a large carriage house, tennis court and small houses for servants. . They had seven children, though one died as an infant. Death and legacy On October 15, 1906, Jones was returning home from a revival when he died. His body was first laid at the rotunda of the Capital in Atlanta. He was buried at the Oak Hill cemetery in Cartersville, Georgia. At the time of Jones‚Äô death, the sanctuary of what was then named Cartersville Methodist Episcopal Church was in the process of being completed. After a unanimous vote, the congregation officially changed the name of the church to Sam Jones Memorial Methodist Church (now known as Sam Jones Memorial United Methodist Church), which is still in existence today.

It is normally observed on September 17, the day in 1787 that delegates to the Constitutional Convention signed the document in Philadelphia., Constitution Day and Citizenship Day When Constitution Day falls on a weekend or on another holiday, schools and other institutions observe the holiday on an adjacent weekday. The law establishing the present holiday was created in 2004 with the passage of an amendment by Senator Robert Byrd to the Omnibus spending bill of 2004. Before this law was enacted, the holiday was known as \\"Citizenship Day\\". In addition to renaming the holiday \\"Constitution Day and Citizenship Day,\\" the act mandates that all publicly funded educational institutions, and all federal agencies, provide educational programming on the history of the American Constitution on that day.Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act, 2005, , Division J, Title I, ¬ß 111, , 3345, enacted December 8, 2004.

At the New York World's Fair, the writers of a new song called \\"I am an American\\" brought their manuscript to the attention of Arthur Pine who handled publicity for the band leader, Gray Gordon, and a music publisher. Arthur Pine had the song introduced on NBC, Mutual, and ABC by the orchestra leader, arranged for an \\"I am an American Day\\" at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and had a local New York newspaper tie-in with \\"I am an American Day\\" in the city. The promotion proved so successful that a newspaper chain promoted \\"I am an American Day\\" on a nationwide basis and had President Roosevelt name it as an official day. In 1939, William Randolph Hearst advocated, through his chain of daily newspapers, the creation of a holiday to celebrate citizenship. In 1940, Congress designated the third Sunday in May as \\"I am an American Day.\\" In 1944 \\"I am an American Day\\" was promoted through the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.See:  * Black and white film with Morgan speaking to an I am an American Day gathering. * * Also see: A 16-minute film, I Am an American, was featured in American theaters as a short feature.I Am an American was produced by Gordon Hollingshead, written and directed by Crane Wilbur, and featured Humphrey Bogart, Gary Gray, Gordon Hart, Dick Haymes, Danny Kaye, Joan Leslie, Mary Lee Moody, Dennis Morgan, Knute Rockne, and Jay Silverheels. See: and . In 1947 Hearst Newsreels featured the event on News of the Day. By 1949, governors of all 48 states had issued Constitution Day proclamations. On February 29, 1952, Congress moved the \\"I am an American Day\\" observation to September 17 and renamed it \\"Citizenship Day\\". =Louisville, Ohio ‚Äì the Constitution Town= Louisville, Ohio, calls itself \\"Constitution Town\\", and credits one of its own for getting the holiday national recognition. In 1952, resident Olga T. Weber petitioned municipal officials to establish Constitution Day, in honor of the creation of the US Constitution in 1787. Mayor Gerald A. Romary proclaimed September 17, 1952, as Constitution Day in the city. The following April, Weber requested that the Ohio General Assembly proclaim September 17 as statewide Constitution Day. Her request was signed into law by Governor Frank J. Lausche. In August 1953, she took her case to the United States Senate, which passed a resolution designating September 17‚Äì23 as Constitution Week. The Senate and House approved her request and it was signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. On April 15, 1957, the City Council of Louisville declared the city Constitution Town. The Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society later donated four historical markers, located at the four main entrances to the city, explaining Louisville's role as originator of Constitution Day. = First U.S. Congressional designation of Citizenship Day = Congressional Record H1941, Appendix to CR p. A1473 Mrs. A.B. (Clara) Vajda, a Hungarian immigrant to the United States, was recognized in the U.S. Congressional Record as the Founder of Citizenship Day on March 27, 1941.Congressional Record, H1941, Appendix to the Congressional Record, p. A1473, Extension of Remarks of Hon. Thad F. Wasielewski of Wisconsin, March 27, 1941, RE: Citizenship Day In his remarks, Rep. Wasielewski noted \\"..on May 3, 1940, the President of the United States approved a joint resolution of both Houses of Congress, setting aside the third Sunday of May of each year as Citizenship Day. The purpose of this Act was to give recognition to all those who, by coming of age or naturalization, have attained the status of citizenship...I wonder how many people in this country really know the true story of the origin of this day. I wonder how many people know that a simple act of charity of a foreign-born citizen was the motivating spark which has set in motion this movement to teach all citizens to appreciate the great honor and privilege which has been bestowed upon them when they assume their sovereign rights of citizenship.\\" Observances President Donald Trump reaffirmed on September 17, 2017, as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.

Description Auto Modellista marked itself apart from others of the same genre with cel-shaded graphics, which gave a hand-drawn and cartoon-like appearance. The game is similar in gameplay to games like Gran Turismo, with the player picking a vehicle which they can modify and customize. There are six tracks in the default game, including the real-life Suzuka Circuit and the Mt. Akagi mountain pass. After poor initial reception, Capcom modified the game for its North American releases. In Japan, the game was rereleased with these changes as Auto Modellista: US Tuned. This version featured American cars such as the Dodge Viper, two new oval tracks, various UI improvements and a new handling model that saw cars accelerate slower and lose more speed in turns. The US Tuned changes were present in every single release of the game starting with the North American PS2 release in early 2003, evidenced by the new cover art with the Dodge Viper. Many distributors predicted that sales of the game were going to be poor, and generally refused to carry it. Also in 2003, Auto Modellista received a followup in the form of Group S Challenge for the Xbox, though it lacked any of Auto Modellista's visual style and is generally not considered to be a direct sequel. Capcom has not been involved with driving games since, although it did publish some games based on MotoGP developed by Milestone srl, and included Mega Man Battle & Chase, a racing game based on the Mega Man franchise, in the Mega Man X Collection. Gameplay Auto Modellista attempts to be a very technical racing game, with an immense amount of available parts and settings for the selection of cars provided to the player. Various aspects of each car can be tuned, allowing the player to tweak the performance of the car. In the Garage mode (the main single-player mode), the player is granted the ability to select one of four tire types which affect road grip in regard to the weather conditions on the race track (for example, the \\"Semi-Slick Tires\\" provide maximum speed and grip in dry weather, but suffer in rain). Other options include brakes (which determine braking efficiency), suspension, Turbines, Mufflers, Computer (determines the car's ability to accept upgrades later in the game), the engine, \\"Final Gear\\", and Weight Reduction. Auto Modellista's customisation options also extends to visual enhancements, allowing the player to choose from many different color combinations, hood and spoiler types, plus the ability to add badges, stickers and even create license plates. Engine swaps are also available, for example, the Subaru 360 can have EJ20T in place of its EK32. Swapped engines cannot be retuned in the game. A large aspect of the game was its online mode, with online races supporting up to 8 players. This functionality (and many of the game modes relating to it) were removed from the original US and European releases, but was added back into the US Tuned editions of the game. The online mode of Auto Modellista has since been terminated, and cannot be used in any versions of the game. Development Auto Modellista was a part of an initiative from Capcom's Production Studio 1 to develop three network focused games on the PlayStation 2. The other games were Monster Hunter and Resident Evil Outbreak. Capcom's plan was that at least one of the games would become a million seller. Both Monster Hunter and Resident Evil Outbreak eventually became million sellers. Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PS2 version a score of 30 out of 40.

Early life Lady Airlie was born in Newport, New Jersey, the daughter of John Barry Ryan, Jr., and Margaret Kahn. Her mother was the daughter of German-American financier Otto Kahn, and her father was the grandson of Thomas Fortune Ryan. Lady Airlie has been a Lady of the Bedchamber since 1973.

CPCs generally provide peer counseling related to abortion, pregnancy, and childbirth, and may also offer additional non-medical services such as financial assistance, child-rearing resources, and adoption referrals. CPCs that qualify as medical clinics may also provide pregnancy testing, sonograms, and other services. However, CPCs have also frequently been found to disseminate false medical information, usually about the supposed physical and mental health risks of abortion, but sometimes also about the effectiveness of condoms and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections. CPCs are typically run by Christians who adhere to a strictly socially conservative viewpoint, and they often operate in affiliation with one of three non-profit organizations: Care Net, Heartbeat International, and Birthright International. , there were approximately 2,300 CPCs in the United States, as compared with 808 abortion clinics. Hundreds more CPCs operate outside of the U.S., including Canada, Latin America, Africa and Europe. These CPCs often are operated or financially supported by the same American organizations, and use similar tactics as the CPCs in the United States. During the Presidency of George W. Bush (2001‚Äì2009) CPCs received tens of millions of dollars in federal grants. , more than half of the U.S. states helped to fund crisis pregnancy centers either directly and/or through the sale of Choose Life license plates. Legal and legislative action regarding CPCs has generally attempted to curb deceptive advertising, targeting those that imply that they offer abortion services by requiring centers to disclose that they do not offer certain services or possess certain qualifications. In 1993, the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) was formed to provide legal advice to CPCs in the U.S. Origin Protest against crisis pregnancy center in Chicago. The Family Research Council describes the beginnings of the crisis pregnancy center movement in a 2009 report. In 1968, the first network of centers was established by Birthright, in Canada. Alternatives to Abortion, today known as Heartbeat International, was founded in 1971. Christian Action Council founded its first center in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1980. Christian Action Council eventually would become Care Net.\\"A Passion to Serve: A Vision for Life\\" ‚Äì Pregnancy Resource Center Service Report 2009 Family Research Council. 2009. Page 6. Retrieved May 5, 2011 Others cite Robert Pearson as the founder of the first CPC. After abortion was legalized in Hawaii in 1967, he started a crisis pregnancy center in Honolulu to fight it. Activities While CPCs often look like abortion clinics and are intentionally located near them, most are not legally licensed as medical clinics and do not offer medical services. However, CPCs often offer free pregnancy tests, often over-the-counter ones; additionally, there is a trend toward CPCs obtaining some form of medical certification, largely so that more CPCs may offer sonograms in an attempt to convince women to carry their pregnancies to term.NIFLA They may also provide screening for sexually transmitted infections, adoption referrals, religious counseling, financial assistance, prenatal services, child-rearing resources and other services. Peer counselors are typically covered by mandated reporting laws with regard to statutory rape, and they are encouraged to ask about the age of the woman and the biological father.Mandated Reporting In the United States, CPCs do not offer contraception, despite advertisement that sometimes gives the appearance that they do. Others may offer Bible study sessions and peer counseling for women who have recently had abortions. CPCs have been criticized for misleading advertising, for the dissemination of inaccurate medical information, for religious proselytism, and for subjecting clients to graphic videos. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, an independent abortion-providing agency, said that young women were particularly vulnerable to religiously-influenced anti-abortion \\"Crisis Pregnancy Centres\\", unregulated by the National Health Service, because many of the women knew less about the healthcare system or did not want to consult their family GP. Crisis pregnancy centers, along with hospitals and fire and police stations, are designated by state law in Louisiana as emergency care facilities where parents may surrender custody of newborn infants. =Use of sonograms= Ultrasound scanner. Some CPCs conduct free sonograms as a way to dissuade women from abortion.The Columbus Dispatch January 20, 2008, \\"Pregnancy centers stir debate\\" Proponents say that women who visit CPCs and see their embryos or fetuses through the use of ultrasound technology tend to decide against abortion, although scientific research suggests mandatory pre-abortion ultrasound has no effect on women's decisions to continue their pregnancy. Organizations such as Colorado-based Focus on the Family and the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, have worked to equip more CPCs with ultrasound machines.Focus on the Family Budgets $4.2M To Provide Ultrasound Equipment to Pregnancy Centers With Goal of Preventing Abortions Focus Celebrates Option Ultrasound Success, Focus On the Family =False medical information= CPCs have frequently been found to disseminate false medical information. In some cases such information may be based on decades-old studies that have been discredited by more recent research. In others, CPCs may falsely claim to be describing an existing scientific consensus. CPCs' false information is usually about the supposed health risks of abortion, saying, for example, that abortion is much less safe for pregnant women than childbirth when the opposite is true. One common medical claim is the assertion of a link between abortion and breast cancer. Crisis pregnancy centers have told clients that their chances of getting breast cancer increase dramatically after abortion. Major medical bodies (including the National Cancer Institute) say that there is no link between abortion and breast cancer. Another assertion is that of a link between abortion and mental health problems. CPC counselors have warned clients of severely negative psychological consequences, including high rates of depression, \\"post-abortion syndrome\\", post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide, substance abuse, sexual and relationship dysfunction, propensity to child abuse, and other emotional problems. Neither the American Psychiatric Association nor the American Psychological Association recognizes the existence of \\"post-abortion syndrome\\", and an American Psychological Association review of relevant studies found that \\"abortion is usually psychologically benign.\\" The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists finds no evidence to support an increased likelihood of abuse. CPCs may also claim that surgical abortion is a dangerous procedure, with a high risk of perforation or infection and death. In fact, the risk of complications requiring hospitalization after an abortion is approximately 2 in 1,000 in the US. The alleged risk of perforation and infection is also part of the assertion that abortion negatively impacts future childbearing, by increasing the risk of infertility, miscarriages, complications, ectopic pregnancy, or fetal health problems. These claims are not supported by medical data. CPCs have also been found to disseminate misinformation about birth control methods, in particular the idea that contraception and condoms do not work or have harmful effects. False information about pregnancy and the female body or about fetal development may also be provided, as may misinformation about the availability of abortion in early pregnancy and the rate of postpartum depression among women who carry to term, CPCs may also misinform women about their stage of pregnancy in order to prevent them from seeking an abortion until it is no longer legally possible. Care Net denounces \\"any form of deception in its corporate advertising or individual conversations with its clients\\", though they also say of their promotion of an abortion‚Äìbreast cancer link that their \\"role is clearly to include this possible risk when [they] educate clients about all the risks of abortions.\\" Religious affiliation The overwhelming majority of CPCs in the U.S. are run by Christians according to a conservative Christian philosophy.NIFLA Christian , two Christian charities, Care Net and Heartbeat International, accounted for three quarters of CPCs in the United States. Care Net, the largest CPC network in the United States, is explicitly evangelistic in nature, and says that its \\"ultimate aim...is to share the love and truth of Jesus Christ in both word and deed\\" and that its \\"pregnancy centers are committed to sharing the love of Jesus Christ with every person who walks through their doors.\\" Heartbeat International, one of the largest CPC networks in the United States and also the largest CPC network in the world, runs \\"Christian crisis-pregnancy centers\\" and describes itself as a \\"Christian association of faith-based pregnancy resource centers\\" whose materials are \\"consistent with Biblical principles.\\" The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA), which works with CPCs on legal issues, \\"strongly believes that sharing the Gospel is an essential part of counseling women in pregnancy help medical clinics\\". Some CPCs are run by the Catholic Church or by other church groups. Unaffiliated CPCs, or CPCs affiliated with other organizations, may provide a religious perspective in their counseling. In contrast to the overt Christian perspective of most CPC networks, Birthright International has a stated philosophy of non-evangelism. A Jewish CPC organization, called In Shifra's Arms, also exists. Many CPCs require their staff to be Christian. For example, as a condition of affiliation, Care Net and the Canadian Association of Pregnancy Support Services, the two largest CPC organizations in the United States and Canada respectively, require each employee and volunteer of a prospective affiliate to comply with a statement of faith. CPCs unaffiliated with either of these may also require staff to be Christian.About Southside Pregnancy Religious activity is sometimes part of a CPC customer's experience. Care Net, which \\"is committed to presenting the gospel of our Lord to women with crisis pregnancies\\", claims to have effected over 23,000 conversions or restatements of Christian faith. NIFLA \\"strongly believes that sharing the Gospel is an essential part of counseling women in pregnancy help medical clinics\\". Some visitors to CPCs report that employees subjected them to unwanted evangelizing. CPCs outside the United States are also frequently Christian. CareConfidential, the largest umbrella network for CPCs in the United Kingdom, runs \\"Christian-based pregnancy crisis centres\\" and is a division of the Christian charity CARE. The Canadian Association of Pregnancy Support Services, a similar network in Canada whose centers may also affiliate with Care Net or Heartbeat International, describes itself as a \\"Christian charity\\"; its affiliates \\"adhere firmly to Christianity.\\" The United States- based Human Life International runs \\"Catholic pregnancy centers\\" in Mexico and also provides aid to the Centros de Ayuda para la Mujer, a network of CPCs in Latin America whose philosophy is \\"in conformity with the Magisterium of the Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church.\\" As in the United States, unaffiliated CPCs may also be run by church groups or are otherwise Christian. =Affiliation with the anti-abortion movement= Most crisis pregnancy centers are affiliated with several major anti-abortion organizations; these are Care Net, Heartbeat International, Birthright International, and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA). A CPC may be affiliated with more than one network. US based Care Net and Heartbeat International are the world's two largest CPC networks with about 3,000 associated centers between them in the United States and abroad. Italy, for example, has more than 400 CPCs associated with Heartbeat International, the largest number outside the U.S. The largest UK organisations are CareConfidential and LIFE, while the largest Canadian one is the Canadian Association of Pregnancy Support Services (CAPSS). Human Life International, a Catholic group opposed to abortion, also runs CPCs outside the United States. Advertising methods Example of an advertisement for a CPC CPCs have been criticized for deceptive advertising. Some falsely advertise abortion services, attracting clients who wish to have an abortion. In the 1980s, investigative reporters from the Arizona Republic, the San Francisco Chronicle and CBS News, among others, filed stories about CPCs attracting women by offering free pregnancy tests but then presenting them with religious arguments and scare tactics against abortion. CPCs may intentionally locate near, and look like, abortion clinics; critics have also objected to CPCs' use of rhetoric and advertising language similar to those of abortion providers, such as \\"Plan Your Parenthood\\" or a directory listing under \\"abortion services\\" or \\"clinics\\". These, they say, may mislead pregnant women seeking abortion into contacting a CPC. In particular, the advertising approach of the Pearson Foundation, which assists local groups establishing CPCs, has been criticized by some other anti-abortion groups, including Birthright International, another CPC operator. The foundation recommends that a center seek out women who want abortions through \\"neutral\\" advertising, and refuse to answer questions that would reveal that they provide neither abortion services nor referrals to abortion services. Pearson, identified by some as the founder of the first CPC, said that a woman \\"has no right to information\\" that will allow her to have an abortion. In Ireland, where abortion is illegal except when pregnancy endangers the mother's life and women often travel to the United Kingdom to end their pregnancies, \\"rogue\\" CPCs, in contrast to government sponsored pregnancy centers, may falsely give the impression in their advertising that they refer women to Britain for abortions or otherwise provide information for women seeking to travel for abortion. In recent years, CPCs have also begun using the Internet as a means of advertising. Some use search engine optimization to get their websites closer to the top of search results or bid against abortion providers to appear at the top of sponsored link sections on Google and Yahoo. Heartbeat International, a Christian association that runs 1,800 crisis pregnancy centers, recommends that CPCs use two websites, one fundraising website that describes an anti-abortion mission to secure donors, and another website that purports to provide medical information to attract women seeking contraception, counseling, or abortion. =Legality of advertising methods= Much legal and legislative action around CPCs has attempted to rein in deceptive advertising by CPCs seeking to give the impression that they provide abortions or other women's health services. Lawsuits against a number of CPCs have determined that they engaged in false advertising and required them to change their methods, or led to settlements where they agreed to do so. CPCs that advertised that they provided abortion services were forbidden from doing so or obliged to affirmatively tell clients that they did not do so. In some instances, CPCs were prohibited from using names similar to nearby medical clinics that provided abortions, from providing pregnancy tests, or from advertising pregnancy tests as \\"free\\" if they were conditional upon hearing a presentation or counseling. In one of these cases, the CPC argued that they did not receive money from clients and were therefore not subject to regulations on commercial speech, but the court ruled that they were not exempt because they aimed to provide services rather than exchange ideas. Several ordinances requiring CPCs to post signs disclosing that they do not provide abortions, birth control, referrals for either, and sometimes other medical services have been enjoined, with courts finding that such \\"compelled speech\\" violates the centers' rights.\\"Judge Blocks City‚Äôs Crisis Pregnancy Center Law\\", D. Chen, The New York Times, July 13, 2011 In December 2009, Baltimore, Maryland was the first local government to introduce and pass a CPC ordinance‚ÄîOrdinance 09-252, \\"Limited Service Pregnancy Centers‚ÄîDisclaimers\\".Austin, Texas amended its law requiring centers to disclose that they do not offer abortion or birth control services to instead require them to disclose whether they do offer medical services under the direction of a licensed health care provider. A bill in Oregon would require its CPCs, currently unregulated, to disclose whether or not they provide these services, and bar them from releasing health information collected from clients without the clients' consent. In San Francisco, rather than compelling any speech, the city ordinance is framed as a false advertising law which allows courts to fine CPCs up to $500 every time they falsely imply in an advertisement that they offer abortion services. The law's constitutionality was upheld in federal court, with a judge dismissing a lawsuit from a CPC that had been identified by the city attorney as advertising deceptively. California's 2015 \\"Reproductive FACT Act\\" requires CPCs without medical licenses to post signs saying that they are not licensed medical facilities and have no medical professionals providing or supervising services; CPCs must also let clients know about the state's public programs for reproductive health care.https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/nifla- becerra-crisis-pregnancy-centers-supreme-court/555887/ The law has been challenged in National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, argued at the Supreme Court on March 20, 2018, and the Court will decide whether or not the disclosures required by the California Reproductive FACT Act violate the free speech clause of the First Amendment.http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-institute- family-life-advocates-v-becerra/ On March 30, 2006, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and eleven co-sponsors first introduced a bill called the \\"Stop Deceptive Advertising for Women's Services Act\\", which would have required the Federal Trade Commission to \\"promulgate rules prohibiting...persons from advertising with the intent to deceptively create the impression that such persons provide abortion services\\" and \\"enforce violations of such rules as unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\\" Maloney and her colleagues have re-introduced the bill in several Congresses, most recently in May 2013, in the 113th Congress. In July 2006, Representative Henry Waxman and his team from the Special Investigation Division published \\"False and Misleading Health Information Provided by Federally Funded Pregnancy Resource Centers\\", which analyzes the scientific accuracy of the information provided by a Bush Administration priority: federally funded ‚Äúpregnancy resource centers.‚Äù Since 2001, pregnancy resource centers have received over $30 million in federal funding. Most of this money has come from federal programs for abstinence-only education. Additional funding has been distributed as ‚Äúcapacity-building‚Äù grants to 25 pregnancy resource centers in 15 states as part of the new $150million Compassion Capital Fund. For this report, female investigators telephoned the 25 pregnancy resource centers that have received grants from the Compassion Capital Fund, requesting information and advice regarding an unintended pregnancy. During the investigation, 20 of the 23centers (87%) provided false or misleading information about the health effects of abortion. In 2002, after an investigation and subpoenas of a number of New York State CPCs alleged to be engaged in deceptive business practices, then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's office worked out an agreement with one of the CPCs in question, intended to be used as a model, which sets out practices including informing clients that the center does not provide abortion or birth control, that it is not a licensed medical facility, and that the pregnancy tests it provides are over-the-counter. In the United Kingdom, the Advertising Standards Authority mandated in 2013 that the Central London Women's Centre must stop using \\"misleading\\" and \\"irresponsible\\" advertisements implying that it offered abortion services. Government support As of July, 2006, 50 American CPCs had received federal funding. Between 2001 and 2006, over $60 million in federal funds were given to crisis pregnancy centers, much of it coming from funding for abstinence-only programs provided under the conservative George W. Bush administration. Florida Choose Life tag In 2006, 20 U.S. states subsidized crisis pregnancy centers. These included Florida, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Efforts are led by anti-abortion Republicans. Some CPCs in Canada have received funding from provincial governments. In 29 U.S. states, individuals can support CPCs by purchasing Choose Life license plates. Motorists in these states can request these plates and pay an extra fee, a portion of which is used by the state to fund adoption support organizations and crisis pregnancy centers. In July 2013, then governor of Rhode Island Lincoln Chafee vetoed a bill for the license plates saying that in his opinion it violated the separation of church and state. Under the Trump administration, CPCs were encouraged to apply for title X funding which is intended to go to organisations offering family planning services. However, most struggled to qualify because offering hormonal birth control, which many CPCs oppose, is a requirement to receive the grants. One CPC organisation, The Obria Group, was awarded millions in grants in 2019 after promising to provide those services in some clinics, despite not currently offering them. =Mandatory use of CPCs= South Dakota enacted a law in 2011 which would have required consultation at a crisis pregnancy center as a precondition to obtaining an abortion. The law, which was to take effect in July 2011, also would have established a 3-day waiting period, the longest in the country. In June 2011, Judge Karen Schreier issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law from going into effect, writing that the provisions \\"constitute a substantial obstacle to a woman's decision to obtain an abortion because they force a woman against her will to disclose her decision to undergo an abortion to a pregnancy help center employee before she can undergo an abortion.\\" Although the law remains enjoined, the state later enacted another law which excluded weekends and holidays from the 72-hour waiting period mandated for a person seeking an abortion, potentially extending the wait for the procedure to 6 days, so that only days when CPCs were already open would count as part of the period. In some cases, judges responsible for granting judicial bypasses to minors have required them to go to a CPC for counseling before having an abortion. =Confusion with government-supported centers in Ireland= In Ireland, centres not affiliated with the government exist that attempt to persuade women not to have an abortion. These have been reported to \\"use manipulation and alarmist information\\", including false medical information, and have been called \\"rogue agencies\\". The government's Crisis Pregnancy Programme (formerly Crisis Pregnancy Agency) funds crisis pregnancy initiatives and is in turn reimbursed by the Health Service Executive; however, crisis pregnancy counseling grants, provided through a campaign called \\"Positive Options\\", are only awarded to centres that offer non- directive and medically accurate counselling that discusses all possible options, including travelling abroad for abortion. Government sponsored centres' efforts to reduce the number of women who opt for abortion consist primarily of the provision of \\"services and supports which make other options more attractive.\\" A survey by the CPP found that 4 in 46 women surveyed encountered a \\"rogue agency\\" when seeking counseling. The Department of Health does not regulate the anti-abortion agencies, since the 1995 Abortion Information Act, which establishes that Irish women have a right to know about abortion services abroad and which regulates providers of information, does not apply to centres that do not provide information on abortion. The term \\"crisis pregnancy\\" is used by abortion-rights agencies, like the Irish Family Planning Association.

He served as colonial governor of Connecticut from 1751 to 1754. Biography Wolcott was born the son of Simon Wolcott and Martha Pitkin Wolcott in Windsor, Connecticut. His formal education was severely limited by the nature of the frontier village, so at age twelve he was apprenticed to a weaver, and at the age of twenty-one entered that business on his own. He married Sarah Drake on December 3, 1702, and they had fifteen children before her death in 1748. Their son Oliver Wolcott Sr. signed the Declaration of Independence and went on to become governor of Connecticut. Career In May 1709, Wolcott was admitted to the bar and began to practice law. In 1711, during Queen Anne's War, He accompanied militia forces on an expedition to Quebec as a commissary. On his return he served as Clerk of the House, 1710-1711 and was elected Deputy to the colony's Lower House in 1709-1714, 1718, 1719, serving as Speaker in October, 1719. In 1714 he was elected to the Upper House (also called the Council) and served as Assistant, 1714-1718, 1720-1741, 1754-1760. He was Commissioner of Connecticut for the Adjustment of Colonial boundaries, 1717, 1718, 1723-1726, 1728, 1730, 1737, 1740, 1742, 1750. Captain of the Trainband of Windsor, 1722. Captain of Troops raised for active service, 1724. He was made judge of the Hartford County court in 1723, serving through 1732, and of the colony's Superior Court in 1732, serving through 1741. Wolcott was made Colonel of the First regiment, 1739. In 1741 Wolcott was elected Deputy Governor of the colony. As deputy governors traditionally served as the Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Connecticut, he also assumed that position, which he held until 1750. In 1745 Wolcott was again active in the militia, this time as a Major General. In King George's War, Massachusetts governor William Shirley issued a general call to the New England colonies for an expedition against the French in √éle-Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island). Wolcott served as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the Expedition to Cape Breton. General Wolcott headed the Connecticut troops in Sir William Pepperrell's expedition that captured Fortress Louisbourg. With the death of Governor Jonathan Law in 1750, Wolcott succeeded to the position of governor. He was re-elected annually to that position through 1753. Shortly after he retired as governor, his son, Roger Wolcott, Sr., attended negotiations with six other British colonies and around 200 members of various Indian nations at the Albany Congress in June and July 1754. During his administration, a disabled Spanish ship, the St. Joseph and St. Helena, with a cargo valued at 400,000 Spanish dollars, ran aground near New London. Wolcott ordered the ship seized and the cargo impounded in order to allow time to resolve conflicting claims between the vessel's captain and the salvage crew. While in the colony's custody, a large portion of the ship's cargo mysteriously disappeared. Tainted with the scandal surrounding the Spanish Ship case, he was defeated for re-election in 1754. All previous governors had died in office. Following his defeat, Wolcott generally withdrew from public life to study and follow literary pursuits. In 1759, Wolcott authored a short history of the Connecticut colony titled, Roger Wolcott's Memoir Relating to the History of Connecticut. Death Wolcott died at home in Windsor and is interred at the Old Burying Ground (Palisado Cemetery) there.

In his early days, he was a Mu'tazilite scholar, but then rejected the Mu'tazilite doctrine. Afterwards, he became a Shia scholar, though there is debate about whether he stayed a Shia until his death or became a skeptic.A History of Natural Philosophy By Edward Grant Although none of his works have survived, his opinions had been preserved through his critics and the surviving books that answered him.Ibn al-Rawandi, by Mehmet Karabela, in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Science, and Technology in Islam, edited by Ibrahim Kalin, vol. 1, New York: Oxford University Press, 2014. His book with the most preserved fragments (through an Ismaili book refuting Al-Rawandi's ideology) is the Kitab al-Zumurrud (The Book of the Emerald).  Life  Abu al-Husayn Ahmad bin Yahya ben Isaac al- Rawandi was born in Greater Khorasan, today located in northwest Afghanistan, about the year 827 CE.Medieval Islamic Civilization By Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach According to the Egyptian scholar Abdur Rahman Badawi, Al-Rawandi was born in Basra at the time of the Abbassid Caliph Al-Mamoun.Min Tareekh Al- Ilhad Fi Al-Islam, From the History of Atheism in Islam by Abd-El Rahman Badawi pages: 87‚Äì206, Second edition 1991, Sinaa Lil Nasher Egypt (Arabic) His father, Yahya, was a Jewish scholar and convert to Islam, who schooled Muslims in how to refute the Talmud.Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Genealogy to Iqbal Page 636 Al-Rawandi abandoned Islam and used his knowledge of Islam, learned from his father, to refute the Quran. He joined the Mu'tazili of Baghdad, and gained prominence among them. But then he became estranged from his fellow Mu'tazilites, and formed close alliances with Shia Muslimsand then with non-Muslims (Manichaeans, Jews and perhaps also Christians). He then became a follower of the Manichaean zindiq Abu Isa al-Warraq in which he wrote several books that criticized revealed religion.  Philosophy  There is no agreement as to the nature of his views. Some look for the roots of his views in his connections with Shi'ia Islam, and depict him as a Mu'tazilite. Some regard him as an Aristotelian philosopher, while others see him as a radical atheist, and some stress the political challenge he presented to the Islamic polity. Scholars also try to account for the more positive view of Ibn al- Rawandi in some Muslim sources. Josef van Ess in particular has suggested an original interpretation that aims at accommodating all the contradictory information. Van Ess notes that the sources which portray Ibn al-Rawandi as a heretic are predominantly Mutazilite and stem from Iraq, whereas in eastern texts he appears in a more positive light. As an explanation for this difference, van Ess suggests \\"a collision of two different intellectual traditions,\\" i.e., those in Iran and in Iraq. He further suggests that Ibn al- Rawandi's notoriety was the result of the fact that after Ibn al-Rawandi left Baghdad, \\"his colleagues in Baghdad ... profiting from his absence ... could create a black legend.\\" In other words, van Ess believes that Ibn al-Rawandi, although admittedly eccentric and disputatious, was not a heretic at all.  Subjects discussed in the Kitab al-Zumurrud  = Muslim traditions = According to the Zumurrud, traditions concerning miracles are inevitably problematic. At the time of the performance of a supposed miracle only a small number of people could be close enough to the Prophet to observe his deeds. Reports given by such a small number of people cannot be trusted, for such a small group can easily have conspired to lie. The Muslim tradition thus falls into the category of flimsy traditions, those based on a single authority (khabar al-ahad) rather than on multiple authorities (khabar mutawatir). These religious traditions are lies endorsed by conspiracies. The Zumurrud points out that Muhammad's own presuppositions (wad) and system (qanun) show that religious traditions are not trustworthy. The Jews and Christians say that Jesus really died, but the Qu'ran contradicts them. Ibn al-Rawandi also points out specific Muslim traditions, and tries to show that they are laughable. The tradition that the angels rallied round to help Muhammad is not logical, because it implies that the angels of Badr were weaklings, able to kill only seventy of the Prophet's enemies. And if the angels were willing to help Muhammad at Badr, where were they at Uhud, when their help was so badly needed? The Zumurrud criticizes prayer, preoccupation with ritual purity, and the ceremonies of the hajj; throwing stones, circumambulating a house that cannot respond to prayers, running between stones that can neither help nor harm. It goes on to ask why Safa and Marwa are venerated, and what difference there is between them and any other hill in the vicinity of Mecca, for example the hill of Abu Qubays, and why the Kaaba is any better than any other house.

Weather Wizard made his first live appearance in the television series the Flash played by actor Liam McIntyre who played Mark Mardon. He appeared in the first, second and fifth season of the series. Clyde Mardon appeared in the pilot episode of The Flash played by actor Chad Rook. In the fifth and sixth seasons, a female version called the Weather Witch is played by Reina Hardesty and is the estranged daughter of Mark Mardon. Publication history Created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, the character made his first appearance in The Flash #110 (December 1959). Fictional character biography =Early life= Escaping a prison transport by leaping from the window, Mark Mardon fled to his brother's house only to find him dead. Mardon's brother, Clyde, a scientist, had just discovered a way to control the weather before dying of a heart attack (although recent evidence implies that Mardon murdered his brother and either lied about or blocked out the memory of finding his bodyFinal Crisis: Rogue's Revenge #2). Mardon took Clyde's notes and used them to make a wand to generate weather and embarked on a criminal career as the Weather Wizard, sometimes using his powers on a small scale (such as zapping someone with lightning) and sometimes a larger scale (imprisoning a town in winter), almost always facing defeat by the Flash (Barry Allen). After Barry Allen's death during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Weather Wizard went into semi- retirement for a while, until, during Underworld Unleashed, he teamed up with other Rogues which included Captain Cold, Heat Wave, Captain Boomerang, and Mirror Master, as part of a ploy for greater power. Ultimately, it ended with their deaths and the release of the demon Neron. They were later resurrected as soulless demons by Neron to use against Barry Allen's successor Wally West, who manipulated Neron to return the Rogues' souls. The Weather Wizard and the others, except for Heat Wave, returned to a life of crime. Weather Wizard joined up with Blacksmith and her rogues. Through her, he learns he has a son from a one-night stand with Keystone City police officer Julie Jackham. Their son, Josh, had exhibited internalized weather-controlling abilities and Mardon wanted to have the same ability without the use of his wand. He tried to kidnap Josh from Wally's wife, Linda and dissect him to understand out how his son gained that ability, but hesitated to harm the child when he noticed that the child had \\"my eyes...my brother's eyes\\". He was stopped by Flash and sent to Iron Heights, but escaped. After Blacksmith's group disbanded, the Weather Wizard, along with Mirror Master and Trickster, joined up with Captain Cold, who declared himself the leader of the Rogues. Mardon was also the representative of the rogues for the Secret Society of Super Villains. =One Year Later= One Year Later, he and several other Rogues are approached by Inertia with a plan to kill the Flash (then Bart Allen). Inertia destroyed Weather Wizard's wand and used 30th century psychological therapies to remove the mental blocks which prevented him from using his powers without it. Though Inertia is eventually defeated, the other Rogues beat Bart to death, Weather Wizard using his control over lightning to electrocute him. After Allen's identity was revealed, Mardon was surprised and horrified to discover that the Rogues had \\"killed a kid\\".All Flash #1 =Salvation Run= Weather Wizard is one of the exiled villains featured in Salvation Run along with his fellow Rogues: Captain Cold, Heat Wave, Mirror Master, and Abra Kadabra. =Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge= He was seen as the member of Rogues who joined Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains. In the Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge series, however, Weather Wizard and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game (Captain Cold even berates Mirror Master for working with scum like Dr. Light). Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used.Final Crisis: Rogue's Revenge #1 In retaliation, Libra kidnaps Josh and tries to get Mardon to join the Society, threatening to kill the boy if he does not, to which Mardon responds: \\"If I killed my brother, Libra, if I electrocuted the only person who ever cared about me, what makes you think I care anything about that child?\\" Libra then taunts Mardon to prove him wrong. Mardon is hesitant to make a move when Inertia kills the boy himself, and Mardon joins his fellow Rogues in defeating and killing Inertia.Final Crisis: Rogue's Revenge #3 =The Flash (Vol. 3)= Weather Wizard and the Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words In Case of Flash: Break Glass written on it.Flash Secret Files and Origins (2010) Afterward, Mardon is still on the run with the Rogues.The Flash (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010) =The New 52= In The New 52 timeline, while Weather Wizard's past with Barry Allen remains almost unchanged, his origins are slightly different. Now called Marco Mardon he and his brother, Claudio, are Latino and the heads of an organized crime family. After their father's death Marco runs away, eventually becoming the Weather Wizard, but is called back after Claudio's murder. The Flash, looking for Patty Spivot who had been kidnapped, later attacks and submits Mardon forcing Elsa, his brother's widow, to reveal she was the kidnapper and also Claudio's killer. This revelation drives Marco to the edge, making him attempt a suicide-murder by calling lightning to strike himself and Elsa, but he survives and is approached by the Golden Glider for an unknown plot.The Flash (vol. 4) #10 (June 2012) In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Weather Wizard and his fellow Rogues are among the villain that attend the underground meeting held by Riddler that talks about the Superman Theory.Doomsday Clock #6 (July 2018). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Weather Wizard originally wielded a wand that enabled him to control weather patterns. Weather Wizard has used it to produce blizzards, summon lightning bolts, fly using air currents, produce fog and generate winds. Essentially Weather Wizard can produce any type of weather pattern imaginable, as well as other phenomenon such as tornadoes. Recently Inertia destroyed his wand, using 30th Century psychological therapies to remove Weather Wizard's mental blocks. He can now control the weather without his wand. Weather Wizard has also shown limited control over magnetism. In The New 52 reality, Mardon returns to using his wand, but reveals that the device drove him crazy.

In other media =Television= Live-action * In the 1979 TV specials Legends of the Superheroes, Weather Wizard was portrayed by comedian Jeff Altman. * Danny Bilson and Paul DeMeo tried to do Weather Wizard for the first season of the 1990 Flash TV series, but didn't have enough money to do so and they had to wait until they had a larger budget. Ultimately, it failed to materialise after the show was canceled. * Miguel Ferrer essentially reprised his role when he portrayed the villainous Weatherman/Dr. Eno in the 1997 live-action TV pilot Justice League of America who was based on Weather Wizard. thumb250pxrightLiam McIntyre (left) and Chad Rook (right) portray Mark and Clyde Mardon respectively on The CW's The Flash. * Chad Rook and Liam McIntyre portray Clyde and Mark Mardon, respectively, on The CW's The Flash. In the series pilot, the brothers are bank robbers that are caught in a plane crash when the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator explodes, giving them both the ability to manipulate the weather. However, Mark is heavily wounded in the aftermath of their transformation and is hospitalized as his younger brother returns to Central City nine months later. Clyde uses his powers to terrorize Central City for a short period of time, and is the first metahuman the Flash fought. After getting his plan foiled by the Flash, Clyde is shot dead by Detective Joe West, saving the Flash's life. After learning of his brother's death, Mark, having fully mastered his powers behind-the-scenes, kidnaps Joe with the intent of having the detective watch him kill everyone in Central City. He generates an enormous tidal wave, causing Barry to use his speed to create a barrier against it, but Barry inadvertently travels back in time a day before as the result. He captures Mark before he can initiate his revenge against Joe, and imprisons him at S.T.A.R. Labs. In the episode \\"Rogue Air\\", he is being transported to Lian Yu, with the other metahumans, who had been imprisoned in S.T.A.R Labs, but Leonard Snart sabotages the plan and sets them free. In the season two episode \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\" it is revealed that the Mardon brothers had an encounter with Patty Spivot's father at a bank prior to their transformation that resulted in Mark shooting him in the face, and Patty becoming a police officer in her quest to stop metahuman criminals. In \\"Running to Stand Still\\", Mark breaks Snart and Jesse James out of prison to join forces to kill the Flash- although Snart declines to participate- dispersing random bombs around the city in Christmas gifts to force the Flash to let them kill him or they will trigger the bombs. However, the Flash's allies find and disable all the bombs while Mark is taking his time killing the Flash, allowing them to dispose of the bombs through a dimensional breach while Barry deals with his foes. Patty attempts to kill Mark while he is immobilized, but the Flash convinces her not to become a murderer and she instead arrests Mark, taking him in to Iron Heights Prison in Central City. The season five episode \\"O Come, All Ye Thankful\\" introduces Mark's estranged daughter Joslyn \\"Joss\\" Jackam (portrayed by Reina Hardesty), who has become the criminal Weather Witch after obtaining a staff that enables her to control the weather. After her plot to kill her father fails, Weather Witch plans to use the staff to wreak havoc on Central City, but is foiled by the Flash using the Weather Wizard's wand. The Mardons are locked together in Iron Heights. Animated * Weather Wizard appeared many times in the DCAU: ** Weather Wizard was introduced in Superman: The Animated Series episode titled \\"Speed Demons\\", voiced by Miguel Ferrer (and resembles him). He is a former extortionist from Central City who tracks Superman and Flash's coordinates as they competed for the title of 'fastest man alive'. Also in that episode, Mark's brother (here called Ben) was not dead and Mark siphoned the energy off Superman and Flash through the monitoring arm bands, which he gave to them with the intention of using their race to generate the necessary energy to work his weather-manipulating machinery. With Ben's help, Superman and Flash defeated him. ** Weather Wizard appeared in Justice League, voiced by Corey Burton. Weather Wizard was a member of the Superman Revenge Squad. During battle, Wonder Woman deflected a lightning bolt back at Weather Wizard with her metal bracelets even though Flash pointed out that there was a large number of reasons why it shouldn't have worked. He gave cover to Kalibak by conjuring a tornado. Batman managed to disarm Weather Wizard and knock him out. ** Corey Burton reprised his role as Weather Wizard in Justice League Unlimited. Weather Wizard appears as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society. He was also seen as a background character and a display in the episode \\"Flash and Substance\\".

He is frozen by a turncoat Killer Frost, and is killed when Darkseid destroys the Secret Society's station. * Weather Wizard is featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. He makes a cameo in the episode \\"Night of the Huntress!\\" where Calculator informs him that Flash will be out of Keystone City for a few days allowing him to commit his crime there. In \\"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!\\", he assists Captain Cold and Heat Wave in a crime spree. Though they have admitted that they missed their usual Flash when they fought Batman, Jay Garrick, and Kid Flash. When Barry Allen was brought back to his time, Weather Wizard, Captain Cold, and Heat Wave are pleased that their Flash is back as Barry assists Jay Garrick and Kid Flash into defeating the villains.

Early life Born Herbert Arthur Chamberlayne Blythe in Amritsar, India, he was the son of William Edward Blythe (1818‚Äì1873), a surveyor for the British East India Company, and his wife Charlotte Matilda Chamberlayne de Tankerville (1822‚Äì1849) who had some French descent. Herbert, the youngest of seven, had an older brother named Will and two sisters named Emily and Evelin. Three other siblings had died in infancy.The Blyth Family, personal reminiscence of Margarita Alice Caroline Blyth(1878-1952), niece of Herbert Blyth (Maurice Barrymore)...(Wayback Machine) Matilda, after a difficult pregnancy, died shortly after giving birth to Herbert on 21 September 1849. In his formative years Herbert was raised by his Aunt Amelia Blythe, his mother's sister, and later by other family members. Amelia, a Chamberlayne by birth, had married a brother of Herbert's father and was a Blythe by marriage. Herbert was sent back to England for education at Harrow School, and studied Law at Oxford University, where he was captain of his class football team in 1868. Herbert also became enamored of the sport of boxing. The Marquess of Queensberry Rules were firmly established at this time but it wasn't unusual to see bare knuckle fights. On 21 March 1872 Herbert won the middleweight boxing championship of England. Years later many of Herbert's friends would be sports figures of the day, particularly boxers and wrestlers such as William Muldoon, John L. Sullivan, James J. Corbett and a young actor named Hobart Bosworth, the latter of whom Herbert would stage in an amateur bout with his son Lionel.James Kotsilibas Davis (ca. 1977) Great Times Good Times: The Odyssey of Maurice Barrymore Herbert's father expected him to become a barrister, but Herbert fell in with a group of actors, which scandalized the elder Blythe. That same year 1872 Herbert sat for his first posed theatrical photographic portrait by Oliver Sarony, older brother of the better remembered Napoleon Sarony. In order to spare his father the \\"shame\\" of having a son in such a \\"dissolute\\" vocation, he took the stage name Maurice Barrymore (though he never legally changed from \\"Blythe\\"), inspired by a conversation he had with fellow actor Charles Vandenhoff about William Barrymore (1759‚Äì1830),American and British Theatrical Biography page 74 c.1979 by J.P.

Haddon ChambersC. Haddon Chambers (1888) Captain Swift at Hathi Trust Digital Library Maurice Barrymore mid 1890s. On 29 December 1874, Barrymore emigrated to the United States, sailing aboard the SS America to Boston, and joined Augustin Daly's troupe, making his d√©but in Under the Gaslight. He made his Broadway d√©but in December 1875 in Pique opposite Emily Rigl; in the cast was a young actress, Georgiana Drew, known as Georgie. Maurice and Georgiana had been introduced earlier by her brother John Drew Jr. who had befriended Maurice when he first arrived in America. Drew Jr. and Georgiana later brought Barrymore home to Philadelphia to be introduced to her mother, the formidable Mrs. John Drew, who for some reason wasn't too enthralled by the young man. After a brief courtship, Barrymore and Georgie married on 31 December 1876, and had three children: Lionel (born 1878), Ethel (born 1879), and John (born 1882). While their parents were on tour, the children lived with Georgiana's mother in Philadelphia. Barrymore had a lifelong love of animals and in the 1890s bought a farm on Staten Island to keep his collection of exotic animals. Georgiana died 2 July 1893, from consumption leaving Maurice a widower with three teenage children. For a summer in 1896, Lionel and John were left on the farm in the care of the man who fed the animals. Exactly one year after Georgie's death Barrymore married Mamie Floyd, much to Ethel's consternation. Shooting On 19 March 1879, in Marshall, Texas, Barrymore and fellow actor Ben Porter were shot by a notorious gunfighter and bully named Jim Currie.Ben Porter, findagrave.com Barrymore and Porter had played cards earlier with Currie, winning some money from him. That evening, while Barrymore, Porter and the actress Ellen Cummins dined at the White House Saloon, an intoxicated Currie began insulting and goading them into a fight. Barrymore challenged Currie to a fistfight. Currie shot him in the chest and then shot Porter in the stomach. John Drew, Jr., also with the company, showed up at the doorway after being alerted by all the commotion but Currie didn't shoot him. Porter was killed, while doctors spent the night operating on Barrymore to save his life. Georgie, then several months pregnant with Ethel, rushed to Texas to be at her husband's side enduring a long train trip. He made a full recovery, and returned to Marshall for the legal procedures that followed. Currie's brother was Andrew Currie, mayor of Shreveport, Louisiana, from 1878 to 1890 and later a member of the Louisiana state legislature, who apparently used his influence to secure a not guilty verdict (after a 10-minute deliberation). An enraged Barrymore vowed never to return to Texas. According to a 2004 A&E; Biography piece, after the Ben Porter tragedy, Barrymore asked Georgiana to tour with him and Helena Modjeska in a play he had written. Georgiana and the children had converted to Catholicism under Helena's influence. Learning that he and Helena had resumed their romance, Georgiana, who had been given ownership of the play by Barrymore, forced his hand by closing it. Helena's husband, its producer, sued her. The real reason for Georgiana's actions never got into the press. However, Barrymore's many dalliances did make the newspapers. Nadjezda In 1884, Barrymore wrote a play titled Nadjezda (meaning \\"hope\\"). During this period he sailed with his wife Georgiana and their children Lionel, Ethel and John, then respectively 6, 5 and 2, to England to visit relatives he hadn't seen since migrating to America. (He had inherited some money from his aunt Amelia, one of his family members who helped raise him.) During the trip Barrymore met the great French actress and star Sarah Bernhardt. Without copyrighting his play, he gave her a copy of the manuscript. In 1886, Victorien Sardou, a friend of Bernhardt's, wrote his play La Tosca, which later achieved great fame as an opera. Barrymore claimed that Bernhardt had given his play to Sardou and that La Tosca plagiarized it, and sought an injunction to stop Fanny Davenport from putting on further performances. In affidavits read out in court Bernhardt said that she had never seen the play and knew nothing about it, and Sardou said that preliminary material for the play had been in his desk for fifteen years. In fact, the only resemblance to La Tosca is the unholy bargain the heroine makes to save her husband's life, similar to that of Tosca and Baron Scarpia. As Sardou pointed out in his affidavit, this plot device is a common one and had been notably used by Shakespeare in Measure for Measure. Last years Lithograph of Barrymore with Mrs. Leslie Carter in The Heart of Maryland, 1895 In 1896, Barrymore became the first major Broadway star to headline in Vaudeville‚Äîa brave foray at the time. During his career, Maurice Barrymore played opposite many of the reigning female stars of the time including Helena Modjeska, Mrs. Fiske, Mrs. Leslie Carter, Olga Nethersole, Lillian Russell, and Lily Langtry. In the 1895 theater season on Broadway he co-starred with Mrs. Leslie Carter in The Heart of Maryland. In the 1899 season on Broadway he had a success playing opposite Mrs. Fiske in the part of Rawdon Crawley in Becky Sharp.Famous Actors and Actresses On the American Stage: Documents of the American Theater History Vol. 1 A-J by William C. Young c.1975; (Maurice Barrymore entry pages75-81 with splendid photo as Rawdon Crawley) This play was based on a character from William Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair. Becky Sharp was Barrymore's last Broadway success. In 1900, Barrymore toured the U.S. with a play called The Battle of the Strong co-starring a young Holbrook Blinn. In the company of this play was a five-year-old child actress, Blanche Sweet, who grew up to be a silent movie actress and acted with Lionel in his first Biograph film. When the Battle of the Strong company stopped in Louisville, Kentucky Barrymore sat for his last posed photograph. Also during this time he got to spend time with his son John, who was now in his late teens. Lionel and Ethel were on the road in theater companies, having already started their careers. Mental breakdown and death On 28 March 1901, Barrymore was performing at the Lion Palace Theatre in New York when he suddenly departed from his monologue and shocked the audience with what was described as \\"a blasphemous attack on the Jews\\" and a rant of \\"such an emotional pitch that tears rolled down his face.\\" After further erratic behavior, Barrymore was committed to Bellevue Hospital by a court order obtained by his son.\\"Barrymore in an Asylum\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, 30 March 1901, p1 In reporting his death on 25 March 1905, The New York Times recalled that \\"He was playing a vaudeville engagement [in 1901] at a Harlem theatre when he suddenly dropped his lines and began to rave.\\" The following day he became violent and was taken to Bellevue insane ward by his son, John, who lured him under the pretense of starring in a new play. At Bellevue and later Amityville he was diagnosed with the lingering effects of syphilis, an incurable disease at the time. During his stay at Bellevue he almost strangled his daughter Ethel during a visit. Ethel, through her early success on the stage, paid for her father's stay in the institutions. A trained boxer, Barrymore's strength remained, as in a scuffle with one of the Bellevue attendants, he picked the man up over his head and threw him into a corner. In 1905, Barrymore's son Lionel visited him at Amityville and the subject of San Francisco came up. Maurice called Lionel a \\"goddamned liar\\" and stated that San Francisco had been destroyed by fire and earthquake. Lionel writes in his autobiography that his father had foreseen the great 1906 earthquake a full year before it took place.Lionel Barrymore writing in We Barrymores c.1951 Barrymore died at Amityville in his sleep, and Ethel had him buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Philadelphia. When the cemetery later was closed, his remains were moved to Mount Vernon Cemetery, also in Philadelphia, where his first wife and her family are buried. Barrymore was fondly remembered, and his death was widely reported in the country's newspapers. He had lived long enough to see all three of his children enter the family business of acting.\\"Tribute to Maurice Barrymore\\" by actor/friend Henry Miller(Wayback version) In memoriam In honor of his life, Michael J.

Etymology Moldavia/Moldova was named after the Moldova River, which is a Slavic name, derived from Slavic mold-, \\"spruce, fir\\". A. I. Sobolevskij derived it from *moldu, \\"tender, soft, young\\".Nandris (1968), p. 121 The ending -ov(a)/-av(a) is a common Slavic suffix used in appelatives and proper names.Nandris (1968), p. 122 -ova denotes ownership, chiefly of feminine nouns. There is significant Slavic influence on Romanian. The myth, included in works of Grigore Ureche (1590‚Äì1647), Miron Costin (1633‚Äì1691) and Dimitrie Cantemir (1673‚Äì1723), but given varying levels of credibility by these, was that the hunter Drago»ô from Maramure»ô (the founder of Moldavia) in 1359 hunted for wild oxen, accompanied by female dog Molda who chased an ox into the river where the animal was killed and the dog itself drowned in the water; the river and region was named after the dog. Other theories is that it is derived from old German Molde, meaning \\"open-pit mine\\", or the Gothic Mulda meaning \\"dust\\", \\"dirt\\" (cognate with the English mould), referring to the river. The short- lived capital of Moldavia, Baia in the Suceava County, was called Stadt Molde in a 1421 German document. Bogdania The original and short-lived reference to the region was Bogdania, after Bogdan I, the founding figure of the principality. Wallachia The term \\"Black Wallachia\\" (), in Turkish Kara- Eflak, was another name found used for Moldova in the Ottoman period. It derived from Bogdan I of Moldavia; in Ottoman Turkish usage his state was known as Kara-Bogdan () and Bogdan-Eflak, \\"Bogdan's Wallachia\\".

Gann based on a real-life trip that he flew as a commercial airline pilot for Matson Lines from Honolulu, Hawaii to Burbank, California. It was adapted into a film of the same name. The novel won the Silver Medal at the Commonwealth Club of California's 23rd Annual California Book Awards for 1953 fiction. Plot summary In Honolulu, TOPAC airliner 420 prepares to take off for San Francisco with 16 passengers and a crew of 5. Former captain Dan Roman, the flight's veteran first officer known for his habit of whistling, is haunted by a takeoff crash in South America that killed his wife and son and left him with a permanent limp. 420's captain, Sullivan, suffers from a secret fear of responsibility after logging thousands of hours looking after the lives of passengers and crew. Young second officer Hobie Wheeler and veteran navigator Lenny Wilby are contrasts in age and experience. Stewardess Spalding attends her passengers, each with varying personal problems, and befriends the terminally ill Frank Briscoe after being charmed by his pocket watch. A last minute arrival, businessman Humphrey Agnew, soon causes her misgivings by his strange behavior. After a routine departure, 420 experiences sporadic sudden vibrations. Although the crew senses that something may be wrong with the propellers, they cannot locate a problem. When a vibration causes Spalding to burn her hand, Dan inspects the tail compartment but still finds nothing amiss. After nightfall, as the plane passes the point of no return, Agnew confronts fellow passenger Ken Childs, accusing him of having an affair with Agnew's wife. The men struggle and Agnew pulls out a gun, intending to shoot Childs, but before he can do so, the plane swerves violently when it loses a propeller and the engine catches fire. The crew quickly extinguishes the fire, but the engine has twisted off its mounting. In mid-ocean, the crew radios for help, assisted by an amateur radio operator aboard the steamer S.S. Cristobal Trader, and sets in motion a rescue operation. Dan discovers that the airliner is losing fuel from damage to a wing tank and that as a result, along with adverse winds and the drag of the damaged engine, the plane will eventually run out of fuel and be forced to ditch. Unassuming fisherman Jos√© Locota disarms Agnew and confiscates the gun, compelling him to sit quietly. Broadway producer Gustave Pardee, who up until now has made no secret of his fear of flying, inspires calm in his terrified fellow passengers. Dan calmly explains the situation, trying to lessen their anxiety, but warns that their chances of making the coast are \\"one in a thousand.\\" The passengers rally around each other and find changed perspectives about their existing problems. In San Francisco, Operations Manager Tim Garfield, who redeemed Roman's career by hiring him at TOPAC, arrives at the airline's operations center but is not sanguine about their chances. A favorable change in the winds and the arrival of a Coast Guard rescue B-17 to escort them raises the crew's hopes that they have just enough fuel to reach San Francisco. Wilby, however, discovers that in his nervousness he made an elementary error in navigation and their actual remaining time in the air is less than he originally calculated. Garfield sends Sullivan a suggestion for conserving fuel that he fears Sullivan will disregard as disparaging his flying ability. Dan's experience tells him that their luck would be better trying to make land than ditching in the rough seas at night, and he recognizes that fear rather than judgment is governing Sullivan's decisions. When Sullivan panics and prepares to ditch immediately, Dan slaps him back to his senses. Dan adjusts the controls without Sullivan's permission to save gas. A recalculation of the remaining fuel convinces Dan the fuel supply is barely sufficient to reach San Francisco if the tail winds continue to increase, which persuades Sullivan to make the gamble. As the airliner approaches rain-swept San Francisco in the middle of the night and at a perilously low altitude, the airport prepares for an emergency instrument landing. The plane narrowly surmounts the city's hills and breaks out of the clouds with the runway lights dead ahead, guiding them to a safe landing. As the passengers disembark, Garfield watches their reactions from the shadows of the terminal as they are harried by inquisitive reporters. After the tumult dies down, he joins the crew inspecting the damaged airplane and informs Dan that only thirty gallons of gas remained in their tanks. Dan acknowledges the gamble they took and walks away. \\"So long...you ancient pelican,\\" Garfield mutters to his disappearing form. Factual basis of plot The novel is based on Ernest Gann's experiences as a commercial airline pilot. On a Matson Lines DC-4 flight from Honolulu to Burbank, the stewardess complained of a sporadic vibration that was rattling the dishes and silverware in the rear of the plane. Gann inspected the tail compartment and noticed nothing amiss, attributing the vibration to a problem with number 3 engine. The vibration was eventually traced to a missing elevator hinge bolt that almost resulted in a loss of control. Captain Sullivan and first officer Roman are composite characters based on airline pilots that Gann knew personally. Gann himself had flown airplane delivery missions to South America during a furlough from American Airlines. He later flew with a first officer who had almost twice as many flight hours, who was forced to resume flying with low seniority after running out of funds in retirement. Gann later recounted his airline experiences in his memoirs, Fate Is the Hunter. Publication information * Gann, Ernest K. The High and the Mighty.

Try as he might, he can not identify the cause of his torment or make sense of the fleeting remains of his dreams. He shrugs them off, but things seem to be getting worse. Johnnie works as foreman on his uncle Trump's construction crew. Work tensions run high as the building owners complain about the cost and pace, while the workers constantly find their pay-packets shorted. Sly as a fox, Uncle Trump always explains everything away. Even when arrested for indecent exposure in a park frequented by gay men on the prowl for sex, he handily swears he only stopped there to relieve himself and was arrested by mistake.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 23 Jan. 2013 Later, when bishop of C√¶sarea in Cappadocia, according to Eusebius, Firmilian invited Origen to his own country for the benefit of the Churches, around (232-5) when Origen was staying in C√¶sarea of Palestine, on account of his bishop's displeasure at his having been ordained priest in that city. Firmilian was an opponent of the stringent policies of antipope Novatian, for Dionysius writes that he had been invited to a synod at Antioch in 252 by the bishops of Cilicia, Cappadocia, and Palestine to repudiate Novatianism.Lardner, Nathaniel and Kippis, Andrew. The Works of Nathaniel Lardner, Vol. II, J. Johnson, London, 1788 Dionysius counts Firmilian as one of \\"the more eminent bishops\\" in a letter to Pope Stephen I (Eusebius, VII, v, 1), where his expression \\"Firmilian and all Cappadocia\\" implies that Caesarea was already a metropolitan see. This explains how Firmilian could invite Origen to Cappadocia, \\"for the benefit of the Churches\\". Firmilian's letter to Cyprian A controversy arose as to whether it was necessary or not to re-baptize those Christians who had been initially baptized by heretics. Tertullian held that it was necessary since such a baptism was null. Chapman, John. \\"St. Cyprian of Carthage.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 8 February 2016 It was the practice in the East to rebaptize those baptized by heretics.Benson, E.W., \\"Firmilianus, bp. of Caesarea\\", A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography, (Henry Wace, ed.), John Murray, London, 1911 When the baptismal controversy arose, Cyprian wished to gain support from the Eastern churches against Pope Stephen for his own decision to rebaptize all heretics who returned to the Church. At the end of the summer of 256, he sent the deacon Rogatian to Firmilian with a letter, together with the documents on the subject--letters of the pope, of his own, and of his council at Carthage in the spring, and the treatise De Ecclesia Catholica Unitate. In a letter to Pope Sixtus II (257-58), Dionysius mentions that in the controversy over rebaptism of the lapsed, Pope Stephen had refused communication with Helenus of Tarsus, Firmilian, and all Cilicia and Cappadocia, and the neighbouring lands (Eusebius, VII, v, 3-4), a subject touched on in the sole surviving letter of Firmilian, a response to Cyprian. =On baptism= Firmilian's reply was received at Carthage about the middle of November. It is a long letter, even more bitter and violent than the letter of Cyprian to Pompeius. It has come down to us in a translation made, no doubt, under Cyprian's direction, and apparently very literal, as it abounds in Greek expressions.\\"Epistle 74\\", Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 5., (Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A. Cleveland Coxe, eds.) (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1886.) Revised and edited for New Advent by Kevin Knight In the letter, Cyprian's arguments against Pope Stephen are reiterated and reinforced. Firmilian says: \\"We have received your writings as our own, and have committed them to memory by repeated reading\\" (c. iv). Firmilian's reasoning against the validity of heretical baptism is mainly that of Cyprian, that those who are outside the Church and have not the Holy Spirit cannot admit others to the Church or give what they do not possess: \\"Very many of us meeting together in Iconium very carefully examined the matter, and we decided that every baptism was altogether to be rejected which is arranged for without the Church.\\" =Regarding Pope Stephen= The argument of Firmilian's letter is written with a bit more vehemence and acerbity than becomes a bishop, chiefly for the reason, as may be suspected, that Stephen had also written to Firmilianus, Helenus, and other bishops of those parts. The dispute was similar to that which developed over Novatianism, that is, under what circumstances are those who left the faith to be re-admitted to communion. According to Alban Butler, the practice of the Church was to regard any baptism given in the evangelical words, that is, in the name of the three persons of the Holy Trinity, as valid and not dependent upon the moral character of the person administering it. While both faith and the state of grace are required in him who confers any sacrament, any culpable failure in this regard belongs to the minister not the recipient, and does not affect the sacrament's validity. This was the practice even of the African Church till Agrippinus, bishop of Carthage, in the close of the second century, changed it, fifty years before St. Cyprian. Thus, Stephen based his argument on to tradition from St. Peter and St. Paul. Firmilian reassures Cyprian that although at Carthage the custom of rebaptizing may be new, in Cappadocia it has been the custom from the very beginning, and he can answer Stephen by opposing tradition to tradition, and that some time since, he had joined in a council at Iconium with the bishops of Galatia and Cilicia and other provinces, and had decided to rebaptize the Montanists. The disagreement with Stephen was further complicated in that Stephen viewed it as touching on matters of faith, while Cyprian and Firmilian considered it a question of discipline appropriate to the jurisdiction of individual ordinaries. Stephen threatened to cut off the patrons of the novelty from the communion of the Church. But St. Dionysius of Alexandria interceded by letters, and procured a respite.Butler, Alban. \\"St. Stephen, Pope and Martyr\\". The Lives of the Saints. Vol VIII, 1866 Firmilian enables us to gather much of the drift of Stephen's letter to Cyprian. The threat of excommunication only served to incense Firmilian who considered it \\"ridiculous\\" that Stephen demanded nothing but the use of the Trinitarian formula. He viewed Stephen's perceived leniency towards heretics as an insult to the Apostles. Moreover, he disagreed that Rome preserved the Apostolic traditions unchanged, for it differed from Jerusalem as to the observances at Easter and he disputed Stephen's authority to excommunicate them. \\"I am justly indignant with Stephen's obvious and manifest silliness, that he so boasts of his position, and claims that he is the successor of St. Peter on whom were laid the foundations of the Church... You have cut yourself off--do not mistake--since he is the true schismatic who makes himself an apostate from the communion of ecclesiastical unity. For in thinking that all can be excommunicated by you, you have cut off yourself alone from the communion of all.\\" Dionysius, in a letter to the Roman priest Philemon , also mentions the Council of Iconium. It was presumably held in the last years of Alexander Severus, ca 231-35\\\\. Proceedings against Paul of Samosata Firmilian presided at a council at Antioch which discussed deposing Paul of Samosata, in 266. He was persuaded that Paul would amend, however another council was necessary. He was on his way to this assembly when death overtook him, at Tarsus, in 272. Though Firmilian was excommunicated by Stephen, it is certain that the following popes did not adhere to this severe policy. Firmilian is commemorated in the Greek martyrology (October 28) but is not venerated in the West. His great successor in Cappadocia, St Basil of Caesarea, mentions his view on heretical baptism without accepting it (Epistle clxxxviii), and says, when speaking of the expression \\"with the Holy Ghost\\" in the Doxology: \\"That our own Firmilian held this faith is testified by the l√≥goi which he has left\\" (De Spiritu Sancto, xxix, 74). There is no other mention of such writings, which were probably letters.

He was born in Newark, New Jersey. His older brother was historian Leonard Krieger. He served in World War II before studying at the University of Chicago, and Ohio State University as a doctoral student. One of the major New Critics, in 1976, he helped found the School of Criticism and Theory, which became an influential forum for literary criticism and critical theory in the United States. His study of the New Critics introduced a degree of philosophical sophistication and theoretical self-consciousness to formalist criticism that was rare among literary critics in the U.S. during that time.http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb1r29n709&doc.view;=frames&chunk.id;=div00035&toc.depth;=1&toc.id;= Krieger's work focused on the nature of literary fiction and how it reveals the constructed nature of all forms of representation. According to him, literature is the \\"primary means of freeing ourselves from the constraints of ideology and arbitrary beliefs.\\" He insisted that literature is different from other kinds of discourse because it never claims its fictional forms are anything other than illusions. Krieger argued that literary illusion, as illusion, offers society a critical perspective on the ideological systems by which beliefs are nourished and enforced as ‚Äútrue,‚Äù and he included among those systems any theoretical method that discounts the special status of literary forms. Consequently, in an ironic reversal of the revolution he had helped bring about, Krieger spent the last two decades of his career arguing for the importance of literature to the study of theory. He received numerous awards and honors during his lifetime, including membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1983), the Humboldt Prize (1985), the UCI Medal (1990), and the Daniel G. Aldrich Award for Distinguished University Service (1993). Following his retirement in 1994, he was appointed University Research Professor, and in that capacity he continued to write, teach, and lecture around the world until his death six years later.

Plot introduction This novel is another chapter in the disastrous life of the cyborg botanist Mendoza, recruited by the Company in 16th century Spain, and exiled to the far past. Twice in her life the same man, in different identities, has visited her, become her lover, and been killed. Neither seemed to know her at first. Alec Checkerfield is a 24th- century data pirate and smuggler who steals a time machine. He encounters Mendoza. She encounters him. It's deja vu all over again for her. He is mystified. This meeting catalyzes the most horrific event in human history. All involved are left wondering what they have done, and why. Meanwhile, Dr. Zeus seems to go from strength to strength. Plot summary The first part is an extension of the first person accounts previously supplied by Mendoza, which accounts are apparently previous chapters in her journal, written on any material she can get. Somehow all of this manages to stay intact for the unknown amount of time, perhaps 3000 years, that Mendoza spends in exile on Santa Catalina. The period is uncertain because Mendoza herself cannot remember living through some portions of it. From time to time she looks down at her plants, and next time she looks up months or years have slipped by. She may just be doing the cyborg version of 'zoning out', but since she has already slipped forward in time once, there's no telling what might be happening. What is certain is that she is about 150,000 years in the past, growing fruit and vegetables for a Company resort on Santa Cruz island. One day, a man shows up in a Company Time Shuttle. These previously unknown vessels let the Company ship tourists back to the past, but can only be piloted by cyborgs. Nonetheless the man is the image of her two previous lovers, and she does unto him what she did unto them. This time, however, he leaves behind genetic material when he goes back to the future. She is able to learn from this that he is no more human than she, but in a different way. His name is Alec Checkerfield. Next we learn about \\"Smart Alec\\", precocious scion of rich privileged 24th century Londoners, who leave him in the care of their housekeepers so they can get on with their lives away from dismal, puritanical England. Alec affects all around him, especially machines. Given a highly controlled moral teaching unit at a young age, he is able to re-program it by instinct to become his personal assistant and, eventually, partner in crime. This entity becomes \\"The Captain\\", after the pirate Captain Morgan. They resolve to rule the oceans of the world, using smuggling to pay the bills. Since meat, alcohol, chocolate etc. are illegal in most of the developed world, this is both easy and lucrative. With the assistance of the Captain, Alec outwits the Company and becomes master of his own time machine. This is in no small part thanks to Mendoza, who disables the self-destruct device on the one he initially stole from the Company. However, at the peak of his achievements, he finds he has committed one of the most heinous crimes of history. He, Mendoza and the Inklings all become aware of their parts in this. All are left desolated, filled with self-loathing and worse. Characters Alec Checkerfield grows up in 24th century London, part of a privileged class of Administrators. Alec is different. He instinctively understands computers, and can impose his will on others to some extent. At first he uses these abilities to get the usual things, money, women etc., but then he comes to the attention of Dr. Zeus Inc., which operates openly at this time. Warned by his Artificial Intelligence companion, \\"The Captain\\", that a person he is talking to is a cyborg, he makes an exit from the Company offices, and begins to work on finding out the truth, while living off the proceeds of smuggling alcohol, chocolate, coffee, meat and other illegal commodities. Alec Checkerfield, Nicholas Harpole, and Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax are one and the same, or at least different versions of the same man, created for the Adonai project. Genetically they are tetraploid, which means that even if Mendoza were still human, there would be certain obstacles to her enjoying full connubial bliss with any one of them. The \\"New Inklings\\" are idle geniuses who have, at least in their own minds, designed and deployed, from their lofty perches in the 24th century, all the Enforcers, Facilitators, Preservers and other cyborgs working for the Company throughout history. Given how much trouble it was to deal with the Enforcers once they stopped being useful, since they could hardly be passed off as normal humans, they begin the project Adonai, creating a non-cyborg human who will have the qualities they want and be easier to control, not to mention kill if necessary. Their first test run involves a man in Tudor England who grows up to be Nicholas Harpole.... Major themes In previous episodes, Santa Catalina Island off of California seems to be a focus of Company attention and the key to its history. In this episode one learns more of what is there, and how Mendoza's lovers, and indirectly the \\"New Inklings,\\" played a part in its initial discovery, which gave rise to the Company itself. Other major players in previous novels, such as Joseph and Lewis, do not appear here. In fact the only cyborg named is Mendoza herself.

Chhaupadi ( ) is a form of menstrual taboo which prohibits Hindu women and girls from participating in normal family activities while menstruating, as they are considered \\"impure\\". Chhaupadi is said to be practiced primarily in the western part of Nepal, but the same is true for city dwellers also. During chhaupadi, women are banned from the house and are made to live in a cattle shed (mainly in the western region of the country), or a makeshift dwelling known as a menstruation hut, for the duration of their period. Childbirth in Nepal also results in a similar form of confinement. During menstruation, women and girls are restricted from participating in everyday life events, and from interacting with their communities. Origin The practice of chhaupadi originates from the superstition that menstruation causes women to be temporarily impure. This superstition arose from a myth that Indra created menstruation as a means to distribute a curse. In this belief system, it is thought that if a menstruating woman touches a tree, it will never again bear fruit; if she consumes milk, the cow will not give any more milk; if she reads a book, Saraswati, the goddess of education, will become angry; if she touches a man, he will be ill. The practice persists in rural areas primarily in Western Nepal. It is also called ‚Äòchhue‚Äô or ‚Äòbahirhunu‚Äô in Dadeldhura, Baitadi and Darchula, ‚Äòchhaupadi‚Äô in Achham, and ‚Äòchaukulla‚Äô or ‚Äòchaukudi‚Äô in Bajhang district.  Description  The tradition begins with an adolescent girl's first menstrual cycle, during which she remains in the shed for up to fourteen days; afterwards, she must spend the duration of each monthly period in the shed, until she reaches menopause. Additionally, women who have just given birth must stay in the shed with their children for up to two weeks. Menstruating women and girls are required to remain isolated from their family, and are forbidden from entering homes, kitchens, schools, and temples. During this time, they remain in what is often known as a menstruation hut, which is usually made from wood or stone. In some locations, women may stay isolated from their family in a separate room attached to the house, such as a shed used for storing tools. Furnishings are sparse, so the women often sleep on the floor with only a small rug for warmth. They may not touch family members, especially male family members, and food and water is passed to them in such a way as to prevent touching. Menstruating women are also restricted from participating in family, religious or social functions, such as attending the temple or going to weddings, and girls are prevented from going to school. Women who are menstruating are barred from consuming milk, yogurt, butter, meat, and other nutritious foods, for fear that their impurity will cause cows to become ill. The typical diet during menstruation includes dry foods, salt, and rice. Menstruating women are also barred from using community water sources or performing daily functions like bathing or washing clothing. Despite the social isolation of chhaupadi, women must still work, often in the fields, during menstruation.  Health and safety risks  Women are exposed to multiple health and safety risks while practising chhaupadi. Huts are often poorly constructed and lack heat or ventilation, leaving women exposed to the elements as well as extreme temperatures during different times of year. Women are at risk of developing illnesses such as pneumonia or diarrhea while practicing chhaupadi, and are also vulnerable to attack by snakes and other animals. Risk of asphyxiation is high if a woman starts a fire in the hut to keep warm during the winter. Women have also been raped while practising chhaupadi.\\"The Risky Lives of Women Sent Into Exile‚ÄîFor Menstruating\\", National Geographic, March 10, 2017. In addition, a study by Ranabhat et. al of women aged 12-49 in the Bardiya and Kailali provinces of Nepal showed that the practice of chhaupadi is significantly correlated with reproductive health problems such as dysuria and genital itching. While exact numbers are not available, women and girls die every year while performing chhaupadi. Particularly in the far and mid-western regions of Nepal, a number of deaths have been directly related to the use of these huts. Causes range from being attacked by animals, to being bitten by scorpions or snakes, to illnesses from exposure.http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Water/ContributionsStigma/others/field_bulletin_- _issue1_april_2011_-_chaupadi_in_far-west.pdf These are some examples of the deaths that have occurred due to chhaupadi: *An 11-year-old girl died in January 2010 stemming from diarrhea and dehydration from being kept in a menstruation hut. Both her family and neighbours refused to bring her to the hospital because they believed that they would become impure should they touch her. *Two young women in late 2016 who died from smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning from fires.Evelyn Nieves, \\"In Nepal, Monthly Exile for Women\\", The New York Times \\"Lens\\", Jan. 5, 2017.\\"15-Year-Old Girl Found Dead In A Menstrual Hut In Nepal\\", NPR, Dec. 20, 2016. *In May 2017, Lalsara Bika, a 14-year-old, died as a result of a serious cold-related illness from living in a menstruation hut. *In July 2017, 19-year-old Tulasi Shahi died from being bitten by a snake \\"twice, on her head and leg,\\" while living in a cow shed being used as a menstruation hut. *In January 2019, Amba Bohora, a 35-year-old Nepali mother and her sons, aged 9 and 12, died of smoke inhalation while living in their menstrual hut. *In early February 2019, 21-year old Parwati Bogati died from suffocation and smoke inhalation after lighting a fire to stay warm.  Public action against chhaupadi  Community and organizational actions exist to combat the practice. In January 2019, local authorities demanded the destruction of chhaupadi huts in Bajura, the municipality in which a woman and her two young sons died in a hut. This resulted in the removal of 60 sheds, and the deployment of law enforcement to patrol for further removal.  Legislation  Chhaupadi was outlawed by the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2005, but the tradition has been slow to change. In 2017, Nepal passed a law punishing people who force women into exile during menstruating with up to three months in jail or a fine of 3,000 Nepalese rupees. However, in the five months since the new law went into effect (in August 2018), no cases have been filed against those enforcing the practice. In late 2018, district governments in the far west of the country began denying state support services to citizens still enforcing the practice of chhaupadi, in an effort to reduce the practice.

Reaching an altitude of just from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is one of the world's highest coastal ranges, being 250m shorter than the Saint Elias Mountains in Canada. The Sierra Nevada encompasses about and serves as the source of 36 rivers. The range is in the Departments of Magdalena, Cesar and La Guajira. The highest point of the Sierra Nevada group (and Colombia in general) may be either Pico Crist√≥bal Col√≥n or Pico Sim√≥n Bol√≠var both in the municipalities of Santa Marta and Aracataca; it has yet to be determined which is higher. SRTM data and local topographic maps show that their true elevations are approximately , lower than the elevation that is often quoted. The Sierra Nevada is a compact group, relatively small in area, and completely surrounded by lands with elevations below . Although it is associated with the Tropical Andes, the main backbone of the Andes cannot be reached from the Sierra Nevada without dropping below this level. This makes its highest point the world's fifth most prominent summit. Several peaks in the Sierra Nevada are intervisible with Cerro Paramillo, a peak in Antioquia Department. This implies a theoretical direct line of sight of just over , reported to be the longest between any two points on the surface of the Earth. Climate It is calculated that the yearly average rainfall is at elevations of to . The temperature varies between 0 ¬∞C and 27 ¬∞C.(32-81 ¬∞F) Biodiversity The tropical rainforest is made up of perennial trees, with a canopy reaching between to . There is a great variety and large populations of epiphytes and lianas, and more than 3,000 species of vascular plants are found in the area. The indigenous peoples made an alcoholic beverage from fruits of the palm Attalea maripa found at the lower elevations. Of Colombia's 340 endemic species, 44 are found in the park, for example seven species of endemic hummingbirds. Of the 3,057 endangered species, 44 are found here. The area is home to 440 species of birds, including black-fronted wood-quail, king vulture, Andean condor, Santa Marta warbler and Santa Marta parakeet. Mammals found in the park include: tapir, cougar, jaguar, squirrel, Transandinomys talamancae, otter, and brocket deer. The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is home to a number of ecoregions, which vary with elevation. The Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub region lies near the Caribbean seacoast to the north of the range. The Sin√∫ Valley dry forests cover the range's lower slopes, up to an elevation of . The Santa Marta montane forests lie above to . The montane forests are separated from other moist forests by the lower-elevation dry forests and xeric shrublands, and have large numbers of endemic species. The montane forest ecoregion has several distinct plant communities, distinguished by altitude and rainfall; moist lowland forests cover the windward northern and western flanks of the range between and , and the drier eastern and southern flanks from to . Above is a transitional forest zone of smaller trees and palms. Cloud forests occur above ; the Sub-Andean forests from to form a canopy to tall, while the higher-elevation Andean forests, between and , grow to to in height.

The Santa Marta P√°ramo is the northernmost enclave of P√°ramo in South America, which occur along the Andes belt. Above meters lies the permanent snow cap. National Natural Park The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Natural Park () is Colombia's second oldest national park, established in 1964. It is located in the Cordillera Oriental range, between the departments of La Guajira, Magdalena and Cesar, in the mountain range of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. It is a sanctuary as well as a tourist attraction, because it offers different climate, terrain, flora and fauna environments, ranging from beaches to snowy mountain peaks. Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Natural Park is considered a unique place in the world due to its isolation from the Andes and its highest peak (5700 meters above sea level) is located just 42 km away from the sea. All the water courses that originate in the national park drain to the Caribbean sea whether directly (e. g. rivers Rancher√≠a, Don Diego, Palomino, Buritaca, Guachaca, Ca√±as, etc.) or through the Magdalena River system that includes the Ci√©naga Grande de Santa Marta, (e. g., rivers Cesar, Ariguan√≠, Fundaci√≥n, Fr√≠o, Aracataca, etc.). Roughly 1.2 million people are dependent upon the freshwater supplied by the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta rivers. There are currently about 30,000 indigenous people of the ethnic groups Koguis, Arhuacos, Kankuamos and Wiwa living in the area. This park is also home to the remnants of the Tairona Culture. In 1979 the park was designated a Biosphere reserve by UNESCO. A 2013 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature on the world's most irreplaceable protected areas identified the park as the most irreplaceable park in the world for threatened species. Geology It is composed of Cretaceous metamorphic rocks (predominantly schists and gneisses) and quartzdioritic intrusives of Tertiary age. The Quaternary of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is mainly represented by colluvial-alluvial valley fill and by recent beach deposits. The coastlines of the northwestern part of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta are indented, reflecting the alternation of rocky headlands and deep, NNW trending tectonically controlled bays. The headlands are typically high plunging cliffs cut into schists and granites, whereas the embayments front alluvial valley deposits. The bay shores are typically steep, reflective beaches composed of very coarse sand to granules eroded from adjacent cliffs and alluvial deposits. Wide pocket beaches and tombolos are common along sectors with abundant rocky erosional remnants and stacks. Fauna Three species of reptiles which are native to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta are named after it: Anolis santamartae, a lizard; Atractus sanctaemartae, a snake; and Lepidoblepharis sanctaemartae, a lizard.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"St. Marta\\", p. 255). Inhabitants The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is home to the remnants of the Native American Tairona Culture; Arhuacos, Koguis, Wiwas and Kankuamos, that live in Resguardos Indigenas (Indian reserves) located in the mid-highlands. =Recent access problems= For the last ten years, access to the highest summits has been very difficult, and this situation continues, although there is a documented ascent of Pico Crist√≥bal Col√≥n in December 2015. The only safe and relatively straight forward access is from Santa Marta city to Cuchillo de San Lorenzo, but that is only to (although it provides excellent views of the peaks).

Predominantly Australian, Z Special Unit was a specialist reconnaissance and sabotage unit that included British, Dutch, New Zealand, Timorese and Indonesian members, predominantly operating on Borneo and the islands of the former Netherlands East Indies.Horner 1989, p. 26 The unit carried out a total of 81 covert operations in the South West Pacific theatre, with parties inserted by parachute or submarine to provide intelligence and conduct guerrilla warfare.Courtney 1993, p. 14 and Horton 1983, p. 150 The best known of these missions were Operation Jaywick and Operation Rimau, both of which involved raids on Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour; the latter of which resulted in the deaths of 23 commandos either in action or by execution after capture.Horner 1989, p. 26 Although the unit was disbanded after the war, many of the training techniques and operational procedures employed were later used during the formation of other Australian Army special forces units and they remain a model for guerrilla operations to this day.Horner 1989, p. 27  History  = Formation and training = The Inter-Allied Services Department (IASD), was an Allied military intelligence unit, established in March 1942. The unit was created at the suggestion of the commander of Allied land forces in the South West Pacific area, General Thomas Blamey, and was modelled on the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) in London. It was renamed Special Operations Australia (SOA) and in 1943 became known as the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD).Dennis et al 2008, p. 508. It contained several British SOE officers who had escaped from Singapore, and they formed the nucleus of the Inter-Allied Services Department (ISD) which was based in Melbourne. In June 1942, an ISD raiding/commando unit was organised‚Äîdesignated Z Special Unit. Several training schools were established in various locations across Australia, the most notable being Camp Z in Refuge Bay, an offshoot of Broken Bay to the north of Sydney, Z Experimental Station (also known as the \\"House on the Hill\\" or ZES.) near Cairns, Queensland, Fraser Commando School (or FCS) on Fraser Island, Queensland where a commemorative monument stands on the mainland overlooking the island. As a training exercise, one group led by Samuel Warren Carey paddled folboats between Fraser Island and Cairns. Another training school was the Special Boat Section at Careening Bay Camp, on Garden Island, Western Australia.Powell 1996, p. 119 and pp. 196‚Äì198. Another, in Darwin on the site of the Quarantine Station, was named the Lugger Maintenance Section to disguise its true purpose. = Plans for an attack on Singapore = In 1943, a 28-year-old British officer, Captain Ivan Lyon of the Allied Intelligence Bureau and Gordon Highlanders, and a 61-year-old Australian civilian, Bill Reynolds, devised a plan to attack Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour. Z Special Unit would travel to the harbour in a disguised fishing boat. They would then use folding kayaks to attach limpet mines to Japanese ships. General Archibald Wavell approved the plan, and Lyon was sent to Australia to organise the operation.Courtney 1993, p. 3. Bill Reynolds was in possession of a 21.3 metre-long Japanese coastal fishing boat, the Kofuku Maru, which he had used to evacuate refugees out of Singapore. Lyon ordered that the boat be shipped from India to Australia. Upon its arrival, he renamed the vessel MV Krait, after the small but deadly Asian snake.Courtney 1993, p. 3. Lieutenant-Colonel G. Egerton Mott, the chief of the Services Reconnaissance Department, suggested that they should test the effectiveness of the plan by making a mock raid on a tightly guarded Allied port. Townsville, Queensland was chosen for the location of the attack.McKie 1960, pp. 45‚Äì53. = Operation Scorpion = In January 1943, Lieutenant Samuel Warren Carey, a Z Special Unit officer based at Z Experimental Station, Cairns, Queensland, approached General Thomas Blamey with a proposition for a raid on the Japanese-occupied port at Rabaul, New Guinea. One submarine, with a small group of commandos on board, would be involved. The commandos would be dropped off Rabaul.Powell 1996, pp. 64‚Äì65. They would then use their Hoehn military folboats (collapsible kayaks) to travel into the harbour and attach limpet mines to as many enemy ships as possible. They would then retreat to a volcano section roughly south of Rabaul, where they would hide out until they could safely rendezvous with the submarine. Blamey was sure that the unit would be captured and shot, but he authorised the operation, and issued Carey carte blanche authority to perform whatever actions he deemed necessary during the planning of the proposed operation, which was codenamed Operation Scorpion.Powell 1996, pp. 64‚Äì65. By the end of March 1943, Carey had assembled a team of nine men on their base at Magnetic Island. Lyon and Mott arranged to have Carey's unit perform a mock attack on Townsville, although they were careful not to commit anything to paper. Townsville was a busy harbour full of troop transports, merchantmen and naval escort vessels, and tight security was maintained due to the constant threat of Japanese air and submarine attack.Thompson and Macklin 2002, pp. 59‚Äì61. At midnight on 22 June 1943, the unit left Magnetic Island and paddled by folboat through the heavily mined mouth of Townsville Harbour. Dummy limpet mines were attached to ten ships, including two destroyers. The men rowed into Ross Creek, dismantled and hid their folboats, then travelled into Townsville to find a place to sleep. Around 10:00 am, the limpets were discovered, and panic ensued. Carey was arrested, and despite producing Blamey's letter and earnest assurances that the mines were dummies, they refused to allow him to leave or to allow the removal of the mines, which the RAN feared were real and might accidentally detonate. Mott was able to arrange Carey's release, but only on the condition that he left Z Special Unit. Operation Scorpion was scrapped due to a lack of submarine transport, but Mott and Lyon had learned many valuable lessons from the raid.Powell 1996, pp. 64‚Äì65. = Operation Jaywick = Operation Jaywick was an Inter-Allied Services Department operation to infiltrate the Japanese- occupied Singapore Harbour and destroy shipping. On 2 September 1943, the Krait, with a crew of eleven Australian and four British personnel, left Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia. The group, commanded by Ivan Lyon, dyed their skin brown and hair black (the skin dye later caused many skin problems for the members of the team, including irritation and reactions in adverse amounts of sunlight). They also wore sarongs, so that they resembled Indonesian fisherman.Courtney 1993, pp. 3‚Äì4. They arrived off Singapore on 24 September and that night six men left the boat. They paddled to a small island near the harbour where a forward base was established in a cave. On the night of 26 September, using folboats the party paddled into the harbour and placed limpet mines on several Japanese ships. The mines sank or seriously damaged four Japanese ships, amounting to over 39,000 tons. The raiders waited until the commotion had died down before returning to the Krait. On 19 October the Krait arrived back at Exmouth Gulf having achieved a great success. = Operation Rimau = Operation Rimau was a follow-up to the successful Operation Jaywick, which had taken place in 1943, being a further attack on Japanese shipping at Singapore Harbour. Rimau (Malay for \\"tiger\\") was again led by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon, a British officer on secondment from the Gordon Highlanders. Originally named Operation Hornbill, the goal of \\"Rimau\\" was to sink Japanese shipping by placing limpet mines on ships. It was intended that motorised semi-submersible canoes, known as Sleeping Beauties, would be used to gain access to the harbour.Powell 1996, p. 124. Lyon led a Services Reconnaissance Department party of twenty-two men. They left their base in Australia aboard the British submarine on 11 September 1944.Thompson and Macklin 2002, p. 149. When they reached the island of Merapas, which was to be their forward base, it was discovered to be inhabited. To ensure that their stores would remain undiscovered by the natives one of the officers from the Porpoise, Lieutenant Walter Carey, remained on Merapas as a guard. The party then commandeered a Malay junk named Mustika, taking the Malay crew aboard the submarine. The SRD men transferred their equipment to the junk and the Porpoise departed. Lyon decided to drop off four more men with Carey: Corporal Colin Craft, Warrant Officer Alf Warren and Sergeant Colin Cameron.Thompson and Macklin 2002, pp. 154‚Äì160. Meanwhile, the Mustika neared its target. On the day of the planned attack, 10 October 1944, disaster struck. A Japanese patrol boat from the Malay 'Heiho' challenged the Mustika and someone on board opened fire, killing three Malays. Their cover blown, Lyon had no option but to abort the mission. After scuttling the junk and the Sleeping Beauties with explosives, he ordered his men back to Merapas. Unbeknown to Lyon two Malays had escaped overboard during the firing and had made their way ashore to report the incident.Thompson and Macklin 2002, pp. 165‚Äì167. The Hoehn Mk III folboats stored in the Mustika were deployed to make the party's way to Merapas. Hoehn 2011, p. 70, 72 and pp.99-103 Using these folboats, Lyon led a small force of six other men‚ÄîLieutenant Commander Donald Davidson, Lieutenant Bobby Ross, Able Seaman Andrew Huston, Corporal Clair Stewart, Corporal Archie Campbell and Private Douglas Warne‚Äîinto Singapore Harbour, where they are believed to have sunk three ships.Thompson and Macklin 2002, p. 169. Lyon and twelve others were killed in action soon afterwards, and the remaining ten men were captured and later executed by beheading in July 1945.Thompson and Macklin 2002, p. 210 and 243. = Operation Copper = Four of the crew members of Motor Launch (ML) 1321 and NX73110 Sapper (Spr) Edgar Thomas 'Mick' Dennis, Z Special Unit, the only survivor of the ill-fated raid on Muschu Island (off the coast of New Guinea), at Brisbane dockyard. May 1945 Operation Copper was one of the last Z Special operations in New Guinea. On the night of 11 April 1945, eight operatives were landed near Muschu Island by HDML patrol boat. Their mission was to paddle ashore and reconnoitre the island to determine the status of Japanese defences and validate reports that two 140 mm long-range naval guns were still in position. Intelligence suggested that these weapons were back in service and could prove dangerous during the forthcoming invasion of Wewak, as they had sufficient range to fire into the proposed landing areas and, while they would not stop the Australian invasion, they could cause significant casualties.Dennis 2006, p. 58. Caught by unexpected currents the four folboats were pushed south of their landing area and came ashore amid a surf break. All boats were swamped and some items of equipment lost, but they made it ashore and harboured up until morning.Dennis 2006, pp. 61‚Äì64. At daybreak they commenced their reconnaissance of the island, soon encountering Japanese who, unbeknownst to them, had found equipment that was washed ashore further along the island. Thus alerted, the island became a hunting ground, with almost 1,000 Japanese searching for the patrol.Dennis 2006, pp. 65‚Äì67. Attempts to communicate by radio with the HDML patrol boat failed, as their radios had been swamped and the batteries ruined.Dennis 2006, p. 70. Of the eight men, only one survived. Sapper Mick Dennis, an experienced commando who had previously fought the Japanese in New Guinea in several significant engagements, escaped after fighting his way through Japanese patrols.Dennis 2006, pp. 179‚Äì183. He swam the channel to Wewak while being pursued by the Japanese and made his way through enemy territory to eventually meet up with an Australian patrol on 20 April.Dennis 2006, p. 226. The information he returned with proved vital to keeping the guns out of action and in preventing the Japanese from using the island as a launching point for attacks against the Australian forces during the Wewak landings a month later.Dennis 2006, pp. 233‚Äì234. In 2010 and 2013, expeditions to Muschu Island were conducted by MIA Australia, leading to the discovery of the remains of four of the Z Special Commandos lost on the Muschu raid. In late February 2014 it was announced that the remains of former St George first grade rugby league player, Lance Corporal Spencer Henry Walklate, and Private Ronald Eagleton, would be laid to rest in May 2014 with full military honours at the Lae War Cemetery, where the other five men from Operation Copper are buried. = Borneo = During 1943‚Äì45, Z Special Unit conducted surveillance, harassing attacks and sabotage behind Japanese lines in Borneo, as well as the training of natives in resistance activities. The first of these operations was Operation Python. Few details of these operations have been officially released, although details have emerged from the personal accounts of some Z Special Unit personnel. On 25 March 1945, Tom Harrisson was parachuted with seven Z Special operatives from a Consolidated Liberator onto a high plateau occupied by the Kelabit. An autobiographical account of this operation (SEMUT I, one of four SEMUT operations in the area) is given in World Within (Cresset Press, 1959); there are also reports‚Äînot always flattering‚Äîfrom some of his comrades. His efforts to rescue stranded American airmen shot down over Borneo are a central part of \\"The Airmen and the Headhunters,\\" an episode of the PBS television series Secrets of the Dead. Throughout June and July 1945, several operations under the aegis of Operation Platypus were launched in the Balikpapan area of Borneo.  New Zealand recruits  During the southern winter of 1944, twenty-two New Zealand soldiers,Sgt P. J. Boyle, Sgt W. J. Butt, Maj J. K. L. Brown, Sig A. J. Campbell, Cpl G. R. Edlin, Sig N. G.

Wigzell. based at Trentham Military Camp, north of Wellington, New Zealand were sent to train with Z Special Unit in Melbourne, Australia. They were then sent to Fraser Commando School, on Fraser Island, Queensland, to be trained in using parachutes, unarmed combat, explosives and the Malay language. Four New Zealanders were killed during operations in Borneo.Wigzell 2001.McGibbon 2000, p. 627. Major Donald Stott and Captain McMillan were both presumed drowned in heavy seas while going ashore in a rubber boat from the submarine in Balikpapan Bay on 20 March 1945. Their bodies were never found. Warrant Officer Houghton made it to shore in a second boat but was captured ten days later and languished in Balikpapan Prison where he died of beriberi about 20 April 1945.Wigzell 2001. Signalman Ernie Myers, a trained Z Special Unit operative in Platypus VII, parachuted into enemy-held territory near Semoi on 30 June 1945, but landed with two other operatives inside a Japanese camp area. They resisted strongly, but the Australian in the party was killed and Myers was captured along with the Malay interpreter of the group. Both men were tortured for three days, before being beheaded. Their bodies were recovered soon after the Japanese surrender when Lieutenant Bob Tapper, another New Zealander who was working with the War Graves Commission, discovered their remains. Evidence given to the commission by native witnesses ensured that the Japanese involved paid the penalty for this atrocity.Wigzell 2001.  Vessels allocated to Z Special Unit  = Snake-class boats = HMAS Tiger Snake in April 1945 The SRD used a number of vessels for its operations in South East Asia. Over the course of 1944‚Äì45 SRD took control of four trawlers that were constructed at the naval dockyard in Williamstown, Victoria. These vessels were modified with more powerful engines and alterations were made to their superstructures in order to disguise them and make them look more like the types of vessels that were operating in the waters around South East Asia. They were designated \\"Snake-class\\" boats. Later, two more were built but they were not completed in time to see service during the war. On operations the Snake-class vessels operated in tandem with a mother-ship. SRD operated two such vessels‚ÄîHMAS Anaconda and HMAS Mother Snake‚Äîboth of which were long wooden motor vessels. There was a third vessel laid down‚ÄîAV 1358 (Greenogh)‚Äîbut it did not see service with SRD during the war. With a crew of 14, these vessels were mainly crewed by a mixture of Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army personnel with a naval lieutenant in command and an army captain as chief officer. The boats were officially commissioned ships and were outfitted with two 300‚Äì320-horsepower diesel engines and armed with one 20mm Oerlikon as well as a number of assorted smaller machine guns. Of the Snake-class boats that saw service, at least three were used to deploy Z operatives with Hoehn military folboats in enemy occupied areas for reconnaissance or small scale raids. HMAS Riversnake went to Portuguese Timor, to deploy SUNCHARLIE operatives. HMAS Blacksnake deployed GIRAFFE and SWIFT operatives in the Celebes and HMAS Tigersnake sailed out of Sarawak to set down operatives of SEMUT IVB.Hoehn 2011, pp. 69-71. After the war, the Anaconda remained in service until November 1946 when she was sold and converted into a fishing boat. The fate of the Mother Snake is unknown, although it is believed that she remained in Borneo after the war. The six Snake-class boats, however, along with the Krait were sold to the British Civil Administration in Borneo. The MV Krait was originally restored in 1964 and used for training and recreation purposes by the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol. The vessel is part of the Australian War Memorial's collection, on loan to the Australian National Maritime Museum in Darling Harbour, Sydney. = Other vessels = *AL254 Charm, a lugger.Register of Army Small Craft covering the period 1943 to 1946.

The Z Special Unit Association (NSW Branch) was disbanded in March 2010 due to a decline in members and the Association's last Sydney ANZAC Day march was held in 2010. Commemorative plaques to Z Special Unit have been placed on each lamp post on the new jetty at Rockingham, Western Australia, and the activities of Z Special Unit have been depicted in several Australian films, TV series, and documentaries including Attack Force Z, The Highest Honor, The Heroes, Heroes II: The Return, and Australia's Secret Heroes.

Life Paul was born, according to the chroniclers of his order, at Udine, about 1369 and died at Venice on 15 June 1429, as Paolo Nicoletti. He joined the Augustinian Order at the age of 14, at the convent of Santo Stefano in Venice. In 1390 he is said to have been sent to Oxford for his studies in theology, but returned to Italy, and finished his course at the University of Padua, becoming a Doctor of Arts and Theology in 1405. He lectured in the Universities of Padua, Siena, Perugia, and Bologna during the first quarter of the fifteenth century.Conti, Alessandro, \\"Paul of Venice\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . He was also a teacher to Paolo da Pergola. Paul was also appointed Prior General of the Augustinian Order in 1409 by Pope Gregory XII, and also served as an ambassador to the Republic of Venice. Paul was one of the theologians called to Rome in 1427 by Pope Martin V to defend the orthodoxy of St. Bernardino of Siena, occasioned by Bernardino's use of inscriptions of the name of Jesus in worship. In 1429, Paul died in Padua, while he was completing his commentary on Aristotle's De Anima.Conti, Alessandro, \\"Paul of Venice\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . Philosophical work Logica, 1546 Paul's philosophy has been categorised within the realist tradition of medieval thought. Following on from John Wycliffe and the subsequent Oxonians who followed him, Paul further developed this new brand of realism, and further renewed Walter Burley‚Äôs opposition to nominalism. Paul's metaphysical theses are rooted fundamentally in Scotist thought. Duns Scotus maintained the doctrine of the univocity of being and the existence of the universal forms of objects outside of the person's mind. He also maintained Scotus' notion of the real identity and the formal distinction between essence and being, alongside the notion of \\"thisness\\" as the principle by which we individuate.Conti, Alessandro, \\"Paul of Venice\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N.

Paul was also simultaneously influenced by other thinkers of the Scholastic period, including the Dominican thinkers Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas, and his fellow Augustinian, Giles of Rome. Paul also critically engaged with the works and doctrines of fourteenth- century nominalists such as William Ockham, John Buridan, and Marsilius of Inghen, and sometimes gauged these thinkers' theses against each other to undermine their positions.Conti, Alessandro, \\"Paul of Venice\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N.

It is owned by Entercom and airs a Spanish-language Latin pop radio format. KLOL serves as the Spanish-language flagship station for the Houston Texans football team. The studios and offices are in Greenway Plaza in Houston.KLOL.radio.com/contacto The transmitter is located off McHard Road in Missouri City, Texas.Radio-Locator.com/KLOL History =KTRH-FM= For much of the early days of radio, KTRH had been one of Houston's top AM stations, co-owned with The Houston Chronicle. In 1947, an FM station was added, 101.1 KTRH-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-236 It was the third FM station in Houston (after the short-lived KOPY and KPRC-FM) and mostly simulcast KTRH's programming when few people had FM radios. KTRH-AM-FM aired the CBS Radio Network line-up of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In the 1950s, as network programming moved from radio to TV, KTRH-AM-FM switched to a full-service middle of the road (MOR) format. In 1965, KTRH-AM-FM were acquired by the Rusk Corporation. Under Rusk ownership, KTRH-FM experimented with progressive rock programs at night while simulcasting AM 740 in the daytime. In 1970, Rusk switched the station over to a full-time rock format as KLOL.Broadcasting Yearbook 1971 page B-204 =101 KLOL= In 1970, \\"I'm Free\\" by The Who ushered in a new format and call sign to the 101.1 frequency, and \\"The KLOL Legend\\" was born. In the early days, KLOL was known as \\"Mother's Family\\" and later \\"K101\\" and utilized what would be termed a freeform radio format, where each DJ would choose which records he wanted to play. The \\"Mother's Family\\" name was a reference to KFMK-FM (97.9, now KBXX), Houston's original progressive ock radio station, known as \\"Mother Radio.\\" A major contributor to the early and ongoing success of KLOL was the laid-back DJ Maurice \\"Crash\\" Collins. KLOL played cuts from mostly rock albums in the early years, but it was also possible to hear jazz, blues, folk music and R&B.; In the mid-1970s the main rock competition to 101 KLOL was ABC-owned 96.5 KAUM. KAUM eventually switched to top 40 hits. In addition, 100.3 KILT-FM was also playing rock music, another competitor for KLOL. =Moving to AOR= By the late 1970s, KLOL had moved from progressive rock to an album-oriented rock sound, with a structured playlist of only the top tracks from the best selling albums. The station changed its moniker to \\"101 KLOL.\\" KLOL achieved victory in early 1981 against format rival KILT-FM, which soon changed its format to country music. Shortly thereafter, KLOL had another rival in 97ROCK (96.5 KSRR) and one of the fiercest AOR battles of the 1980s commenced. KLOL once again won the battle as KSRR flipped to top 40 as KKHT in 1986 (and is now KHMX). KLOL mellowed somewhat in the 1980s, as did many AORs, but the playlist remained quite wide. The station's core artists were The Eagles, Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood Mac, Van Halen, The Rolling Stones, Billy Joel, Led Zeppelin, Boston, The Police and Tom Petty. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, KLOL was one of the top- rated AOR stations in the United States. KLOL featured legendary morning hosts Mark Stevens and Jim Pruett and their \\"Stevens and Pruett Show,\\" chalking up both high ratings and several fines from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for \\"offensive content.\\" Dayna Steele anchored mid-days, and the \\"Steele-workers\\" were numerous. And in the evenings it was \\"Outlaw Radio\\", an active rock show with \\"a lot of attitude.\\" KLOL was regularly in the top 3 in that time frame. =Changes in ownership= In 1993, Evergreen Media bought KTRH and KLOL for $49 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1995 page B-403 Evergreen started to make changes to KLOL's sound. The station started relying heavily on either classic rock product (KLOL would be almost all classic rock from 1996 to 1998) or current product from \\"safe artists\\" who were often not that popular. KLOL virtually ignored the exploding grunge rock and alternative rock bands in the 1990s. In late 1998, KLOL began playing more current material. Some thought active rock was finally coming to Houston on KLOL. Alternative rock-formatted KTBZ-FM had moved to a more pop-alternative sound to target listeners who had previously tuned in the now defunct 102.9 KKPN, a modern AC station that is now KLTN. So the opportunity for a harder-edged station was there. But the station stopped short of going to an active rock sound. Clear Channel Communications became the owner of KLOL in 2000. For several years, Clear Channel retained the rock format. Many thought Clear Channel would bring back the classic sound of the station during the previous decades. Instead, KLOL carried on in the same vein for another four years. =KLOL goes Spanish= Rumors of a KLOL format change had been heard since at least 1999. Some had speculated on a switch to urban oldies or top 40 as \\"KISS 101.\\" However, the November 10, 2004, edition of \\"the Walton & Johnson Show\\" on KLOL informed listeners that if they wanted to keep listening, they had better learn Spanish. On November 12, 2004, after a rerun of the \\"Walton & Johnson Show\\", KLOL segued into the \\"10 O'Clock Rock Block\\" as normal. Then, at 10:11 a.m., the station changed its format to Hurban (Spanish-language hip hop music).Clifford Pugh, \\"KLOL suddenly speaking Spanish; Venerable rock station switches to a new format\\", The Houston Chronicle, November 13, 2004.Carol Christian, \\"The day a music icon died; Houstonians mourn the loss of KLOL and its 34 on-air years\\", The Houston Chronicle, November 15, 2004.http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=53662http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2004/RR-2004-11-19.pdf \\"I'm Free\\" by The Who would bookend the 34-year history of KLOL as a rock station. In the fall of 2007, KLOL redesigned the station's entire look, changing the format to a more contemporary Latin pop sound under the direction of Clear Channel's Senior VP Alfredo Alonso. This design was made to better compete with other Spanish- language stations on the Houston radio dial. The name MEGA 101 was kept, while the logo was changed. The website was also redesigned. =CBS and Entercom acquisitions= On December 15, 2008, Clear Channel and CBS Radio announced a multi-station swap: KLOL and co-owned 96.5 KHMX would go to CBS Radio, while CBS Radio-owned stations WQSR in Baltimore, KBKS-FM in Seattle, KLTH and KXJM in Portland, Oregon, and KQJK in Sacramento, California, would go to Clear Channel. The sale was approved on March 31, 2009, and was consummated on April 1. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the November 17. =Partnership with KTMD= On September 25, 2018, Entercom struck a new content deal with NBCUniversal Television Group station KTMD (Telemundo Channel 47). The TV station will provide news, weather and other content for KLOL programming.https://klol.radio.com/articles/entercom-y-telemundo-houston- sellan-sociedad-estrat-gica =Online return of Rock 101= On November 12, 2012, after eight years of absence, Rock 101 KLOL returned as an Internet radio format.http://mikemcguff.blogspot.com/2012/07/rock-101-klol-back-on- air.htmlhttp://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2012/07/rock_101_klol.php The online-only version plays classic, progressive and some contemporary rock as well as blues-rock, often commercial-free. The Internet station is run by volunteers and uses a listener-supported business model. It is not owned by Entercom. The station has several syndicated shows as well as original programming. Classic station imaging is played and old clips of Stevens & Pruett's \\"Uncle Waldo\\" are aired on Friday mornings.

A backseat driver may be uncomfortable with the skills of the driver, feel out of control since they are not driving the vehicle, or want to tutor the driver while they are at the wheel. Many comment on the speed of the vehicle, or give alternative directions. Some backseat drivers exhibit this type of behavior simply because they feel the driver is taking risks they would not normally take, while others may have other reasons to be nervous, such as when the driver has a poor driving record. A survey of 2,000 British drivers in early 2018 found that 70% motorists found backseat driving an annoying habit and that life partners were those most likely to interfere. Although only 21% of motorists admitted to backseat driving, half said they have been in arguments due to interfering comments, and five percent admitted to accidentally jumping a red light during an argument with a backseat driver.Elsworthy, Emma (6 June, 2018). All the signs you're a back- seat driver, according to study. The Independent.  Examples in context  The term has been used for technology, such as devices installed in a car which observe the driving through electronic means, and inform the driver or a third party. The Maine Department of Transportation has a web poster \\"Are you a Good Back Seat Driver?\\" asking \\"True or False: Being a Backseat Driver means it is okay to be noisy or distracting to the driver as long as you are giving them safety tips.\\" The Inland Register produced by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane makes use of it in a sermon: \\"Even our phrase 'back-seat driver' reflects this new-found freedom. Which of us who has graduated to the status of driver enjoys a passenger, especially one out of reach in the back seat, who seems to know how to drive better than we do?\\" The Art of being a Backseat Driver in the San Bernardino County Sun summarizes various comments of the sort otherwise found in multiple blogs. Some are specialized, such as the Back Seat Driving blog, formerly the \\"LA Car Blog\\". Appearances in culture The term is used in Backseat Drivers from Beyond the Stars, an episode of Invader Zim. A poem \\"The Backseat Driver\\" by Parick G Hughes appears in the Northern Ireland BBC.http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/getwritingni/sp_ph_backseat.shtml Writer's Showcase The act of giving instructions to a driver has been used as a humorous idea for a game. In All things Considered on NPR for July 19, 2006, there is an account of a \\"Back Seat Driver competition in Forest City, Iowa. [...] The event‚Äîin which a driver races backward while blindfolded and instructed by the voice of a companion over an intercom‚Äîis in its eighth year.\\" It has even been noticed by People's Daily. In Mighty Morphin Power Rangers season 3 episode, Master Vile and the Metallic Armor, showed Rito being a backseat driver. He asks Master Vile \\"Are We There yet?\\" and annoyed him. Rito gets yelled at by him for the whining and not letting him work in peace. Master Vile threaten to turn the Space Skull around and send him back to Rita and Zedd if he doesn't behave himself. A couple of episodes in Power Rangers Zeo shows example of backseat drivers with Rita Repulsa and Goldar in the motorhome base they share with Lord Zedd, Finster, and Rito. On their way back to the palace, Rita's constant demanding lands the base a flat tire, which she and Zedd blame each other. After getting the tire fixed and back driving, Goldar shows up with the map that Zedd needs and unintentionally proceeds to be another backseat driver by overly trying to help them with the map that lands the motorhome base with yet another flat tire. Surely, Rita and Zedd blames him for the mess. Another example of a backseat driver is Rito whose constant asking of \\"Are We There Yet?\\", irritated both Zedd and Rita to the point they threaten to kick him out of the motorhome and make him walk the rest of the way to the palace. James Bond in Tomorrow Never Dies is forced to dive into the rear seat of his BMW 750il and drive it from a cellular phone that can remotely control the car. Later in the film, both he and Wai Lin are handcuffed together and must jointly ride a motorcycle while constantly bickering. The earlier episodes of The Simpsons shows examples of backseat drivers in the form of Bart and Lisa annoying Homer to no end with their asking of \\"Are we there yet?\\", causing him to snap at them. One time in the season 2 episode \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\", while driving to Detroit to visit Herb Powell, Marge lost her patience with Bart and Lisa being backseat drivers. She snapped at the two for misbehaving themselves in the car and makes her threat clear that she will have Homer turn the car around and take them home at once if they don't behave themselves. Under threat of being returned home and not being able to see Herb, Bart and Lisa behave themselves. When he complained about not meeting Herb, Marge reassures Homer that they will see him. She only threatened Bart and Lisa to return home because it was the only way the two will behave during the drive.  Related idioms  Armchair quarterback refers to a sports fan who thinks that he or she knows better than the players themselves and is always eager to shout advice, whether live at the game or, more commonly, sitting at home in a chair (hence \\"armchair\\"). Similarly, the phrase armchair general is used to refer to somebody who is not in the military but thinks that he or she knows better than the generals who plan military operations. This term can be used in many of the same situations as backseat driver. In Italy, the term umarell refers to men of retirement age who pass time watching roadworks, offering unwanted advice, similar to a \\"sidewalk superintendent\\" in English.

He served as a United States Representative from Missouri and was appointed as the first United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, which also had jurisdiction over Indian Territory. Parker became known as the \\"Hanging Judge\\" of the American Old West, because he sentenced numerous convicts to death. In 21 years on the federal bench, Judge Parker tried 13,490 cases. In more than 8,500 of these cases, the defendant either pleaded guilty or was convicted at trial. Parker sentenced 160 people to death; 79 were executed. Early life Born in Ohio, Parker was the youngest son of Joseph Parker and his wife Jane Shannon. He was the great-nephew of Ohio Governor Wilson Shannon. He was raised on the family farm near Barnesville, Ohio. He attended Breeze Hill Primary School, followed by the Barnesville Classical Institute, a private school. He taught in a county primary school to pay for his secondary education. At 17, he began an apprenticeship in law, called \\"reading the law\\" with an established firm, and passed the Ohio bar exam in 1859 at the age of 21. Parker moved to St. Joseph, Missouri between 1859 and 1861, where he joined his maternal uncle's law firm of Shannon and Branch. On December 12, 1861, Parker married Mary O'Toole, with whom he had sons Charles and James. By 1862, Parker had his own law firm. He represented clients in the municipal and country courts. Political career Photo of Isaac Parker taken between 1860 and 1865 In April 1861, Parker ran as a Democrat for part-time position of city attorney for St. Joseph. He served three one-year terms, from April 1861 to 1863. When the American Civil War broke out four days after Parker took office, he enlisted in a pro-Union home guard unit, the 61st Missouri Emergency Regiment. He had reached the rank of corporal by the end of the war. During the 1860s, Parker continued both his legal and political careers. In 1864, he formally split from the Democratic Party over conflicting opinions on slavery. He ran as a Republican for county prosecutor of the Ninth Missouri Judicial District. By the fall of 1864, he was serving as a member of the Electoral College and voted for re-election of Abraham Lincoln. In 1868, Parker won a six-year term as judge of the Twelfth Missouri Circuit. Parker was nominated for Missouri's 7th congressional district on September 13, 1870, backed by the Radical faction of the Republican party. He resigned his judgeship and devoted his energy to his campaign. Parker won the election after his opponent withdrew two weeks prior to the vote. Parker was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives of the 42nd and 43rd United States Congresses, serving from March 4, 1871, to March 3, 1875. He was the caucus nominee of his party for United States Senator in 1874. The first session of the 42nd Congress convened on March 4, 1871. During his first term, Parker helped to secure pensions for veterans in his district and campaigned for a new federal building to be built in St. Joseph. He sponsored a failed bill designed to enfranchise women and allow them to hold public office in United States territories. He also sponsored legislation to organize the Indian Territory under a territorial government. Parker was again elected to Missouri's 7th district in the forty-third Congress. A local paper wrote of him, \\"Missouri had no more trusted or influential representative in ... Congress during the past two years\\". In his second term, Parker concentrated on Indian policy, including the fair treatment of the tribes residing in the Indian Territory. His speeches in support of the Bureau of Indian Affairs gained national attention. In 1874, Parker was the caucus nominee of the Republican Party for a Missouri Senate seat. But, the political tide had shifted in Missouri; it seemed unlikely that the legislature would elect him to the Senate, so he sought a presidential appointment as judge for the Western District of Arkansas. Federal judicial service Photo of Parker's courtroom reconstructed at the Fort Smith National Historic Site, taken in 1966 On May 26, 1874, President Grant nominated Parker as Chief Justice of the Utah Territory to replace James B. McKean. At his own request, Parker was instead nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 18, 1875, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. It had been vacated by Judge William Story, who resigned under threat of impeachment for allegations of corruption. Parker was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 19, 1875, and received his commission the same day. He served in this position until his death in office, on November 17, 1896. Parker arrived in Fort Smith on May 4, 1875, initially without his family. Parker's first session as the district judge was on May 10, 1875, with court prosecutor W. H. H. Clayton. Clayton served as the United States Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas for fourteen of Parker's twenty-one years on the court. Also on May 10, Parker commissioned Bass Reeves as a Deputy US Marshal. Reeves became one of the first African American lawman west of the Mississippi River. In May 1875, Parker tried 18 men during his first session of court, all of whom were charged with murder; 15 were convicted in jury trials. Parker sentenced eight of them to a mandatory death penalty. He ordered six of the men to be executed at the same time on September 3, 1875. One of those sentenced to death was killed trying to escape. The governor commuted the sentence of another to life in prison due to his youth. In an interview with the St. Louis Republic on September 1, 1896, Parker said that he had no say in whether a convict was to be hanged due to compulsory death sentences, and that he favored \\"the abolition of capital punishment\\". Parker's court had final jurisdiction over federal crimes in the Indian Territory from 1875 until 1889, as there was no court available for appeals. The Five Civilized Tribes and other Native American tribes in the Indian Territory had jurisdiction over their own citizens through their tribal legal systems and governments. Federal law in Indian Territory applied to non-Indian United States citizens. According to Congress, the federal court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four separate terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The court had such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat six days a week in order to ensure prosecuting as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of European-American settlers moving into the Indian Territories still increased the court's workload. From May 1, 1889, Congress made changes to allow appeals of capital convictions to the United States Supreme Court. Forty-four cases in which Parker imposed the death penalty were appealed to the Supreme Court. It overturned and ordered a re-trial for 30 of them. While serving as a district judge in Fort Smith, Parker also served on the Fort Smith School Board. He was the first president of St. John's Hospital, established by the local St. John's Episcopal Church. (In the 21st century, the hospital is known as Sparks Health System). Present- day image of the reconstructed gallows now located at the Fort Smith National Historic Site In his time on the court, Parker presided over a number of high- profile cases, including the trial of Crawford Goldsby, known as \\"Cherokee Bill\\", and the \\"Oklahoma Boomer\\" case involving David L. Payne, a non-Indian who illegally settled on lands in the Indian Territory. In 1895, Parker heard two cases involving Crawford Goldsby (Cherokee Bill). In the first, Goldsby was charged with killing a bystander during a general-store robbery in 1894. He was convicted in a case that lasted from February 26 to June 25, 1895, and Parker sentenced him to death. While awaiting execution, Goldsby attempted to escape prison and killed a prison guard. He was tried again and convicted in Parker's court; the judge sentenced him to death on December 2, 1895. Goldsby was hanged on March 17, 1896. =Later years= Keeping up with continued settlement in the West, the Courts Act of 1889 established a federal court system in the Indian Territory. This decreased the span of jurisdiction of the Western District Court at Fort Smith. Parker clashed with the Supreme Court on a number of occasions. In around two-thirds of cases appealed to the Supreme Court from his court, his rulings were upheld. In 1894, Parker gained national attention in a dispute with the Supreme Court over the case of Lafayette Hudson. Direct link to article (PDF). Hudson was convicted of assault with intent to kill and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. He appealed to the Supreme Court and was granted bail. Parker refused to release Hudson on the grounds that statute law did not provide the Supreme Court with the authority to demand Hudson's release. In 1895, Congress passed a new Courts Act which removed the remaining Indian Territory jurisdiction of the Western District, effective September 1, 1896. Death and legacy When the August 1896 term began, Parker was at home, suffering from Bright's disease and too ill to preside over the court. The jurisdiction of the court over Indian Territory was ended on September 1, 1896. Reporters wanted to interview Parker about his career, but had to talk to him at his bedside. Parker died on November 17, 1896, of a number of health conditions, including heart degeneration and Bright's disease. His funeral in Fort Smith had the highest number of attendees up to that point. He is buried at the Fort Smith National Cemetery. In 21 years on the federal bench, Parker tried 13,490 cases; more than 8,500 defendants either pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial. He sentenced 160 people to death and 79 were executed; the others either died while incarcerated, or were acquitted, pardoned, or had their sentences commuted. Representation in other media *Charles Portis features Parker in his novel True Grit, which has twice been adapted as films of the same name. Parker is also a featured character in the sequel to the first film. He was portrayed by James Westerfield in the 1969 movie and by John McIntire in the sequel. He was played by Jake Walker in the 2010 remake of True Grit. *Zeke Proctor, one of Parker's deputy marshals, is featured in Larry McMurtry's 1997 novel Zeke and Ned. *Carlyle Mitchell, in his penultimate acting role, was cast as Judge Parker in the 1961 episode, \\"A Bullet for the D.A.\\", on the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Carole Mathews played Belle Starr recently released from federal prison. In the story line, Belle unsuccessfully plots the revenge assassination of US Attorney W. H. H. Clayton (Don Haggerty) during a Wild West show in Fort Smith. *In the pilot episode of the TV series Hec Ramsey, the title character (a former United States Marshal) briefly discusses having ridden for Parker for several years.

The pipeline allows certain CPU-intensive operations such as iDCT, motion compensation and deinterlacing to be offloaded to the GPU. DXVA 2.0 allows more operations, including video capturing and processing operations, to be hardware-accelerated as well. DXVA works in conjunction with the video rendering model used by the video card. DXVA 1.0, which was introduced as a standardized API with Windows 2000 and is currently available on Windows 98 or later, can use either the overlay rendering mode or VMR 7/9. DXVA 2.0, available only on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and later OSs, integrates with Media Foundation (MF) and uses the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR) present in MF. Overview The DXVA is used by software video decoders to define a codec-specific pipeline for hardware-accelerated decoding and rendering of the codec. The pipeline starts at the CPU which is used for parsing the media stream and conversion to DXVA-compatible structures. DXVA specifies a set of operations that can be hardware-accelerated and device driver interfaces (DDIs) that the graphic driver can implement to accelerate the operations. If the codec needs to do any of the defined operations, it can use these interfaces to access the hardware-accelerated implementation of these operations. If the graphic driver does not implement one or more of the interfaces, it is up to the codec to provide a software fallback for it. The decoded video is handed over to the hardware video renderer, where further video post-processing might be applied to it before being rendered to the device. The resulting pipeline is usable in a DirectShow-compatible application. DXVA specifies the Motion Compensation DDI, which specifies the interfaces for iDCT operations, Huffman coding, motion compensation, alpha blending, inverse quantization, color space conversion and frame-rate conversion operations, among others. It also includes three sub- specifications: Deinterlacing DDI, COPP DDI and ProcAmp DDI. The Deinterlacing DDI specifies the callbacks for deinterlacing operations. The COPP (Certified Output Protection Protocol) DDI functions allow the pipeline to be secured for DRM-protected media, by specifying encryption functions. The ProcAmp DDI is used to accelerate post-processing video. The ProcAmp driver module sits between the hardware video renderer and the display driver, and it provides functions for applying post-processing filters on the decompressed video. The functions exposed by DXVA DDIs are not accessible directly by a DirectShow client, but are supplied as callback functions to the video renderer. As such, the renderer plays a very important role in anchoring the pipeline. = DXVA on Windows Vista and later = DXVA 2.0 enhances the implementation of the video pipeline and adds a host of other DDIs, including a Capture DDI for video capture. The DDIs it shares with DXVA 1.0 are also enhanced with the ability to use hardware acceleration of more operations. Also, the DDI functions are directly available to callers and need not be mediated by the video renderer. As such, a program can also create a pipeline for simply decoding the media (without rendering) or post-processing and rendering (without decoding). These features require the Windows Display Driver Model drivers, which limits DXVA 2.0 to Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 8. On Windows XP and Windows 2000, programs can use DXVA 1.0. DXVA 2.0 allows Enhanced Video Renderer as the video renderer only on Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. (With Windows XP, DXVA-Rendering is possible with VMR9 and the well-known Overlay Mixer.) DXVA integrates with Media Foundation and allows DXVA pipelines to be exposed as Media Foundation Transforms (MFTs). Even decoder pipelines or post-processing pipelines can be exposed as MFTs, which can be used by the Media Foundation topology loader to create a full media playback pipeline. DXVA 1.0 is emulated using DXVA 2.0. DXVA 2.0 does not include the COPP DDI, rather it uses PVP for protected content. Windows 7 implements DXVA-HD if the driver complies with WDDM 1.1.  DXVA2 implementations: native and copy-back  DXVA2 implementations come in two variants: native and copy-back. With native implementation, the decoded video stays in GPU memory until it has been displayed. The video decoder must be connected to the video renderer with no intermediary processing filter. The video renderer must also support DXVA, which gives less freedom in the choice of renderers. With copy-back implementation, the decoded video is copied from GPU memory back to the CPU's memory. This implementation doesn't have the limitations mentioned above and acts similarly to a normal software decoder; however, video stuttering will occur if the GPU is not fast enough to copy its memory back to the CPU's memory. Native mode is advantageous unless there is a need for customized processing, as the additional copy-back operations will increase GPU memory load.

Regularly held in July of each year, it is valued by both hardcore genre film fans, and distributors, who take advantage of the eclectic line up to select domestic and international films for release across North America. By virtue of the reputation developed over the last 15 years, this festival has been described as perhaps the \\"most outstanding and largest genre film festival in North America\\". Overview The history of the Fantasia Festival has roots in the Asian Film scene in Montreal. Beginning in 1996 where it screened Asian films from Hong Kong and Anime from Japan, the festival later expanded its international repertoire and screened genre films from all across the world. Since this time many world and international premieres have featured at Fantasia fest, including Shaun of the Dead, Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Midnight Meat Train, Dread, The Sorcerer's Apprentice and Uzumaki. Premier of Alter Egos at Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal July 24, 2012 Among the many North American premieres have included Ringu, Inglourious Basterds, Thirst, We Are What We Are, Visitor Q and Night Watch. The organizers present a number of awards at the conclusion of each annual festival, including the Barry Convex Award for best Canadian film premiering at the festival.Kaeli Van Cott, \\"19th Fantasia International Film Festival Announces 2015 Winners\\".

History =1996‚Äì2010= *Fant-Asia 1996 (inaugural festival) *Fant-Asia 1997 :Some of the films featured were Perfect Blue, Drunken Master II, Stagefright, El Dia de la Bestia, Henry, A Gun for Jennifer, Tromeo and Juliet and Cutting Moments. *Fant-Asia 1998 :Fantasia's Toronto edition premiered at the Bloor Cinema. *Fantasia International Film Festival 1999 :The 1999 edition of Fantasia was the only one that used the ex-Centris facilities. This year also featured the second Toronto edition. *FanTasia 2000 :The 2000 edition of Fantasia featured the debut of the Just For Laughs film festival, Comedia, as a selection of comedy films were shown with the regular Fantasia fare. This was also the final year that a Toronto edition of the festival was presented. *FanTasia 2001 :The 2001 edition was the last held in the Imperial Cinema. It was also the last time the festival was jointly held with Comedia. *FanTasia 2002 (missed year) :Fantasia 2002 was cancelled due to problems with the Imperial Cinema. The air conditioning system was broken, and it could not be fixed in time for Fantasia. Indeed, the theatre was not repaired until 2004. Due to the lack of assurance that the theater would be available, and the fact that it broke four months before the festival, meant that alternate bookings were not available. The lack of assurance for the 2003 festival meant a change in venue. *FanTasia 2003 (move to Concordia University) :Fantasia 2003 was held for the first time on the Concordia University campus, using the DeSeve Cinema and Henry F. Hall Alumni Auditorium. The venue change was instigated by the lack of consideration that the Imperial Theatre gave in informing the festival organizers on the status of Imperial. This was also the first year that a DVD filled with movie trailers of movies shown at the festival was available for purchase with the festival guide book. *Fantasia 2004 :The 2004 Fantasia was held at Concordia University using the Hall Auditorium and deSeve Cinema. Unlike the 2003 event, no DVD filled with trailers was available. *Fantasia 2005 :The 9th annual Fantasia Festival in 2005 was again held at Concordia University. That year, a trailer-filled DVD was provided as part of the festival guide book and not a separate purchase. *FanTasia 2006 (10th edition/10th anniversary) :Fantsasia's 10th anniversary and 10th edition, the 2006 edition, is the first to feature free outdoor shows. The outdoors shows are at Parc de la Paix and are free. Outdoor projections included films from the previous editions: Kamikaze Girls, the last four episodes of Goldorak, Night of the Living Dorks and Attack the Gas Station. The indoor shows use the same Concordia University facilities as since the move to Concordia. The outdoor shows are several kilometres away from the indoor shows. With its 10th anniversary, Fantasia helped to launch an associated but separate Toronto festival Toronto After Dark Film Festival. *FanTasia 2007 :This edition was held from July 5 to July 23, 2007 at the Concordia University. In addition to the Hall hall and DeSeve hall, a third screening room has been added at the D.B. Clarke Theatre. There were, however, no outdoor shows this year. Montreal film Flutter received the award for best Quebec short feature. *Fantasia 2008 :This edition was held from July 3 to July 21, 2008. It featured the world premieres of Pig Hunt, Home Movie, Repo! The Genetic Opera, Midnight Meat Train, Eric Shapiro's Rule of Three, Truffe, Treevenge, The Facts in the Case of Mister Hollow, Electric Fence, Paradox Mary, Laura Panic, and Don't Worry.https://fantasiafestival.com/en/archives/2008?id=310 *Fantasia 2009 :The films screened at Fantasia 2009 were, among others, Thirst, Love Exposure, Embodiment of Evil, Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl, Smash Cut, Trick 'r Treat, Neighbor, Must Love Death, Cencoroll and Dread.

He was the son of Victor Grosvenor, Earl Grosvenor, son of the 1st Duke of Westminster, and Lady Sibell Lumley, the daughter of the 9th Earl of Scarborough. Nickname \\"Bend'Or\\" Azure, a bend or, the ancient Grosvenor arms From his childhood and during his adult life he was known within family circles as \\"Bendor\\",Loelia, Duchess of Westminster, Memoirs of, London, 1961, pp.172-4 which was also the name of the racehorse Bend Or owned by his grandfather the first Duke, which won The Derby in 1880, the year following his grandson's birth. The name is a jovial reference to the ancient lost and much lamented former armorials of the family: Azure, a bend or, which were awarded to the Scrope family in the famous case of 1389 heard before the Court of Chivalry, known as Scrope v Grosvenor. His wife Loelia wrote in her memoirs: \\"Of course everybody, even his parents and sisters, would normally have addressed the baby as \\"Belgrave\\" so they may have thought that any nickname was preferable. At all events it stuck, and my husband's friends never called him anything but Bendor or Benny\\".Loelia, Duchess of Westminster, Memoirs of, London, 1961, p.173 Estate His ancestral country estate in Cheshire, the 54-bedroom Eaton Hall, consisted of of parkland, gardens and stables. The main residence had its walls hung with master works, paintings by Goya, Rubens, Raphael, Rembrandt, Hals, and Vel√°zquez. An avid participant in the hunting life, the Duke owned lodges reserved for the sport in Scotland and France (the Ch√¢teau Woolsack). According to his Times obituary (21 July 1953), \\"he was busy up to the day of his death in great schemes of afforestation in Cheshire, in the Lake District, and in Scotland.\\" For sea excursions, he had his choice of two yachts, Cutty Sark and Flying Cloud. For ground transportation he had 17 Rolls Royce automobiles and a private train built to facilitate travel from Eaton Hall directly into London, where his townhouse Grosvenor House was located. Grosvenor House was later leased to the United States for use as the American Embassy.Vaughan, Hal, Sleeping With The Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p.39-45 Early life and character Like many of his social class who were born to lives of privilege, the Duke was often occupied in the pursuit of pleasure. He was described as \\"a pure Victorian who had eyes for his shotgun, his hunters, his dogs ‚Ä¶ a man who enjoyed hiding diamonds under the pillow of his mistresses ‚Ä¶\\" He was also prompt to seek military service when war broke out, volunteering to fight as a front-line officer in both the Boer War and the First World War. As a nineteen year old, he briefly attended a French boarding school run by the Count de Mauny, who was rumoured to have made sexual advances towards some of its pupils. In later life the Duke was notable for being virulently opposed to such practices.  Military service  The Duke 1900 Lord Grosvenor had taken a commission with the Royal Horse Guards and was in South Africa serving in the Second Boer War, when in December 1899 he succeeded his grandfather. After a brief visit back home, he returned in February 1900 to serve with the Imperial Yeomanry, as an ADC to Lord Roberts and Lord Milner. Arriving in Cape Town, he was reported to leave that city for the front in early March. He resigned his commission in December 1901, and was appointed captain of the Cheshire (Earl of Chester¬¥s) Imperial Yeomanry the following month. The war ended in May 1902. He subsequently invested in land in South Africa and Rhodesia, and visited the colony with his wife in late 1902. In 1908, the Duke competed in the London Olympics as a motorboat racer for Great Britain. On 1 April 1908, he was named honorary lieutenant-colonel of the 16th Battalion, the London Regiment, a post he held until 1915. In the First World War the Duke volunteered for front-line combat and served with distinction, showing both initiative in battle and technical skill with motor-cars. Whilst attached to the Cheshire Yeomanry he developed a prototype Rolls-Royce Armoured Car for their use. During their 1916 campaign in Egypt, as part of the Western Frontier Force under General William Peyton, the Duke (then a major) commanded the armoured cars of the regiment and took part in the destruction of a Senussi force at the Action of Agagia on 26 February 1916. On 14 March 1916, he led the armoured cars on a daring raid against superior forces that destroyed the enemy camp at Bir Asiso. Learning that the crews of HMT Moorina and HMS Tara were being held in poor conditions at Bir Hakeim, he led the nine armoured cars‚Äîwith three armed but unarmoured cars and a further 28 cars and ambulances‚Äîon a dash across the desert to rescue them. Their Senussi captors attempted to run away but were gunned down by the enraged British rescuers. The prisoners attempted to stop the killings but failed. They had subsisted on little more than the snails in which the region abounded, but said their captors had not been overly cruel. However, the chief jailor responsible for the snail diet, a Moslem cleric nicknamed \\"Holy Joe\\", was hanged to general approval.Gwatkin-Williams, Capt. R., In the Hands of the Senussi p. 105‚Äì106 The Duke received the DSO for his exploits. He was subsequently promoted colonel and on 26 May 1917, he was named honorary colonel of the regiment.  Chanel  Westminster and Chanel In 1925, he was introduced to Gabrielle (\\"Coco\\") Chanel after a party in Monte Carlo and pursued her. He was as extravagant with her as he was with all of his lovers. He purchased a home for Chanel in London's prestigious Mayfair district, and in 1927 gave her a parcel of land on the French Riviera at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin where Chanel built her villa, La Pausa. His romantic liaison with Chanel lasted ten years.Vaughan, Hal, Sleeping With The Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 36-37 An illustration of both Westminster‚Äôs extravagance and orchestrated technique in the courting of women has endured in the form of various apocryphal stories. He purportedly concealed a huge uncut emerald at the bottom of a crate of vegetables delivered to Chanel. Disguised as a deliveryman, Westminster appeared at Chanel‚Äôs apartment with an enormous bouquet of flowers. His ruse was only uncovered after Chanel‚Äôs assistant offered ‚Äúthe delivery boy‚Äù a tip.  Political ideology  The 2nd Duke's portrait bust at St Mary's Church, Eccleston In 1931, the Duke, a Conservative, exposed his brother-in-law William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp (1872‚Äì1938) as a homosexual to the King and Queen. He reportedly hoped to ruin the Liberal Party through Beauchamp. The king was horrified, supposedly saying, \\"I thought men like that shot themselves.\\" During the run-up to the Second World War, he supported various right-wing and anti-Semitic causes, including the Right Club. \\"His anti-Semitic rants were notorious\\", according to a biographer of Coco Chanel.Vaughan, Hal, Sleeping With the Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 101. In her book The Light of the Common Day, Lady Diana Cooper reminisces back to 1 September 1939. She and her husband, the prominent Conservative Duff Cooper, were lunching at London's Savoy Grill with the Duke of Westminster. She recalls:http://www.spartacus- educational.com, retrieved 30 August 2012 The Duke, known for his pro-German sympathies, was reportedly instrumental in influencing his former mistress, Coco Chanel, to use her association with Winston Churchill to broker a bilateral peace agreement between the British and the Nazis.Vaughan, Hal, Sleeping With The Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 161. In late 1943 or early 1944, Chanel and her current lover, Nazi espionage agent Baron Hans Gunther von Dinklage, undertook such an assignment. Codenamed \\"Operation Modellhut\\", it was an attempt through the British Embassy in Madrid, via Chanel, to influence Churchill, and thereby persuade the British to negotiate a separate peace with Germany. This mission as planned ultimately met with failure, as Churchill had no interest.Vaughan, Hal, Sleeping With The Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 169‚Äì175. Marriages and issue The Duke's first wife, Constance Lewis in 1902 On 16 February 1901, the Duke married Constance Edwina (Shelagh) Cornwallis-West (1876‚Äì1970). They had three children: * Lady Ursula Mary Olivia Grosvenor (21 February 1902 ‚Äì 1978), married, firstly, William Patrick Filmer-Sankey in 1924 and was divorced in 1940. She married, secondly, Major Stephen Vernon in 1940. By her first husband she had two sons, Patrick (who married the film actress Josephine Griffin) and Christopher Filmer-Sankey, the younger dying in her lifetime. Her child by her second husband died young. Lady Ursula's descendants by her first husband are the sole descendants of the 2nd Duke. They reside in the UK, Australia and Sweden. * Edward George Hugh Grosvenor, Earl Grosvenor (1904‚Äì1909), who died aged 4, after an operation for appendicitis. * Lady Mary Constance Grosvenor (27 June 1910 ‚Äì 2000). On 26 November 1920, the Duke became the second husband of Violet Mary Nelson (1891‚Äì1983). They were divorced in 1926. Westminster married Loelia Mary Ponsonby (1902‚Äì1993) on 20 February 1930. The couple were unable to have childrenAnne Duchess of Westminster and divorced in 1947 after several years of separation.Lady Lindsay of Downhill He married Anne (Nancy) Winifred Sullivan (1915‚Äì2003) on 7 February 1947. She outlived him by fifty years. The Duke was known for multiple love affairs and spectacular presents. After Coco Chanel he was fascinated by the Brazilian Aim√©e de Heeren who was not interested in marrying him and to whom he gave significant jewellery, once part of the French Crown Jewels. Death and succession The Duke died of coronary thrombosis at Loch More Lodge on his Scottish estate in Sutherland in 1953, aged 74, and was buried in the churchyard of Eccleston Church near Eaton Hall, Cheshire. His large estate attracted then-record death duties of ¬£18m, which took between July 1953 and August 1964 to pay off to the Inland Revenue.This record was superseded by those charged on the estate of Sir John Ellerman, 2nd Baronet, who died in 1973. According to the National Archives currency converter, ¬£18m in 1955 (nearest year to his death) would be worth ¬£313,560,000 in 2005. He left two daughters. His titles and the entailed Westminster estate passed to his cousin, William Grosvenor, and thence to the two sons of his youngest half-uncle Lord Hugh Grosvenor (killed in action in 1914). The title is now held by Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster.

The poems date from a three hundred year period, with some dated as early as the late 6th century BCE. In the PƒÅli Canon, the Therigatha is classified as part of the Khuddaka Nikaya, the collection of short books in the Sutta Pitaka. It consists of 73 poems organized into 16 chapters. It is the companion text to the Theragatha, verses attributed to senior monks. It is the earliest known collection of women's literature composed in India.  Overview  The poems in Therigatha were composed orally in the Magadhi language and were passed on orally until about 80 B.C.E., when they were written down in Pali. It consists of 494 verses; while the summaries attribute these verses to 101 different nuns, only 73 identifiable speakers appear in the text. Like the Theragatha, it is organized into chapters that are loosely based on the number of verses in each poem. While each poem in the Theragatha has an identified speaker, several of the Therigatha texts are anonymous, or are connected with the story of a nun but not spoken to or by her‚Äîin one case, no nun seems to be present, but instead the verse is spoken by a woman trying to talk her husband out of becoming a monk. More so than the Theragatha, there seems to have been uncertainty between different recensions about which verses were attributable to which nuns‚Äîsome verses appear in the Apadana attributed to different speakers. Longer poems later in the collection appear in the Arya metre, abandoned relatively early in Pali literature, but include other features indicative of later composition, including explanations of karmic connections more typical of later texts like the Petavatthu and Apadana. A section of the Paramathadippani, a commentary attributed to Dhammapala, provides details about the Therigatha. Significance Despite small size, the Therigatha is a very significant document in the study of early Buddhism as well as the earliest-known collection of women's literature. The Therigatha contains a passages reaffirming the view that women are the equal of men in terms of spiritual attainment as well as verses that address issues of particular interest to women in ancient South Asian society. Included in the Therigatha are the verses of a mother whose child has died (Thig VI.1 and VI.2), a former sex worker who became a nun (Thig V.2), a wealthy heiress who abandoned her life of pleasure (Thig VI.5) and even verses by the Buddha's own aunt and stepmother, Mahapajapati Gotami (Thig VI.6). An additional collection of scriptures concerning the role and abilities of women in the early Sangha is found in the fifth division of the Samyutta Nikaya, known as the Bhikkhunƒ´- Sa·πÉyutta \\"Nun's discourse\\". A number of the nuns whose verses are found in the Therigatha also have verses in the book of the Khuddaka Nikaya known as the ApadƒÅna, often called the Biographical Stories in English. The majority of these have been translated into the English language. Translations * Psalms of the Sisters, tr C. A. F.

It is situated on the north side of the River Aln, about two miles (3 km) east by north from Whittingham, and miles west from Alnwick.E. Mackenzie, An historical, topographical, and descriptive view of the county of Northumberland, Volume II, Newcastle, 1825, page 37. It has a chapel and a small number of residential properties.  History  Bolton is an ancient Northumbrian village. An early record is of the establishment of a hospital, founded by Robert de Ros, Baron of Wark, before the year 1225, to support a master and three chaplains, thirteen leprous men, and other lay-brethren, dedicated to St. Thomas the Martyr, or the Holy Trinity; subordinate to the abbey of Ryeval, and the priory of Kirkham, in Yorkshire. de Ros richly endowed the hospital with the villa, lordship, impropriation, and advowson of Bolton, and a waste of ; a corn-mill and a tenement at Mindrum; lands at Paston, and at Kilham. He also gave it the villa, manor, impropriation, and advowson of Straunston, and his estates of the Pauntons within that lordship, near Grantham, in Lincolnshire; and also an estate at Elwell, in Swanesland, in Yorkshire, with pasturage for 300 sheep, near the river Humber; a corn-mill and a tenement at Middleton, near Dalton; and lands at Garton; both in the county of York. The master, chaplains, and brethren of the hospital, were to keep a good table, dress neatly, and provide themselves with proper necessaries and conveniences out of their annual revenues, and apply the remainder to the relief of the poor, and helpless strangers. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1536 and 1541, it came, with the manor and villa, into the possession of the Collingwoods of Eslington. It belonged to Sir Cuthbert Collingwood; and to Robert Collingwood. By 1702, it was the seat and manor of William Brown, High Sheriff of Northumberland in that year; and of Nicholas Brown, high sheriff of Northumberland, 1748; and afterwards of his son-in-law, Matthew Forster a younger branch of the house of Etherstone, and who was high sheriff of Northumberland in 1765. Bolton came next into the possession of the co-heiress of his late widow, Mrs. Forster, daughter of Nicholas Brown, Esq. above-mentioned. Before the battle of Flodden, Sir Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, was at this village, on Monday, 5 September 1513; where all the noblemen and gentlemen met him with their retinues, to the number of 26,000 men, among whom were Lords Clifford, Coniers, Ogle, Scroope, and Lumley, Sir William Percy, Lionel Percy, Sir George Darcy, Sir William Bulmer, of Brancepeth Castle, in the county of Durham, and Richard Tempest. The population of the 'township' of Bolton is given in an 1827/8 gazetteer as 115 in 1801; 130 in 1811; and 144 people in 1821, divided into 27 families living in 27 houses. The annual value of the township is specified as ¬£1,707. In 1951 the civil parish had a population of 79. On 1 April 1955 the civil parish was merged into Hedgeley.  Governance  Bolton is in the parliamentary constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed.

R. R. Tolkien. Published in 2000 by Kosmos in Germany, Wizards of the Coast in the U.S., and Parker Brothers in the U.K., the game is designed by Reiner Knizia and features artwork by illustrator John Howe. It won a Spiel des Jahres special award for best use of literature in a game and in 2004 it won the Games Magazine Games 100 Honor in the Family Strategy category. A slightly revised version was later published by Fantasy Flight Games. The board game was highly unusual when it was published, because it is a cooperative board game -- each player plays a hobbit in the party, and the party will succeed or fail as a group to destroy the One Ring, thus winning or losing the game. Game play Game play is centered on advancement through a series of scenarios corresponding to the adventures of the books. Players turn tiles and play cards in order to move forward, and collect and spend tokens to avoid advancement toward the Dark Lord Sauron. In dire situations, tokens may be spent to call for the assistance of Gandalf, or the One Ring may be used to speed advancement at the cost of moving closer toward Sauron. On the master board there are three locations: Bag End, Rivendell, and Lothl√≥rien. The game starts at Bag End and each player draws a card identifying the player's Hobbit character, each of which has a special ability. Each player is dealt cards that allow him to complete four different activities: traveling, hiding, friendship or fighting. One hobbit is initially assigned to be the \\"ring bearer\\", but a new hobbit may become the ring bearer after each scenario is completed. The journey through the game calls for jumping back and forth between the main board and the other four boards. Players advance through locations such as Rivendell, Lothl√≥rien, Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor; all while trying to stay away from the dark lord Sauron. Players are eliminated if they are on the same space as Sauron or are behind him. The game concludes when the fellowship reaches Mount Doom and destroys the Ring, the ring bearer is eliminated, or if the Fellowship reaches Mount Doom yet all players are eliminated before the Ring is destroyed. Players need to cooperate and work together in order to beat this game. Players must display strategy and have a little luck. Knowledge of The Lord of the Rings plot isn‚Äôt needed to play the game, yet might help in some situations. Expansion packs Three expansions currently exist, the Friends & Foes Expansion (adds two scenario boards and a deck with 30 foes), Sauron Expansion, in which one player takes the role of Sauron and plays against all others, and Battlefields (adds six additional battlefiels and five more members of the Fellowship). Limited Edition The game was also released in a \\"Limited Edition\\" version, limited to 250 German and 500 English copies. The set features a box signed by game designer Knizia and illustrator Howe, as well as an art print limited to 750 copies, created and signed by Howe. The game board and pieces are identical to the standard version, with the exception of pewter hobbit character pieces and a 22-kt. gold One Ring. List price for this version was approximately $300 US. Other Tolkien-based games More than twenty Tolkien-games have been published since 1970, when the board game \\"Conquest of The Ring\\" was first released by gaming company Hobbit Toy and Games. A full and updated list of the games can apparently be found on the enthusiast website \\"Tolkien Boardgames\\" mentioned below. Reception Teeuwynn Woodruff comments: \\"Where Reiner Knizia's Lord of the Rings board game delivers brilliantly is in conveying this all-important feeling of fellowship through every aspect of its design. In order to beat the game, players must talk to each other, work together, and one or more Hobbits may have to sacrifice themselves so that the Ring-bearer can get to Mount Doom and destroy his dangerous burden. When your group manages to achieve this lofty goal, it's a victory for all.

It is home to RAF Boulmer. Boulmer has an independent volunteer lifeboat station. Origin of the name The name Boulmer, pronounced \\"Boomer\\", is a derivation of Bulemer, from the old English bulan-mere (bulls mere). History Boulmer was notorious for its smuggling activities, much of which was centred on the Fishing Boat Inn. In the 18th century, one of the most well-known smugglers, King of the Gypsies William Faa, lived some 35 miles away in the remote Scottish village of Kirk Yetholm. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the village was the smuggling capital of Northumberland. A major change was the arrival of the Royal Air Force in World War 2. Otherwise, Boulmer has changed little in over 100 years and is one of the few true traditional fishing villages left on the Northumberland coast. Today The village consists of a row of cottages and the pub. Set within a natural haven, in a gap through an almost complete band of rock, Boulmer has no harbour. =Fishing= Hauled-up fishing boat and lobster pots Traditional blue fishing cobles are hauled ashore or moored in the water. The main catch is crab, lobster and sea salmon. =Boulmer Volunteer Rescue Service= Boulmer Volunteer Rescue Service was originally funded by the Duke of Northumberland and was run by the RNLI between 1825 and 1967 when the RNLI decided to withdraw the service. Re-established in 1967 when the community decided to buy their own private boat, it is now an independent lifeboat service, but currently only operates during daylight hours, weekends and on bank holidays due to a small crew and limited sea-traffic. =Filming location= In the spring and summer of 2004, much of the filming for the ITV comedy-drama series Distant Shores was carried out at various locations along the Northumberland coast. Boulmer is featured in many scenes, including \\"Hildasay\\" Ferry and various settings depicted both inside and outside the cottages, including the beach and sand dunes, and the nearby countryside where the fictional new doctor's surgery was built.

In 1922 he moved to Munich and continued his studies. He returned to Statistics Norway in 1923 and received his doctorate in 1925 with a dissertation on the sex proportion at birth and infant mortality.

In 1930 Wedervang was among the sixteen founding members of the Econometric Society. As a professor Wedervang lectured on applied economics, social and economic statistics, and demography. Wedervang belonged firmly to the school of empirically oriented Norwegian economists in the tradition of Anton Martin Schweigaard. His work in the 1920s comprised an estimate of national income in Norway and some articles on trade problems. Wedervang did not publish in German or English and was therefore hardly known outside Scandinavia. Professor Wedervang worked also actively for the establishment of the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen and served as the school's first rector from 1936 to 31 December 1956.

A date of around 1516 has been established by means of dendrochronological research. The central panel, signed \\"Jheronimus Bosch\\", measures 135 by 200 centimeters and the wings measure 147 √ó 66 cm. The outside shutters feature a version of Bosch's The Wayfarer. History The painting was part of a group of six acquired by King Philip II of Spain in 1570, and shipped to El Escorial four years later. It was later sold to the Marquis of Salamanca, and divided into three paintings. In 1848, the central panel was bought by Isabella II of Spain and brought to Aranjuez, the right one was returned to Escorial and the left went to the Prado. The triptych was finally recomposed in 1914 in the latter museum. A copy exists at the Escorial. The closed triptych Description =Shutters= The exterior of the shutters, like most contemporary Netherlandish triptychs, were also painted, although in this case Bosch used full colors instead of the usual grisaille. When closed, they form a single scene depicting a wayfarer. Around him is a series of miniatures including the robbery of another wayfarer and a hanged man. The man uses a stick to repel a dog. According to the most recent interpretations, this figure may represent the man who follows his road in spite of the temptation of sins (such as lust, perhaps symbolized by the two dancing shepherds) and the evil acts occurring around him. =Main panels= The Haywain triptych follows a similar narrative to The Garden of Earthly Delights. The left panel shows God giving form to Eve. Unlike the Garden, though, a narrative sequence flows through the panel in different scenes. At the top, the rebel angels are cast out of Heaven while God sits enthroned, the angels turning into insects as they break through the clouds. Below this, God creates Eve from the rib of Adam. Next, Adam and Eve find the serpent and the tree; the serpent offers them an apple. Finally, at the lowest part of the panel, the angel forces the two out of the Garden of Eden. Adam speaks with the angel; Eve, in a melancholic pose, looks ahead to the right. The central panel features a large wagon of hay surrounded by a multitude of fools engaged in a variety of sins, quite apart from the sins of lust which dominates the Garden of Earthly Delights. In the center panel Bosch shows Christ in the sky, not paralleled in the Garden. An angel on top of the wagon looks to the sky, praying, but none of the other figures see Christ looking down on the world. The rightward bow of the figures around the wagon provides the force for the viewer's eye to move with them on their journey and the cart is drawn by infernal beings which drag everyone to Hell, depicted on the right panel. The forward kinetic motion of the participants moves the viewer from present-day sin into unadulterated torture in the realms of Hell. The procession on the left side of this panel bends back into the middle ground, but the right side figures continue in a straight line with the wagon, a more evident progress into damnation. Painting materials The triptych was thoroughly investigated by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation ProjectThe Bosch Research and Conservation Project with the results published in book form. Bosch's palette was rather limited with pigments including azurite, lead-tin yellow, vermilion and ochres.Hieronymus Bosch, The Haywain Triptych, ColourLex References External links *The Haywain Triptych at El Escorial *Hieronymus Bosch, The Haywain Triptych, ColourLex Category:Paintings by Hieronymus Bosch in the Museo del Prado Category:Paintings depicting Jesus Category:Triptychs Category:1516 paintings Category:Paintings depicting Adam and Eve Category:Angels in art Category:Farming in art Category:Horses in art Category:Insects in art Category:Snakes in art Category:Dogs in art ","title":"The Haywain Triptych"},{"id":"2364635","title":"The Last Dance (Steps album)"},{"id":"2364644","title":"Aztecas UDLAP"},{"id":"2364651","text":"Judith Irene Bailey (n√©e Hege; born August 24, 1946)Who's Who in America (2000). 54th edition, Marquis. is an American academic who served as president of Northern Michigan University (1997‚Äì2003) and Western Michigan University (2003‚Äì2006).

KCYZ airs a Hot AC music format branded as \\"Now 105.1\\". KCYZ is owned by iHeartMedia and licensed to Citicaster Licenses LP. Its studios are located on Main Street in Ames, while its transmitter is located just north of Ames on West 190th Street. History Prior to the switch to Alternative rock, the station was known as \\"Hot 105 KCCQ\\" with a Top 40/CHR format. Many years in the 1990s, KCCQ was the only contemporary hit radio station broadcasting in central Iowa, including the Des Moines metro area. Much of the history of KCCQ prior to 1990 is unknown. Since it signed on in 1968, KCCQ had several contemporary format incarnations throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The signal in Des Moines itself was relatively weak prior to 1998 when the station moved frequencies to 105.1 from 107.1 and the wattage was increased. Much of the time the station occupied 107.1, listeners in Des Moines and other parts of the southern fringe of KCCQ's coverage area could often hear interference from KJJC of Osceola, which was broadcasting at 106.9 with higher wattage than KCCQ. Previous to 1998, the station only targeted the Ames, Iowa area and was known as \\"Hot 107 KCCQ\\" and before that \\"107 KCCQ Ames' Hot FM\\". Ames Broadcasting Company owned KCCQ along with KASI in Ames, and KIKD-FM in Lake City until 1999 when KASI and KCCQ were sold to Jacor, which, at the time recently merged with Clear Channel Communications. After the purchase by Clear Channel, the company swapped KCCQ's CHR format with the alternative rock format of new sister station KKDM. KCCQ was then known as \\"Channel Q\\". The station also boosted its broadcast power to cover more of central Iowa, though it still only provides grade B coverage to Des Moines itself. In August 2010, KCCQ rebranded as \\"New Rock 105.1\\". On December 26, 2013, at Midnight, KCCQ swapped formats with sister station KPTL and began broadcasting a Hot AC format, while its alternative rock format moved to 106.3. On April 4, 2014, KCCQ changed their call letters to KCYZ. Clear Channel would also change their name on September 16, 2014, renaming themselves iHeartMedia.

Norman origins The origin of the name is Norman.C.P Lewis, Mortimer Roger (I) de (fl. 1054-c.1080) in Oxford Dictionary Of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2004. One version is that it derives from \\"Mortemer\\", site of the Cistercian L'Abbaye de Mortemer at Lisors near Lyons-la-For√™t and close to Rouen in Normandy. The land was granted to the Cistercians by Henry II of England in the 1180s. Finding the land to be a marshland area of the Lyons Forest around the running Fouillebroc stream, the monks dug out a large drainage lake and built the Abbaye de Mortemer. The ruins and lake can still be visited, and the later 16th century abbey hosts tours. According to Fran√ßois de Beaurepaire, > \\"There are two possible explanations: first, a small pond must have already > existed before the land was given to the monks and have already been called > Mortemer like the two other Mortemers, because the word mer 'pond' was not > used anymore beyond the Xth century. This word is only attested in North- > Western France and of Frankish or Saxon origin mari / meri 'mere', 'lake' > (in Cambremer, Blingemer, etc..); mort(e) 'dead' is also quite common to > mean 'stagnant' (in Port-Mort 'the port with stagnant water', Morteau 'dead > water', etc.).Fran√ßois de Beaurepaire, Les noms des communes et anciennes > paroisses de la Seine-Maritime, √©ditions Picard 1979. . Second, the monks > could have given the name Mortemer to their drainage lake to remember the > other Mortemer for any kind of reason we don't know, making a pun at the > same time with Mer Morte 'Dead Sea'.\\" The village of Mortemer, further north in the Seine-Maritime area, bears the same name and predates the abbey at Lisors by more than one hundred years. Another version, which appears at least as far back the Elizabethan era, (see, for instance, Edward II by Christopher Marlowe, Scene 7 Line 21ff) attributes the name to a Norman knight who fought in the Crusades and was distinguished in battle by the shores of the Dead Sea (Mer Morte in French), but this is unsubstantiated and almost certainly a romanticised myth. Medieval magnates Arms of Mortimer: Barry or and azure, on a chief of the first two pallets between two base esquires of the second over all an inescutcheon argent In the Middle Ages, the Mortimers were a powerful magnate family or dynasty of Marcher Lords in the Welsh Marches, centered on Wigmore Castle in Herefordshire, and from the 14th century holding the title of Earl of March.

Topley was noted for his portraiture of Canadian politicians, and was a business partner of William Notman, taking over Notman's Ottawa studio in 1872. A large number of photographs by Topley are now in the collection of Library and Archives Canada, including approximately 150,000 glass plates negatives and a set of 66 index albums covering the entire history of his Ottawa studios from 1868 until 1923. William James Topley was born in 1845 in Montreal, and raised in Aylmer, a town just outside Ottawa in modern-day Quebec. His first exposure to photography was from his mother, who purchased a camera in Montreal in the late 1850s. In 1863, at the age of 18, Topley was listed as an itinerant photographer, but by 1864 he was working at apprentice wages for William Notman in Montreal. In 1867, the year of Canada's confederation, when Topley was only 22 years old, he was placed in charge of a new portrait studio opened by Notman (his first outside of Montreal) on Wellington Street in Ottawa in a new purpose-built structure across from the new Parliament buildings. Topley clearly had very good business sense, becoming the \\"proprietor\\" of the Notman studio by 1872, and by 1875 opening a studio under his own name. King McCord Arnoldi (architect) designed the studio and residence on Metcalfe Street at Queen Street in 1875.King McCord Arnoldi William James Topley was a member of the Camera Club of Ottawa (established in 1894), he joined the club in 1898 and remained an active member until 1921. His stature within the photographic community shaped the Camera Club of Ottawa, and the club remains active to this time. After building this rather overstated studio in 1876 he soon found that he had to abandon it and move to smaller quarters on Sparks St., where he and later his son continued to operate the Topley studio until they sold it in 1923. The studio attracted many political figures, including all the Prime Ministers from Sir John A. Macdonald to Mackenzie King. The studio also attracted the wives and daughters of nobility, political and business figures, Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll), The Countess of Aberdeen, Mrs. Robert Laird Borden, Mrs. Louis Philippe Brodeur, Mrs. Brown Chamberlin, Mrs. Louis Henry Davies, Lady Eileen Nina Evelyn Sibell Elliot, Mrs John Peter Featherston, Mrs. William Stevens Fielding, Mrs. Edward Griffin, Mrs. Joseph Howe. He catered to the well-to-do‚Äîas he himself said \\"If I can see beauty in the human face, and reproduce it, I can command three times the reward for my work than he who simply shoots a plate at his patron. True, in a small city, such a course limits trade, but one-half of the business with three times the prices is much better for mind and body and pocketbook.\\" References External links  William Topley: Exposure on Ottawa (39 minute podcast) at Library and Archives of Canada * Camera Club of Ottawa, 75 Years of Photography, published 1970 * Topley Studi fonds (R629) at Library and Archives Canada Category:1845 births Category:1931 deaths Category:Canadian photographers Category:Artists from Montreal ","title":"William James Topley"},{"id":"2364684","text":"\\"First Impressions\\" is the third episode of season 2 in the television show Angel. Written by Shawn Ryan and directed by James A. Contner, it was originally broadcast on October 10, 2000 on the WB television network. Plot synopsis After talking with the host at the demon bar about his future, Angel walks out and encounters Darla. The two dance and talk before they kiss passionately. Angel then awakens, shaken by the disturbing dream. While Angel sleeps late, Cordelia and Wesley clean and organize their new office. Gunn arrives at the hotel, expecting Angel to be awake and able to help him. When Angel finally wakes up, David Nabbit is there to offer financial advice in regards to Angel's investment in the hotel. The whole gang and Gunn meet up with a man named Jameel in order to get information about a demon named Deevak. Gunn gets violent when Jameel won't talk, but the interruption of a pack of vampires prevents Gunn from getting answers. After dusting the three vampires with quite a bit of effort, everyone complains about their injuries. After dropping Angel off at the hotel and returning home, Cordelia gets a vision of Gunn in danger. When Wesley and Angel both aren't available to help, Cordelia takes it upon herself to save Gunn. Angel enjoys happy dreams of being with Darla until Wesley arrives and interrupts. Cordelia mistakenly attacks one of Gunn's friends, Joey, when she thinks that Joey is attacking Gunn. Gunn walks Cordelia to the car, but it turns out that Angel's car has been stolen. Without a car, Angel is forced to ride on Wesley's motorcycle, wearing a pink helmet in order to help save Gunn. With Cordelia at his side, Gunn tracks down Desmond, who stole Angel's car. Before he can get information on the car's whereabouts, a huge pack of vampires attack the party. Gunn fends off most of them, but one of Gunn's close friends, Veronica, is cut badly by a piece of broken glass. Gunn reacts badly to the fact that Veronica nearly died, especially because he can't forget his sister's death. Angel and Wesley arrive in time to witness the aftermath of the party, but find the location of Deevak through one of the surviving vampires at the party. After finally finding Angel's car, Gunn also finds Deevak. Holding Gunn by the throat and Cordelia by the arm, Deevak turns into Jameel. After Cordelia sprays Jameel with mace, he lets go of Cordelia and Gunn long enough to revert to his ugly, demonic form. Angel and Wesley arrive to help and Angel finally kills Deevak with an ax. Cordelia warns Gunn that he, not Deevak, was the danger she saw in her vision - he is putting himself in danger recklessly. She intends to help prevent him from destroying himself. Angel dreams that he returns to the hotel and Darla is there to comfort him. As he sleeps and dreams of his romantic encounters with his sire, Darla climbs over Angel in bed and kisses him.

Early life  Bristow was born in Marion, South Carolina in 1903 to Baptist minister Louis Judson Bristow and Caroline Cornelia Winkler. Bristow became interested in writing while reporting junior high school functions for her local newspaper.  Education  Bristow attended Anderson Baptist College in Anderson, South Carolina, for one year before transferring to Judson College in Marion, Alabama. Bristow disliked the strict rules that Judson imposed on its all-women student population. Students were required to wear uniforms, and they were forbidden from speaking with men or boys during visits downtown. Bristow directed and acted in two plays at Judson, playing the roles of men in both. Bristow was voted \\"Most Original\\" in her junior class in 1923. Bristow graduated from Judson College in 1924 with degrees in English and French. Bristow's parents moved to New Orleans in February of that year. After college, Bristow set her sights on studying journalism at the Pulitzer School of Journalism at Columbia University. Bristow's parents were unable to support her financially, so Bristow earned money by writing essays for other people, saving enough to purchase the typewriter required for school. Bristow also won a $90 scholarship from Columbia to cover her first semester. While attending Columbia, Bristow continued to support herself by writing papers for others, working as a nursemaid, typing theses, writing biographies of businessmen for trade journals, and working as a secretary to a Polish baroness on Riverside Drive. After one year at Columbia Bristow took a summer job with The Times-Picayune in New Orleans. The newspaper offered Bristow a permanent position, and Bristow accepted. She did not return to Columbia. Bristow kept a journal during her time at Columbia that she later destroyed, observing that she had been a \\"shrewd and remarkably accurate reporter\\" of her classmates' \\"foibles,\\" and \\"this stuff should not be lying around.\\" \\"And of course, there was a lot of unintended self-revelation.\\"  Early career  Bristow initially lived with her parents in New Orleans at 4501 Magnolia on the grounds of Southern Baptist Hospital, where Bristow's father had become superintendent. When women in the United States were granted the right to vote by constitutional amendment in 1920, Bristow immediately registered. Bristow covered the great flood of 1927 for the newspaper and social issues that touched on gender equality, such as the insistence by some brides that \\"obey\\" be left out of the marriage ceremony. During a later stint at the paper, Bristow covered the Huey Long assassination. Bristow wrote a letter describing her life as a reporter: > I do regular reporting, which means interviewing convicts, getting > descriptions of runaway girls, covering luncheons, writing obituaries of > famous citizens and talking to famous actors who come to town. I have met > more funny people than I ever knew existed. At the same time, Bristow was writing poetry, and she published a volume titled The Alien and Other Poems in 1926. Bristow met another journalist, Bruce Manning, while covering a murder trial, and the pair began to date. They eloped on January 14, 1929, marrying in a civil ceremony in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. The elopement was intended to avoid objections from Bristow's family to Manning's religion; Bristow was a Baptist, and Manning, a Catholic. The couple lived in a French Quarter apartment at 627 Ursuline Street.  First publications  Bristow published her first novel, The Invisible Host, in 1930. The mystery novel was co-written with Manning. The novel was a success and was adapted into a Broadway play called The Ninth Guest in 1931. Bristow resigned her job with The Times-Picayune. The couple collaborated again on The Gutenberg Murders in 1931. With their newfound success, Bristow and Manning moved to a mansion in the Mississippi Gulfport area. But the couple was not immune to the Depression that swept the United States. Bristow later wrote: \\"We were having a wonderful literary life on the coast and in the city when the Depression, which I had heard of but ignored, swooped down upon us and sent us scurrying for shelter.\\" Bristow asked to be rehired at her old job, and in February 1932 she returned to The Times-Picayune.  Move to Hollywood and literary success  RKO Pictures bought the film rights to The Ninth Guest in 1933 and asked Bristow and Manning to write the script. The couple moved to Hollywood and lived briefly at 8231 Fountain Avenue. In 1934 Manning published a solo novel, Party Wire, and sold the film rights. Bristow had also written several novels on her own, but they were rejected by publishers. Bristow destroyed the manuscripts. Bristow persevered, and in California began writing what would become her Louisiana plantation novels. Deep Summer (1937), The Handsome Road (1938), and This Side of Glory (1940) are historical novels that follow two Louisiana families over the course of several generations. These novels established Bristow as a popular writer of historical fiction. Bristow's fame grew, and Manning also enjoyed rising popularity as a director and producer. They befriended Joe Pasternak, Ray Bradbury, Irving Stone, and scriptwriters Pauline and Leo Townsend. Bristow's next hit was Jubilee Trail (1950) which she wrote over seven years. The novel is set against the backdrop of westward expansion in the 1840s. The protagonist Garnet Hale joins a wagon train bound for California, and the novel offers a fictionalized account of the early Santa Fe trail pioneers. Jubilee Trail was on several bestseller lists for months. A film version, which premiered at the Saenger Theater on Canal Street in New Orleans, was also successful. By 1950, the couple lived in the San Fernando Valley. There, Bristow wrote Celia Garth (1959). She continued to write novels and articles for magazines until her death in 1980.  Health  Bristow drank alcohol frequently and at times to excess, and smoked cigarettes. She also followed a careful regimen of one hour's daily exercise spent walking, swimming, or bicycling. Bristow stood 5 feet 4 inches tall. Bristow had plastic surgery in 1937 to affix her ears more closely to her head and had her lashes and eyebrows dyed regularly. In 1946, Bristow's doctor advised her to stop smoking, and recommended a tonsillectomy. Bristow stopped smoking briefly, but it was not permanent. Manning died in 1965 after illness and depression. In 1980, Bristow was diagnosed with lung cancer. She died on August 17, 1980.  Treatment of race and slavery in work  Bristow's historical novels, set in the southern United States, included slavery and racial discrimination. According to critics, Bristow took no position on the issue of slavery; Billie Theriot wrote that Bristow did \\"not deny atrocities,\\" like the sexual exploitation of slaves, and wove the existence of such atrocities into her stories.  Legacy  Bristow was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1989. Her archives are held at the Oviatt Library at California State University, Northridge.

It was founded in 1977 and was initially known as the Kansai Gaidai Hawaii College, and the name was changed to TransPacific Hawaii College in 1998. The College closed its operation at the end of December 2008. The closure was a direct result of the College's accreditation body's (Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges) dissatisfaction with the College's financial structure that relied the majority of its operating costs on its tuition income. The accreditation agency's financial concern resulted in a Show-Cause status, and the College decided to cease the operation. The college was initially accredited on January 1, 1985 and the accreditation remained till the closure of the college (According to the accreditation agency, the accreditation was terminated effective on April 3, 2009 on which day the college was no longer existent). Students' academic records are now kept by the Kansai Gaidai University's Center for International Education. The transcript request form is available online. The College conferred solely the Associate in Liberal Arts Degree. The typical enrollment of the College was 250, all international students mainly coming from Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand.  Campus  The campus of the College was located in a residential community of Aina Haina district. The land, which was approx. , faced the eastern coast line of the island. There was a complex of four main buildings and it housed twenty classrooms, administrative offices, professors' offices, three computer labs, one learning resource lab, a student service center, and a library.

He was created Marquess of Westminster in 1831. He was an English Member of Parliament (MP) and an ancestor of the modern-day Dukes of Westminster. Grosvenor continued to develop the family's London estates, he rebuilt their country house, Eaton Hall in Cheshire where he also restored the gardens, and built a new London home, Grosvenor House. He maintained and extended the family interests in the acquisition of works of art, and in horse racing and breeding racehorses. Personal life Robert Grosvenor was born on 22 March 1767 in the parish of St George Hanover Square, London. He was the third son and the only surviving child of Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor, and was initially known as Viscount Belgrave. He was educated at Westminster School, Harrow School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1786. In addition to his formal education, William Gifford acted as his private tutor.Tedder, H. R., rev. H. C. G. Matthew (2004) 'Grosvenor, Robert, first marquess of Westminster (1767‚Äì1845)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Retrieved on 12 April 2010. Gifford accompanied Grosvenor when the latter undertook his Grand Tour between 1786 and 1788. Gifford described him as a \\"most amiable\\" and \\"accomplished\\" pupil. On 28 April 1794 Grosvenor married Eleanor, the only child of Sir Thomas Egerton (later the 1st Earl Wilton). They had four children; in 1795 Richard, Lord Belgrave, who succeeded his father; in 1799 Thomas, who became the 2nd Earl of Wilton on the death of his grandfather; in 1801 Robert, later the 1st Baron Ebury; and finally a daughter, Amelia, who died in her early teenage years. Political and public life Grosvenor was elected as MP for East Looe in 1788 and served this constituency until 1790; during this time he was appointed a Lord of the Admiralty. His first speech in the House of Commons of Great Britain contained a quotation from the ancient Greek orator Demosthenes, which led to the satirist Peter Pindar calling him \\"the lord of Greek\\". In 1790 he was elected as MP for Chester and continued to serve in this seat until 1802. Between 1793 and 1801 he was a commissioner of the Board of Control. He raised a regiment of volunteers from the city of Westminster to fight against France and in 1798 was appointed its major- commandant. When his father died on 5 August 1802 he became the 2nd Earl Grosvenor. Grosvenor was Mayor of Chester in 1807‚Äì08, and was responsible for the building of Thomas Harrison's Northgate in the city in 1810. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Flintshire from 1798 to 1845. When Grosvenor entered parliament, he continued the family tradition of being a Tory and supporting William Pitt the Younger. However, after Pitt's death in 1806, he changed his allegiance and became a Whig. This led to his support for the victims of the Peterloo massacre, for Catholic Emancipation, for the abolition of the Corn Laws, and his voting for the Reform Bill. He was a man of principle; he championed Queen Caroline and is reputed to have thrown either a Bible or a Prayer Book at the head of King George IV. And when the Duke of Wellington was presented with the freedom of the city of Chester, Grosvenor refused to allow the town hall to be used for the event. The relations between Grosvenor and the king later improved, and in the coronation honours of 1831 he was created Marquess of Westminster. He participated in the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1837. On 11 March 1841 he was received as a Knight of the Garter. Development of the estate Porden's Eaton Hall Soon after Robert Grosvenor inherited the Eaton estate, he rebuilt the country house at Eaton Hall in Cheshire, and he also developed the London estate, creating the areas now known as Belgravia and Pimlico. Eaton had become \\"an unfashionable and run-down estate\\". The existing country house had been built for his grandfather, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet and designed by William Samwell. He appointed William Porden as architect, who had previously surveyed his London estate. The original plan was for the new house to cost ¬£10,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ), and for it to take two years to build. In the event it took just under ten years and cost over ¬£100,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). The previous house was encased and surrounded by \\"every possible permutation of the gothic style\\". It included turrets, pinnacles, arched windows, octagonal towers, and buttresses (both regular and flying). Four new wings were added to the house. When the future Queen Victoria visited in 1832 at the age of 13, she wrote in her journal: \\"The house is magnificent\\". However others described it as being \\"as extravagant and opulent as the very latest upholsterer-decorators could make it\\". It was described as \\"the most gaudy concern I ever saw\\" and \\"a vast pile of mongrel gothic which ... is a monument of wealth, ignorance and bad taste\\". To restore the gardens and grounds, Grosvenor employed John Webb, a pupil of William Emes, who had been the previous designer of the landscaping around the house. New terrace walls were created on the east side of the house. Belgrave Avenue, the approach to the house from the west, was levelled and drained, and 130,000 trees were planted along it. The paths along the approach, which was long, were made between and wide, so that they would be suitable for the use of carriages. On the east side of the house a serpentine lake was created on the near side of the River Dee. By the 1820s formal garden beds were becoming fashionable and William Andrews Nesfield was employed to design formal parterres around the house. He added more terracing, balustraded walls, and flower beds surrounded by box edging. Grosvenor House, showing the new entrance For the London estate, Grosvenor created a \\"fashionable new residential quarter\\" near Buckingham House (later Buckingham Palace). He appointed Thomas Cundy as architect and surveyor, and Thomas Cubitt as builder. The entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states: \\"This urban development was to make the Grosvenors one of the richest families in Britain\\". He also bought more property in Cheshire, and elsewhere at Shaftesbury in Dorset, and Stockbridge in Hampshire. The family's London house had been in Millbank, but in 1806 Grosvenor bought a house in Upper Grosvenor Street and greatly extended it; this was to become Grosvenor House. He added an art gallery to the Park Lane side of the house in 1827, and in 1843 built a new entrance in Upper Grosvenor Street consisting of a Doric screen between large pedimented gateways that separated a cour d'honneur from the street in the Parisian manner. Personal interests Grosvenor continued the family's interests in art and horse racing. He added to the art collection; his acquisitions included four paintings by Rubens for which he paid ¬£10,000, and he paid ¬£100 for Gainsborough's The Blue Boy. To develop the facilities for horse racing, he expanded the Eaton Stud. The finest horse produced by the stud during Grosvenor's time was Touchstone. This horse won 16 of the 21 races for which it was entered, including the St Leger, and on two occasions, the Ascot Gold Cup and the Doncaster Cup. After retirement, the horse sired 323 winners of over 700 races. Death St Mary's Church, Eccleston - The enclosure which marks the site of the Grosvenor family vault within the demolished old church St Mary's Church, Eccleston - The tablet in the new church which lists the Grosvenors buried in the demolished old church Grosvenor died at Eaton Hall on 17 February 1845 and was buried in the family vault at St Mary's Church, Eccleston. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster. In 1998 a statue of Grosvenor, by Jonathan Wylder, was erected in Belgrave Square, London. On the statue is a quotation by Ruskin that reads \\"When we build let us think we build for ever\\".

A 2014 image of product shortages in Venezuela. In economics, a shortage or excess demand is a situation in which the demand for a product or service exceeds its supply in a market. It is the opposite of an excess supply (surplus).  Definitions  In a perfect market (one that matches a simple microeconomic model), an excess of demand will prompt sellers to increase prices until demand at that price matches the available supply, establishing market equilibriumTucker (2014) Economics Today. In economic terminology, a shortage occurs when for some reason (such as government intervention, or decisions by sellers not to raise prices) the price does not rise to reach equilibrium. In this circumstance, buyers want to purchase more at the market price than the quantity of the good or service that is available, and some non-price mechanism (such as \\"first come, first served\\" or a lottery) determines which buyers are served. So in a perfect market the only thing that can cause a shortage is price. In common use, the term \\"shortage\\" may refer to a situation where most people are unable to find a desired good at an affordable price, especially where supply problems have increased the price. \\"Market clearing\\" happens when all buyers and sellers willing to transact at the prevailing price are able to find partners. There are almost always willing buyers at a lower-than-market-clearing price; the narrower technical definition doesn't consider failure to serve this demand as a \\"shortage\\", even if it would be described that way in a social or political context (which the simple model of supply and demand does not attempt to encompass).  Causes  Shortages (in the technical sense) may be caused for the following: * Price ceilings, a type of price control which involves a government-imposed limit on the price of a product service. * Anti-price gouging laws. * Government ban on the sale of a product or service, such as prostitution or certain recreational drugs. * Decisions by suppliers not to raise prices, for example to maintain friendly relationships with potential future customers during a supply disruption. * Artificial scarcity  Effects  Decisions which result in a below-market-clearing price help some people and hurt others. In this case, shortages may be accepted because they theoretically enable a certain portion of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at the market-clearing price. The cost is to those who are willing to pay for a product and either can't, or experience greater difficulty in doing so. In the case of government intervention in the market, there is always a trade-off with positive and negative effects. For example, a price ceiling may cause a shortage, but it will also enable a certain percentage of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at market costs. Economic shortages caused by higher transaction costs and opportunity costs (e.g., in the form of lost time) also mean that the distribution process is wasteful. Both of these factors contribute to a decrease in aggregate wealth. Shortages may cause: * Black (illegal) and Grey (unregulated) markets in which products that are unavailable in conventional markets are sold, or in which products with excess demand are sold at higher prices than in the conventional market. * Artificial controls of demand, such as time (such as waiting in line) and rationing. * Non-monetary bargaining methods, such as time (for example queuing), nepotism, or even violence. * Panic buying * Price discrimination. * The inability to purchase a product, and subsequent forced saving.  Examples  Empty supermarket shelves in the dry pasta section due to panic-buying as the result of the 2020 COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Many regions around the world have experienced shortages in the past. * Food shortages have occurred in the United States during the Great Depression. * Rationing in the United Kingdom and the United States occurred mainly during and after the world wars * Potato shortages in the Netherlands triggered the 1917 Potato riots. * From 1920 to 1933 during prohibition in the United States, the creation of a black market for liquor was created due to the low supply of alcoholic beverages. * During the 1973 oil crisis, during which long lines and rationing was used to control demand. * In the former Soviet Union during the 1980s, prices were artificially low by fiat (i.e., high prices were outlawed). Soviet citizens waited in line for various price-controlled goods and services such as cars, apartments, or some types of clothing. From the point of view of those waiting in line, such goods were in perpetual \\"short supply\\"; some of them were willing and able to pay more than the official price ceiling, but were legally prohibited from doing so. This method for determining the allocation of goods in short supply is known as \\"rationing\\". * From the mid-2000s through the 2010s, shortages in Venezuela occurred, due to the Venezuelan government's economic policies; such as relying on foreign imports while creating strict foreign exchange controls, put price controls in place and having expropriations result with lower domestic production. As a result of such shortages, Venezuelans had to search for products, wait in lines for hours and rationing was initiated, with the government allowing the purchase of a certain amount of products when it's available, through fingerprint recognition. * Shortages in Sudan sparked a revolution in 2019 which ended President Omar al-Bashir's 30-year rule. They continued into 2020. * Panic buying due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused food and product shortages around the world. One of the innovations that came out of this was the implementation of applications that alerted consumers when scarce items were back in stock.  Shortages and \\"longages\\"  Garrett Hardin emphasised that a shortage of supply can just as well be viewed as a \\"longage\\" of demand. For instance, a shortage of food can just as well be called a longage of people (overpopulation). By looking at it from this view, he felt the problem could be better dealt with.Video Interview with Garrett Hardin: Longages and Overpopulation Predictions Educational Communications program 803, 1990 Labour shortage In its narrowest definition, a labour shortage is an economic condition in which employers believe there are insufficient qualified candidates (employees) to fill the marketplace demands for employment at a wage that is mostly employer-determined. Such a condition is sometimes referred to by economists as \\"an insufficiency in the labour force.\\" An ageing population and a contracting workforce and a birth dearth may curb U.S. economic expansion for several decades, for example.Shrinking labour force may curb U.S. expansion for two decades =Wage factors= Wage levels have been suggested as one way to measure a labour shortage. However, that often does not match people's common perceptions. For example, if wages alone are the best measure of labour shortages, then that would imply that doctors, instead of farm workers, should be imported because doctors are far more expensive than farm workers. However, there are institutionally-imposed limits on the number of doctors that are allowed to be licensed. If foreign migrant workers were not allowed into a nation, farm wages may go up but probably not enough to approach the wages of doctors. The Atlantic slave trade (which originated in the early 17th century but ended by the early 19th century) was said to have originated from perceived shortages of agricultural labour in the Americas (particularly in the Southern United States). It was thought that bringing African labor was the only means of malaria resistance available at the time.\\"As American as‚Ä¶Plasmodium vivax?\\" Ironically, malaria seems to itself have been introduced to the \\"New World\\" via the slave trade.\\"UCI: New World malaria linked to slave trade.\\"  See also  References * Kornai, J√°nos, Socialist economy, Princeton University Press, 1992, * Kornai, J√°nos, Economics of Shortage, Amsterdam: North Holland Press, Volume A, p. 27; Volume B, p. 196 . * Gomulka, Stanislaw: Kornai's Soft Budget Constraint and the Shortage Phenomenon: A Criticism and Restatement, in: Economics of Planning, Vol. 19. 1985.

It covers an area of about and is home to several natural warm water springs, as well as a wide variety of flora and fauna. Its location in the heartland of the West African savanna makes it a unique way for tourists and holidaymakers to watch wildlife in its natural habitat. Yankari was originally created as a game reserve in 1956, but later designated Nigeria's biggest national park in 1991. It is the most popular destination for tourists in Nigeria and, as such, plays a crucial role in the development and promotion of tourism and ecotourism in Nigeria.Odunlami, S.S.S. (2000): Parks: Vanguard of Ecotourism Promotion. The Host Magazine Vol 2, No 1 pp 25 It is also one of the most popular eco- destinations in West Africa.Olokesusi, F. (1990): Assessment of the Yankari Game Reserve, Nigeria: Problems and Prospects. Butterworth Heineman Ltd., pp 153‚Äì155 History The open country and villages that surround Yankari National Park are populated by farmers and herders, but there has been no human settlement in the park for over a century. There is, however, evidence of earlier human habitation in the park, including old iron smelting sites and caves. In 1934, the Northern Regional Committee made a recommendation to the Executive Council to establish a pilot game reserve in the Bauchi Emirate. This was supported by Alhaji Muhammadu Ngeleruma, a minister in the former northern Nigeria Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Around this time, he had been impressed by a visit to a Sudanese game reserve while on a trip to East Africa. On returning, he encouraged the moves to establish something similar in Nigeria.Odunlami, Samuel Segun, An Assessment of the Ecotourism Potential of Yankari National Park, Nigeria. Ecoclub.com E-Paper Series, Nr. 7, April 2003 In 1956, the Northern Nigeria Government approved the plans for the creation of a Game Preservation area. Yankari was identified as a region in the south of what was then Bauchi Province where large numbers of wild animals existed naturally and could be protected. In 1957 a Game Preservation area was carved out and the area was constituted as a Bauchi Native Authority Forest Reserve. Yankari was first opened to the public as a premier game reserve on 1 December 1962. Since then, the Northern Eastern State Government and then the Bauchi State Government both managed the Yankari Game Reserve. The park is now managed by the Federal Government of Nigeria, through the National Park Service.Ubaru, J.I (2000): Review of Illegal Activities in Yankari National Park (1991‚Äì1999). Unpublished. In 1991 it officially became a National Park by decree 36 of the National Government.Falade, G.O. (2000): Understanding Tourism in Nigeria JIS Printing Ecotourism Welcome to Yankari park Ecotourism or ecological tourism is now favoured by many global environmental organizations and aid agencies as a vehicle to sustainable development. It promotes conservation of biological diversity by protecting ecosystems and has the local culture, flora and fauna as the main attractions. Yankari National Park fulfills these criteria. In 2000, Yankari National Park hosted over 20,000 tourists from over 100 countries. This makes it the most popular tourist destination in Nigeria and, if properly managed, it could become a significant part in the development and promotion of tourism throughout Nigeria. It is one of a few remaining areas left in West Africa where wild animals are protected in their natural habitat. Geography Yankari National Park lies in the southern part of the Sudan Savannah. It is composed of savannah grassland with well-developed patches of woodland. It is also a region of rolling hills, mostly between 200m and 400m. Kariyo Hill, is the highest point at 640m. Annual rainfall in the park is between 900mm and 1,000mm. The rainy season is from May to September. Temperatures range between 18C and 35C. During the dry season, the harmattan wind blows from the Sahara, often bringing dusty skies and night temperatures fall as low as 12C. The hottest period falls in March and April, when temperatures can rise above 40C in the day. In the dry season, larger wildlife in the park depend on the Gaji river and its tributaries for survival. This river is the only watershed and cuts the park in two. Marshall estimated the area of the Gaji River Valley used by elephants in the dry season at about .Marshall, P.J. (1985): A new method of censusing, Elephants and hippopotamus on Yankari Game Reserve. Nigeria Field 50: 5-11 . This increases the chances of seeing elephants at this time of year. The park's main entrance is at Mainamaji village, about 29 km from Dindima. It is located within the Duguri, Pali and Gwana districts of Alkaleri LGA, Bauchi State. This LGA has a population 208,202 people occupying a total land area of . Geology The whole park lies on the Kerri formation, of Tertiary age, which is composed of sandstone, silt stones, kaolinites and grits. Underneath this lies the Gombe formation, of Cretaceous age, composed of sandstones, silt stones, and ironstones. The valleys of the Gaji, Yashi and Yuli Rivers are filled with Alluvium of more recent age. Sandy loans and clayey soils of riverine alluvium occur in the valley of the Gaji Yashi and Yuli Rivers. East of the Gaji valley is a 5‚Äì7 km wide band of very poor sandy soils that support a shrub savanna formation Ubaru, J.I (2000): Review of Illegal Activities in Yankari National Park (1991 ‚Äì 1999) Wildlife African bush elephants in Yankari National Park Water buck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) -Yankari game reserve, Bauchi State (1) Yankari National Park is an important refuge for over 50 mammal species including African bush elephant, olive baboon, patas monkey, Tantalus monkey, roan antelope, western hartebeest, West African lion, African buffalo, waterbuck, bushbuck and hippopotamus. The lion population is on the verge of extinction. Only 2 lions remained in the park in 2011. Leopard long presumed to be extinct in the park, but in April 2017, one adult male was captured on WCS camera-trap. There are also over 350 species of bird found in the park. Of these, 130 are resident, 50 are Palearctic migrants and the rest are intra- African migrants that move locally within Nigeria. These birds include the saddle-billed stork, guinea fowl, grey hornbill, and the cattle egret.Olokesusi, F. (1990): Assessment of the Yankari Game Reserve, Nigeria: Problems and Prospects. Butterworth Heineman Ltd., pp 153 ‚Äì 155. In recent years there have been no sightings of Critically Endangered White-backed Vultures in Yankari and species probably extirpated from the reserve. Yankari is recognized as having one of the largest populations of elephants in West Africa, estimated at more than 300 in 2005. The growth of the elephant population has become a problem for surrounding villages at times as the animals enter local farms during the rainy season. The elephants have also stripped the park of many of its baobab trees. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with Kainji National Park. Features Due to underground geothermal activity, Yankari National Park also features four warm water springs. The camp is named after the most well known of these, the Wikki Spring, from the local Duguri language with ‚ÄúWikki‚Äù meaning ‚Äúwhere are you?‚Äù. The Wikki Warm Spring is the largest spring and is about 13.0 metres wide and 1.9 metres deep. It daily flows 21,000,000 litres of clear, spring water into the Gaji river.Nihotours (2000): A Bulletin of the National Institute for Hospitality and tourism Studies, Kano, Nigeria. Vol 1, no 1 pp 8-9. The spring has a constant temperature of 31.1 ¬∞C through the year during both day and night and has been developed for recreation. The other warm water springs are Dimmil, Gwana, and Mawulgo springs. A fifth spring, Tungan Maliki, is the only cool spring in the park. =Evidence of early human settlements= * Dukkey Wells ‚Äì 139 wells with interconnecting shafts representing an elaborate water storage system. * Marshall Caves ‚Äì 59 dwelling caves dug into sandstone escarpments, which were discovered by P.J.

The title is a meaningless palindrome, usually pronounced . Rolling Stone, upon reviewing the album, mentioned that \\"no other music sustains a lifestyle so delicate and loving and lifelike\\".Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip by Jake Woodward, et al. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 99. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on May 13, 1997. In 1991 Rolling Stone selected Aoxomoxoa as having the eighth best album cover of all time.\\"Rolling Stones 100 Greatest Album Covers\\" , Rate Your Music, list adapted from November 14, 1991, issue of Rolling Stone. Retrieved on July 29, 2006. It was voted number 674 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). Background and development The album was a series of firsts for the band. It is the first album the band recorded entirely in or near their original hometown of San Francisco (at Pacific Recording Studio in nearby San Mateo, and at the similarly named Pacific High Recording Studio in San Francisco proper). It is the only studio release to include pianist Tom Constanten as an official member (he had contributed to the previous album and played live with the band from November 1968 to January 1970). It was also the first to have lyricist Robert Hunter as a full-time contributor to the band, thus cementing the Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter songwriting partnership that endured for the rest of the band's existence. It was also the first time the band would showcase acoustic arrangements (as on \\"Mountains of the Moon\\", \\"Rosemary\\", and \\"Dupree's Diamond Blues\\"), which would become the focus of the next two studio albums. Some of the songs on Aoxomoxoa were played live briefly and then dropped. Only \\"China Cat Sunflower\\" became a set staple through the band's career, with \\"Dupree's Diamond Blues\\" somewhat less so. \\"St. Stephen\\" was played until 1971, revived in 1976 and 1977 and played a handful of times after that. Likewise, \\"Cosmic Charlie\\" was played a few times again in 1976. Recording The album was recorded twice. The initial version, with the working title \\"Earthquake Country\\" (a Bay Area reference), was abandoned when Ampex manufactured and released the first 16-track multitrack recording machine (model number MM-1000). Offering 16 discrete tracks for recording and playback, it doubled the number of tracks that had been available when they recorded Anthem of the Sun, the previous year. Consequently, the band spent eight months in the studio, off-and-on, not only recording the album but getting used to ‚Äî and experimenting with ‚Äî the new technology. Garcia commented, \\"it was our first adventure with sixteen-track and we tended to put too much on everything...A lot of the music was just lost in the mix, a lot of what was really there\\".Garcia: An American Life by Blair Jackson, Penguin Books, 1999. pg. 162 Drummer Bill Kreutzmann states, \\"sixteen-track technology came along only after we did our initial recording using an eight-track at the end of 1968. But when the studio procured one of the first sixteen-track recorders in the world (the same one we used for Live/Dead), the decision was made to toss everything we had already done and record it all again. From scratch. This time we could go deeper and experiment with things no other band had done yet. Being able to utilize twice as many tracks essentially doubled the possibilities of what we could do with each song. The end result was dense and cumbersome in places, and all that studio time cost us a fortune, but we were experimenting on the sonic frontier, exploiting cutting-edge technology.\\" Indeed, the lengthy sessions for the album would put the band deeper into debt with Warner Bros. Records ‚Äî specifically, a total cost of $180,000 (US$ in dollars) for Aoxomoxoa. It was their most ambitious and costly venture to date and the last time the band would ever run up such high studio bills. Kreutzmann later commented, \\"Sometime in 1969, when we realized the colossal debt we got ourselves into with the decidedly indulgent making of Aoxomoxoa, we realized that we needed to get a handle on our finances. We were a group of altruistic troubadours, a traveling psychedelic circus.\\" Along with help from guest musicians such as John \\"Marmaduke\\" Dawson and David Nelson, Lesh played acoustic bass for the first time. He later commented, \\"the fun part of that was trying to play in tune with no frets to guide my fingers, just like a violin.\\"Phil Lesh: Searching for the Sound by Phil Lesh, Little, Brown and Company, 2005, pg. 138. Unlike the band's other studio albums, Garcia sang lead on every track. Title and cover art The title of the album is a palindrome created by cover artist Rick Griffin and lyricist Robert Hunter. According to Living with the Dead, the audio memoir of band manager Rock Scully, the title is pronounced \\"ox-oh-mox-oh-ah\\" One fan legend considers the words \\"Grateful Dead\\" on the front of the album, written in large, flowing capital letters, to be an ambigram that can also be read \\"we ate the acid\\". Kreutzmann states, \\"Aoxomoxoa...doesn‚Äôt mean anything ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a cool palindrome. People have surmised over the years that you could read the Grateful Dead lettering on the front cover as We Ate the Acid which, I suppose, is true enough, if you look at it just right.\\" The artwork is adapted from a painting that was originally created as a concert poster for the band.

Courtney Love has claimed to be featured among those photographed on the album's back cover.Love, Courtney. Interview with Nardwuar the Human Serviette (November 15, 1994). Love's father, Hank Harrison, had close ties to the band at the time, and had briefly worked for them in some capacity. Love's claim was corroborated by David Gans in 2011, but further research has proved her incorrect; the girl often identified as Love was actually Bill Kreutzmann's daughter Stacy, who was the same age as Love at the time the photo was taken.\\"It Wasn't Courtney\\", Grateful Dead Guide, January 1, 2015. Retrieved February 7, 2015. Kreutzmann has stated, \\"...despite rumors, that‚Äôs not a five-year-old Courtney Love on the back cover in the group photo.

He appears on the album's back cover crowd shot taken by Tom Weir. He is the one by the horse.  Critical reception  Reviewing Aoxomoxoa in 1969, Rolling Stone magazine's Adele Novelli called it \\"the work of the magical band. Can you hear this music and not see them before your eyes? The music is so much the reality of their physical and spiritual bodies that seeing them is the wonder of seeing music.\\" In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau found the album \\"fantastic\\", with the exception of the \\"one experimental\\" song. He expanded on his praise in The New York Times later that year: Years later, AllMusic's Fred Thomas said \\"the Grateful Dead reached their true peak of psychedelia\\" with the album, embellishing \\"the exploratory jamming and rough-edged blues-rock of their live shows\\" with \\"overdubbed choirs, electronic sound effects, and layers of processed vocal harmonies.\\" According to Adam Bouyamourn of The National, the album's \\"iconoclastic acid rock ‚Ä¶ combined free jazz, improvisation and psychedelia\\". Remix Second-guessing the end results, Garcia and Lesh went back in the studio in 1971 to remix the album, removing many parts present on the original release, including a choir singing on \\"Mountains of the Moon\\", many difficult-to-identify sounds on \\"What's Become of the Baby\\", and an a cappella ending for \\"Doin' that Rag,\\" dropped for an earlier fadeout. The remix also uses different vocal takes on some songs, most noticeably \\"Dupree's Diamond Blues.\\" The result, with the same catalog number (WS1790) and perhaps brighter sound, but with much of the original's experimental character removed, can be identified by the \\"Remixed September, 1971\\" legend on the back cover. Mistakenly, the song timings on the first (1987) CD release refer to the original mix, not the remix (varying most significantly on \\"Doin' that Rag,\\" which was edited from 5:15 to 4:41, and \\"China Cat Sunflower,\\" edited from 4:15 to 3:40). The original mix was later planned for CD release, but the original master tapes could not be located. When the masters were finally found, years later, they were used for The Warner Bros.

In , in the New York‚ÄìPenn League for Oneonta, he batted .365/.447/.504 with 2 home runs in 115 at bats. For this success, he was rewarded with a promotion to High-A ball. Injured and playing poorly, he hit just .210 in the next two seasons. Playing in a league that is notoriously tough for hitters (Florida State League) he hit .289/.344/.461 to establish legitimate prospect status. Mid-season, he was sent up to AA and the Eastern League. There, he batted .250/.328/.435. Combined, he hit .265 with 140 hits, 20 home runs, 101 RBI, and 37 stolen bases to establish himself as a top prospect. Entering the season just 22 years old, Williams flopped, hitting .271, but with only 7 home runs, 59 RBI, and an abysmal 52% stolen base rate. But he rebounded in AAA in . He hit .285/.334/.452 with 16 home runs, 86 RBI, and 36 stolen bases. This earned him a call to the big leagues, where he would for the most part stay until . =New York Yankees (1992‚Äì1996)= Gerald Williams, at the age of 25 years, made his professional debut September 15, 1992. After a brief stint in the minor leagues in , where he practically duplicated his 1992 stats, he was back in the big leagues in . But he was injured and played infrequently. He had also been batting only .239. He finally got a chance to truly play off the bench in , where he had 182 at bats and batted .247 with 6 home runs. Williams saw more action in , hitting .270 with 5 home runs in 233 at bats. He started in more for the Yankees in left field that season than any other player, with 70 starts. On May 1, he set a Yankees team record with 6 hits against Baltimore in a 15 inning game. At the end of the season, Gerald received his first World Series Championship ring.http://mlb.mlb.com/nyy/history/single_game_records.jsp =Milwaukee Brewers (1996‚Äì1997)= On August 23, 1996, Williams was dealt with Bob Wickman to the Milwaukee Brewers for Graeme Lloyd, Pat Listach, and Ricky Bones. Only Lloyd had any success after being dealt to the Yankees, while both Wickman and Williams became solid major league players. After the trade in 1996, Williams only batted .207. Still, the year was a success to Williams, who got 325 at bats, and batted .252 with 28 extra-base hits. The next season was Williams first as a regular. He batted .253 with 10 home runs, 41 RBI, 23 stolen bases, and 44 extra-base hits, but he took few walks, and had an OPS of just .651, some 117 points lower than league average. After that miserable season, he was dealt to the Atlanta Braves for reliever Chad Fox. =Atlanta Braves (1998‚Äì1999)= Williams then spent two years thriving as a semi-regular player in Atlanta, batting .286 with 27 home runs. In 1999, he played against his old team, the Yankees during the 1999 World Series but lost the series in a 4-game sweep. =Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2000‚Äì2001)= Perhaps Williams' finest season was . He set career highs in homers, walks, RBI, hits, runs, and doubles. For this effort, he was named Tampa Bay Devil Rays player of the year. On August 29, 2000, Williams was hit by a pitch thrown by Boston Red Sox pitcher Pedro Mart√≠nez. Williams charged the mound and started a bench-clearing brawl. During the brawl, he was one of 8 members of the Rays ejected. He got off to a slow start in , batting just .207, and the Devil Rays released him. =Second stint with the New York Yankees (2001‚Äì2003)= Williams went back to the Yankees to finish the 2001 season and served as the backup outfielder. He made the postseason roster until the team lost the 2001 World Series to the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2002, he spent most of the season in the minors, but played 33 games in the majors. =Florida Marlins (2003)= Williams signed a one- year deal for the Florida Marlins in 2003. He played 27 games and batted .129 overall. Williams got his second career World Series ring after the Marlins won the 2003 World Series over his former team, the New York Yankees. =New York Mets (2004‚Äì2005)= He signed a two-year deal for the Mets in 2004. During his two years with the Mets, he batted .233 with 5 home runs and 14 RBI. He was released after the 2005 season and announced his retirement shortly thereafter. Personal life Williams resides in Tampa, Florida, is one of the best friends of Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter and who Jeter says \\"always looked out for me\\" He has 12 brothers and sisters. Williams was one of three Atlanta Braves to appear on Saturday Night Live when he made a cameo appearance alongside teammates Mark Wohlers and Pedro Borb√≥n, Jr. on the December 19, 1997, episode hosted by Helen Hunt.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1179705/ See also *List of Major League Baseball single-game hits leaders References External links * Baseball Almanac Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from New Orleans Category:Sportspeople from Manhattan Category:Sportspeople from Atlanta Category:Sportspeople from St. Petersburg, Florida Category:Sportspeople from Tampa, Florida Category:Baseball players from Louisiana Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:New York Yankees players Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Tampa Bay Devil Rays players Category:Florida Marlins players Category:New York Mets players Category:African-American baseball players Category:Columbus Clippers players Category:Louisville Bats players Category:Memphis Redbirds players Category:Albuquerque Isotopes players Category:Norfolk Tides players Category:Prince William Yankees players Category:Albany-Colonie Yankees players Category:Fort Lauderdale Yankees players Category:Grambling State Tigers baseball players ","title":"Gerald Williams (baseball)"},{"id":"2364746","text":"Gemendhoo (Dhivehi: ﬁéﬁ¨ﬁâﬁ¨ﬁÇﬁ∞ﬁãﬁ´) is a formerly inhabited island of Dhaalu Atoll. The island is located on the eastern fringe of the atoll and is surrounded by a long line of 11 uninhabited islands. The route through these islands from Bulhalafushi (to the north) which ends approximately 7 kilometers away at Naibukaloabodufushi can be walked in low tide. Gemendhoo was completely abandoned after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Most of the island's population moved to Kudahuvadhoo, the capital of the atoll.Valpuri Saarelma, IFRC News, 1 October 2007 Prior to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, Gemendhoo had a population of roughly 500 people. The Main economic activity of the Island was fishing, however, export of locally made Thatch for near by Resort Hotels was also a common and profitable activity among locals. The Gemendhoo School taught in English Medium, up to grade 7, and for further studies, students went to the Kudahuvadhoo or Male City. Even though the island had a very small community, they were known among the atoll as being very actively involved in the development of the island. They have built a concrete-cement bridge between the uninhibited island called Thanbulhaedhoo, so as to ease the access to their football ground in the middle of island, and also to allow easy collection of coconuts (for food or making coconut oil) and palm leaves (used for thatch making) from the island. This bridge broke from the middle, when the tsunami wave hit. A second structure similar to this bridge was being built as a Jetty, before the tsunami, to allow ease of access to the island for fishing boats and small boats (known in Dhivehi as Bokkura), mainly used by the locals to visit near by uninhabited islands. Another example of this can be the Main Mosque on the island and the home build for expatriate teachers living and working on the island. Years after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, the island remains in its ruins, mostly visited for picnics, collection of coconuts, and palm leaves etc. It is not surprising that some of the structures (such as the Jetty) still stands on its concrete stilts, faithfully serving its purpose. A visit to the Ruins of Gemendhoo can easily be arranged by contacting locals of Kudahuvadhoo. Since Gemendhoo is surrounded by uninhibited islands, Island Hopping can be an interesting choice of excursion.

He was also the owner and head coach of the Johnstown Chiefs of the ECHL. He last was the president, general manager, and governor of the Greenville Road Warriors of the ECHL. He now is an on-air analyst for the NHL Network. Biography = Early career = Smith played junior hockey before attending Western Michigan University. As a freshman, he was selected to the All-American team as a defenceman, and was named team captain his sophomore season. He was drafted in 1974 by the New York Islanders as the first ever draft pick from WMU. He spent several seasons in the minor leagues before working for the organization as a talent scout. With Smith working in an important capacity for the Islanders minor league system, the Islanders' Central Hockey League affiliate, the Indianapolis Checkers (which at the time was the Islanders most prominent minor league team) won the Adams Cup in 1981‚Äì82. While on the Island, he worked closely with the Islanders chief scout and assistant GM, Jim Devellano, and when Devellano was contacted by the new Detroit Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch to become GM in the summer of 1982, Smith moved with him to the Red Wings, where he won two Calder Cup championships as the general manager of the team's minor league affiliate, the Adirondack Red Wings in 1985‚Äì86 and 1988‚Äì89. During the 1988 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Smith and assistant coach Colin Campbell discovered several Red Wings players, including Bob Probert and Petr Klima, out past curfew. The incident occurred at a suburban Edmonton bar called \\"Goose Loonies\\", and led to an apology being issued by Red Wings head coach Jacques Demers. Smith would later hire Campbell as head coach of the New York Rangers in 1994. = Success with the New York Rangers = Smith was hired by the Rangers in 1989 to be their general manager, inheriting a team that included future stars Brian Leetch and Mike Richter. Under Smith's watch, the Rangers groomed Tony Amonte. Smith was also responsible for drafting star players such as Sergei Nemchinov, Alexei Kovalev, Doug Weight, and Sergei Zubov before he made his mark in 1991 with a blockbuster trade for superstar Mark Messier, who was immediately given the captaincy by the Rangers organization. Over the next three seasons, Smith continued to shape the team through trades and free-agent signings, acquiring several players from the Edmonton Oilers dynasty of the 1980s, including Kevin Lowe, Adam Graves, Esa Tikkanen, Jeff Beukeboom, Craig McTavish and Glenn Anderson. Messier became one of the most popular athletes in New York, winning the Hart Memorial Trophy in 1992, and the Rangers grew into an elite team. The Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy as the team with the NHL's best regular season record twice, and in 1994 won their long-awaited fourth Stanley Cup championship. Neil Smith remains the only GM in the modern era to win a Stanley Cup with the Rangers. = Fall of the Rangers = The next few years saw the team struggle to stay in contention, but having traded away many of its prospects for the Stanley Cup run, the team had to increasingly rely on aging veterans acquired through expensive free agency. A major dispute between Smith and hard-driving coach Mike Keenan ended when Keenan left for the St. Louis Blues after the championship season. Unfortunately, none of the coaches that succeeded Keenan could motivate the highly-paid stars that played for the Rangers in the mid to late 1990s. Attempting to once more bring in an older superstar to re-ignite the magic of 1994, Neil Smith signed Wayne Gretzky in 1996, reuniting him with his old teammate Messier. During the 1996‚Äì97 playoffs the Rangers earned their way into the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were beaten by a bigger and younger Philadelphia Flyers squad. The reunion would last only a year, however, as Messier left amid an acrimonious dispute with the organization. With his departure the Rangers sank into mediocrity; though Smith acquired a succession of veteran players with expensive contracts and drafted a host of promising young players, the team continued to underperform and miss the playoffs until Smith's departure from the organization following the 1999‚Äì2000 NHL season. The Rangers did not again reach the playoffs until 2006. = Short tenure with the New York Islanders = On June 8, 2006, Smith was introduced as the New York Islanders' general manager, making him the only person in NHL history to serve as general manager with both New York teams. Smith stated, \\"Knowing that I'll be working in the same office where one of my mentors, Bill Torrey, created a dynasty is an unbelievable feeling. Al Arbour, whom I owe everything to, gave me my first hockey job as an advance scout. I wear my Islanders Stanley Cup ring with immense pride. To be able to come full circle and return home to the Islanders is a dream.\\" On July 18, 2006, before the season began, Smith was fired and replaced by Islanders goaltender Garth Snow, who retired from his playing position on the team upon being hired. Smith reportedly had grown frustrated with his lack of authority on personnel and staffing decisions, as owner Charles Wang had at that time instituted a setup where decisions were made collectively by a group of advisors rather than by the general manager alone. Wang believed that Smith was incapable of fitting within this model and subsequently fired him. Pat LaFontaine, who had recently been hired by the team as a senior adviser, quit his post the same day in reaction to the firing of Smith. Smith was named as an assistant to Dallas Stars general manager Doug Armstrong shortly after being let go by the Islanders, October 27, 2006. = Broadcasting = Smith has spent time broadcasting NHL games for various networks, and has also done some studio work. Smith has worked for ESPN, TSN, Versus and NHL Network. Neil Smith has also served as a guest host on Hockey Night in Canada Radio on Sirius offering his insight alongside host Jeff Marek.

These mounds are the ruins of Buddhist temples from the pre-Islamic period (before the 10th century) that have not been excavated yet. Thor Heyerdahl, who explored the island in the early 1980s, wrote that the ancient coral-stone mosque of Kudahuvadhoo possesses some of the finest masonry ever seen in the world.

This lent credence to one of the theories that the flight had been commandeered by someone who intended to land the plane in a remote area. Kudahuvadhoo had no airstrip at that time. The Mal√© International Airport north-northeast of Kudahuvadhoo was one that the pilot had practised landing on, using his homemade flight simulator.

Originally released for the PlayStation in Japan in December 1997, an English version was later made available in North America in September 1998. The game features many of the same development staff as its predecessor, Tales of Phantasia, including composers Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura, with character designs by series newcomer Mutsumi Inomata. Its producers gave it the characteristic genre name . A remake for the PlayStation 2 was released in November 2006, which was followed by an updated version called in January 2008, both exclusive to Japan. The remake was also given its own unique genre name by its producers as . Taking place in a fantasy world, the game follows the story of a young man named Stahn who comes across a sentient sword named Dymlos and his subsequent encounters with other similar sword-wielders. Eventually, he and his friends must unite against evil forces seeking use a relic from an ancient war. The PlayStation version of Tales of Destiny was mostly well-received, selling over a million copies worldwide and going on to become the highest selling Tales game in Japan to this day. Gameplay Battle from the original PlayStation version of Tales of Destiny. The game uses an enhanced version of the Linear Motion Battle System that debuted in the first game of the series, Tales of Phantasia. Battles take place on a 2-D plane where characters and enemies act in real time. Melee and ranged attacks are executed in real time, with spell casting requiring a chanting time that increases directly with the complexity of the spell being cast. When the chanting of a spell is complete, game-time temporarily stops as the spell animation is carried out and damage is assigned, so spells essentially act as interrupts. Special melee and ranged attacks do more damage or have more hits than normal attacks, but require technical points, or TP, to be consumed for use. Also, the battle system rewards the player with extra experience for stringing together multi-hit combos. The end result of this break from traditional turn-based RPG battle systems is a more fast-paced and reaction oriented system that behaves more like a fighting game and less like a typical Final Fantasy-esque title. Pre- battle options include assigning spells and special attacks to buttons and button-directional combinations, changing the party's battle formation or order, and assigning AI behavioral patterns for your computer-controlled allies. Certain spells can also be taken off the active casting list for computer-controlled allies. At any one time, the AI is controlling the other characters in the party that the player is not directly commanding, taking general strategic orders into consideration when acting. The player controls one character directly at a time, but can switch to other characters and issue special attack or spell orders for any character on command using an in-battle menu system. This menu system enables the player to use items, spells, or special attacks on the fly in battle. Also, the menu system allows the use of general commands given to the entire party during battle, along with instant adjustment of previous strategy or formation orders. Plot =Setting= In the past, a comet crashed into the world, throwing dust clouds into the sky and shrouding the world in cold and darkness. At about the same time, the inhabitants, the Aethers, discovered a new form of energy from the meteorite's core, which they named Lens. Combining this with further research, the people were able to create cities in the sky and live in them. Unfortunately, only a select few were chosen, leaving the rest of the people to remain on the bleak surface of the planet. These people became known as the Erthers. Over time, the sky's inhabitants became known as the Aetherians and their Aeropolis cities. They created a horrific weapon called the Belcrant that shot down any who dared oppose them. This caused full-scale war to erupt between the two civilizations, now known as the Aeth'er Wars. However, regardless of their will and persistence, the Aetherians continued to have the power to dominate every engagement through the use of their superweapon. In their disgust of their civilization's elitist behavior, a group of Aetherian scientists went to the surface. There, with aid from the people, they were able to create special swords, called Swordians, that were sentient. Unlike other weapons, these swords chose their masters and were able to call upon the elements of nature to do their will. Using these weapons, the people of the surface finally had an edge against the Aetherians. Thanks in part to the Swordians and their masters, scores of Aeropolis were sunk to the depths of the ocean. In the end, the Erthers claimed victory over the Aetherians. Thousands of years later, this story has been mostly forgotten. In the meantime, the purposeless Swordians fell into a deep stasis sleep, only to awaken when grave threats rose once again. =Story= The story of the game begins when country-boy- turned-adventurer Stahn Aileron, who seeks fame and adventure, sneaks aboard the flying ship Draconis as a stowaway. He is found out by the crew and forced to work as a deckhand, but when a large hostile force attacks the ship, the crew is overwhelmed and Stahn breaks free during the ensuing chaos. Looking for a usable weapon to fend off the attackers, he gains access to a storeroom and discovers a \\"junk\\" sword. However, the sword starts talking to him, calling itself Dymlos and claiming to be a sentient Swordian from the Aeth'er Wars. Armed with Dymlos, Stahn fights his way to an escape pod, which he uses to escape the rapidly descending ship before it crashes into the ground. Dymlos becomes the key to the fame, fortune, and adventure Stahn seeks as the young man meets other Swordians, quickly becoming embroiled in a battle for a relic of the Aeth'er Wars: a huge, extremely powerful Lens called the Eye of Atamoni. =Main characters= * is a 19-year-old adventurer who grows into a powerful sword-based physical fighter, Stahn is the protagonist of Tales of Destiny. Not known for his intelligence or his cultured background, his fire- elemental Swordian is Dymlos. He is voiced by Tomokazu Seki. *, armed with Atwight, the Swordian of water, is an 18-year-old headstrong Lens hunter who travels the world looking to make a profit with her partner, Mary, and eventually develops a romantic relationship with Stahn. She is voiced by Yuka Imai. * is a master swordsman of Seinegald ‚Äì at age 16 the youngest in history to serve the kingdom, and a close associate of the president of the powerful Oberon Company. A complex and slightly brooding character, Leon's agile Swordian is Chaltier. He is voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa. * is a 19-year-old priestess. Isolated from the outside world until the events of the game, she has a sweet, charming personality and is very dependable, but she can also be overly fastidious. Her powerful spell casting ability is augmented by her Swordian, Clemente. She is voiced by Kikuko Inoue. * is the 23-year-old Prince of Phandaria, and a skilled archer as well as a swordsman; Igtenos is his wind-elemental Swordian. Wise and mature, Woodrow is known for his cool-headed battle tactics. He is voiced by Sh≈ç Hayami. * is a 24-year-old woman who suffers from amnesia, and is not aware of her last name due to an unknown event in her past. Mary has no Swordian, but can use swords and axes as a strong physical attacker. She is generally easy-going, but sometimes flies into berserker rages in battle. She is voiced by Yuri Amano. * is the 14-year- old granddaughter of Garr's archery master, Alba. Though she appears cute and innocent, she is an archer skilled beyond her age. She is voiced by Naoko Watanabe. * is a 39-year-old powerful fighter from a battle arena. Loud and egotistical, he uses his fists as weapons. He is voiced by Tessh≈ç Genda. * is the estranged 26-year-old son of an aristocratic family and a bard by trade. Seemingly fragile from outward appearances, he can provide useful support in the party through songs played on his lute. He is voiced by K≈çichi Yamadera. * is Stahn's younger sister. She is cheerful and energetic, but knows when to command respect when she is angry. Lilith fights with a frying pan and has no Swordian. She is voiced by Chie Sawaguchi. Development Tales of Destiny was originally developed by members of Telnet Japan and Wolf Team, who had previously worked on Tales of Phantasia. The game features character designs by anime and manga artist Mutsumi Inomata, as well as animated cutscenes produced by Japanese studio Production I.G. It was exhibited at the September 1997 Tokyo Game Show. An English version was announced for North America originally for the third or fourth quarter of 1998, and would later appear at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta. Its North American producer commented that since the game's two-dimensional graphics were so \\"ordinary\\", the translation team focused on creating \\"an outstanding localization\\" to compensate. Namco America had originally intended to dub the character voices into English, and searched for \\"excellent voice talent to fill [the] positions\\", yet the final version still retains the original Japanese audio. =PlayStation 2 versions= In a June 2006 press conference, Namco Bandai Games announced that a remake of Tales of Destiny for the PlayStation 2 was in development and due for release some time the following winter in Japan. The remake contains several new features, including three-dimensional environments, re-drawn character sprites, and an expanded version of the original PlayStation releases' Linear Motion Battle System known as the \\"Aerial Linear Motion Battle System\\" (AR-LMBS) that emphasizes mid-air combat and elaborate combination attacks. In addition, all key cutscenes are now fully voiced, as well as a new feature called the Active Party Window where characters interact with each other during the adventure. It made an appearance at the 2006 Tokyo Game Show, where it was given a release date set for the following November. However, the discovery of unexpected bugs led to the title being delayed past its original due date of November 22, and was instead released on November 30. Screen of the Director's Cut showcasing the new \\"Leon Mode\\" and the 3D map screen. Namco Bandai Games later announced in a July 2007 press conference that yet another version of Tales of Destiny would be released for the PlayStation 2 called the , and would be due for release in early 2008. This version was designed to be compatible with the original PlayStation 2 remake's save data, and features new story events and battle difficulty settings. A new \\"Leon Mode\\" allows players to take control of the character Leon and experience story events from his point of view, and Stahn's younger sister Lilith is now a playable character. The game was released in Japan in January 2008 alongside a limited special edition packaged with an artbook and soundtrack. =Audio= The music for Tales of Destiny was written by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura, who had both previously collaborated on the soundtrack for Tales of Phantasia. The Japanese version also features the opening theme song by J-pop group Deen. An official soundtrack for the original PlayStation version was released in March 2000 by Movic containing a total of 76 songs across two discs. In May 2007, a soundtrack for the PlayStation 2 remake was made available by King Records, and featured 108 songs on four discs. Numerous Tales of Destiny radio drama albums featuring the Japanese voice cast have been produced since 1998. A three-volume set called was released between October 1998 and January 1999 by Movic Records, which were followed by another three-volume collection called released between April and June 1999. A third three-volume set called was also produced by Movic and released between June and August 1999. In December 1999, a stand- alone drama album entitled was released. Reception =PlayStation version= Tales of Destiny obtained a 31 out of 40 total score from Japanese magazine Weekly Famitsu based on individual scores of 8, 7, 8, and 8, earning it the publication's Silver Award. In 2006, Famitsu readers would declare it the 79th greatest game of all time in its \\"All Time Top 100\\" feature, making it the third highest-ranking Tales game on the list. The game sold over 450,000 copies in Japan by the end of 1997, and it received a \\"Gold Prize\\" from Sony in May 1998, indicating sales above 500,000 units in Japan. It went on to sell approximately 1,139,000 copies worldwide by December 2007, becoming the best-selling individual game in the Tales series. The English version received generally positive reception in North America, earning a 73% average score from aggregate review website GameRankings. IGN gave the game a 7.5 of 10, stating the game was \\"Highly recommended, as long as you're a fan of the classic Super NES\\". IGN praised the game for its gameplay, story, and sound, but criticized the graphics for not being much better than what the Super NES was capable of, and the frequency of the battles. RPGFan gave the game an 88% rating overall, calling the battle system \\"a blast to play\\" and \\"well- balanced\\", but had mixed feelings on the graphics, calling it \\"...not even as good as some of the SNES\\" on in the game, but saying it improves farther into the game, stating \\"Transparencies, lighting, reflections and beautifully drawn textures make each area interesting\\". RPGamer was less enthusiastic, giving the game a 6 out of 10, calling it \\"a fairly good game\\" but not without its flaws. The battle system was praised, but the lack of originality was criticized. GameSpot, however, was much more negative in regards to the game, giving it a 4.9 out of 10. Problems cited included \\"...a stale and exceedingly slow-moving story...boring, moldy characters and dry, musty dialogue...\\" and poor graphics, stating that it looked and sounded \\"...far too much like an SNES game, Tales of Destiny seems like it was originally intended to be a sequel on the SNES that got delayed well into the PlayStation's life cycle. While the game's overall poor graphics were widely criticized by reviewers, Production I.G's opening anime video did receive praise from numerous critics. Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Tales of Destiny is a simple yet enjoyable romp through what RPGs once were ‚Äì long adventures featuring lots of character interaction and battles. And with this perspective, expect the game to be entertaining and even challenging at times.\\" =PlayStation 2 version= The PlayStation 2 remake received a slightly higher score of 32 out of 40 from editors of Weekly Famitsu based on scores of 8, 8, 8, and 8, granting it a Gold Award. The original version sold approximately 368,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006, while the Director's Cut would sell 142,301 copies by the end of 2008, becoming the 92nd most-bought software title in the region that year. Legacy The game received a direct sequel, Tales of Destiny 2, which released in 2002 on the PlayStation 2, and was ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2006. Both versions of the game were only released in Asia. It was not to be confused with Tales of Eternia which was released as \\"Tales of Destiny II\\" in North America.

Geography Meedhoo is an island in Dhaalu Atoll. It is the northernmost inhabited island in the Dhaalu Atoll. The island is southwest of the country's capital, Mal√©. A land reclamation project was initiated in 2014, with the dredging contract awarded to Boskalis to add of land to the island of Meedhoo. Demography Economy The main economical work done in the island is fishing. However construction is developing rapidly as people have started to erect storied houses due to lack of land in the island. In addition some people have been working in nearby tourist resorts since tourism was introduced in the atoll in 1998. The island has 2 mosques for men, (Majid Salam and Masjid Zikra) and 2 mosques for women. There is an island office, [Secretariat of the Meedhoo Council] and a court and a health centre. There is 1 school [Dhaalu Atholhu Madharusa] which teaches from grade 1-12 and a pre- school [Meedhoo Pre-School]. There are no land line telephones on the island except in the island office and the school. However, there is good reception of both Dhiraagu and Wataniya Telecom Maldives networks for mobile phones. There are two phone boxes in the island. TVM Television Maldives including other local television channels such as Raajje TV can be viewed in the island. There are 9 shops and 6 guest shops in the island. In addition two private parties supply gas and staple food items (rice, wheat flour and sugar in the Maldives) to the islanders. The power house is owned by the public until 2011 and was changed to the Central Utilities Limited. 24 hour electricity service is provided. Meedhoo was severely hit by the 2004 tsunami. However the people have worked hard to come back to normal and the island is a fast developing island compared to the other islands in the Maldives. The main threat for the development of the island is its size. Being less than a square kilometer, the island is already overcrowded and there is virtually no land at all for economic activities and building. As a result, the people have started to build houses with 2 or 3 floors. Further, as the island was severely hit by the tsunami the islanders had a tendency to build storied houses as a mean protection. Soil erosion has been another threat for the islanders. However the government has taken some actions to prevent this problem and an area of about 50 feet has been reclaimed around the island in 2006. Transport The island has a natural harbor with comparatively easy access and during early 1960 a jetty was erected which was made of woods and limestone composed from coral. During late 1990s the islanders constructed a small harbor for loading and unloading of goods and to facilitate easy transportation. However, due to increased economic activities and due to raise in number of larger fishing vessels, during the Government of President Mohamed Nasheed, construction of a new harbor was initiated under the government safe harbor project. On 7 February 2011 Ministry of Finance and Treasury announced to find a contractor for the project and the project was awarded to MT H√∏jgaard. The construction work was fully completed on early 2012 and was formally opened for operation on 6 May 2012.

In this context, the term \\"environmental impact assessment\\" (EIA) is usually used when applied to actual projects by individuals or companies and the term \\"strategic environmental assessment\\" (SEA) applies to policies, plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state.MacKinnon, A. J., Duinker, P. N., Walker, T. R. (2018). The Application of Science in Environmental Impact Assessment. Routledge.Eccleston, Charles H. (2011). Environmental Impact Assessment: A Guide to Best Professional Practices. Chapter 5. It is a tool of environmental management forming a part of project approval and decision-making. Environmental assessments may be governed by rules of administrative procedure regarding public participation and documentation of decision making, and may be subject to judicial review. The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as \\"the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made\\". EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision makers to account for environmental values in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.Holder, J., (2004), Environmental Assessment: The Regulation of Decision Making, Oxford University Press, New York; For a comparative discussion of the elements of various domestic EIA systems, see Christopher Wood Environmental Impact Assessment: A Comparative Review (2 ed, Prentice Hall, Harlow, 2002).  History  Environmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s, as part of increasing environmental awareness.The United States Environmental Protection Agency was established on 2 December 1970, in response to elevated concern about environmental pollution. EIAs involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making. In the United States, environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969, with enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act. EIAs have been used increasingly around the world. The number of environmental assessments filed every year \\"has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous Environmental Impact Statements (EIS).\\" An environmental assessment is a \\"mini-EIS designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full- blown Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary.\\" EIA is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur.  Methods  General and industry specific assessment methods are available including: * Industrial products ‚Äì Product environmental life cycle analysis (LCA) is used for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. These EIAs consider activities related to extraction of raw materials, ancillary materials, equipment; production, use, disposal and ancillary equipment.Daniel, S., Tsoulfas, G., Pappis, C., & Rachaniotis, N. (2004) Aggregating and evaluating the results of different Environmental Impact Assessment methods Ecological indicators 4:125‚Äì138 * Genetically modified plants ‚Äì Specific methods available to perform EIAs of genetically modified organisms include GMP-RAM and INOVA.Hitzschky, K., & Silviera, J. (2009) A proposed impact assessment method for genetically modified plants (As-GMP method) Environmental Impact Assessment review 29: 348‚Äì368 * Fuzzy logic ‚Äì EIA methods need measurement data to estimate values of impact indicators. However, many of the environment impacts cannot be quantified, e.g. landscape quality, lifestyle quality and social acceptance. Instead, information from similar EIAs, expert judgment and community sentiment are employed. Approximate reasoning methods known as fuzzy logic can be used.Peche, R., & Rodriguez, E., (2009) Environmental impact Assessment procedure: A new approach based on Fuzzy logic Environmental Impact Assessment review 29:275‚Äì283 A fuzzy arithmetic approach has also been proposedDuarte O.

The objective is to make future EIAs more valid and effective. Two primary considerations are: * Scientific ‚Äì to examine the accuracy of predictions and explain errors * Management ‚Äì to assess the success of mitigation in reducing impacts Audits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the null hypothesis or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the EIA document.Wilson, L., (1998), A Practical Method for Environmental Impact Assessment Audits Environ Impact Assess Rev 18: 59‚Äì71 After an EIA, the precautionary and polluter pays principles may be applied to decide whether to reject, modify or require strict liability or insurance coverage to a project, based on predicted harms. The Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol is a sector-specific method for checking the quality of Environmental and Social assessments and management plans.  Around the world  = Australia = The history of EIA in Australia could be linked to the enactment of the U.S. National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) in 1970, which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement. In Australia, one might say that the EIA procedures were introduced at a State Level prior to that of the Commonwealth (Federal), with a majority of the states having divergent views to the Commonwealth. One of the pioneering states was New South Wales, whose State Pollution Control Commission issued EIA guidelines in 1974. At a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level, this was followed by passing of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (Cth) in 1974. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act) superseded the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (Cth) and is the current central piece for EIA in Australia on a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level. An important point to note is that this federal legislation does not override the validity of the States or Territories environmental and development assessments and approvals; rather the EPBC Act runs as a parallel to the State/Territory Systems.Elliott, M. & Thomas, I. (2009), \\"Environment Impact Assessment in Australia: Theory and Practice, 5th Edn, Federation Press, Sydney\\" Overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one-off accreditation of state processes, as provided for in the EPBC Act.  The Commonwealth Level  The EPBC Act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places. It defines this as matters of \\"national environmental significance\\". The following are the nine matters of such significance: * World Heritage properties; * National Heritage places; * Wetlands of international importance (listed under the Ramsar Convention); * Listed threatened species and ecological communities; * Migratory species protected under international agreements; * Commonwealth marine areas; * the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; * Nuclear actions (including uranium mining); and * Water resources, in relation with coal seam gas development and large coal mining development. In addition to this, the EPBC Act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities. These activities could be by the Commonwealth, or its agents, anywhere in the world or activities on Commonwealth land; and activities that are listed as having a ‚Äòsignificant impact‚Äô on matters of ‚Äònational environment significance'. The EPBC Act comes into play when a person (a proponent) wants an action (often called \\"a proposal\\" or \\"a project\\") assessed for environmental impacts under the EPBC Act, he or she must refer the project to the Department of the Environment and Energy (Commonwealth). This referral is then released to the public and the relevant state, territory and Commonwealth ministers, for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance. The Department of the Environment and Energy assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility. The final discretion on the decision remains of the minister, which is not solely based on matters of national environmental significance but also on the consideration of social and economic impact of the project. The Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Energy cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of national environmental significance, regardless of any other undesirable environmental impacts. This is primarily due to the division of powers between the states and the Federal government, and the Australian Government environment minister not being able to overturn a state decision. There are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of EPBC Act. Depending on the kind of breach, civil penalty (maximum) may go up to $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a body corporate, or for criminal penalty (maximum) of seven years imprisonment and/or penalty of $46,200.  The State and Territory Level  = Australian Capital Territory (ACT) = EIA provisions within Ministerial Authorities in the ACT are found in the Chapters 7 and 8 of the Planning and Development Act 2007 (ACT). EIA in ACT was previously administered with the help of Part 4 of the Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 (Land Act) and Territory Plan (plan for land-use). Note that some EIA may occur in the ACT on Commonwealth land under the EPBC Act (Cth). Further provisions of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 (Cth) may also be applicable particularly to national land and \\"designated areas\\". = New South Wales (NSW) = In New South Wales, the Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (EP&A; Act) establishes two pathways for EIA. The first is under Division 5.2 of the EP&A; Act, which provides for EIA of 'State Significant Infrastructure' projects (from June 2011, this Part replaced the previous Part 3A, which previously covered EIA of major projects). The second is under Part 4 of the EP&A; Act dealing with development assessments for local, regional, and State Significant Developments (other than State Significant Infrastructure). = Northern Territory (NT) = The EIA process in Northern Territory is chiefly administered under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA).The Northern Territory Government, viewed 10 September 2010, Although EAA is the primary tool for EIA in Northern Territory, there are further provisions for proposals in the Inquiries Act 1985 (NT). =Queensland (QLD)= There are four main EIA processes in Queensland.The Environment Defenders, viewed 10 September 2010, EDO factsheet Firstly, under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) for development projects other than mining. Secondly, under the Chapter 3 of the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld) (EP Act) for some mining and petroleum activities. Thirdly, under the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971 (Qld) (State Development Act) for ‚Äòsignificant projects‚Äô. Finally, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) for ‚Äòcontrolled actions‚Äô. South Australia (SA) The local governing tool for EIA in South Australia is the Development Act 1993 (SA). There are three levels of assessment possible under the Act in the form of an environment impact statement (EIS), a public environmental report (PER) or a Development Report (DR). =Tasmania (TAS)= In Tasmania, an integrated system of legislation is used to govern development and approval process, this system is a mixture of the Environmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994 (Tas) (EMPC Act), Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 (Tas) (LUPA Act), State Policies and Projects Act 1993 (Tas) (SPPA), and Resource Management and Planning Appeals Tribunal Act 1993 (Tas). =Victoria (VIC)= The EIA process in Victoria is intertwined with the Environment Effects Act 1978 (Vic) and the Ministerial Guidelines for Assessment of Environmental Effects (made under the s 10 of the EE Act).The Law Handbook, viewed 9 September 2010, =Western Australia (WA)= Part 4 of the Environmental Protection Act 1986 (WA) provides the legislative framework for the EIA process in Western Australia.The Government of Western Australia, viewed 9 September 2010, The EPA Act oversees the planning and development proposals and assesses their likely impacts on the environment. =Canada= In Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transportation), La Forest J of the Supreme Court of Canada described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters, Supreme Court Justice La Forest cited , \\"The basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated: (1) early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking; (2) decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles, to the greatest extent possible, the proponent‚Äôs development desires with environmental protection and preservation.\\" La Forest referred to and who described \\"...environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component\\" that provide \\"...an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development.\\" Justice La Forest addressed his concerns about the implications of Bill C-45 regarding public navigation rights on lakes and rivers that would contradict previous cases. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 2012 (CEAA 2012) \\"and its regulations establish the legislative basis for the federal practice of environmental assessment in most regions of Canada.\\" CEAA 2012 came into force July 6, 2012 and replaces the former Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (1995). EA is defined as a planning tool to identify, understand, assess and mitigate, where possible, the environmental effects of a project. Opposition Environmental Lawyer Dianne Saxe argued that the CEAA 2012 \\"allows the federal government to create mandatory timelines for assessments of even the largest and most important projects, regardless of public opposition.\\" On 3 August 2012 the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency designated nine projects: *Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline Joint Review Panel (JRP) 18 months; * Marathon Platinum Group Metals and Copper Mine Project (JRP): 13 months; * Site C Clean Energy Project (JRP) 8.5 months; Deep Geologic Repository Project (JRP) 17 months; * Enbridge Northern Gateway Project (JRP) 18 months; * Jackpine Mine Expansion Project (JRP) 11.5 months; * Pierre River Mine Project: 8 months; * New Prosperity Gold-Copper Mine Project (JRP) 7.5 months; * Frontier Oil Sands Mine Project (JRP) 8.5 months; * EnCana/Cenovus Shallow Gas Infill Project (JRP) 5 months. Saxe compares these timelines with environmental assessments for the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline. Thomas R. Berger, Royal Commissioner of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry (9 May 1977), worked extremely hard to ensure that industrial development on Aboriginal people's land resulted in benefits to those indigenous people. On 22 April 2013, NDP MP Megan Leslie issued a statement claiming that the Harper government's recent changes to \\"fish habitat protection, the Navigable Waters Protection Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act\\", along with gutting existing laws and making cuts to science and research, \\"will be disastrous, not only for the environment but also for Canadians‚Äô health and economic prosperity.\\" On 26 September 2012, Leslie argued that with the changes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act that came into effect 6 July 2012, \\"seismic testing, dams, wind farms and power plants\\" no longer required any federal environmental assessment. She also claimed that because the CEAA 2012‚Äîwhich she claimed was rushed through Parliament‚Äîdismantled the CEAA 1995, the Oshawa ethanol plant project would no longer have a full federal environmental assessment. Mr. Peter Kent (Minister of the Environment) explained that the CEAA 2012 \\"provides for the Government of Canada and the Environmental Assessment Agency to focus on the large and most significant projects that are being proposed across the country.\\" The 2,000 to 3,000-plus smaller screenings that were in effect under CEAA 1995 became the \\"responsibility of lower levels of government but are still subject to the same strict federal environmental laws.\\" Anne Minh-Thu Quach, MP for Beauharnois‚ÄîSalaberry, QC, argued that the mammoth budget bill dismantled 50 years of environmental protection without consulting Canadians about the \\"colossal changes they are making to environmental assessments.\\" She claimed that the federal government is entering into \\"limited consultations, by invitation only, months after the damage was done.\\" =China= The Environmental Impact Assessment Law (EIA Law) requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction. However, if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement, the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau (EPB) may require the developer to do a make- up environmental assessment. If the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time, only then is the EPB authorized to fine the developer. Even so, the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about US$25,000, a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects. The lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction. China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004, including three hydro-power plants under the Three Gorges Project Company. Although one month later (Note as a point of reference, that the typical EIA for a major project in the USA takes one to two years.), most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction, reportedly having passed the environmental assessment, the fact that these key projects' construction was ever suspended was notable. A joint investigation by SEPA and the Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 showed that 30‚Äì40% of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required, while in some areas only 6‚Äì7% did so. This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years. SEPA alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, observed Professor Wang Canfa, director of the centre to help environmental victims at China University of Political Science and Law. In fact, according to Wang, the rate of China's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10%. = Egypt = Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) EIA is implemented in Egypt under the umbrella of the Ministry of state for environmental affairs. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) is responsible for the EIA services. In June 1997, the responsibility of Egypt's first full-time Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was assigned as stated in the Presidential Decree no.275/1997. From thereon, the new ministry has focused, in close collaboration with the national and international development partners, on defining environmental policies, setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development. According to the Law 4/1994 for the Protection of the Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982. At the central level, EEAA represents the executive arm of the Ministry. The purpose of EIA is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development. The long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs. EIA is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach. EIA must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the Law for the Environment. =EU= A wide range of instruments exist in the Environmental policy of the European Union. Among them the European Union has established a mix of mandatory and discretionary procedures to assess environmental impacts. Directive (85/337/EEC) on Environmental Impact Assessments (known as the EIA Directive) was first introduced in 1985, amended in 1997, amended again in 2003 following EU signature of the 1998 Aarhus Convention, and once more in 2009. The initial Directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been codified in Directive 2011/92/EU of 13 December 2011.DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of some public and private projects on the environment from Eur-Lex In 2001, the issue was enlarged to include the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive (2001/42/EC), which was amended by Directive 2014/52/EU of 16 April 2014.Directive 2014/52/EU amending Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, 16 April 2014 Under the EU directive, a compliant EIA must provide certain information in seven key areas: # Description of the project #* Description of actual project and site description #* Break the project down into its key components, i.e. construction, operations, decommissioning #* For each component list all of the sources of environmental disturbance #* For each component all the inputs and outputs must be listed, e.g., air pollution, noise, hydrology # Alternatives that have been considered #* Examine alternatives that have been considered #* Example: in a biomass power station, will the fuel be sourced locally or nationally? # Description of the environment #* List of all aspects of the environment that may be affected by the development #* Example: populations, fauna, flora, air, soil, water, humans, landscape, cultural heritage #* This section is best carried out with the help of local experts, e.g. the RSPB in the UK # Description of the significant effects on the environment #* The word significant is crucial here as the definition can vary #* 'Significant' must be defined #* The most frequent method used here is use of the Leopold matrix #* The matrix is a tool used in the systematic examination of potential interactions #* Example: in a windfarm development a significant impact may be collisions with birds # Mitigation #* This is where EIA is most useful #* Once section 4 is complete, it is obvious where impacts are greatest #* Using this information in ways to avoid negative impacts should be developed #* Best working with the developer with this section as they know the project best #* Using the windfarm example again, construction might take place outside of bird nesting seasons, or removal of hardstanding on a potentially contaminated land site might take place outside of the rainy season. # Non-technical summary (EIS) #* The EIA is in the public domain and be used in the decision making process #* It is important that the information is available to the public #* This section is a summary that does not include jargon or complicated diagrams #* It should be understood by the informed lay-person # Lack of know-how/technical difficulties #* This section is to advise any areas of weakness in knowledge #* It can be used to focus areas of future research #* Some developers see the EIA as a starting block for poor environmental management Annexed projects All projects are either classified as Annex 1 or Annex 2 projects. Those lying in Annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, power stations, etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in Annex 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in Annex 3 of codified Directive 2011/92/EU. The Netherlands EIA was implemented in Dutch legislation on September 1, 1987. The categories of projects which require an EIA are summarised in Dutch legislation, the Wet milieubeheer. The use of thresholds for activities makes sure that EIA is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment. For projects and plans which fit these criteria, an EIA report is required. The EIA report defines a.o. the proposed initiative, it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact.List of criteria for EIA/SEA United Kingdom The EU Directives concerning environmental impact assessment are implemented in England through the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017, which also apply to projects serving national defence purposes in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.UK Government, Environmental Impact Assessment, updated 15 March 2019, accessed 22 October 2019 =Hong Kong= EIA in Hong Kong is regulated by the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance 1997, which became effective in 1998. The original proposal to construct the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line overground across the Long Valley failed to get through EIA, and the Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway Corporation had to change its plan and build the railway underground. In April 2011, the EIA of the Hong Kong section of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge was found to have breached the ordinance, and was declared unlawful. The appeal by the government was allowed in September 2011. However, it was estimated that this EIA court case had increased the construction cost of the Hong Kong section of the bridge by HK$6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices. = Iraq = The Ministry of Environment of the federal government of Iraq is in charge of issuing Environmental compliance certificates based on an EIA report prepared by professional consultant and thoroughly reviewed by MOE. Any project or activity prior to its establishment or even already existing project has to be approved and obtain such certificate from the MOE. Projects are classified into 3 categories; ‚ÄúA‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù and ‚ÄúC‚Äù. EIA report is usually obligatory for those projects and activities falling under categories ‚ÄúA‚Äù (large-scale) and ‚ÄúB‚Äù (small-scale) that may have considerable impacts on environment. An example of ‚ÄúA‚Äù category activities such as: dams and reservoirs, forestry production projects, industrial plants, irrigation, drainage and flood control, land clearance and leveling, port and harbor development, river basin development, thermal power and hydro-power development, manufacture, transportation and use of pesticides or other hazardous materials, hazardous waste management and disposal....etc. An example of ‚ÄúB‚Äù category activities such as: agro-industries, electrical transmission, renewable energy, rural electrification, tourism, rehabilitation or maintenance of highway or rural roads, rehabilitation or modification of existing industrial facilities...etc. preparation of EIA report is usually exempt for projects falling under category ‚ÄúC‚Äù that may have low to no impact on environment, and example of ‚ÄúC‚Äù category activities: small fish breeding pond, institutional development, most human resources projects...etc. The main environmental legislations in Iraq are: Law No.64 for cities and land use (1965), Law No.21 for noise prevention (1966), Law No.25 for system of rivers and other water resources protection (1967), Law No.99 for ionized radiation (1980), Law No.89 for public health (drinking water provision, sanitation and environmental monitoring (1981), Law No.79 for protection and improvement of environment (1986), Environmental criteria for agricultural, industrial and public service projects (1990), Law No.3 for protection and improvement of environment (1997), Law No.2 for water systems protection (2001), Law No.44 for creation of Ministry of Environment instead of the council of protection and improvement of environment (2003), Law No.27 for environmental protection and improvement (2009), Law No.4 for protection of ambient air system (2012). Meanwhile, Environmental Protection and Improvement Board in the regional government of Kurdistan in the northern Iraq (Erbil, Duhok, Sulaimany and Garmyan) is responsible of issuing Environmental compliance certificate, the board was established according to law No.3 Environmental protection and improvement board in Iraqi Kurdistan Region (2010). The board is responsible of issuing such certificate for all projects and activities except of petroleum operation which EIA process is organized and implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources of Kurdistan Regional government. The same Iraqi Environmental Legislations mentioned are adopted but the procedure of EIA in Iraqi-Kurdistan region government may differ from the one in the Federal government of Iraq. = India = The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) of India has been in a great effort in Environmental Impact Assessment in India. The main laws in action are the Water Act(1974), the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972), the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981) and the Environment (Protection) Act (1986), Biological Diversity Act(2002).Shibani Ghosh, \\"Demystifying the Environmental Clearance Process in India\\" , NUJS LAW REVIEW, January 2, 2015 The responsible body for this is the Central Pollution Control Board. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data. Primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment (like air quality data, water quality data etc.). Secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends, based on a few months of primary data, has limitations. Ideally, the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area. In many EIA studies, the secondary data needs could be as high as 80% of the total data requirement. EIC is the repository of one-stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in India. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) experience in India indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottleneck in achieving the full benefits of EIA. The environment being a multi-disciplinary subject, a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data. However, no single organization in India tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners. Further, environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the EIA. This makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators. With this background, the Environmental Information Centre (EIC) has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearinghouse of environmental information that can be used by MoEF, project proponents, consultants, NGOs and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in India. EIC caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country. EIC stores data in GIS format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to EIA stakeholders in a cost-effective and timely manner. So that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc., In 2020, the Government of India proposed a new EIA 2020 Draft, which was widely criticized for heavily diluting the EIA. Many Environmental groups started a campaign demanding the withdrawal of the Draft, in face of these campaigns, the Government of India resorted to banning/blocking the websites of these groups. =Korea, South= Recycling culture and policy Ministry of Environment =Malaysia= In Malaysia, Section 34A, Environmental Quality Act, 1974 requires developments that have significant impact to the environment are required to conduct the Environmental impact assessment. = Nepal = In Nepal, EIA has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s. In the planning history of Nepal, the sixth plan (1980‚Äì85), for the first time, recognized the need for EIA with the establishment of Environmental Impact Study Project (EISP) under the Department of Soil Conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of EIA in infrastructure development projects. However, the government of Nepal enunciated environment conservation-related policies in the seventh plan (NPC, 1985‚Äì1990). To enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements, a series of guidelines were developed, thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans and projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system. In addition, it has also emphasized that EIAs of industry, tourism, water resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental projects be conducted. In Nepal, the government's Environmental Impact Assessment Guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the Environment Protection Act (EPA) of 1997 and the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) of 1997 (EPA and EPR have been enforced since 24 and 26 June 1997 respectively in Nepal) to internalizing the environmental assessment system. The process institutionalized the EIA process in development proposals and enactment, which makes the integration of IEE and EIA legally binding to the prescribed projects. The projects, requiring EIA or IEE, are included in Schedules 1 and 2 of the EPR, 1997 (GoN/MoLJPA 1997). = New Zealand = In New Zealand, EIA is usually referred to as Assessment of Environmental Effects (AEE). The first use of EIA's dates back to a Cabinet minute passed in 1974 called Environmental Protection and Enhancement Procedures. This had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments. When the Resource Management Act was passed in 1991, an EIA was required as part of a resource consent application. Section 88 of the Act specifies that the AEE must include \\"such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment\\". While there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application (Sections 36A and Schedule 4), proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under Section 93. = Russian Federation = , the state authority responsible for conducting the State EIA in Russia has been split between two Federal bodies: 1) Federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources ‚Äì a part of the Russian Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment and 2) Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control. The two main pieces of environmental legislation in Russia are the Federal Law 'On Ecological Expertise', 1995 and the 'Regulations on Assessment of Impact from Intended Business and Other Activity on Environment in the Russian Federation', 2000.Department of Environmental Protection, Russia ;Federal Service for monitoring the use of natural resources In 2006, the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment, created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas. There has been some success in this area, as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered Amur leopard in the Russian Far East. ;Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control The government's decision to hand over control over several important procedures, including state EIA in the field of all types of energy projects, to the Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control has caused major controversy and elicited criticism from environmental groups, which have blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state EIA. The main problem concerning State EIA in Russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned Federal bodies. = Sri Lanka = The National Environmental Act, 1998 requires environmental impact assessment for large scale projects in sensitive areas. It is enforced by the Central Environmental Authority. = Ukraine = The new law of Ukraine on evaluation of impact on surroundings prescribes the requirements of environmental safety, rational use of national resources, minimizing of harmful impact on surroundings in the process of making managerial decisions about planned activity. The designing of the conclusion of evaluation of impact is a result of its conducting. The key moment of the law on evaluation of impact on surroundings is a substitution of conclusion of state environmental expertise on the conclusion of evaluation of impact on surroundings. Business entity is forbidden to conduct or to start its planned activity without the conclusion of impact on surroundings. = United States = The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), enacted in 1970, established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions, federally funded activities or federally permitted/licensed activities that in the U. S. is termed \\"environmental review\\" or simply \\"the NEPA process.\\"United States. National Environmental Policy Act, P.L. 91-190 , , et seq. Approved January 1, 1970. The law also created the Council on Environmental Quality, which promulgated regulations to codify the law's requirements.U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. \\"NEPA and Agency Planning.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, . Under United States environmental law an Environmental Assessment (EA) is compiled to determine the need for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS as soon as significance is known. Certain actions of federal agencies must be preceded by the NEPA process. Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate, intentionally or otherwise. NEPA requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance. The purpose of NEPA process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision.  Environmental assessment  An environmental assessment (EA) is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The certified release of an Environmental Assessment results in either a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or an EIS.Eccleston, Charles H. and J. Peyton Doub (2010). Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User‚Äôs Guide to Best Professional Practices. . The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), which oversees the administration of NEPA, issued regulations for implementing the NEPA in 1979. Eccleston reports that the NEPA regulations barely mention preparation of EAs. This is because the EA was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an EIS. But today, because EISs are so much longer and complicated to prepare, federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing EISs by using EAs, even in cases where the use of EAs may be inappropriate. The ratio of EAs that are being issued compared to EISs is about 100 to 1. Likewise, even the preparation of an accurate EA is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal. Federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement NEPA environmental review, by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under NEPA, and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted. = Content = The Environmental Assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to: # briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) # Demonstrate compliance with the act when no EIS is required # facilitate the preparation of an EIS when a FONSI cannot be demonstrated The Environmental Assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by NEPA 102(2)(E), and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable, plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions. The action agency must approve an EA before it is made available to the public. The EA is made public through notices of availability by local, state, or regional clearing houses, often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area. = Structure = The structure of a generic Environmental Assessment is as follows: # Summary # Introduction #* Background #* Purpose and Need for Action #* Proposed Action #* Decision Framework #* Public Involvement #* Issues # Alternatives, including the Proposed Action #* Alternatives #* Mitigation Common to All Alternatives #* Comparison of Alternatives # Environmental Consequences # Consultation and Coordination = Procedure = The EA becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published, usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal. There is a 15-day review period required for an Environmental Assessment (30 days if exceptional circumstances) while the document is made available for public commentary, and a similar time for any objection to improper process. Commenting on the Draft EA is typically done in writing or email, submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability. An EA does not require a public hearing for verbal comments. Following the mandated public comment period, the lead action agency responds to any comments, and certifies either a FONSI or a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in its public environmental review record. The preparation of an EIS then generates a similar but more lengthy, involved and expensive process.  Environmental impact statement  The adequacy of an environmental impact statement (EIS) can be challenged in federal court. Major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency's failure to prepare an acceptable EIS. One prominent example was the Westway landfill and highway development in and along the Hudson River in New York City.Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 701 F.2d 1011, 18 ERC 1748. (2d Cir., 02/25/1983) Another prominent case involved the Sierra Club suing the Nevada Department of Transportation over its denial of the club's request to issue a supplemental EIS addressing air emissions of particulate matter and hazardous air pollutants in the case of widening U.S. Route 95 through Las Vegas. The case reached the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court's final decision. The case was settled prior to the court's final decision. Several state governments that have adopted \\"little NEPAs,\\" state laws imposing EIS requirements for particular state actions. Some of those state laws such as the California Environmental Quality Act refer to the required environmental impact study as an environmental impact report. This variety of state requirements produces voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects, but also in insufficiently researched scientific domains. For example, in a seemingly routine Environmental Impact Report for the city of Monterey, California, information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of Hickman's potentilla, a rare coastal wildflower.C.M. Hogan, G. Deghi, M. Papineau et al., Environmental Impact Report for the Pebble Beach Properties project by Del Monte Forest, Earth Metrics Inc. Prepared for the city of Monterey and State of California Clearinghouse (1992)U.S. Federal Register: August 2, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 148, Pages 39326-39337)  Transboundary application  Environmental threats do not respect national borders. International pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, aquifers, farmland, the weather and biodiversity. Global climate change is transnational. Specific pollution threats include acid rain, radioactive contamination, debris in outer space, stratospheric ozone depletion and toxic oil spills. The Chernobyl disaster, precipitated by a nuclear accident on April 26, 1986, is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution.Sands, P., (1989), The Environment, Community and International Law, Harvard International Law Lournal, 393, p402 Environmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (UNCHE or Stockholm Conference) held in Stockholm in 1972 and the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED or Rio Summit, Rio Conference, or Earth Summit) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection.Weiss, E., (1999), Understanding Compliance with International Environmental Agreements: The Bakers Dozen Myths, Univ Richmond L.R. 32, 1555 The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo Convention) was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary EIA. However, as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate, most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements. There is also the issue of international enforcement.Wolfrum, R., & Matz, N., (2003), Conflicts in International Environmental Law, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Ausl√§ndisches √ñffentliches Recht und V√∂lkerrech This has led to duplications and failures, in part due to an inability to enforce agreements. An example is the failure of many international fisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises.Young, O., (1999), The Effectiveness of International Environmental Regimes, MIT Press  Criticism  According to Jay et al., EIA is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool. There is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited. Improved training for practitioners, guidance on bestpractice and continuing research have all been proposed. EIAs have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time. No accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries. The boundary refers to ‚Äòthe spatial and temporal boundary of the proposal‚Äôs effects‚Äô. This boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor, but in practice, almost all EIAs address only direct and immediate on-site effects. Development causes both direct and indirect effects. Consumption of goods and services, production, use and disposal of building materials and machinery, additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services, mining and refining, etc., all have environmental impacts. The indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an EIA. Proposals such as airports or shipyards cause wide-ranging national and international effects, which should be covered in EIAs. Broadening the scope of EIA can benefit the conservation of threatened species. Instead of concentrating on the project site, some EIAs employed a habitat-based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment. As a result, alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species, rather than local subpopulations, can be assessed. Thissen and Agusdinata have argued that little attention is given to the systematic identification and assessment of uncertainties in environmental studies which is critical in situations where uncertainty cannot be easily reduced by doing more research. In line with this, Maier et al. have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process. In such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty. These proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed. Tenney et al. and Wood et al. have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to EIAs predictions from a number of case studies worldwide. The gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in EIAs and the impacts measured during, or following project implementation. In explaining this trend, Tenney et al. have highlighted major causes such as project changes, modelling errors, errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed. Some approaches to deal with uncertainty in EIA have been reviewed in.

He was created Baron Grosvenor in 1761 and in 1784 became both Viscount Belgrave and Earl Grosvenor. Early life Richard Grosvenor was born at Eaton Hall, Cheshire, the elder son of Sir Robert Grosvenor, 6th Baronet. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, graduating MA in 1751 and DCL in 1754. Political life He became Member of Parliament for Chester in 1754 and continued to represent the city until 1761, when he became Baron Grosvenor and was elevated to the House of Lords. He was mayor of Chester in 1759 and in 1769 he paid for the building of the Eastgate in the city. Grosvenor extended his estate by the purchase of the village of Belgrave, and the manor of Eccleston in 1769. He succeeded as 7th baronet on the death of his father in 1755.Farrell, S. M. (2004) (online edition 2008) 'Grosvenor, Richard, first Earl Grosvenor (1731‚Äì1802)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Retrieved on 10 April 2010. Initially, Grosvenor was, like his father, a Tory, but later he came to support the ideas of William Pitt the elder. In 1758 he declared himself in favour of the Pitt‚ÄìNewcastle ministry and following this he was created Baron Grosvenor in 1761. However, when the Tory Earl of Bute became Prime Minister the following year, Grosvenor changed his allegiance. Then, when Pitt was returned to power in the Chatham Ministry of 1766‚Äì68, Grosvenor returned to support him. During the 1770s he supported Lord North during the American War of Independence. He voted against Fox's India Bill in 1783 and was rewarded by William Pitt the Younger with title of Earl Grosvenor the following year. Personal interests Otherwise, Grosvenor was interested in the acquisition of art and in horse racing with Potoooooooo. He was also the principal patron of the satirist and journalist William Gifford. For his art collection he acquired works from Italy, and also bought paintings from Benjamin West (including his painting of The Death of General Wolfe), Thomas Gainsborough, Richard Wilson and George Stubbs. In 1788 a collection of literary pieces composed at Eaton was published as The Eaton Chronicle, or The Salt-Box. Grosvenor was appointed as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1777. To breed his race horses Grosvenor established studs at Wallasey and at Eaton. His horses won the Derby on three occasions and the Oaks six times. His racing silks were yellow, with a black cap. In the 1760s, Grosvenor occupied Aubrey House, in the Campden Hill area of Holland Park. A London County Council blue plaque commemorates Grosvenor and other residents of the house. Family On 19 July 1764 Grosvenor married Henrietta Vernon, daughter of Henry Vernon of Hilton Park, Staffordshire; they had four sons. However the marriage was not happy, and Henrietta had an affair with Henry, Duke of Cumberland, the younger brother of George III. The couple were discovered in flagrante delicto in 1769, which led to Grosvenor bringing an action against the Duke for \\"criminal conversation\\" (that is, adultery). He was awarded damages of ¬£10,000, which together with costs, amounted to an award of ¬£13,000 (¬£ in 2015). But Grosvenor was also known to be guilty of adultery himself, regularly seeking out prostitutes around Leicester Square, so he could not sue for divorce. The couple separated and he settled an annual allowance of ¬£1,200 (¬£ in 2015) on his estranged wife, who entered the demi- monde and was a leading member of The New Female Coterie. Death Grosvenor died at Earls Court in 1802 and was buried in the family vault at St Mary's Church, Eccleston. His assets amounted to \\"under ¬£70,000\\" (¬£ in 2015), but his debts were \\"over ¬£100,000\\" (¬£ in 2015).

Sofia Falcone made her live-action debut in the fourth season of Gotham played by Crystal Reed. Publication history Sofia Falcone Gigante first appeared in Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's 1996 miniseries Batman: The Long Halloween as the daughter of crime lord Carmine Falcone. She returned in the sequel Batman: Dark Victory where she became the Hangman killer to avenge her father's death. Loeb stated in an interview that he paralleled the Falcone family to that of the Corleone family, with Sofia's temper matching that of Sonny Corleone. Fictional character biography =The Long Halloween= When the Holiday killer started killing members of the Falcone family, Carmine has his daughter Sofia released from prison early to help him find who the killer was. In the end the killer was apparently revealed to be Alberto Falcone, Carmine's son and Sofia's brother. Afterwards, Carmine was killed by Gotham's district attorney Harvey Dent, who became Two-Face after having his face splashed with acid, and Sofia fell out of the Falcone's penthouse window after being attacked by Catwoman. =Dark Victory= Sofia is revealed to have survived her fall, now in a wheelchair and wearing a neck brace, and is the new head of the Falcone family. Meanwhile, a new serial killer known as the Hangman is killing the cops of Gotham City with a noose, all of whom had a connection to Harvey Dent. In the end, Sofia is revealed to be the killer, having faked her paralysis. She kills her brother Alberto for being a \\"disappointment\\" to the family, and then tries to kill Two-Face, but Batman stops her. While she is battling him, Two-Face shoots her in the head. In other media =Television= Sofia Falcone appears in Season 4 of Gotham, portrayed by Crystal Reed. The daughter of Carmine Falcone, and sister of Mario Calvi Falcone she first appears in \\"A Dark Knight: They Who Hide Behind Masks\\" where she teams up and begins an affair with Jim Gordon to take down Oswald Cobblepot, who has taken over Gotham City. She befriends Cobblepot and opens an orphanage in Gotham. Teaming up with the Gotham City Sirens, she later uses Cobblepot's friendship with an orphan boy to start a war against him. Also, she is revealed to have hired Professor Pyg, a serial killer who targets cops working for Cobblepot, and to have put out a hit that killed her own father. In addition, she orchestrates events that led to Cobblepot being remanded to Arkham Asylum, gains Victor Zsasz's allegiance, and kills Professor Pyg. She then blackmails Gordon into working for her. When Gordon goes back on their arrangement, she works to hurt him by pressuring her sister-in-law and Gordon's ex, Leslie Thompkins, into giving her control over the Narrows. When Thompkins refuses, Sofia breaks her hand with a hammer, and gives control of the Narrows to Thompkins' rival, Sampson. In the episode \\"A Dark Knight: The Sinking Ship, The Great Applause\\", Sofia leads Zsasz, Headhunter, and two Falcone crime family operatives to Spa Bo'sh Sumka in order to target Arthur Penn, her father's former accountant. While Zsasz and Headhunter go after Harvey Bullock and Penn, Sofia engages Gordon in a gunfight and seriously injures him. However, before Sofia can kill him, Thompkins shoots her in the head. As Gordon recuperates in the hospital, Bullock tells him that Sofia is in a coma.

It was the first American torpedo to be originally designed for launching from aircraft only. They were also used on PT boats. Design Mark 13 torpedo's general arrangement, as published in a service manual Douglas TBD Devastator making a practice drop with a Mark 13 torpedo, October 20, 1941 Originating in a 1925 design study, the Mark 13 was subject to changing USN requirements through its early years with resulting on-and-off development. Early models--even when dropped low to the water at slow speeds--were prone to running on the surface, or not running at all. By late 1944, the design had been modified to allow reliable drops from as high as , at speeds up to .

The Mark 13 ran slower than the Mark 14 torpedo. 17,000 were produced during the war.Milford, Frederick J. U. S. Navy Torpedoes; Part One: The great torpedo scandal, 1941‚Äì43. The Submarine Review, April 1996. Archived on October 14, 2007. Wartime development By 1942, poor combat performance had made it apparent that there were problems with the Mark 13, as 42 out of 51 torpedo bombers were lost at the Battle of Midway without scoring a single hit: The Committee assigned the California Institute of Technology to undertake the first systematic study of the dynamics of aerial launched torpedoes. Tank tests using scale models revealed that the \\"low and slow\\" approach that had been presumed necessary for a successful drop was actually counterproductive: striking the water at a flat angle frequently caused the after body of the torpedo to ‚Äúslap‚Äù, damaging the mechanism. Full scale testing simulated aerial torpedo drops under controlled conditions by pneumatically launching full size torpedoes down a 300 foot slide on California's Morris Dam into a mountain lake known for its clarity, allowing all aspects of the water entry to be examined utilizing high-speed photography. Fragile or vulnerable components were improved, tested, refined, and tested again. Improved components were shipped to Newport Rhode Island for air drop testing ‚Äì 4,300 drops in all. The Caltech study led to the development of \\"drag rings\\" that slowed and stabilized the torpedo in flight and cushioned its impact with the water and \\"shroud rings\\" (also known as the \\"ring tail\\") that reinforced the vulnerable tail fins. They also tested and developed a box-shaped wooden tail that stabilized the torpedo in flight and absorbed energy as it was stripped off as the torpedo entered the water, based on the Kyoban series of similar aerodynamic tails, first developed in 1936 by the Japanese for their Type 91 torpedo used at the attack on Pearl Harbor, but first observed at the Battle of the Coral Sea on May 8, 1942. Experiment soon revealed that optimum water entry angles were approximately 22-32 degrees relative to the plane of the surface: the torpedo might plunge as deep as 50 feet but it would return to its set depth and bearing if the mechanism was undamaged. This enabled the US Navy to develop a series of attack profiles that varied the combination of speed and altitude to produce the ideal 22-32 degree water entry angle. For the Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber this meant drop altitudes as high as 800 feet and drop speeds as high as 260 knots which the Avenger could achieve by diving to the release point. Multiple attack profile options also allowed strike planners to de-conflict attack routes by assigning each torpedo squadron a different attack profile, greatly reducing the risk of mid-air collision over the target. Finally, there was the added benefit of increased range, as the torpedo traveled a significant distance in the air before entering the water (up to 1000 yards when released at 800 feet and 300 mph). Combined with radar that delivered the exact range to the target, the results proved to be remarkable: Deployment on PT boats A Mark 13 being launched from a PT-boat In 1942, US Navy Patrol Torpedo (PT) boats operating in the South Pacific were experiencing shortages of 21 inch Mark 8 and Mark 10 torpedoes and confronting large numbers of Japanese Daihatsu barges, which were generally too shallow to attack with torpedoes. Installing larger batteries of heavy machine guns and cannon on PT boats to deal with the barges was attempted. Such installations caused weight and stability problems, and torpedoes were still needed to counter larger Japanese vessels such as destroyers and cruisers. One solution, implemented in 1943, was to replace each of the PT Boat's two to four Mark 8 torpedoes, and their Mark 18 torpedo tubes, with the significantly lighter Mark 13, carried in lightweight Mark 1 launching racks, at a total savings of more than each. The shorter Mark 13 also took up less deck space. The racks took advantage of the Mark 13's air-drop capability by simply allowing the torpedoes to roll over the side, eliminating the risks of a \\"hot run\\" within the tube and the flare of burning grease that sometimes gave away the PT boat's position upon firing. The Mark 13 also had the advantage of a significantly larger warhead ( vs. ), containing the significantly more powerful explosive Torpex, which was approximately 1.5 times more powerful per pound than TNT. The Mark 13's shorter range and slower speed were considered acceptable tradeoffs for boats that usually operated at night and relied on stealth to reach firing position.

The poem is the third longest of Chaucer's works, after The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Criseyde, and is possibly the first significant work in English to use the iambic pentameter or decasyllabic couplets which he later used throughout The Canterbury Tales. This form of the heroic couplet would become a significant part of English literature possibly inspired by Chaucer. The prologue describes how Chaucer is reprimanded by the god of love and his queen, Alceste, for his works--such as Troilus and Criseyde--depicting women in a poor light. Criseyde is made to seem inconstant in love in that earlier work, and Alceste demands a poem of Chaucer extolling the virtues of women and their good deeds. The incomplete nature of the poem is suggested by Chaucer's Retraction from The Canterbury Tales which calls the work the xxv. Ladies. Fifteen and nineteen are also numbers used to describe the work. In the prologue several women are mentioned --Esther, Penelope, Marcia Catonis (wife of Cato the younger), Lavinia, Polyxena and Laodamia--whose stories are not recorded and the nineteen ladies in waiting of Alceste mentioned in the prologue might suggest an unfulfilled structure. The command of queen Alceste is said, by John Lydgate in The Fall of Princes, to be a poetic account of an actual request for a poem by Anne of Bohemia who came to England in 1382 to marry Richard II. If true this would make Chaucer an early poet laureate. Joan of Kent, Richard's mother, is also sometimes considered a model for Alceste. The supposed royal command is one suggested reason for the poem's unfinished state as Chaucer got bored with the task and gave up. Several passages hint at Chaucer's dissatisfaction: These lines, late in the poem, could simply be occupatio or paralipsis, the rhetorical device common in Chaucer of bringing up a subject merely to say you will not mention it. Whether the poem's state is due to Chaucer becoming bored with it is uncertain, but it is not now regarded among his best work, despite being popular when first written. One early fan is Chaucer's own character, the Man of Law, who praises Chaucer and the poem which he calls Seintes Legende of Cupide. The work is rather inconsistent in tone, with tragedy mixed uncomfortably with comedy, and the legends are all somewhat similar with little of the characterisation which is key to The Canterbury Tales. Some scholars have conjectured that the work is deliberately poorly written and the work is actually a satire against women although this is not widely agreed with. Another idea is that it is a satire on the idea of taking stories of classical origin and twisting them to give them contemporary moral meanings. This would suggest that the poem is not only an early use of heroic couplets but also one of the first mock-heroic works in English. The nature of the poem with its separate legends makes dating it difficult but it is clearly placed between Troilus and the Tales around 1386/1388. Chaucer seems to have returned to the work a decade later to rewrite the prologue, but the latter text, which survives in only one manuscript, is generally considered inferior to the original. Tennyson used the poem as theme for his own poem A Dream of Fair Women. Summary of the poems The Legend of Good Women is Chaucer's third longest poem. The Legend of Good Women is often regarded as a piece of work from Chaucer's prime. The poet recounts ten stories of virtuous women in nine sections. The ‚Äúlegend‚Äù is Chaucer‚Äôs retelling of several stories that he long admired Cleopatra, Thisbe, Medea, Phyllis, Hypsipyle, Ariadne, Lucretia, Philomela, Hypermnestra, and most notable Dido.The work is a similar structure to the later Monk's Tale and like that tale, and many of his other works, seems to be unfinished. Chaucer's sources for the legends include: Virgil's Aeneid, Vincent of Beauvais, Guido delle Colonne's Historia destructionis Troiae, Gaius Julius Hyginus' Fabulae and Ovid's Metamorphoses and Heroides. The Legend of Cleopatra: Mark Anthony leaves his wife (the sister of Octavian) in search for another wife. He finds Cleopatra and falls in love with her. They get married and have a great feast but shortly after the feast Mark Anthony learns that Octavian is still angry and is sailing to meet him. Cleopatra and Mark Anthony sail out and meet Octavian. Mark Anthony is defeated in battle so to save his reputation he stabs himself. Cleopatra hears of the death of Mark Anthony and mourns his death extensively. She had sworn that whatever happened to him, would happen to her. So she filled a pit next to Mark Anthony‚Äôs shrine with poisonous snake and laid herself into a final rest next to him. The Legend of Thisbe: Thisbe and Pyramus love each other dearly. However, they are not able to be together. They talked through the crack in the wall that separated their dwellings. They planned to meet at a tree later that evening. Thisbe arrives and sits under the tree waiting for Pyramus to show up. Suddenly a lion appears. The lion‚Äôs mouth is covered in blood so Thisbe decides to flee. While fleeing, she drops the veil that she was wearing. Pyramus finally arrives at the tree and finds the veil. He assumes the worst and decides to stab himself with his sword. Thisbe soon returns to find her lover dead. She takes the same sword and kills herself. The Legend of Dido: Aeneas is told by Venus that he is to seek out Dido and win her heart.When Aeneas is out hunting with Dido, it begins to storm. They run to seek shelter in a cave. They soon notice that they are alone in the cave. Aeneas confesses his love for Dido. At first, Dido refuses to confess that she loves Aeneas back. However, she finally admits to him that she loves him dearly. Aeneas begins to court Dido but eventually he loses interest in Dido. He starts to plan how he will leave her and not return. Dido learns that he is trying to leave and she attempts to stop him from going. Aeneas leaves despite Dido trying to stop him. Dido then calls upon her sister to prepare a funeral arrangement. When Dido sees the funeral arrangement she takes Aeneas‚Äô sword and stabs herself. The Legend of Hypsipyle and Medea: The intro of this legend calls Jason out for the way he lies to the two women about how he would die for love. The intro also state how the unfaithful lover will receives more delight than the faithful one. The Legend of Hypsipyle at beginning tells the reader that Jason is the king‚Äôs nephew and then continues on to say he was once honorable. King Pelias (Jason‚Äôs uncle) became worried that Jason would be so well liked so he plotted to send him to his death. King Pelias told him that he wants him to go on a quest to find a treasure. He tells Jason that he will pick the men to go with him and pay for the expedition. Jason being young and courage accepts. He is granted a crew (Hercules is part of his crew) and sails to the island where he meets Hypsipyle. Hypsipyle sent a man to ask is Jason required any help and he tells the messenger to thank the Queen but they only want favorable winds. Jason meets the Queen at the beach and greets her. She examines him and notes that he must be of nobility. Jason stays at Hypsipyle‚Äôs a while waiting on the good wind, during that time Jason woes her. Jason eventually marries Hypsipyle and has children with her. He took all her property and then set sail and left her. She never saw him again. Hypsipyle decided to be faithful to her husband and dies alone and sad. The legend of Medea starts off with Jason arriving at Colchis and he is looking for a woman to satisfy his lust. Jason goes to the king and requests permission to find the golden fleece. The king grants his request and is so honored that he sits Jason next to his daughter, Madea.Madea had previously heard of Jason‚Äôs reputation and begins to fall in love with him. She tells him she is worried about him attempting to find the golden fleece. He tells her that he is honoured that she is worried about his safety.She explains to him all the dangerous things he would face. She tells him that she can help save him from some of these dangers but if she does he will become her faithful husband. Jason succeeded and he brought Madea across the sea to his home land. However, Jason does the same thing to Madea that he did to Hypsipyle. He married her, took her treasures, had children with her and then abandons her. The Legend of Lucretia: When Rome was under siege, Sextus Tarquinius goes to his friend Collatinus‚Äôs house. They go into see his wife, Lucretia, who was in her chambers with her hair down (as she was not expecting visitors). She explains how she hopes Collatinus is safe and be home soon. Collatinus shows himself and she begins to cry and kiss him. Sextus Tarquinius looks at Lucretia and begins to examine her features. He desires her so badly that he decides he will make Lucretia his. He sneaks into her room and forces himself upon her. He makes her be submissive by placing his sword at her heart and threatening to kill a stable boy and place him there. Lucretia doesn‚Äôt want to soil her good name so she submits to him. After the act, Lucretia calls her husband, laddies, and parents. She explains the horrible act that occurred. She then explains that she doesn‚Äôt deserve forgiveness, she then takes a knife and kills herself.  Poetic Form  Chaucer‚Äôs Legend of Good Women features a number of interesting rhetorical and literary devices. The piece is narrated entirely from a first-person perspective and, similarly to Shakespeare‚Äôs works, is written in Iambic Pentameter. This piece maintains a tone of general irony and comedy, as it shifts from the general misogyny of Chaucer‚Äôs time; the piece climaxes when the narrator chooses to write about positive things women have done instead of criticizing them mercilessly. Interestingly, in the Prologue, a character named Alceste discusses how man cannot be held responsible for the actions they have taken and then proceeds to shift the blame from the fault of man to a third party: one that remains anonymous. This was common during the Chaucerian Era; it took upwards of another 100 years until humanity began to be able to understand the power it held to create and hold power over the earth. Additionally, also in the Prologue, there is an excellent example of inverted syntax. Chaucer‚Äôs narrator says: ‚ÄúThen must we to the books that we find, By which Ancient things are kept in mind.‚Äù Furthermore, in this quote, there is an excellent example of a modern colloquialism. Chaucer often drew inspiration from other texts--a favorite was the Aenid--and chose to implement syntactical and stylistic similarities into his own writing. While Chaucer was alive, it was not considered plagiarism to take from other authors; it was actually a sign of respect to the source if another writer made the decision to use the same content. There is also plenty of foreshadowing. The stories that are told later in the piece are foreshadowed by the nineteen women present in the prologue and the ballad they sing. The Problem with Two Prologues The story itself has two alternate prologues Chaucer authored for the story. The prevailing theory is that the contemporary criticism of the story following its release motivated Chaucer to sanitize or edit his prologue to be more fitting for the audience at hand. With Queen Anne in power, the topic of feminism was very much a hot button issue. Chaucer‚Äôs motivation for authoring the work in the first place is understood as a penance of his previous and unflattering depictions of women in his society. This factor could have had a strong influence on Chaucer to edit his original take. French, John Calvin. The Problem of the Two Prologues to Chaucer's Legend of Good Women. BiblioBazaar, 2013. There is a shorter and a longer of the two, and nobody can definitively assess which is the original and which is the edited. The context of the story, and the subject matters relations to the other works of Chaucer tells us that it was most likely penned sometime in the midpoint of his career. Gardner, John. ‚ÄúThe Two Prologues to the ‚ÄòLegend of Good Women.‚Äô‚Äù The Journal of English and Germanic Philology, vol. 67, no. 4, 1968, pp. 594‚Äì611. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27705603. The authorship of the story is not known to an exact date, but the existence of these two prologues has helped to determine the specific period in Chaucer‚Äôs career that the story was likely written, it has a practical significance in decoding Chaucer's career. The lack of information surrounding the stories publication and mysterious origins has influenced critics over the years to debate not only which of the two is the original version but also which is the superior one for the story. Contemporary English criticism and analysis of these two prologues has traditionally focused on the opening paragraphs of both versions, since the first half of both poems are largely identical. Some critics point to the stories purpose in its shared details between both versions of the prologue as the indicator of the story as a sort of ‚ÄúLadies Handbook‚Äù based on the stories and characters admirable femininity. In the prologue itself, Chaucer states how its authorship was motivated by his previously ill portrayal of women in his other works.Goddard, H. C. ‚ÄúChaucer's Legend of Good Women.‚Äù The Journal of English and Germanic Philology, vol. 7, no. 4, 1908, pp. 87‚Äì129. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27699943. Other critics take this sentiment of penance as the real indicator as to which of the two works is the original as well as the superiorly honest. If this were true, then the original version of the prologue would most likely be the more brutally honest of the two, perhaps the longer less edited version. It has been argued that his continued unfavorable portrayal of his stories purpose in this prologue caused him to edit it down. Lowes, John Livingston. ‚ÄúIs Chaucer's ‚ÄòLegend of Good Women‚Äô a Travesty?‚Äù The Journal of English and Germanic Philology, vol. 8, no. 4, 1909, pp. 513‚Äì569. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27699996. So, it's largely subjective what the reader will take the story as with these two differing contexts. Was Chaucer simply trying to sanitize his public image or was he really admentally motivated in creating a companion text for women to utilize? And, if so, how did these sentiments motivate the editing process? These are the essential questions that drive the critical conversation. The last essential detail of the debate between both prologues lies in the purpose of an analysis of the two, critically, or practically. Lowes argues that the only real purpose we can get out of both versions of the prologue is to help determine the specific details and supposed authorship of The Legend of Good Women or other Chaucerian tales, and that is rather useless to debate which version is superior since they are largely identical in the first place. Other critics like Goddard, are interested in the person of Chaucer or his individual character. Was he really as good willed as he comes off in his work or was he really just pandering to his critics? This rift in criticism and analysis has largely dominated the existing critical spheres and permeated nearly decades of debate surrounding the story. Alternatively, other scholars have attempted to scatologically categorize these arguments and debates into definitive references of the ongoing conversation itself. The most recent additions to the conversation more or less look like this, compendiums of the past critical analysis and prevailing hypothesis with a new theory presented at the conclusion. Importance of Women to the Poem Women play an important role in Chaucer‚Äôs collection of legendary stories, The Legend of Good Women. Not only do women make up the majority of the characters in the poem, but it is also thought that women form a large part of the audience for this poem as well. The most clear depiction of the importance of women to this piece would be the ten female characters: Cleopatra, Thisbe, Dido, Hypsipyle, Medea, Lucrece, Ariadne, Philomela, Phyllis and Hypermnestra. All of these female characters are taken from classical legends and mythology, which Chaucer decides to retell in his own poem. Nicola F. McDonald notes that throughout the narratives, Chaucer makes reference to his predominantly female audience and even questions them in the piece itself. These pagan mythological characters whose stories all include love and betrayal could serve as warnings and cautionary tales to the poem‚Äôs female readers. McDonald also speculates that some of the text might serve as ‚Äúmotherly advice‚Äù to young women on how they should act and think properly during that time period which would also support the idea that this poem was meant for a female audience.McDonald, Nicola F. \\"Chaucer's Legend of Good Women, Ladies at Court and the Female Reader¬π. \\" The Chaucer Review, vol. 35 no. 1, Penn State University Press, 2000, p. 22-42. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/cr.2000.0020. Because it was controversial during that time period to show individualism, especially for women, Chaucer‚Äôs style of writing in The Legend of Good Women could be read as both conservative and radical depending on who was reading it. Although this series of poems seems to be about the legends of these women and their difficulties with love, it has a political undertone that points to the controversial topic of individualism. Hellen Phillips writes that Chaucer uses a specifically ‚Äúamorous‚Äù tone in these poems to veil this controversy, while adding in political jargon to these otherwise unpolitical stories to still suggest this underlying topic.Phillips, Helen. \\"Register, Politics, and the Legend of Good Women.\\" The Chaucer Review, vol. 37 no. 2, Penn State University Press, 2002, p. 101-128. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/cr.2002.0023. Most likely the female audience would have read this story as a satire rather than as an informational story on how they should act, which is how the male audience would have read the poem. So, the women played an important role in interpreting this piece in the way that Chaucer intended. Bibliography * Arner, Lynn.

The Boat Inn was formerly the place of a ferry until the toll bridge was built across the river. The toll house still stands, but the old bridge was replaced in 1904 by a County structure.

A century ago a visitor described how the rags were converted into beautiful white paper. The mill employed 63 hands.  Landmarks  The tollhouse stands at the southern end of the bridge and the building still has the original roof from which it is possible to see the original layout of the windows. However, by 2008, the southern window had been removed and replaced by a modern porch, and the northern window partially obscured by an extension.

Written by Tim Minear and directed by David Semel, it was originally broadcast on October 3, 2000, on the WB network. In the episode, Angel (David Boreanaz) recalls a traumatic experience during the 1950s at the Hyperion Hotel. The episode is a fan favorite and was also a personal favorite of actor David Boreanaz. Writer Tim Minear said it was personally enjoyable for him to write the episode, even though he normally preferred writing longer story arcs that gradually unfolded over the course of an entire season. Plot Angel asks Wesley and Cordelia to look into the mysterious history of the abandoned Hyperion Hotel. A photograph of the hotel blends into an action shot of the hotel exterior during the 1950s, as the manager sends the bellhop upstairs to give the guest in 217 his weekly bill. The bellhop nervously makes his delivery, then runs downstairs, as Angel- the feared occupant of 217 -opens the door. As the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings blare on a TV, Angel strolls through the lobby and the manager turns away an African-American family, telling them that (despite what their sign says) the hotel has no vacancies. On the second floor, heading towards his room, he observes a man banging on a door. In the background, two men share a furtive romantic moment outside a room door. Back in his room, Angel finds a woman pretending to be a maid. When Angel calls her bluff, she tells him that she's hiding from her boyfriend, the man earlier seen banging on a door. Angel helps her hide from him, smashing the door in his face when the man pulls a gun. In the present, Angel visits the now-abandoned Hyperion. While doing research with Wesley, Cordelia discovers that the property is a historical landmark, but that it has been plagued by strange events since it was built. Cordelia then spots Angel in a 1952 photograph of the hotel lobby, and Wesley realizes that Angel has a personal connection to the Hyperion. In 1952, the salesman in the room next to Angel's listens to a record, talks to someone unseen, then holds a gun to his head. Angel hears a gunshot and the record skipping, and drinks his glass of chilled blood without reacting. When the manager and bellhop discover the salesman's suicide, the manager hears a demonic voice whispering, \\"They'll shut you down,\\" and instructs the bellhop not to call the police. They then hide the body in a meat locker. That night, the guests gather at Griffith Observatory, where they discuss the suicide and wonder why the police haven't been notified. Judy tries to thank Angel, but he is unreceptive. The next day, the guests continue to discuss the salesman, questioning if he might have been murdered. Upstairs, when Angel comments on Judy's agitation, she confesses the man banging on the door was a PI sent by the bank from which she stole money. She was fired from the bank when they found out that, although she \\"passes\\" as white, she is actually part African American. Her fianc√© also left her when he found out. Angry at the bank, she stole the money, but has not spent any of it, and Judy regrets her decision to steal. Angel replies that \\"fear makes people do stupid things,\\" then clarifies he was referring to her employers. As Angel stashes Judy's bag of money in the basement, he hears whispering and realizes something in the hotel is making people paranoid. In the present, Cordelia and Wesley find newspaper reports of the bellhop's execution for the salesman's murder, and an article about Judy with the headline, \\"Search Called Off ‚Äî Fugitive Woman Believed Dead.\\" Down in the basement, Angel finds the bag of money and once again hears the whispering. He contacts the others, announcing the hotel hosts a Thesulac demon that whispers to its victims, then feeds on their insecurities. He says he already knows the ritual to make it corporeal so that it can be killed. In 1952, Angel returns from a bookstore where he has learned the ritual to corporealize the demon; meanwhile, the PI reveals Judy's secret. When the guests turn on her, she points them towards Angel, announcing that he has blood in his room. Everyone attacks Angel, except Judy, who starts to cry. Angel is dragged into the hallway; a noose is tied to a rafter and he is pushed over the railing to hang. The crowd cheers, then slowly wonders what they've done. When everyone leaves, Angel frees himself and drops to the lobby floor. On the stairs, the Thesulac demon becomes corporeal, gloating about the paranoia he just fed on; Judy's despair is particularly delicious as she had just come to start to have faith in humanity again due to Angel's friendship and help. Her pain at what she has done to Angel has made her \\"a meal that will last a lifetime\\". The demon says, \\"There's an entire hotel here just full of tortured souls that could use your help.\\" Angel replies, \\"Take them all.\\", abandoning Judy and the rest of the residents to their fate. In the present, Cordelia, Wesley, and Gunn arrive at the Hyperion and, after performing the spell to make the Thesulac corporeal, Angel electrocutes it with the exposed wires of the fuse box. Angel heads upstairs and finds Judy, now old, still in her room, where she has served as the Demon's \\"room service\\" since 1952. She says the voices are gone, and asks Angel if it is safe to go out. He tells her it is, but she is so tired that she needs to rest first. She then tells Angel that she is sorry she got him killed and asks his forgiveness. He assures her she did not kill him and tells her that he forgives her. She then passes away. Angel returns downstairs and announces that they're moving in. Wesley reminds Angel that evil things have happened in the hotel, but Angel tells him that all of that is in the past. Production  =Writing= Tim Minear wrote the episode: \\"Are You Now or Have You Ever Been\\". This is another episode by writer Tim Minear that explores Angel's background. \\"He's cynical, I-don't-get-involved guy, and I thought that was a very interesting place to be,\\" says Minear. \\"Although he does reach out to help someone in the episode, it doesn't take much to push him out of that light.\\" When fans point out the flashback scene in Buffy in which Angel is living on the streets of New York City, Minear deflects the accusation of retconning by saying, \\"I don't believe he was thrown out of that room in Romania by Darla in 1898 and has been on the street ever since...in the 1950s, that was the beginning of his descent into the streets.\\" The theme of otherness is carried through this episode by exploring LA's history of social exclusion. The hysteria provoked by the paranoia demon mirrors the fears of communism surrounding LA's entertainment community, the fear of being revealed as gay by a well-known actor who arranges furtive liaisons at the hotel, the racism that caused an African American family to be turned away from the hotel, the racism that led to Judy's firing and rejection by family, friends, and fianc√©, and the lynch mob that attacked Angel. This both captures the connection between anti-communism and racist policing, and serves as direct comment on the perpetuation of past prejudices and relevance to recent events. Arc significance *The flashback scenes reveal that in the 1950s, Angel bore \\"a contempt for humanity that is reminiscent of Angelus but without the sadism\\". His decision to allow the demon to feed on the hotel residents foreshadows his decision later in the season to allow Darla and Drusilla to slaughter the Wolfram & Hart lawyers. Both times Angel deems that the humans in jeopardy aren't worth saving. Cultural references *McCarthyism: The episode's title is based on the \\"$64,000 question\\" posed during Congressional hearings held in the 1950s by the House Un-American Activities Committee and by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations associated with Joseph McCarthy: \\"Are you now, or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?\\" The era, and paranoia surrounding it, is the setting for much of this episode. *Rebel Without A Cause: The scene in which Judy mentions a show depicting the end of the universe was shot on location at the Griffith Observatory. Several scenes in the James Dean film Rebel Without A Cause were filmed at that same observatory, including a scene in which the characters attend a planetarium show about the world ending. The character of Judy physically resembles the character of the same name (played by Natalie Wood) in that film. Additionally, Angel is dressed exactly like James Dean's character during this scene. =Set design= Actor David Boreanaz cited the episode as one of his personal favorites. This episode introduces the Hyperion Hotel, which becomes Angel's main set until season 5. Production designer Stuart Blatt explains that after blowing up Angel's cramped office in the season one finale, he had the opportunity to create a bigger, more \\"film-friendly\\" set that the crew and cameras could move through freely. Creator Joss Whedon suggested an abandoned hotel, something similar to the hotel in the Coen Brothers' Barton Fink. The exterior shots of the Hyperion are of a historic building on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles called the Los Altos Hotel & Apartments, which Blatt had previously used in the episode \\"I Fall to Pieces\\". The Los Altos was home to many Hollywood celebrities ‚Äî including Bette Davis, Mae West, and William Randolph Hearst ‚Äî before the Great Depression, similar to the fictional history of the Hyperion featured in this episode. Blatt says the front doors of the Hyperion are \\"exact duplicates\\" of those at the Los Altos, and the back garden closely resembles the back garden in the apartments, which allows the crew to film the characters entering and exiting the building on location. \\"Then we cut to the interior of the hotel,\\" Blatt says, which is on a sound stage, \\"and it all works fairly seamlessly.\\" Reception  This episode is a fan favorite, regularly ranking as one of the top episodes of the series.

He started the CD series Dick's Picks, a series that selects live music from Grateful Dead concerts. The first volume of Dick's Picks was released in 1993. The series continued after Latvala's death in 1999 until 2005, with later volumes being selected by David Lemieux. In 2005 the series inspired a spin-off officially known as Dave's Picks. Personal life As a senior studying psychology at San Francisco State University, Dick Latvala wrote a brief autobiography in 1965, apparently in preparation for his first time ingesting LSD. The autobiography details Latvala's basic philosophy and understanding of himself, his growing up, and his relationship with his parents and two sisters. Latvala described how he felt more comfortable having black friends rather than white friends, and became interested in the racial struggles of the United States. According to Steve Silberman, upon Latvala hearing the Grateful Dead in 1965 \\"it was the first music from white people he heard that approached the power of gospel.\\" Latvala was known for his strong opinions, passionate conversations, and love of the Grateful Dead. Jesse Jarnow's Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America details much of Dick's personal and professional life as an adult. Dick grew up in the San Francisco- Bay Area, where he lived until moving to Hilo, Hawaii in 1974. Prior to Hawaii Dick, his wife Carol, and their son Richie lived at one of Victor Baranco's Morehouse communes. Carol Latvala described Morehouse's philosophy and practices as \\"a combination of Sexual Freedom League material, [and] things they'd learned from witches, Scientology, and Buddhism.\\" In Hilo, Dick Latvala worked as a zookeeper. Hawaii is where Latvala began to collect recordings of Grateful Dead concerts, often mailing other tapers pot in exchange for tapes. Latvala would exchange long letters with tapers on the mainland and extend an invitation to visit Hawaii, to smoke pot and listen to the Grateful Dead at high volumes. Dick and Carol moved back to California in the early 1980s, and although divorced they remained friends and even next-door neighbors, both working for the Grateful Dead at their Front Street office in San Rafael. While Carol worked in the Dead's ticket office, Dick initially performed menial tasks as well as managing the band's music archives. Throughout his life, Dick Latvala was an avid consumer of psychoactive substances, \\"a constant acid consumer, a bong hit taker, a coffee drinker, a cigarette smoker, a drinker.\\" At one point, the Grateful Dead paid for Latvala to enter rehab for alcohol. An autobiographical document written by Latvala in 1965 begins \\"I consider any form of psychotherapy . I prefer LSD for a number of reasons.\\" As Latvala recalled to David Gans about his first LSD experience in 1993: \\"A major turning point occurred on June 28, 1965. I took LSD in a research project in 1965 in Menlo Park, in which I actually paid $500 to go through this experience, which was, perhaps, the most powerful single experience I ever went through... something happened that changed me forever.\\" Beyond his love of the Grateful Dead, Latvala enjoyed gospel music, Henry Kaiser, Fats Domino, Little Richard, Lead Belly, and Robert Johnson. Work with the Grateful Dead While living in Hawaii, Latvala became very active in tape trading. He maintained numerous correspondences with Grateful Dead tapers and collectors, often trading marijuana for recordings through the mail. In addition to amassing a large collection of live recordings, in the 1970s Latvala began maintaining personal notebooks filled with commentary about particular Grateful Dead shows. As described by Grateful Dead archivist Nicholas Meriwether, Latvala \\"catalog[ed] his tapes in a series of notebooks, detailing their origin and provenance‚Äîwho taped it and with what equipment‚Äîas well as when, where, what they played. He usually noted especially strong renditions as well as his impressions, which he would often revisit later, critiquing his critiques.\\" In the early 1980s Latvala began working at the Grateful Dead's Front Street office in San Rafael, where he did various odd jobs. Prior to Latvala's arrival, the band did not actively maintain an archive of their recorded concerts. It was Latvala who convinced the band about the importance of maintaining such an archive. Latvala eventually became the curator of Dick's Picks, a series of commercially released recordings of live Grateful Dead performances. Until Dick's Picks, the Grateful Dead typically released live albums that were specially recorded on multitrack source tapes, then professionally mixed. Dick's Picks however, tapped into the band's vast 2-track audio collection, spanning thousands of hours of concerts. During the early years of Dick's Picks until Latvala's death, 1993-1999, Latvala routinely posted on chat rooms at the band's web site, www.dead.net, and conversed with fans regarding his opinions of Grateful Dead recordings and what should be released next. Latvala was known for his outspoken and sometimes wild opinions about particular Grateful Dead recordings. Latvala received a mixed response from the larger Grateful Dead organization. As journalist Steve Silberman recalls, Latvala \\"was used to people ignoring him or thinking of him as low status in the scene... but I actually thought of him as one of the secret buddhas that protected the music... He was completely aware in Zen fashion that his work was the ultimate gift and the ultimate curse. He had to suffer because the collective ethos of the backstage scene was very bruising and masculine. He was in part a stand-in for all Deadheads, for whom [the band's roadies] had contempt.\\" Latvala was known for lending friends tapes from the official Grateful Dead vault. Nicholas Meriwether noted how many of tapes in the Grateful Dead Archive are labeled \\"'Courtesy of Dick Latvala. Do not circulate!'\\" In Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America, Jesse Jarnow highlights the ambiguous stance Latvala took about these tapes being re-circulated. While refusing to speak to one friend for two years after learning that he re-circulated tapes, Latvala also \\"loves the Grateful Dead too much and wants the word of their music to travel into every ear and mind possible.\\" Jarnow even claims that Latvala gave taper and future Dark Star Orchestra guitarist Rob Eaton a \\"near-complete copy of the vault.\\" Death and legacy Dick Latvala died following a heart attack at age 56, on August 6, 1999. David Gans dedicated the August 11, 1999 Grateful Dead Hour to the memory of Dick Latvala. After his sudden death, the Grateful Dead continued the Dick's Picks series. In memory of Dick's known wishes, the Grateful Dead released Dick's Picks Vols. 15 and 16, 9-3-77 and 11-8-69, respectively, which were two of Dick's favorite and most-discussed candidates for future release in his series. In many Dick's Picks albums, the name \\"LATVALA\\" can be seen somewhere in the album artwork, often carefully hidden. This was apparently done to commemorate Latvala after his death. The Dick's Picks series gradually came under the creative direction of David Lemieux. Lemieux now releases live concerts under a spin-off series, Dave's Picks. Dick Latvala's collection of Grateful Dead material was donated by Dick's wife, Carol, to the Grateful Dead Archive. As described by archivist Nicholas Meriwether \\"Latvala‚Äôs collection is divided into two major sections... his personal collection of tapes, more than 500 seven-inch and ten-inch reels, and his papers, which comprise more than a dozen linear feet of notebooks, correspondence, and other materials.\\" Noting Latvala's shift from dedicated fan to actual archivist, Nicholas Meriwether highlighted the three major themes reflected by Dick Latvala's story and his collection: the \\"porous the boundary between band and fan in the Grateful Dead phenomenon... how participation in the Dead phenomenon instilled a sense of historicity in fans... Most of all, the collection Latvala built demonstrates that it is impossible to tell the story of the Dead without discussing their fans. Deadheads are not only an inextricable part of the phenomenon, they are a vital part of the Archive. That connection goes to the heart of what Latvala‚Äôs collection also says about the phenomenon, for Latvala made the transition from amateur to professional, from fan to insider, eventually earning a living from his passion for the band.\\" In an obituary published by the Chicago Tribune, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart said his strongest memory of Latvala was the image of him blaring Grateful Dead music at high volumes: \\"The neighbors would complain, the cops might call, he wouldn't care... In those moments, he was communing with God.\\" References External links * http://www.dicklatvala.com/ - Archival material posted by Dick's son, Richie Latvala Category:Grateful Dead Category:1943 births Category:1999 deaths Category:American people of Finnish descent Category:20th-century American musicians ","title":"Dick Latvala"},{"id":"2364913","text":"Raina A.

Walker soon became the thirteenth president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe).  Youth and military service  Aldace Walker was born on May 11, 1842, in West Rutland, Vermont, the son of Aldace Walker, D. D. and Mary A. Baker. He attended Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire, and then Middlebury College where he graduated in 1862. His professional career started with military service as he enlisted with the 11th Vermont Infantry for service in the American Civil War. Walker was promoted through the ranks to become a lieutenant colonel before he was mustered out in June 1865. In 1869 he published a book of his experience in the war titled The Vermont Brigade in the Shenandoah Valley.  Transportation leadership  After the war, Walker studied law and began his practice in New York City in 1867. There he joined Strong & Shepard, owned by Theron R. Strong and Elliott Fitch Shepard. At first he was the firm's managing clerk, and became a partner and lawyer there in 1870. For the next seven years, he worked on many cases involving rail transport, including the land appropriation for the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railway which would connect the Hudson River Railroad and the New York and Harlem Railroad. When the senior partner in Walker's firm died, the practice was broken up and Walker moved to Rutland, Vermont, where he joined the practice of Prout, Simons & Walker. In this position too, Walker worked on cases that involved local railroads including the Rutland Railroad, Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, Vermont and Canada Railroad, Vermont Central Railroad and others until he left the firm to become a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in Washington, D.C. In 1889 he resigned his position at the ICC to become the chairman of the Interstate Commerce Railway Association, and later the same role for the Western Traffic Association. Walker assumed the Santa Fe's presidency when Joseph Reinhart resigned on August 8, 1894. When the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (A&P;) filed for bankruptcy, Walker and John J. McCook, another executive with the Santa Fe, were appointed as the A&P;'s receivers in December 1895. At this time, Walker stepped down from the Santa Fe's presidency, but remained on the Board of Directors as Chairman.

It is situated approximately west of Hornsea town centre, and north-west of the A165 road. According to the 2011 UK census, Leven parish had a population of 2,433, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 2,240. History It is believed that the village of Little Leven - immediately west of the present village - began as far back as the days of the Ancient Britons, though Neolithic and Bronze Age human occupation of the area is known. Finds from Leven 'Carrs' (marshy land) have included axe heads, leaf-shaped swords, and a spearhead. Three quarters of a mile west of Little Leven, at Hall Garth, is the site of Leven's former parish church - St Faith's - which was in use between 1350 and 1843. It is speculated that the original village of Leven was sited in its immediate vicinity though archaeological understanding of that area is sparse. In 1823 Leven (then spelt 'Leaven'), was a civil parish in the Wapentake and Liberty of Holderness. The patronage of the church was under Sir William Pennyman. Population at the time was 658. Occupations included eight farmers, three wheelwrights, two blacksmiths, two butchers, three corn millers, five shoemakers, two maltsters, two grocers, a bricklayer, a schoolmaster, a parish clerk, and the landlords of The Minerva and the Blue Bell public houses. Four carriers operated between the village and Beverley and Hull twice weekly. There were two other carriers: one taking post by foot to Hornsea four times a week; and another to Hull once a week by water transport. Residents included the parish rector, three yeomen, a gentleman, and a merchant. The 1892 Bulmer's Directory of Hull and the East Riding states that the Manor of Leven was given to the Church of St John of Beverley by Edward the Confessor, and is listed in the Domesday Book as being amongst its possessions. After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1547, ownership of the land reverted to the crown, to be bought by Sir Marmaduke Constable in 1557. About 1612, it appears that Sir Thomas Gresham owned some of the land, having received it as a gift from Queen Elizabeth I. There was a proposal to build a Leven railway station as part of the North Holderness Light Railway but despite appearing on tile maps at several North Eastern Railway stations, the line was never constructed. Leven was a small village with 400 inhabitants until 1964, after which a private housing estate was built (Barley Gate, Mill Drive, Westlands Way, Balk Close), and the village expanded to become a dormitory for workers mainly from Hull and Beverley. The population is now over 2,500. The village has two public houses: The New Inn and The Hare and Hounds as well as a member's club featuring live entertainment each week. Leven has amateur football, cricket and bowling teams. The A165 road, opened 25 May 1994, was built after a campaign by residents to bypass the village. Landmarks The church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1968 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. Leven Canal, a Site of Special Scientific Interest links the village to the River Hull, although it is now closed. The canal was opened in 1804 having been cut by the order of Mrs Charlotte Bethel, Lady of the Manor. The 3 1/4 mile long canal started at the River Hull and was constructed to allow sailing barges to reach the warehouses at Canal Head on the southern edge of the village. Constructed in 1825, the two warehouses served two principal functions - storage of local grain ready for barge transport to Hull and Beverley and a depository for coal. Linley Hill Airfield is nearby and is used for flying activities. Users include Hull Aero Club which was founded in the 1920s and numbered Amy Johnson among former members. Notable people The Canadian politician George Dinsdale was born in Leven in 1887.

Early life Cottesloe was the eldest son of Admiral Sir Thomas Fremantle and Betsey, daughter of Richard Wynne. He was the elder brother of Admiral Sir Charles Fremantle after whom the city of Fremantle in Western Australia is named, and of William Robert Fremantle (c. 1808-1895), Dean of Ripon, whose son, William Henry Fremantle filled the same clerical role. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford. The family seat was Swanbourne, Buckinghamshire. On 14 August 1821 he was created a Baronet, of Swanbourne in the County of Buckingham, in recognition of his father's services to the country and with remainder to the heirs male of his father. Political career Fremantle was returned to Parliament for Buckingham in 1826 (succeeding his uncle, William Henry Fremantle), a seat he held until 1846. He served under Sir Robert Peel as Financial Secretary to the Treasury between 1834 and 1835, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury between 1841 and 1844, as Secretary at War between 1844 and 1845 and as Chief Secretary for Ireland between 1845 and 1846. He was sworn of the British Privy Council in 1844 and of the Irish Privy Council in 1845. Fremantle left the House of Commons in 1846 and was afterwards Deputy Chairman of the Board of Customs between 1846 and 1847 and Chairman between 1847 and 1874. He was also as a Justice of the Peace. On 2 March 1874 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cottesloe, of Swanbourne and Hardwick in the County of Buckingham, in recognition of his services. Family Fremantle proposed to Louisa Elizabeth Nugent, on 30 June 1824, but was initially refused by her father, Sir George Nugent unless his parents contributed more. However, they were married on 24 November 1824. Louisa's mother Maria Skinner was a descendant of the Schuyler family and the Van Cortlandt family of British North America. They had five sons and six daughters. Their fourth son Sir Edmund Robert Fremantle (1836‚Äì1929) was an Admiral in the Royal Navy. Lady Cottesloe died in August 1875. Lord Cottesloe survived her by fifteen years and died in December 1890, aged 92. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Thomas.

He was also the real-life model for a character in James Joyce's novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. He was a friend and schoolmate of Joyce, Oliver St. John Gogarty, Tom Kettle, and Frank O'Brien (the father of Conor Cruise O'Brien). He married Hanna Sheehy in 1903, whose own surname he adopted as part of his name, resulting in the name \\"Sheehy Skeffington\\". They always showed their joined names unhyphenated, although many sources include the hyphen. Early life Francis Skeffington was born in Bailieborough, County Cavan, and was raised in Downpatrick, County Down, the only son of Dr. Joseph Bartholomew Skeffington, a school inspector, and Rose Magorrian, both of County Down. His parents had been married at the Roman Catholic Chapel at Ballykinlar, County Down, in 1869. 'Frank' was educated initially at home by his father, and later at the Jesuit community in St Stephen's Green, Dublin. Francis's radical sympathies manifested early on through his enthusiasm for the constructed language Esperanto. In 1893, at the age of 15, he wrote a letter to his local newspaper in County Down stating that \\"Gaelic\\" was irretrievably dead and \\"the study of Esperanto would be more useful to the youth of Ireland\\".Leah Levenson, With Wooden Sword: a portrait of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, Northeastern U. Press, 1983, p. 13 Later in life he became fluent in the language, and had a number of Esperanto books in his library when he died. This enthusiasm was not unusual at the time in leftist circles, and several prominent leaders of the 1916 Easter rising, including James Connolly, were also Esperantists.Ken Keable, \\"James Connolly and Esperanto\\", published both on www.communist- party.org.uk and www.anphoblacht.com, on 29 May and 28 June 2001 respectively (both accessed 30‚Äì31 March 2016). The earlier version has more detailed citations. =Student years= In 1896 (aged 18), Frank enrolled in University College, then run by the Jesuits and located on St Stephen's Green in the centre of Dublin. He stayed at the college long enough to earn a master's degree. Skeffington was a well-known figure at the college, individualistic and unconventional in temperament. He was active in student politics and debating societies, including the Literary and Historical Society, which he revived in 1897. His closest companions in his student days were James Joyce and Thomas Kettle (later to become his brother-in-law). In protest against uniformity of dress, Frank Skeffington refused to shave, and wore knickerbockers with long socks, which earned him the nickname \\"knickerbockers\\". He was an ardent proponent of women's rights, and wore a Votes for Women badge. He was an equally ardent advocate of pacifism and vegetarianism, and he denounced smoking, drinking, and vivisection. He was a vegetarian and a teetotaller. But he did permit himself chocolate, and apparently he was often seen with a bar of milk chocolate in his pocket.Richard Ellman, James Joyce, Oxford University Press, 1982, pp. 61-62, 69.See also James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, chapter 5, Oxford World Classics, p. 163. Joyce enrolled at University College in 1898; he was four years Skeffington's junior but only two classes below him. He left a fictional portrait of Skeffington in his novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, under the guise of \\"MacCann\\", a fellow-student whom Joyce's alter- ego Stephen Dedalus describes as \\"a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches,\\" with a \\"bluntfeatured face\\" and \\"a strawcolored goatee which hung from his blunt chin.\\" Stephen remembers him saying: \\"Dedalus, you're an anti- social being, wrapped up in yourself. I'm not. I'm a democrat: and I'll work and act for social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the United States of the Europe of the future.\\"James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, chapter 5; Oxford World Classics edition, pp. 149, 164, 167. Later, \\"MacCann\\" is seen standing in a lobby after class, canvassing signatures on a petition for universal peace, under a picture of the Czar of Russia, who was a proponent of disarmament. (In the spring term of that year Skeffington would attend the international peace conference called by the Czar.) \\"MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Czar's rescript,Czar Nicholas II had issued a \\"peace rescript\\" in 1898, which solicited petitions to hold the international peace conference which Skeffington would attend in the Hague in of 1899. of Stead,William Thomas Stead, a crusading anti-war journalist. of general disarmament, arbitration in cases of international disputes,Both goals of the Hague peace conference. of the signs of the times, of the new humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible the greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number.\\"A strange mixture of evangelical Christianity and Utilitarian socialism! ‚Äì Stephen Dedalus expresses indifference to these goals and gestures at the picture of the Czar: \\"If we must have a Jesus, let us have a legitimate Jesus.\\" To which MacCann replies: \\"Dedalus, I believe you're a good fellow, but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the responsibility of the human individual.\\"James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, chapter 5; Oxford World Classics edition p. 163 ff.

Writing to his brother Stanislaus about the above passages, Joyce referred to Skeffington as \\"Hairy Jaysus\\",Cited by Richard Ellman, James Joyce, Oxford University Press, 1982, p. 192. a complex expression which is both sardonic and affectionate. In the autumn of 1901 Skeffington wrote an essay advocating equal status for women in the University, commissioned by St Stephen's, the new literary magazine of the college.St Stephen's ran from 1901-1906 and contains early writings by James Joyce, Thomas Kettle and Patrick Pearse as well as Sheehy Skeffington. Later series were issued under the same title in the 1960s and 1970s. The essay was refused publication by the Censor, and, at Joyce's suggestion, Skeffington then published the essay as a pamphlet, along with another essay by Joyce himself, which had been similarly censored (\\"The Day of the Rabblement\\", a critique of the Irish Literary Theatre). Although Joyce and Skeffington disagreed with each other's politics, they both resented censorship, and agreed to co-finance the print run of 85 copies and distribute the pamphlet to newspapers and prominent Dubliners.The pamphlet was titled Two Essays, and Skeffington's essay, \\"A Forgotten Aspect of the University Question\\". About the printing and distribution of the pamphlet see Richard Ellman, James Joyce, Oxford U. Press, 1982, p. 89. Joyce's essay is reprinted in James Joyce, Occasional, Critical, and Political Writing, Oxford World's Classics, p. 50 ff.; see also editor's notes on p. 295 ff, and likewise the editor's notes to Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Oxford World Classics, p. 264, note 149.6-7; and to Dubliners, Oxford World's Classics, p. 271, note 148.24. Career and politics After graduating from University College, Skeffington worked as a freelance journalist, contributing to socialist and pacifist publications in Ireland, England, France and North America. In 1901-02 he taught in St Kieran's College in Kilkenny, where he was a colleague and friend of the school's English, French and history master Thomas MacDonagh; the two also lodged in the same house in Kilkenny City. He then took a job as the registrar of University College. On 26 June 1903Leah Levenson, With Wooden Sword: a portrait of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, Northeastern U. Press, 1983, p. 40 he married Hanna Sheehy, a teacher at the Rathmines College of Commerce (a forerunner of Dublin Institute of Technology). They jointly adopted the surname \\"Sheehy Skeffington\\". Hanna's family were a prosperous farming and milling family in County Cork, and her father had been a Nationalist MP, and had been imprisoned no less than six times for revolutionary activities.Thomas O'Riordan, \\"Hanna Sheehy- Skeffington\\" , Multitext Project in Irish History, University College Cork, accessed 30 March 2016. The couple joined the Irish Women's Suffrage and Local Government Association, and the Young Ireland Branch of the United Irish League (the constituency element of the Irish Parliamentary Party). They also supported the Women's Social and Political Union, which lobbied for women's rights in Britain. Shortly after they married, Francis organised a petition to lobby for women to be admitted to University College on the same basis as men. When the university refused to take that step, Francis resigned from his job as registrar in protest, relying on Hanna to support him for a time.Marian Broderick, Wild Irish Women: Extraordinary Lives from History, Dublin: O'Brien Press, 2012, p. 168. He was President of the Socialist Party of IrelandBarberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, pp. 207-08, 251. In 1907, Francis wrote a novel, In Dark and Evil Days, which remained unpublished until 1916, the year of his death.Francis Sheehy Skeffington, In Dark and Evil Days, Dublin : J. Duffy, 1916. In 1908, he published a biography of the Irish nationalist and Land League agitator Michael Davitt.Michael Davitt; Revolutionary, Agitator, and Labor Leader; Book review by James Connolly, Marxists.org; accessed 5 June 2020. In 1912, he and Hanna co-founded the Irish Women's Franchise League. He was made co-editor of the League's newspaper, The Irish Citizen. The Irish Women's Franchise League agitated for votes for women; members included his brother-in-law Tom Kettle and his friend Thomas MacDonagh, as well as all of the non-nationalist suffrage activists of the day. (Nationalist women tended to avoid it, on the basis that the IWFL was seeking to get into the British Parliament, while nationalists were trying to get out). In 1909 Francis and Hanna had a son, Owen. They were much criticized for refusing to have him baptized. In April 1911, Francis took part in an amusing protest at a meeting of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. The chamber was holding a public meeting to organize a welcoming ceremony for King George V on his visit to Dublin later that year. To open the meeting, the president of the chamber proposed that \\"a Citizens' Committee be formed for the purpose of arranging a suitable welcome and preparing and presenting a loyal address to the Most Gracious Majesties the King and Queen, on their approaching visit to Dublin\\". Francis counter- proposed that the word \\"not\\" be inserted after the word \\"be\\", and argued that ignoring the visit was the best compromise to satisfy both supporters and objectors to the visit. \\"Sean Milroy ‚Äì a future minister in the Irish Free State ‚Äì stood to second Sheehy Skeffington's motion, while the chairman, the Earl of Mayo, attempted to maintain order over cries of 'Hear hear!' and 'Put him out!' In an effort to silence the dissenters, Mayo called a vote on Sheehy Skeffington's amendment; 36 supported it while 'some hundreds' voted against.\\" After this, Countess Markievicz proposed another counter-resolution which led to further uproar.Lauren Arrington, Revolutionary Lives: Constance and Casimir Markievicz, Princeton University Press, 2016, p. 77, citing a report from the Irish Times: \\"Royal Visit to Dublin\\", 28 April 1911, pp. 7-8. Francis was on friendly terms with Countess Markievicz: for instance he once escorted her to a police court after she had kicked a police officer during a Socialist Party meeting, which Francis had also attended.Lauren Arrington, Revolutionary Lives, op. cit., p. 81. During the 1913 Dublin Lock-out, he became involved in the Citizens' Peace Committee, a group formed by various people including Tom Kettle and Thomas MacDonagh, with Joseph Plunkett as secretary, whose goal was to reconcile the employers and workers. The workers were willing to negotiate, but not the employers. Francis Sheehy Skeffington joined and then became a vice-chairman of the Irish Citizen Army when it was established in response to the lockout. But he lent his support on the understanding that the ICA would have a strictly defensive role; he resigned when it became a military entity. Sheehy Skeffington testified before a tribunal in 1913 as a witness to the arrest of the leading trade unionist Jim Larkin on O'Connell Street, and the subsequent police assault against a peaceful crowd, which had occurred on the last weekend of August 1913.The full text of this testimony can be found in James Larkin, In the footsteps of Big Jim: a family biography, Tallaght : Blackwater Press, 1996. His testimony stated that he was in the street with a group of women caring for a person who had already been assaulted by the police when a member of the Dublin Metropolitan Police charged towards this group with his baton raised. He reports that it was only because he called out the policeman's number that the man was dissuaded from the violence he had so clearly intended. He said that he was later abused by a gang of policemen showing clear signs of intoxication in the yard of the police station at College Green where he went to make his complaint, and that their officers had no control over their behaviour. In 1914, on the outbreak of World War I, Sheehy Skeffington campaigned against recruitment and was jailed for six months. He supported the peace crusade of the American car manufacturer Henry Ford; and when Countess Markievicz advocated armed uprising by Irish nationalists, he challenged her to a debate on the subject. She accepted the challenge in an open letter published in James Connolly's newspaper, The Workers' Republic.Lauren Arrington, Revolutionary Lives, op. cit., p. 121, citing \\"Constance de Markievicz\\", letter to the editor, The Workers' Republic, 22 January 1916, pg .1.  Easter Rising  Francis Sheehy Skeffington is often considered one of the martyrs of Ireland's 1916 Easter Rising; He was killed for trying to prevent looting. Richard Ellman, the eminent biographer of James Joyce, passes on such a caricature when he writes that Sheehy Skeffington \\"died at the hands of the British ... when he quixotically tried to dissuade the Dublin poor from looting,\\" or again that he was \\"arrested while trying to keep the Dublin poor from looting.\\"R. Ellman, James Joyce, Oxford University Press, 1982, p. 61 and 399.) =Political background= Francis Sheehy Skeffington had always supported Home Rule for Ireland. After 1913 he had also supported his friend Thomas MacDonagh's more separatist Irish Volunteers; however he grew increasingly critical of the Volunteers' growing militarism, and in an open letter to MacDonagh published in 1915 in his own paper The Irish Citizen, Sheehy Skeffington wrote: \\"As you know, I am personally in full sympathy with the fundamental objects of the Irish Volunteers ... [however,] as your infant movement grows, towards the stature of a full-grown militarism, its essence ‚Äì preparation to kill ‚Äì grows more repellent to me.\\"Francis Sheehy Skeffington, \\"Open Letter to Thomas MacDonagh\\", May 1915, reprinted in The Irish Times, 21 March 2016 (accessed 30 March 2016). At the outset of the Easter Rising, Sheehy Skeffington opposed the violent methods of the insurgents, advocating a nonviolent form of civil disobedience, while his wife Hanna actively sympathized with the insurgents and joined the group of women who brought food to those stationed at the General Post Office and the Royal College of Surgeons. In contrast, on the first day of the rising (Monday 24 April 1916) Francis risked crossfire to go to the aid of an English soldier outside Dublin Castle.The soldier, Guy Vickery Pinfield (1895-1916), a Second Lieutenant (TP) 8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars, would go on to die of his wounds, the first fatality of the Easter Rising. As Hanna recalled the incident six years later: \\"When the outbreak began on Easter Monday my husband was near Dublin Castle. He learned that a British officer had been gravely wounded and was bleeding to death on the cobblestones outside the Castle gate. My husband persuaded a bystander to go with him to the rescue. Together they ran across the square under a hail of fire. Before they reached the spot, however, some British troops rushed out and dragged the wounded man to cover inside the gate.\\"Hayden Talbot, Michael Collins' own story, as told to Hayden Talbot, London : Hutchinson & Co., 1923, ch. 11 (accessed 30 December 2016). =Attempts to prevent looting= Shortly after that incident Sheehy Skeffington was seen climbing up onto the steps of Nelson's Pillar on Sackville Street, and haranguing a crowd of inner-city paupers to stop looting shops. He was hooted and jeered, and his next move was then to cross the street, enter the GPO, and demand to speak to James Connolly, one of the principal leaders of the insurrection, who was also a labour leader and sympathetic to Sheehy Skeffington's socialism. Connolly sent out some armed men to quell the looting. The men climbed an overturned tramcar to berate the looters, and even fired shots over the looters' heads.Max Caulfield, The Easter Rebellion: The outstanding narrative history of the 1916 Rising, Kindle edition, at location 2427 of 6699 (accessed 10 April 2016). The next morning, 25 April, Sheehy Skeffington went back into the city centre and, again according to Hanna, \\"actively interested himself in preventing looting\\". He returned to the GPO, emerging around one o'clock, and began to walk around the area pasting up a typewritten flyer.Max Caulfield, The Easter Rebellion: The outstanding narrative history of the 1916 Rising, Kindle edition, at location 3111 of 6699 (accessed 10 April 2016). The flyer read: > When there are no regular police in the streets, it becomes the duty of > citizens to police the streets themselves and to prevent such spasmodic > looting as has been taking place in a few streets. Civilians (men and women) > who are willing to co-operate to this end are asked to attend at > Westmoreland Chambers (over Eden Bros.) at five o'clock this (Tues.) > afternoon. Sheehy Skeffington then busied himself visiting various people, including priests, to enlist their help in guarding specific shops. That afternoon he had tea with his wife Hanna in one of the tea shops which, astonishingly, were still open in the city centre. Hanna then returned home to mind their child Owen, and Francis went to his meeting.Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, \\"British Militarism As I Have Known It\\", in: F. Sheehy Skeffington, A Forgotten Small Nationality: Ireland and the War, pamphlet, New York: Donnelly Press, n.d. (circa 1917), p. 17-32. Unfortunately the meeting was poorly attended, and no one volunteered to help Francis stop the looting. =Arrest= On his way home from the dispiriting meeting, Francis was followed by a crowd of hecklers who were shouting out his nickname, \\"Skeffy!\\" This crowd of hecklers turned out to be a crucial cog in the machinery of fate which was to bring on his death. Undoubtedly they were the very inner city poor whom he had been exhorting to refrain from looting ‚Äì and who would have been familiar with him from his many impromptu speeches on the steps of the Custom House, where he exhorted the passers-by on feminist or socialist subjects. He lived at that time at 11 (now 21) Grosvenor Place in Rathmines, and as he and his hecklers approached the Portobello Bridge, around 7:30 p.m., they were intercepted by soldiers of the 11th East Surrey Regiment. The officer in charge was under orders to keep the road and bridge clear, and felt apprehensive about the disorderly crowd. He detained Sheehy Skeffington, who said that he was \\"not a Sinn F√©iner\\", but admitted to sympathy for the insurgents' cause, though he was opposed to violence. He was then arrested and taken back to the Portobello Barracks in Rathmines (now the Cathal Brugha Barracks). Towards 11pm that evening an officer of the 3rd battalion of Royal Irish Rifles, Captain John C. Bowen- Colthurst, took Sheehy Skeffington back out of the barracks, as a hostage in a raiding party. The raid was aimed at the tobacconist shop of Alderman James Kelly, a moderate \\"home rule\\" nationalist, whom Bowen-Colthurst had mistaken for a separatist of the same name, Alderman Tom Kelly.Brenda Malone, \\"16 Days of Internment; Alderman James J. Kelly, 1916\\", in www.thecricketbatthatdiedforireland.com, 7 Sept. 2013 (accessed 31 March 2016). The raiding party, consisting of 25 men led by Bowen-Colthurst, along with Sheehy Skeffington who was held with his hands tied behind his back, left the barracks and headed towards Rathmines Road, where they intercepted two young men who were returning from a meeting of a religious sodality. On the pretext of the lateness of the hour, Bowen-Colthurst detained and threatened them, eventually shooting one of them: a 19-year-old mechanic named James Coade, who was left in the road and subsequently died of his wound. Sheehy Skeffington witnessed this and protested against the shooting as the raiding party made its way through Rathmines. The party continued on down Lower Rathmines Road, and the soldiers stopped at the Portobello Bridge, where half of the men were left at a guardhouse along with Sheehy Skeffington. Bowen- Colthurst gave orders that the soldiers at the guardhouse were to monitor the further progress of the raiding party, and shoot Sheehy Skeffington if either his or their party came under attack from snipers. He also ordered Sheehy Skeffington to say his last prayers in case this were to happen, and when Sheehy Skeffington refused, Bowen-Colthurst said prayers on his behalf.Bryan Bacon, A Terrible Duty: the Madness of Captain Bowen-Colthurst, Thena Press, 2015 (a Kindle Book). Bacon cites as his source a Lieutenant Wilson's testimony on the first day of Colthurst's court martial. The shop at Kelly's Corner, as it appears today The raiding party continued on to the shop of Alderman James Kelly, 300 yards away at the corner of Camden Street and Harcourt Road (now known as \\"Kelly's Corner\\"). Having heard gunshots which they presumed to be emanating from Kelly's shop, the soldiers destroyed the shop (which was also Kelly's home) with hand grenades. They also captured two men who had taken refuge in the shop, Thomas Dickson and Patrick MacIntyre, both pro-British journalists.Dickson was editor of The Eye Opener and Patrick McIntyre was editor of The Searchlight. (Brenda Malone, \\"Captain John Bowen- Colthurst\\", The Cricket Bat that Died for Ireland, 6 Jan. 2015, accessed 30 December 2016.) =Summary execution= That night, Bowen-Colthurst was up much of the night praying and reading the Bible.Michael Barry, Courage Boys, We Are Winning, Dublin: Andalus Press, 2015, p. 86-89. On the following morning, he ordered the two journalists and Sheehy Skeffington taken out to a yard in the barracks, where he intended to have them shot. He told a subordinate officer this was \\"the best thing to do\\". In the yard he assembled a squad of seven men and ordered them to fire immediately at the three prisoners, who until that moment were not aware they were about to die. After killing the three men, the firing squad immediately left the yard, but when movement was detected in Sheehy Skeffington's leg, Bowen-Colthurst gathered another group of four soldiers and ordered them to fire another volley into him. Bowen-Colthurst later reported what he had done to his superior, Major Rosborough; he said he took responsibility for the shooting and that he \\"possibly might be hanged for it\\". Rosborough asked him for a written report, and Colthurst was confined to barracks duties. The bodies were hastily buried in the grounds.Brenda Malone, \\"Captain John Bowen-Colthurst\\", The Cricket Bat that Died for Ireland, 6 Jan. 2015, accessed 30 December 2016. In light of this report, it seems there may be some exaggeration in the assertion that Bowen-Colthurst then made \\"frantic efforts to wipe out all the traces of his crime\\", as a Father M. Scannell alleged many years later in a letter to Hanna Sheehy Skeffington. According to Father Scannell, Bowen-Colthurst detained several bricklayers from a nearby building site, and ordered them to repair the broken and bullet-impacted bricks in the wall behind where the executed men had stood. The terrified bricklayers would have been surrounded by soldiers with fixed bayonets pointed at them.Father Scannell's letter, written in 1935, states that one of the bricklayers later confessed this incident to him under promise of secrecy, also giving him a brick with a bullet embedded in it which the man had brought out of the barracks \\"by accident\\" in his tool basket. Scannell's letter is transcribed in Brenda Malone, \\"Captain John Bowen-Colthurst\\", op. cit., accessed 30 December 2016. Months later, when Countess Markievicz ‚Äì then in Mountjoy Prison ‚Äî first heard of the executions of the leaders of the Easter Rising, she expressed surprise at only one thing: \\"Why on earth did they shoot Skeffy?\\" she is reported to have said. \\"He didn't believe in fighting.\\"Lauren Arrington, Revolutionary Lives, op. cit., p. 145-146, citing a manuscript account of a visit by the Countess's sister. The answer to that question is somewhat clearer now, in light of archival documents. A fortnight after the execution, Bowen-Colthurst filed a written report in which he stated he had been under the impression that Dublin was being overrun by rebels who were massacring police and soldiers. He did not know that military reinforcements were arriving and knew that Portobello Barracks was undermanned, with inexperienced soldiers who belonged to disparate units. He also believed Sheehy Skeffington and the two journalists to be \\"ringleaders\\" of the uprising. Bowen-Colthurst (1880-1965) belonged to an Anglo-Irish military family centred on Blarney Castle in County Cork,His own family were from Dripsey Castle, Carrignamuck and had previously served in a stressful military career which included time in Tibet, in the Boer War, and then in the trenches of World War I, from which he had been sent home invalided, possibly due to shell shock. His brother had been killed at the Battle of Ypres in March 1915, and it seems that after this Bowen-Colthurst's superiors had noticed \\"eccentricity\\" in his behaviour, including reckless sacrifice of his men and cruelty to German prisoners. It may have been this behaviour that led him to be sent home from the front. Bowen-Colthurst's May 9 report stated: > On Tuesday and up to Wednesday morning rumours of massacres of police and > soldiers from all parts of Dublin were being constantly sent to me from > different sources. Among others the rumour reached me that 600 German > prisoners at Oldcastle had been released and armed and were marching on > Dublin. I also heard that the rebels in the city had opened up depots for > the supply and issue of arms, and that a large force of rebels intended to > attack Portobello Barracks, which was held only by a few troops ... We had > also in the barracks a considerable number of officers and men who had been > wounded by the rebels. ... Rumours of risings all over Ireland and of a > large German-American and Irish-American landing in Galway were prevalent. > ... I knew of the sedition which had been preached in Ireland for years past > and of the popular sympathy with rebellion. I knew also that men on leave > home from the trenches, although unarmed, had been shot like dogs in the > streets of their own city, simply because they were in khaki, and I had also > heard that wounded soldiers home for convalescence had been shot down also. > On the Wednesday morning 26 April all this was in my mind. I was very much > exhausted and unstrung after practically a sleepless night, and I took the > gloomiest view of the situation and felt that only desperate measures would > save the situation. However, this report may not be a reliable guide to Colthurst's motives, as on other occasions, he provided different explanations for his conduct. The report he wrote on April 26, the day of the executions, was as follows: > This morning at about 9 a.m. I proceeded to the Guard Room to examine these > two men [Dickson and MacIntyre] and I sent for a man called Skeffongton > [sic] who was also detained. I had been busy on the previous evening up to > about 3 a.m. examining documents found on these three men and I recognised > from these documents that the three men were all very dangerous characters. > I therefore sent for an armed guard of six men and ordered them to load > their Rifles and keep their eyes on the prisoners. The Guard Room was full > of men and was not a suitable place in my opinion in which to examine the > prisoners. I ordered therefore the three prisoners to go into the small > court yard of the Guard Room. I regret now that I did not have these three > men hand cuffed and surrounded as the yard was a place from which they might > have escaped. When I ordered these three men into the yard I did not however > know this. The Guard was some little distance from the prisoners and as I > considered that there was a reasonable chance of the prisoners (from > correspondence captured on them the previous evening) to be dangerous > characters, I called upon the Guard to fire upon them which they did with > effect, the three men being killed. The documents found on these three men > have been forwarded to the Orderly Room. There was another possible explanation for Colthurst's actions, mentioned in passing in the report of the subsequent Royal Commission [on the Arrest on April 25th, 1916 and Subsequent Treatment of Mr Francis Sheehy Skeffington...]. This was the suggestion that \\"a shooting incident\\" [Coade's murder] at which \\"Sheehy Skeffington was present...might have had some bearing upon his subsequent treatment.\\" =Burial and coverup= The man in overall charge of defence at Portobello Barracks was 55-year-old Sir Francis Vane (1861-1934), a Dublin-born major in the Royal Munster Fusiliers. Vane was not present when these shootings took place, having taken up an observation post at the top of the nearby Rathmines Town Hall. Later on Wednesday morning, when Vane returned to the compound, he heard what had happened during his absence from a young lieutenant attached to the Army Service Corps who was stationed at the barracks. Vane was horrified and went immediately to see the deputy commander of the garrison, Major Rosborough. He told Rosborough he believed that Bowen-Colthurst was mentally deranged. Rosborough then ordered a subordinate to telephone the garrison high command, and also to make an exceptional telephone report to the British high command at Dublin Castle. The garrison high command replied with an order to bury the bodies in the barracks yard. This was done after Roman Catholic rites had been performed by a chaplain. At a later date the bodies were exhumed in the presence of Sheehy Skeffington's father, and then reburied in consecrated ground. In an interview with the playwright Hayden Talbot six years after the killing, Hanna said her husband's body \\"had been put in a sack and buried in the barracks' yard. The remains were given to his father on condition that the funeral would be at early morn and that I be not notified. My husband's father consented unwillingly to do this on the assurance of General Maxwell that obedience would result in the trial and punishment of the murderer.\\" Re-interment took place on 8 May 1916 at Glasnevin Cemetery. Bowen-Colthurst also shot two other men on April 26, shortly after the executions at Portobello Barracks, but they seem to have been involved in the uprising. One of them was Richard O'Carroll, a brick layer, trade union officer, Labour Party Councillor, and the Quartermaster of C Company of the Irish Volunteers. O'Carroll was delivering ammunition to the garrison outpost at Northumberland Road when he was pulled from his motorcycle and shot through the lungs. He died of his wounds nine days later. The other man was one Patrick Nolan, shot by Bowen-Colthurst outside Delahunt's Grocery shop on Camden Street. He was brought to the hospital at Dublin Castle and survived.See Brenda Malone, \\"Captain John Bowen- Colthurst\\", The Cricket Bat that Died for Ireland, 6 Jan. 2015, accessed 30 December 2016. For further detail on O'Carroll's death see Neil Richardson, According to their lights: stories of Irishmen in the British Army, Easter 191 (Cork: Collins Press, 2015). Richardson cites as his source an unpublished memoir by an Anglo-Irish man who had been a medical student and also a cadet- sergeant in the British army at the time: Gerald Keatinge, \\"Some experiences of a cadet during the Irish Rebellion of Easter Week, 1916\\". See also Bryan Bacon, A Terrible Duty: the Madness of Captain Bowen-Colthurst, op. cit. Bacon cites as his source the report made by Bowen-Colthurst to his superiors on 26 April, which described O'Carroll's capture and wounding without providing his name. The grave of Francis and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was not told about her husband's detention or his death. She went around Dublin seeking to find where her husband was, and heard rumours of his fate. Her two sisters then offered to visit Portobello Barracks on Friday and make inquiries. Upon revealing their business, the two sisters were arrested as \\"Sinn F√©iners\\", and questioned by Captain Bowen- Colthurst. Bowen-Colthurst denied any knowledge as to the fate of Francis Sheehy Skeffington, and had them released. Later on Friday Hanna learned the dreadful news from the father of the young boy Coade who had also been shot, and the news was confirmed to her by the chaplain who had performed the funerary rites, and who also worked in the neighborhood. On that same Friday evening, Bowen-Colthurst and a group of soldiers forced entry into the Sheehy Skeffingtons' home, hoping to find evidence to incriminate Francis as an enemy sympathiser. Hanna, Owen (then seven), and a \\"young maid-servant\\" were in the house, where Owen was just being put to bed. The soldiers announced their presence by firing a volley of bullets through the front windows. The soldiers then burst in through the front door, wielding rifles with fixed bayonets, and ordered the three residents to stand under guard while they searched the premises. According to an official report, \\"All the rooms in the house were thoroughly ransacked and a considerable quantity of books and papers were wrapped up in the household linen, placed in a passing motor car, and taken away. ... A large part of the material removed seems to have consisted of text-books both in German and other languages, as well as political papers and pamphlets belonging to Mr. Sheehy Skeffington.\\" The maid-servant, terrified by the experience, subsequently quit her job. She was replaced by another maid who was subsequently arrested and detained for four days after another raid by the Portobello garrison (this time not ordered by Bowen-Colthurst). But upon examination several months later by a government commission, none of the material was found to be seditious. =Court-martial of Bowen-Colthurst and public inquiry= The upshot of the various military reports in the immediate aftermath of the shooting was that Bowen-Colthurst retained his rank and still circulated freely, whereas Sir Francis Vane was removed from command. Vane then travelled to London and on 3 May he met the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, in Downing Street. A telegram was then sent to Sir John Maxwell, commander-in-chief of British forces in Ireland, ordering the arrest of Bowen-Colthurst. Three days later Bowen-Colthurst was placed under \\"open arrest\\", and then on 11 May under \\"close arrest\\". Finally Bowen-Colthurst was charged with murder but to be tried by court-martial, despite the Army Act's stipulation that any soldier charged with murder committed in the United Kingdom could be tried only in a civilian, not a military, court. Over a hundred spectators attended the court martial held June 6/7 at the Richmond Barracks, Dublin. Once the prosecution and defence counsel had established the uncontested facts of the case, a succession of army officers testified to Colthurst's kindness and decency but also to his occasional eccentricity, excitability and impulsiveness. Four medical experts then provided past and more recent accounts of Colthurst's mental instability. Except to enter his 'Not guilty' pleas and to decline to comment at the end of the proceedings, Colthurst did not speak, as was his right. There were doubts about the impartiality of the court martial. There was no mention of Coade and no discussion of Colthurst's April 26 report. Similarly off limits were Colthurst's activities in the hours and days following the executions. Important witnesses (Colonel McCammond, Major Vane, Lieutenants Tooley and Gibbon, Sergeant Claxton), who might have provided different views of Colthurst's mental state, were not summoned to give evidence. Neither defence counsel's arguments nor the medical evidence 'clearly established' Colthurst's insanity at the time of the murders, the standard of proof for insanity required by the Manual of Military Law. Nevertheless, the court found Colthurst 'Guilty but insane' and sentenced him to indefinite incarceration in Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. This lenient verdict (avoiding a sentence of death or imprisonment) became a cause celebre internationally and, along with the civilian deaths in North King Street, provoked a political furore which culminated in the appointment of several Royal Commissions of Inquiry. The Royal Commission on the deaths of Sheehy Skeffington, Dickson and McIntyre was chaired by Sir John Simon (a former Attorney General and Home Secretary), and held hearings on 23‚Äì31 August 1916 in a public courtroom at the Four Courts in Dublin. 38 witnesses were examined, including Sheehy Skeffington's wife Hanna. The report of this commission\\"Royal Commission on the Arrest and subsequent treatment of Mr. Francis Sheehy Skeffington, Mr. Thomas Dickson, and Mr. Patrick James McIntyre: Report of the Commission\\", presented to both houses of Parliament by command of His Majesty, London: Darling & Son, 1916 (accessed 29‚Äì31 March 2016). The report of an earlier Royal Commission on the Rebellion in Ireland (which held hearings in May‚ÄìJune 1916) can be consulted here . constitutes the principal source of facts about the events leading to the death of Sheehy Skeffington. However, much of the evidence presented at the public hearings does not appear in the final report, due to restrictions on the formal terms of reference of the Commission. This additional evidence is known to historians thanks to reports of the oral proceedings published in the Dublin newspapers.See e.g. the Irish Times and the Irish Independent. The lacunae in the report are signalled by Bryan Bacon in A Terrible Duty: the Madness of Captain Bowen-Colthurst (Thena Press, 2015). The Royal Commission examined the circumstances of Dickson's, MacIntyre's and Sheehy Skeffington's deaths but not why they were killed. The commission chairman's view was that as a court martial had already determined that Colthurst was insane, there could be no further discussion of his mental state and motives. However, the commission report did present a plausible narrative of Colthurst's actions, April 25-28 (except for the shootings of O'Carroll and Nolan which, during the hearings, the chairman had ruled inadmissible ). The commission report concluded with three 'general observations'. In the first, the commission absolved Irish Command of responsibility for the murders, declaring itself 'satisfied that the state of things which rendered Captain Bowen-Colthurst's conduct possible was largely caused by the unfortunate but inevitable absence [through serious illness] of Colonel McCammond, the only officer in the barracks whom Captain Colthurst would not have considered himself at liberty to ignore.' In its second observation, the report singled out Colthurst's April 28 raid on Mrs Sheehy Skeffington's house as being particularly discreditable, especially in the light of his earlier treatment of Mrs Sheehy Skeffington's sisters at Portobello Barracks. Finally, the report ascribed the complicity of the soldiers involved in Colthurst's misconduct to a misunderstanding of martial law. The Commission found that it was \\"a delusion to suppose that a proclamation of martial law confers upon an officer any right to take human life in circumstances where this would have been unjustifiable without such a proclamation, and this delusion in the present case had tragic consequences\\". The Commission concluded that the proclamation of martial law > does not confer on officers or soldiers any new powers, but is a warning > that the Government, acting through the military, is about to take such > forcible and exceptional measures as are needed to restore order. ... The > measures taken can be justified only by the practical circumstances of the > case. ... The shooting of unarmed and unresisting civilians without trial > constitutes the offense of murder, whether martial law has been proclaimed > or not. We should have deemed it superfluous to point this out were it not > that the failure to realise and apply this elementary principle seems to > explain the free hand which Captain Bowen-Colthurst was not restrained from > exercising throughout the period of crisis. =Aftermath= Francis Sheehy Skeffington, depicted on street art in Dublin, in the neighborhood of Rathmines where he lived and where he was killed. Major Sir Francis Vane, who had sought to have Bowen-Colthurst brought to justice, was dishonourably discharged from the British Army at some time between May and July 1916, owing to an adverse report about him filed by British high commander Sir John Maxwell about his actions in the Skeffington murder case.British House of Commons, \\"Disturbances in Ireland\\", hearing held on 1 August 1916 (accessed 31 March 2016). He went on to be involved with the Boy Scouts, then retired from public life in 1927 and died in 1934. Captain Bowen- Colthurst was interned briefly at Broadmoor Hospital from which he was released under medical supervision on 21 January 1918, and provided with a military pension. Bowen-Colthurst emigrated in April 1919 to the Canadian province of British Columbia, where he lived for the rest of his life and died in 1965. His obituary did not mention his role in the Easter rising.Bowen- Colthurst was released from Broadmoor (under medical supervision) on 21 January 1918. He emigrated to Terrace, British Columbia in April 1919. Besides Terrace, he lived in Sooke (near Victoria) from 1929-1948, and in Naramata (near Penticton) from 1948 till his death in 1965. His obituary appeared in The Vancouver Sun, 15 December 1965 (\\"Warrior Dies\\"), and in The Penticton Herald, 14 December 1965 (\\"Colorful Figure Dies, Was Original Socred\\"). The fact that The Vancouver Sun did not mention Bowen-Colthurst's role in the Rising was noted in Bryan Bacon's book \\"A Terrible Duty: the Madness of Captain Bowen-Colthurst\\", which also reproduced the full obituary. His remains were buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Penticton, British Columbia. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was offered financial compensation by the British government in 1916, but she refused it because it came on the condition that she cease to speak and write about the murder. She became increasingly nationalist-minded, and supported the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War. She refused to send her son Owen to any school with a pro-Treaty ethos, and therefore opted to place him in the secular Sandford Park School when it was founded in 1922. Her sister's son Conor Cruise O'Brien was also placed there. Hanna died in 1946. Owen Sheehy-Skeffington became a lecturer in French at Trinity College, and, beginning in 1954, an Irish Senator. He died in 1970. Works =Books= *A Forgotten Aspect of the University Question.

In August 2019, it was announced that the network would rebrand as ESPN Africa on 30 August 2019, due to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. Australia As of August 2014 both Setanta Sports Australia and Setanta Sports Plus were sold to Al Jazeera Media Network with approval sought from regulators in Australia. The channel became BeIN Sports Australia in November 2014. Canada Setanta Sports previously operated a version of the channel in Canada as a joint venture with Canadian media company Rogers Communications (Setanta itself owned 20% of the network). However, its minority stake was acquired by Rogers in July 2011 and the channel was re-aligned as part of its Sportsnet networks, and become Sportsnet World on 3 October 2011. The re-launch would also come alongside an overall re-branding of the Sportsnet networks. Great Britain Setanta previously operated services in the UK, following a period of administration its UK services ceased operating. Within the Great Britain, Setanta GB operated Setanta Sports 1 and 2, and Setanta Golf. It also operated Setanta Sports News under a joint venture with Virgin Media. Setanta GB also operated Arsenal TV, Celtic TV, LFC TV and Rangers TV with their respective clubs. =Financial difficulties and closure= Reports on 7 June 2009 suggested that Setanta could be forced into administration that week, after failing to make payments due on TV rights. Because of late payment and renegotiation over fees by Setanta to football clubs, several British football clubs were put into financial difficulties as money promised had been spent in annual budgets. On 4 June 2009, the Scottish Premier League announced they would be paying the sums that some of the clubs were owed to avoid causing them financial problems. On 19 June 2009, Setanta Sports failed to pay the latest instalment of ¬£30 million (‚Ç¨35 million) it owed the English Premier League. The Premier League had to sell the rights to the 46 live matches Setanta had for the 2009/10 season. A Premier League spokesman said, \\"It is with considerable regret that we announce that Setanta has been unable to meet their obligations. As such the existing licence agreement between us has been terminated with immediate effect.\\"Setanta collapses could cost Premier League clubs ¬£30m The Guardian.com, 18 June 2009Setanta loses Premier League contract after failing to repay debt Times Online 19 June 2009 On 21 June 2009, BT Vision stopped selling Setanta Sports channels to customers.BT Vision stops selling Setanta BBC News, 21 June 2009 On 22 June 2009, it was reported by RT√â News that the original Setanta Sports channel, Setanta Ireland, might be bought out by an existing consortium who already hold interests in Setanta Sport Holdings Ltd., the Irish arm of Setanta Sports. Setanta Sports Ireland and Setanta Sports North America were the only brands which made a profit in 2008. The same day, Setanta lost all their SPL TV rights because they were unable to pay the ¬£3m (‚Ç¨3.5m) owed to the league. Following this, it was announced that ESPN had bought the rights to show the 46 Premier League games bought by Setanta for the 2009/10 season. Setanta GB went into administration 22 June 2009, following failure to make payments to a number of sporting organisations. 430 jobs, 200 of which were in Ireland, were expected to be lost as a result of its going into administration. The administration was handled by Deloitte. At 18:00 that day, most of its channels ceased operations within Great Britain. According to the final report published by Setanta's administrator Deloitte, released in July 2010, the broadcaster had outstanding bank loans of UK¬£261m and unsecured debt of UK¬£288m. Deloitte said that unsecured lenders received just 2p for every pound that they have claimed back from the defunct operator. Arsenal TV continued until August 2009 while Arsenal explored alternative options. Liverpool FC assumed responsibility for LFC TV and decided to continue broadcasting as normal. =Criticism= Just as when Sky Sports, in the 1990s, first obtained the exclusive rights to screen live coverage of the England national football team's away qualifying matches for the World Cup, so Setanta attracted similar criticism as a result of it having obtained the same contract. Whereas Sky often sold on a highlights package to a terrestrial broadcaster (BBC), Setanta indicated that the sums offered by terrestrial broadcasters, reported to be ¬£100,000 to ¬£200,000, were five to ten times lower than their perceived market value; Setanta paid ¬£5 million to screen England's away qualifier with Croatia on 10 September 2008 and believed a sensible highlights package should attract a fee of ¬£1 million.Interview, Victoria Derbyshire (programme), BBC Radio 5 Live, 10‚Äì11 September 2008 Thus, no highlights package was agreed, and Setanta themselves showed highlights of both England and Scotland qualifiers free-to- air after the live games had concluded. This was announced at 18:00 on the day the matches took place, and received 220,000 viewers.ITV to show England- Croatia highlights after striking Setanta deal, TheGuardian.com, 11 September 2008; Retrieved 12 September 2008 Setanta then accepted \\"a low, six-figure deal\\" with ITV to show delayed \\"extended highlights\\" a few days later. Setanta's GB subscriber numbers were lower than those of Sky Sports, and the number of households watching the match live was estimated at around 1.5 million. Because of the availability of Setanta on both digital satellite and digital terrestrial television, the theoretical possible subscriber base surpassed that of Sky Sports (not available via DTT at the time) but fans who were unwilling to subscribe could not see the match live. British Prime Minister at the time Gordon Brown indicated he felt it \\"unfortunate\\" more fans could not see the match live for free. =Cancellation issues= Setanta GB also received significant criticism of its cancellation policy, with the issue investigated by the BBC's Watchdog programme and Radio 5 Live. While customers were able to subscribe either on-line or over the telephone, many customers found it \\"nigh-on impossible to cancel\\" the service, with the only means of a cancellation being to inform the company in writing. Because of the amount of negative feedback received, Setanta GB eventually changed this to allow for cancellations to be done through email. Furthermore, while customers were originally entered into a 30-day notice period once their cancellation letter was received, this was increased to 60 days without any information being sent to customers; again, because of the negative feedback, this was quickly reduced back to 30 days. These customer service issues were compounded by the fact that customers had to phone a premium rate number should they have any issues to resolve, with calls costing at least 10 pence per minute. Southeast Asia Setanta Sports launched a variation of the channel in Asia.

It is distinguished from pyromania by the gratification being of a sexual nature. Description While the erotic focus immediately raises the diagnostic issue of pyromania, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV classifies this disorder as an impulse-control disorder, with nothing to indicate or suggest an overlap between this disorder and the paraphilias. Other than the purposeful act of fire-setting itself, there is no mention of the possibility that the tension or affective arousal experienced before the act; the fascination with, interest in, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (for example, paraphernalia, uses, consequences); or the pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting, witnessing, or participating in the aftermath of fires might be sexual in nature or even contain a sexual arousal component. Some described cases of pyrophilia do not include behaviors commonly associated with pyromania, such as being a regular ‚Äúwatcher‚Äù at fires in their neighbourhood; setting off false alarms; deriving pleasure from institutions, equipment, and personnel associated with fire, spending time at the local fire station, setting fires in order to be affiliated with the fire department; and either showing indifference to the consequences to life and property caused by the fire or deriving satisfaction from the resulting destruction of property. Sexual gratification need not involve actual fire; arousal or masturbatory aids may include fantasies or talk of setting a fire. In other instances, the patient may derive arousal primarily from setting or watching their fire. Pyrophilia has been diagnosed in very few instances, and is not fully accepted by the general psychological community.. In popular culture Pyrophilia is the main subject of Ricardo Abdahllah's novel Pyretta Blaze and the Type O Negative song inspired by and named after the book. Pyrophilia is also seen in George R.R. Martin's novel series A Song of Ice and Fire, where several characters including Aerys Targaryen show symptoms of pyrophilia and pyromania.

The highway is an old routing of U.S. Route 89 from Bitter Springs, Arizona to Kanab, Utah. The state of Arizona has designated this highway the Fredonia- Vermilion Cliffs Scenic Road. The highway is used to access Grand Canyon National Park and is known for the Navajo Bridge. Until 2008, the Utah portion was signed State Route 11. __TOC__ US 89A southeast of Navajo Bridge, June 2009 Route description The highway's southern terminus is at U.S. Route 89 south of Page, Arizona. Its northern terminus is in Kanab, Utah, also at US 89. US 89A runs near or through Lee's Ferry, the Navajo Bridge, Vermilion Cliffs, the Kaibab Plateau, and Fredonia, Arizona. The eastern portion of the highway runs through part of the Navajo Nation. From Jacob Lake, State Route 67 leads south to the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, then north to the neighboring cities of Fredonia, Arizona and Kanab, Utah. The Utah portion of US 89A is defined by Utah Code Annotated ¬ß72-4-114. History Navajo Bridges over Marble Canyon along US 89A, June 2009 This was part of mainline US 89 until the construction of Glen Canyon Dam. In 1960, US 89 was moved to a new, more northerly route and the old route became US 89A. The Utah segment of US 89A was first commissioned as part of State Route 11. This highway ran from Nephi to the Arizona state line near Kanab. This route is still drivable as the modern US 89A, US 89, and SR-132. With the establishment of the United States highway system in 1926, most of SR-11 was used for the routing of US 89 through southern Utah; the internal designation used by state agencies remained SR-11. In 1969, as part of a series of changes to state routes, the portion north of Sevier Junction (I-70 and US 89 near Joseph) was transferred to other routes, removing the only part of State Route 11 that was signed with the state designation. It is also during this time that a new alignment for US 89 was constructed to serve the Glen Canyon Dam, with SR-11 being now signed as US 89A south of Kanab and US 89 to the north. As part of the 1977 Utah state route renumbering to conform signage and legislative definitions, SR-11 was truncated to what is now signed US 89A. The route was signed SR-11, with \\"TO US 89A\\" at the northern terminus in Kanab and a \\"TO US 89\\" at the Arizona state line. In 2008, however, SR-11 was deleted after a bill in the Utah legislature was passed to restore U.S. Route 89A in Utah. From 1941 to 1992, there was a discontinuous southern portion US 89A running from Flagstaff to Prescott, Arizona, now designated Arizona State Route 89A.

It has about 9,800 inhabitants. The centre of the town is historically significant and from 2003 it is protected by law as Urban monument zone. History Lys√° nad Labem was firstly mentioned in the Cosmas chronicle. In the 13th century, a castle was built here and until the reign of the Luxembourgs, the town was property of the Czech queens. Since 1291, there has been evidence of Lys√° being a town. In that year, Queen Guta issued a charter to unite the settlements of the Lys√° estate into one economic unit. During the Hussite wars the town suffered a lot. At the turn of the 15th and 16th century, the Smi≈ôick√Ω family of Smi≈ôice rebuilt the castle into the palace. In 1548 Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor added Lys√° to the intimate dominion as a hunting centre. The sustainable development of the town was stopped by the Thirty Years' War. Armed uprising, which burst in the town during the violent recatholisation, is the proof of the presence of the evangelical element until the Battle of White Mountain. The immediate reaction to the religious tolerance was the establishment of the group of the Reformed church, whose compound is still one of the cultural monuments of the town. In 1647, Lys√° was acquired by the empire general Johann von Sporck and then the town began to flourish. After the general's death, his son Franz Anton von Sporck began to reign. He made the most important changes in 1696 when the Augustinian monastery was restored and the new parish church and the chapel of Three Kings were built. Nowadays, the palace serves as a House for seniors. In 1950, the village of Litol was merged with the town. Monuments The notable buildings of the town are the Augustinian monastery, neighbouring with baroque palace and the church in the Baroque style as well. Baroque monuments are here thanks to the reign of count Franz Anton von Sporck, who invited many Baroque artists to the town. The most famous of them was sculptor Matthias Braun. Braun with his pupils sculpted many statues for the town, many of which decorate the palace garden. Another interesting place is the museum of oriental cultures, dedicated to the local native Bed≈ôich Hrozn√Ω, who deciphered the hieroglyphic script of the Hittites. Culture Nowadays, Lys√° nad Labem is most famous for the horse racing course and its exhibition grounds where many thematic exhibitions are held during the whole year.

It is approximately north-west of Newcastle upon Tyne on the A68, and is the last village in England before the A68 climbs the Cheviot Hills to cross Carter Bar into Scotland. Byrness's village church features a stained-glass window commemorating the workers who died during the building of Catcleugh Reservoir nearby. Much of the village was built by the Forestry Commission to house workers for the extensive forests that surround it. Situated on the Pennine Way, Byrness has an inn (Forest View), campsite and other accommodation offering rest and sustenance for weary walkers. History In the 17th century Byrness was located in the shieling grounds of the upper Rede valley and there is little or no evidence of permanent post-medieval habitation. By the latter part of the 18th century, Hodgson reported that there was a burial ground in the area and the sale of the Lordship by the Howards had resulted in the construction of some farms in the area, such as Catcleugh and Byrness. The first real evidence of attempts to create a permanent centre of settlement in this part of upper Redesdale came in the 1790s with the erection of the Church of St Francis and also a school by the Rector of Elsdon, the Rev Louis Dutens. The school was only built to house twelve children and gives some indication of the small size of the surrounding agricultural population. This population remained fairly stable throughout the 19th century, but was obviously given a huge increase with the construction of Catcleugh Reservoir and the introduction of several hundred workers and their families into this remote rural location. The village for the workers constructed by the water company supplied many of the workers' needs. However, aspects of the building operations, such as the narrow gauge railway to Woodburn and the Saturday market held for the dam workers by local tradesmen were of direct benefit to the local people. When the dam was completed, a small number of workers remained to manage the reservoir, but the next influx new people did not take place until the 1930s. In an effort to assist the long-term unemployed, a number of labour camps to provide industrial training were opened throughout Britain. One of these was built at Byrness as a summer extension camp for the facility at Kielder in North Tynedale and operated as a training centre from 1934 until the Second World War when it was closed down. It is known that workers from this camp assisted with forestry work as there was clearly a requirement for workers as parts of upper Redesdale was planted. After the war, this work was undertaken by forestry staff who were provided with a purpose built village just north of the church at Byrness. Dr Thomas Sharp, a highly regarded expert in local authority housing, designed the houses, which are similar to the ones built at Kielder and Stonehaugh. The village has now been sold off to private home-owners as working practices in the forestry industry no longer necessitate a permanent, resident work force. At the same time the school which became housed in a modern building close to the village is now closed and unused, while the old school is now a private house. The former Byrness farmhouse is now a hotel. Wildlife Species encountered in the Byrness area include roe deer, badger, fox and the endangered red squirrel. The forest and hills in the area are also home to a variety of birds of prey including eagles, hawks and owls. During the summer months it is common to see an adder or the common lizard.

In addition to preying on American merchant ships (she captured 18 between her commissioning on 11 February 1813 and her conversion to a merchant vessel in 1814), she also defended Nova Scotian waters during the war. After her conversion to a merchantman she fell prey to an American privateer in 1814. She was burnt to prevent her reuse. Origins She was originally the American privateer brig Thorn, Asa Hooper master, and was armed with eighteen long 9-pounder guns. Thorn was from Marblehead, Massachusetts, and she was on her first cruise when the British captured her.She had sailed with 140 men but had put prize crews aboard two prizes so only 124 remained. At the time of her capture she had already taken as prizes the brig Freedom, loaded with salt, and the American vessel Hiram, with a cargo of flour and bread on a voyage to Lisbon and traveling with a British license (safe conduct pass) that asked all British naval vessels and privateers to let her pass, provided that she was on a bona fide passage to Spain or Portugal with flour. This capture, on 15 October, gave rise to a US Supreme Court court case in which the court ruled that Hiram, although an American vessel, was a legitimate prize.JustitiaTHE HIRAM, 12 U. S. 444 (1814) The British naval vessels , , and captured Thorn on 31 October 1812. Thorn was sold at Halifax as a prize and renamed after the former colonial administrator Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. Privateer She had three letters of marque issued to her: 27 November 1812 (Captain Thomas Robson); 15 February 1813 (Captain Joseph Freeman); and 27 August 1814 (Captain Wm Corken). Sir John Sherbrooke's primary captain was Joseph Freeman, an experienced privateer officer from Liverpool, Nova Scotia, who was a veteran who did everything in navy fashion. (Freeman was eventually buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)). Freeman co-operated with the navy, which treated him with the same respect as a naval officer. On 7 April Betsey, which had been sailing from Newport to Havana, arrived at Halifax, a prize to Sir John Sherbrooke. Lloyd's List - accessed 15 December 2013. On 19 May Sir John Sherbrooke recaptured the brig Paragon, of 213 tons (bm), J. Gorden, master, which an American privateer had captured as Paragon was sailing from Aberdeen to New Brunswick. Paragon arrived at Halifax on 24 May. The records of the Vice admiralty court give the name of Paragons master as \\"J. Gardner\\". Sir John Sherbrooke also sent into Halifax Columbia, which had been sailing from Savannah. Sir Sir John Sherbrooke had captured Columbia, a brig of 98 tons (bm), S.Holland, master, on 15 May. Columbia had been sailing from Savannah to Boston with a cargo of 173 bales of cotton and a quantity of reeds. On 24 May San Gabriel arrived at Halifax. She had been sailing from Havana to New York when the American privateer Alexander had captured her. Sir John Sherbrooke recaptured San Gabriel on 19 May and sent her into Halifax. The Vice admiralty court restored San Gabriel, A. Drummond, master, to her owners. On 18 December 1813, the prize agents advertised the distribution of prize money for the following captures: *Sloops Red Bird, Apollo, Betsey, and Fame *Brig Columbia *Schooners Mary, Paulina, and Caroline *Privateer schooner Governor Plummer, of six guns and a crew of 100 men. as well as salvage for the recapture of the ship , brig Paragon, and sloop General Hodgson.Acadian Recorder 1 January 1814 p.4. Next, Sir John Sherbrooke sailed in company with and the schooner . Together the three captured 11 American vessels between 7 and 9 April. Sir John Sherbrooke provided reinforcements for Shannon prior to her famous victory over the USS Chesapeake, although Sir John Sherbrooke was not present at the battle. Sir John Sherbrooke had gathered 50 Irish volunteers when on 26 May 1813 she recaptured Duck, which was transporting them as laborers from Waterford to Newfoundland. Duck had been the prize of the American privateer General Plummer, which Sir John Sherbrooke had captured two days latter. Twenty-two of the laborers agreed to transfer from Sir John Sherbrooke to Shannon. Sir John Sherbrooke also began the chase of the notorious American privateer schooner Young Teazer, which British naval ships, including and then took up. The chase ended with Young Teazer's destruction at the hands of a member of her own crew who feared capture because he had violated his parole resulting from a previous capture. Merchantman Far larger than most colonial privateers, Sir John Sherbrooke required a constant supply of American captures to pay for her large crew. Following the destruction of most American shipping during the war, Sir John Sherbrooke became unprofitable to operate as a privateer and her owners sold her in 1814. Her new owners then employed her as a merchant ship. Lloyd's Register (LR) for 1815 showed her with J. Duncan, master, Ewing & Co., owners, and trade Greenock‚ÄìNewfoundland. The entry carried the annotation that she had been captured in 1814.LR (1815), Seq.‚ÑñS493. Fate In the autumn of 1814 Sir John Sherbrooke was outward bound from Halifax with a cargo of oil and dried fish. She encountered the American privateer Syren, which captured her and put a prize crew aboard her. Lloyd's List (LL) reported on 21 October 1814 that Sir John Sherbrooke, Lester, master, was one of four merchantmen that American privateers had captured. (The other three were James, McNeil, master, Emulation, and , Lester, master. Their crews were landed at Viana.[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735026?urlappend=%3Bseq=411 LL.) However, a British squadron came along and chased the captured Sir John Sherbrooke ashore. The American prize crew managed to get away with all the valuables on board despite the fire of the British frigate's guns. The frigate sent her boats to attempt a recovery, but gunfire from a nearby fort drove them off. Salvage was impracticable, so the cutting-out party from the frigate set Sir John Sherbrooke on fire; she then burned to the water's edge. On 16 November 1814, boats from ] and , herself a former American privateer, ran Syren ashore under Cape May, where her crew destroyed her. Other information Sir John Sherbrooke was not as famous as her smaller and more successful counterpart, the schooner Liverpool Packet. However some believe that Sir John Sherbrooke inspired the line \\"I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\", from the Stan Rogers song \\"Barrett's Privateers\\", because the town of Sherbrooke, Nova Scotia did not yet exist, as the song takes place in 1778.

Bywell Castle is a gatehouse tower built in the early 15th century for Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland. There are two churches in Bywell. * St Andrew's Church, now redundant, is situated near Bywell Hall and has a fine tower of the Anglo Saxon period, considered to be the best in the county ‚Äî high and about . Part of a cross is another reminder of the early period, when the church then had narrow nave, chancel and apse. It was very much enlarged in the thirteenth century in a time of local prosperity. In the nineteenth century it was extensively restored, and a lot of medieval grave covers were built into the walls of the church very attractively. The thirteenth-century font was where Robert Surtees, the sporting novelist was baptized. He was born at the Riding on 26 August 1806. There are monuments to Fenwicks of Bywell and Bacons of Styford. St Andrew's Church is now surplus to requirements and is preserved as part of our heritage. The vicarage was demolished in 1852, and Mr Beaumont gave land for building another at Riding Mill. * St Peter's Church is different in situation, among the trees and close to the river. It has a square medieval tower, and the church was extended in the thirteenth century. A close examination of the stonework will reveal features of the Saxon period, and there is evidence of more extensive buildings. There is a tide dial on the south wall. The north chantry or chapel was for many years used as a school. One lancet window is a memorial to the curate Henry Parr Dwarris, who was drowned in the Tyne. There is a monumental brass to Wentworth Canning Blackett Beaumont, Viscount Allendale, born at Bywell Hall in 1860. He presented the Sele and Priory grounds to the people of Hexham. Another inscription commemorates William Wailes (1881), artist in stained glass. The church is also partly 8th century in date and it is possibly the building in which Bishop Egbert of Lindisfarne was consecrated in AD 802. :The high garden wall to the south-west of the old vicarage is known locally as the \\"spite wall\\". It was built to hide the vicarage from the view of the Hall. When the village of Bywell was cleared, the vicar could not be made to leave.

In 1967 he was appointed to a research position at IBM and he remained on their research staff until 1994. An important figure in the early development of generative grammar, he became a proponent of the generative semantics movement along with George Lakoff, James D. McCawley, and Haj Ross. In the 1970s, with David M. Perlmutter, he developed Relational Grammar. Later, with David E. Johnson, he developed Arc Pair Grammar. These non-transformational theories of grammar have had an indirect but major impact on modern syntactic analysis. Since his involvement with generative semantics, he has remained a vocal critic of Noam Chomsky and work done in Chomsky's frameworks.Harris, Randy Allen (1993). The Linguistics Wars. Oxford: OUP.

The term was coined in 1981 by Faith Popcorn, a trend forecaster and marketing consultant. It is used in social science, marketing, parenting, economic forecasting, self-help, religion, and has become part of standard English as defined by multiple dictionaries. History Evidence of intensifying home-focused behavior became more pronounced in Popcorn's data from 1984 and by 1985 she forecast it would be a trend, not a fad. She explained the concept involves building a \\"shell of safety\\" around oneself in a 1986 article in The New Yorker. In 1987, The Washington Post columnist George Will explained that \\"the harassments of daily life -- looming nuclear incineration, rude waiters -- have driven people to cocooning. They have gone to ground in their dens with their VCRs and compact- disc players, snug in their Barcaloungers equipped with stereo headphones, the better to keep at bay the modern world, the discontinuities of which have produced a longing for tradition.\\" A Los Angeles Times article in 1987 called \\"The Essence of Cocooning: It's a Desire for a Cozy, Perfect Environment Far From the Influences of a Madding World\\" tied the concept to fear of environment destruction. In the article, Popcorn cited the increased use of gourmet frozen foods, soft furniture such as Barcaloungers, investment services, and \\"mom foods\\" that remind consumers of adolescence, as examples of cocooning behavior. She cited less involvement in social and political issues as a downside of cocooning, though she predicted a counter-trend to emerge. The term was designated in 1987 by the editors of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language as a word being tracked for possible inclusion in the dictionary. The dictionary's editors later included it, as did Merriam Webster's Dictionary. A 1989 New York Times article called \\"Lounge Wear for Cocooning\\" described a trend among many upscale designers, including Ralph Lauren, Bob Mackie, Giorgio Armani and Valentino, to create clothing for use at home that was more dressy than sleepwear but less formal than sportswear. \\"However, sleeping is not the point. Neither, necessarily, is seduction. Cocooning, a dream word for market researchers, is. Everybody is working. Everybody is tired. Everybody just wants to go home and watch 48-inch TV. Relax, slip into something comfortable, and join the ranks of homebody chic,\\" the article says. In its 1996 \\"Year in Review\\" article, Time cited cocooning as a major social trend and linked it to Bowling Alone, a 1995 essay by Harvard Professor Robert Putnam, describing a decrease in in-person social intercourse. Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the Chicago Tribune ran an article entitled \\"The 'cocooning' trend draws reinforcement\\" which asserted that the terrorist attacks intensified cocooning. In 2002, La-Z-Boy, in partnership with Popcorn debuted \\"cocooning chairs\\" for women, scaled-down reclining chairs allowing women to get up and down easily but still big enough to pull children onto their laps. An even smaller version was sold for children. A study by sociologists at the University of Toronto in 2004 concluded that Canadians were socializing less with their friends and family and spending more time \\"cocooning\\" home alone. The change was attributed to \\"higher rates of separation and divorce, smaller households with fewer children, delayed marriages and more individuals living alone.\\" In 2013, a USA Today article entitled \\"Cocooning: It's back and thanks to tech, it's bigger\\" concluded that cocooning had turned into \\"super-cocooning\\": \\"Thanks to always- on wireless Internet connectivity and bigger, better TVs that reproduce pixel- perfect high-definition video, cocooning is entering a new evolutionary stage. Consumers are staying home more, watching movies delivered via cable, satellite, Internet or disc, eating in and transforming their apartments and houses into a shelter from the daily social storm.\\" In Fortune in 2015, Popcorn said \\"uber-cocooning, and now even bunkering\\" were becoming prominent because people had become \\"terrified\\" of world conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland, \\"cocooning\\" has been the term used by the Health Service Executive and other official bodies when advising precautionary self-isolation by those aged over 70 or in other high-risk groups.; In the UK, the term \\"shielding\\" is more frequently used. The UK government has advised people who are \\"clinically extremely vulnerable\\" to \\"stay at home as much as possible and keep interactions outside to a minimum. This is called ‚Äòshielding‚Äô, and the government is currently advising people to shield until 31 July 2020\\".Public Health England, Guidance on shielding and protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19, updated 14 July 2020, accessed 28 July 2020 Child Rearing and Adoption Cocooning A 2014 clinical book for mental health practitioners, lawyers and educators describes the parental strategy of cocooning (or \\"restrictive mediation\\") as explicitly limiting objectionable material, including from television and the movies, from younger children. When the same practice is used with older adolescents, it was determined parents were less connected to their children, more likely to be resented and less successful in maintaining control in the long term. In The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia, its authors contend that adoptive parents have \\"popularized\\" cocooning as \\"a strategic way in which to create a safe and secure home in which to raise a newly adopted child.\\" The psychologist Patti Zordich trademarked \\"cocooning\\" as the focus of the resources she provides to adoptive families. Standard cocooning tactics for adoptive parents include retreating from the outside world to focus on the immediate family in order to build bonds that will secure attachment with the child.  Digital Cocooning  A 1994 article in PC Magazine described \\"virtual cocooning\\" in terms of virtual reality products for exploring and designing one's own interiors or world. In South Korea, experts who saw the rise of \\"digital cocooning\\" in 2006 said that while some people were experiencing a nomadic outdoor life thanks to wireless devices, others were choosing to stay \\"nested up at home\\" with them. People who almost never left home because of the internet were characterized as \\"digital zombies.\\" Digital cocooning was the subject of a 2014 panel discussion about \\"isolating elements of pervasive mobile technology.\\" A 2014 report by Euromonitor International, a strategic market research firm, contends that \\"A major consequence of the growth in mobile web use is that the trend towards cocooning ‚Äì the home- centred lifestyle that characterised the early part of the century ‚Äì has given way to a movement towards mobile or individual cocooning, whereby consumers are immersed in their own digital worlds anywhere and anytime.\\" Tele-Cocooning is a term developed by Ichiyo Habuchi in 2005 to describe intimate human computer interaction, specifically in reference to \\"the communication of one person to the next without having physical interaction with that person\\".Ichiyo Habuchi, ‚ÄúAccelerating Reflexivity,‚Äù in Personal, Portable, Pedestrian: Mobile Phones in Japanese Life, ed. Mizuko Ito, Daisuke Okabe, and Misa Matsuda (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2005). In 2014, an academic study of Japanese youth supported the \\"tele-cocooning hypothesis\\", which contends that mobile \\"texting is associated with increasingly insular communication because it strengthens core ties at the expense of interactions with lesser-known weak ties.\\" The study says that research from many sources showed that texting among youth usually involves \\"the intensive exchange of text messages among intimate and homogeneous peers.\\" This decreases social tolerance and trust. A 2015 follow up study concluded that tele-cocooning behavior could be mitigated with smartphone applications stimulating interaction with communication weak ties through on-screen reminders. Books =Popcorn Report= In her 1991 book, The Popcorn Report, Popcorn describes cocooning as: \\"the impulse to go inside when it just gets too tough and scary outside. To pull a shell of safety around yourself, so you're not at the mercy of a mean, unpredictable world - those harassments and assaults that run the gamut from rude waiters and noise pollution to crack-crime, recession and AIDS. Cocooning is about insulation and avoidance, peace and protection, coziness and control-a sort of hyper-nesting.\\" In the 1991 book, Popcorn argues that since she had defined the trend it had been substantiated by subsequent skyrocketing VCR sales; declining restaurant sales just as take out restaurant sales substantially grew; the emergence of \\"shelter\\" magazines; screening calls; and the increase in birth rates. Popcorn described three sub-trends within cocooning: the armored cocoon, the wandering cocoon, and the socialized cocoon. Armored Cocoon Indicators of the \\"armored cocoon\\" included greater gun ownership among women, and the growth in \\"paranoia\\" industries. These include home security systems, computerized watchdog systems linked to private guards and emergency help, anti-snooping devices, home warehousing of supplies and home delivery of food and other supplies to \\"stock the cocoon.\\" Wandering Cocoon The \\"wandering cocoon\\" is characterized by controlling one's environment when outside the home, such as car and mini-van design intended to make automobiles more pleasurable and livable. Signs of the \\"mobile cocoon\\" included people eating more meals in their cars; conducting business and \\"life maintenance chores\\" over the phone while driving; and the increase in airline security. Socialized Cocoon The \\"socialized cocoon\\" is characterized by surrounding oneself with \\"soothing, congenial\\" friends in one's \\"home cocoon.\\" Rather than entertaining at home as in the past, the socialized cocoon is characterized by selective invitations to a few close friends. Signs included a surge in book clubs, watching television with friends. The 1991 trend was described as \\"nascent.\\" =Other Books= In her 1997 book, Clicking: 17 Trends That Drive Your Business--And Your Life, Popcorn asserted that the cocooning trend would give rise to 24-hour, comprehensive home banking. William A. Sherden, in his 1999 book The Fortune Sellers: The Big Business of Buying and Selling Predictions, takes a skeptical view of Popcorn's ideas about cocooning and concludes she was wrong on several issues. Sherden's statistics show double digit percentage growth in activities outside the home in the five years following her prediction. In 2003, in the Encyclopedia of Community: From the Village to the Virtual World, authors David Levinson and Karen Christensen note that cocooning has intensified with the growth of the internet because people can stay at home for weeks at a time without losing touch with friends, getting food to eat, working or watching recent movies. The authors cite the growth of home entertainment as a significant factor in cocooning, with people treating large casts of fictional characters as a \\"surrogate community.\\" While they saw no evidence of people entertaining at home more, in the wake of September 11, they said that people traveled less, stayed closer to home and spent more time with their families. A German economics book in 2009 titled Cocooning: My Home is My Castle asserted that in times of crisis people prefer to \\"hedgehog\\" at home and forecast good commercial prospects for chocolate, snacks, ready-made-meals and home furniture. A self-help book from 2010, The One Year Book of Inspiration for Girlfriends, advocates cocooning as a form of religious retreat. In 2014, authors Marilyn Coleman and Lawrence Ganong tie cocooning to the trend for larger homes. Rather than using amenities like public pools, parks and movie theaters, and participate in community activities like church and school functions, the authors contended that more people were retreating to large homes designed as a safe and pleasant refuge.

The astronomer's surname, and hence the star identifier, is sometimes indicated by a Greek sigma, Œ£. Although the components are too faint to be viewed with the naked eye, this star system is among the closest to the Sun. Parallax measurements by the Hipparcos spacecraft give them an estimated distance of about 11.6 light years away. Both stars are small red dwarfs, with each having around a third the Sun's mass and radius. They each display the type of variability common to flare stars, and their active surfaces are sources of X-ray emission. The orbital period for the pair is about 295 years, with an average distance of about 56 astronomical units, and the eccentricity of their orbit is 0.70. The pair has a relatively high proper motion of 2.2 arc seconds per year. The system is on an orbit through the Milky Way that has an eccentricity of 0.05, carrying them as close as 8 kpc and as far as 9 kpc from the Galactic Center.

The earliest manuscript (of 36 which are known to exist) dates from the first half of the 16th-century (AM 123 8vo). Synopsis The story begins in Denmark where there was a king called Hringr, the son of Skj√∂ld Dagsson. It tells that this Skj√∂ld had a saga of his own telling of his battles with a Herman. It lauds Hringr's qualities as well as those of his son Sigurd. The mother was Sigrid, the daughter of Vilhjalm (William) of Gaul. Not far from where they lived there was a farmer called Svidi the Valiant whose wife was Hildr and son Illugi. This Illugi was tall, strong and good at any game, and he often played with Prince Sigurd. The two boys became close friends and swore to avenge one another. However, the king had an incompetent advisor named Bj√∂rn who was treacherous and cunning, but skilled in seid (witchcraft) and a great warrior who ably defended Denmark for the king. Bj√∂rn was jealous that Sigurd loved Illugi so much, so he slandered Illugi in front of the king and the prince, but Sigurd refused to believe him. One summer, Sigurd, Bj√∂rn and Illugi went a Viking expedition to Scotland and Orkney. The pillaging was good, and in the autumn they steered home to Denmark. However, a great storm arose and they were driven away to large bay called Gandvik (usually identified as the White Sea). It was cold and Bj√∂rn asked Illugi to cross a fjord to fetch firewood. If he succeeded it would prove him a better advisor and he would get Bj√∂rn's ring. Illugi, however, declined and said that he would go for wood anyway. When he had crossed the fjord, he found a cave and soon encountered its inhabitant. It was a troll woman named Grid. She could not be called beautiful, in fact she was hideous. When Illugi said that he came searching for fire, she replied that he would get none unless he said three truthful words fast, and slept with her daughter. The daughter was stunning and Illugi immediately fell in love with her. The truthful words he chose to say were that Grid was hideous, the hall was beautiful and so was the daughter. Grid said that since he preferred the daughter to her, he could go to bed with the girl. Illugi was surprised that she was not enjoying the act, and soon he found out why because Grid grabbed him by the hair, put a knife to his throat and said that she would kill him for seducing the girl. However, when Illugi showed no signs of fear, she asked him to go back to bed remarking that she had never met anyone less afraid of dying. She had killed sixteen men with the knife and they had all been afraid. Grid said that he would have the girl whose name was Hildr, and then she told him her story. She said that there was a king √Åli in Alfheim (modern Bohusl√§n) whose queen was Alfrun. Their daughter's name was Signy and she was a very able girl. She was married to a king named Eric who died during an expedition in the west, leaving her with a very beautiful daughter named Hildr. Signy then returned to her father, but the mother soon died and the father remarried with a woman named Grimhild. This Grimhild was just as evil as she was beautiful, and so were her seven daughters that she had before marrying King √Åli. Rumours began to spread in the kingdom and when a man disappeared mysteriously this was attributed to Grimhild. Grimhild murdered the old king by poison, became the ruler and soon her tyranny had laid the whole kingdom waste. She banished Signy and her daughter Hildr from the kingdom, putting a curse on them so they had to live alone in a cave. All the men who saw Hildr would fall in love with her, but Signy would murder them, and every night seven sisters would maim and mutilate her. They would live in this condition until she found a man who was not afraid of dying. When Signy heard this she was speechless of sorrow, but Hildr cursed Grimhild. She said that a fire would burn between her legs, and she would be burning on one side and freezing on the other until their own curse had passed, then Grimhild would fall into the fire and die. Grid said that she was Signy and as Illugi had delivered them from the spell after eleven years, he would marry her daughter. Then the seven daughters of Grimhild arrived with short swords and attacked Grid, wounding her in the body and in her heart. Illugi threw himself into the fight to defend Grid, killed all seven of them and burned them in the fire. Grid gave Illugi gold and he returned to the ships with fire. The other men were glad to see him, but Bj√∂rn slandered Hildr and said that she was an evil troll. Sigurd told Bj√∂rn to keep quiet. Later at night Bj√∂rn disappeared and in the morning they found him dead hanging from the mast of the ship. This was how Grid punished him for calling her daughter a troll. Sigurd then sailed to Finnmark and then back to Denmark with the ships laden with booty. Later, king Hringr died by illness and Sigurd inherited Denmark and Sk√•ne. Signy came to Denmark to join them and was well received by Illugi and Hildr. Illugi told Sigurd everything about Signy and Sigurd decided to marry her. They had many children and lived long. But Illugi lived longest even though he and Hildr never had any children. However, Illugi became the foster-father of Gnodar-Asmund.

Geography The island is southwest of the country's capital, Mal√©. Unlike all the other islands in this chain, it is naturally round in shape, owing to its position on one of the edge of one of the widest channels in the MPA. Demography Economy The main area of habitation is toward the eastern half of the island. A deep water access harbour leads toward the enormous main street, which runs east to west straight through the heart of the island. This busy street is full of different kinds of shops, with the tourist souvenir shops dominating the eastern end. Toward the western end of the street is a small mosque, the medical centre, the huge and very impressive school and the island council offices. There is a real feel of growth and development on this island, and in many ways it feels more like Male or an atoll capital island than the traditional quiet village that is seen nearby. Adding to this sense of progress is the impossible to miss development of a huge new deep water harbour and airport complex. The traditional harbour has been expanded by several times its original size, and is now capable of accommodating 20 metre plus liveaboard vessels.  Transport  = Ferry = Maamigili is connected by ferry service from Mal√©. = Airport = Villa International Airport has been built on the southern edge of the island, the huge lagoon has been reclaimed, adding an area of over 73 hectares to the original island. This was done to construct the first airport in Ari atoll, with a plan to link into the network of larger capacity terrestrial landing planes, which are capable of reaching all parts of the country. The airport will also have a pilot training school. Progress on the construction of the airport is gathering pace, with regular flights being scheduled to begin by 2013. = Taxi = The island has about five taxi cars and around three pickups as taxi for various purposes.

He rose to international prominence during the 1991 Persian Gulf War during which he acquired the nickname \\"The Scud Stud\\". He is the brother of Canada's former Minister of the Environment Peter Kent.  Early life and education  Kent was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta. His father, Arthur Parker Kent, worked for Southam Newspaper Group and retired as associate editor of the Calgary Herald. After his father's retirement, Arthur Kent began his journalism career at the Calgary Herald in the summer of 1973. Kent graduated from Carleton University in Ottawa in 1975 while working as a general assignment reporter for CJOH, Ottawa's CTV station.  Career  In 1977, after moving to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Kent was named Alberta correspondent for The National, CBC's principal TV newscast. Three years later, Kent left CBC to become an independent reporter and photographer, eventually filing jointly to NBC News, CBC and London's Observer newspaper. In 1989 Kent joined NBC News as the network's Rome Correspondent. Kent won 1989 Emmy Awards for his part in NBC's coverage of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre and the December, 1989 Romanian Revolution. After a contract dispute with NBC, he was fired in August 1992. He subsequently sued NBC for breach of contract, fraud, and defamation, a case that was settled in March 1994. Under the terms of the agreement, NBC paid Kent a large settlement and retracted prior statements about Kent and the dispute. Kent also won the right to publish testimony and evidence from the discovery phase of the suit in his book, Risk and Redemption: Surviving the Network News Wars. He subsequently returned to Canada to host CBC Television's Man Alive. With the settlement from NBC, he established his own film company, Fast Forward Films, in the UK. Kent has worked for the BBC, The Observer and Maclean's. He has hosted many History Channel shows including History Undercover and History's Mysteries. Afghanistan: Captives of the Warlords was shot secretly using a hidden camera, which shows life in Afghanistan under the repressive Taliban, contrasted with life under the much more lenient Northern Alliance. First broadcast by PBS in June 2001, an updated version received extensive broadcast on PBS affiliates and on CBC following the September 11 attacks. It received the Gold WorldMedal at the New York festivals, and a Golden Eagle award from CINE.AEI Speakers Bureau. Arthur Kent profile; retrieved 2007-01-15. In 2007, Kent launched skyreporter.com, an outlet for new & archived documentaries and short films. Composed of 1‚Äì2 minute pieces from Afghanistan, London, Bosnia, Iraq, and other places, Sky Reporter features Kent's independent reportage and commentary direct from the field. In 2008, Kent sued the producers and distributors of the film Charlie Wilson's War, claiming that the movie used material Kent produced in the 1980s without permission.Anne Urda, \\"War Footage Not Charlie Wilson's: 'Scud Stud'\\", Law360, April 28, 2008 On September 19, 2008, Kent announced he had reached a settlement with whose terms he was \\"very pleased;\\" the terms of the settlement remain confidential. In 2019, he released a 13 minute film titled Black Night In June which consists of restored footage from his coverage of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, in honour of its thirtieth anniversary.  Political campaign and defamation lawsuit  In November 2007, Kent was chosen by local party members as the Progressive Conservative candidate for the Alberta provincial riding of Calgary Currie. During the 2008 election, newspapers including the National Post and Calgary Herald published an article written by Don Martin about Kent and his campaign that was ruled defamatory by Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench in a June, 2016 trial judgment. Canada's largest newspaper chain, Postmedia Network Inc., was found liable for defamation after Postmedia published the Martin article on its websites until November 2012. Kent won $200,000 in damages. On January 16, 2017, the trial judge awarded Kent costs of $250,000. Kent appealed the decision, asking Alberta's Court of Appeal to find the defendants' \\"intentional strategic decision to conceal\\" key email records was, in fact, fraudulent concealment. In a decision on May 25, 2018, the Court of Appeal agreed with Kent, awarding him an additional $200,000 in costs, and ruling: \\"we respectfully disagree with the trial judge's conclusion that the appellant's allegations of fraudulent concealment and the giving of false evidence were unproven. It follows that the trial judge erred in penalizing the appellant for having made these allegations.\\" Neither Postmedia nor Martin have acknowledged or expressed contrition for the offences found by the courts. Postmedia's financial predicament, combined with the resignation of director David Pecker, who was granted immunity by U.S. federal prosecutors investigating President Trump's former personal attorney, prompted Canada's National Observer to comment that \\"ethical journalism may not be a priority to (Postmedia's) owners, as revealed in Arthur Kent's defamation lawsuit against the company.\\" Kent lost the March 3, 2008 election to incumbent Dave Taylor.

It is sometimes considered conspecific with the brown teal. The plumage is similar to that of the Auckland teal, dark sepia with the head and back tinged with green iridescence, and a chestnut breast on the male, with the female dark brown all over. Its natural habitat is tussock grassland dominated by Poa tussock grass, ferns and megaherbs. The species also uses the burrows and pathways of petrel species that nest on the islands. They are apparently territorial in the wild, and probably feed on amphipods and insects.  Conservation  left The Campbell teal was once found on Campbell Island, but was driven to extinction there by the introduction of Norway Rats (which ate their eggs and chicks), and was for a while presumed extinct. In 1975 it was rediscovered on Dent Island, a small (23 hectare) islet near Campbell that had remained rat-free. The population was so small that a single event could have driven it to complete extinction; to prevent this from happening, 11 individuals were taken into captivity by the Department of Conservation for captive breeding at the Mt Bruce Wildlife Centre in 1984 while the rest followed in 1990. They were also put on the list of critically endangered species in 1979. Captive breeding was initially very difficult to achieve, as no studies on the behaviour of the species had been carried out in the wild and \\"staff [at Mount Bruce] thus had to experiment with a range of techniques to encourage breeding. Success came in 1994 when Daisy, the only wild origin female to ever lay eggs in captivity, finally accepted a mate. Subsequently, breeding has occurred every year ‚Äì wild origin males contributed genes by pairing with captive raised females.\\"\\"Forest and bird\\", No319, February 2006; \\"Snow ducks of the Antarctic\\" by Helen Gummer\\" A tiny population of 25 captive-bred individuals was released on Codfish Island in 1999 and 2000, already intensively managed and pest-free as an important habitat for the critically endangered kakapo. In the final phase of the ecological restoration of Campbell Island (cattle, sheep and cats had already been removed), the world's largest rat eradication campaign was undertaken by helicopter drops of more than 120 tonnes of poisoned bait over the entirety of the island's 11,331 hectare area in 2001; this operation successfully removed what was estimated to be the world's densest population of Norway rats (200,000) from Campbell Island and it was officially declared rat free in 2003. Fifty Campbell teal, a mix of captive-bred and wild-acclimatised animals (from Codfish), were reintroduced to Campbell Island in mid-2004, after an absence of more than a century. Subsequent monitoring in 2005 has shown that the majority of these birds are now thriving in their ancestral homeland. By 2011 the species has firmly been returned to Campbell Island, resulting in a reclassification of its threat status to Endangered.

It is part of the militant wing of the disability rights movement, due to its use of nonviolent direct action in order to bring attention and awareness to the lack of civil rights the disability community has. ADAPT strategies include using civil disobedience if necessary as a tool to gain public attention, so that they can change laws, policies, and services affecting persons with disabilities. ADAPT also now practices legislative policy advocacy, grassroots education and mobilization, and individual members may engage in legal advocacy, as in the case of individual ADAPT members suing the Chicago Transit Authority in the 1980s. History The Atlantis Community was started in Denver, Colorado, in 1975, when Reverend Wade Blank, a non-disabled former nursing home recreational director, assisted several severely disabled nursing home residents to move out and start their own community. In 1978 protests were held in Denver by members of the Atlantis Community, and Blank, against the wheelchair inaccessibility of public buses in that city. These protests included the nation‚Äôs first demonstration for wheelchair-accessible public buses, which was on July 5 and 6. At that protest nineteen members of the Atlantis Community (called the Gang of Nineteen) chanted \\"We will ride\\" and blocked buses with their wheelchairs, staying in the streets throughout the night. In 1983, the Gang of Nineteen started ADAPT after several years of similar local bus protests. Originally, ADAPT's name was an acronym that stood for Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit, since the group's initial issue was to get wheelchair-accessible lifts on buses. Throughout the 1980s, the campaign for bus lifts expanded out from Denver to cities nationwide. ADAPTers became well known for their tactic of immobilizing buses to draw attention to the need for lifts. Wheelchair users would stop a bus in front and back, and others would get out of their chairs and crawl up the steps of an inaccessible bus to dramatize the issue. Not only city buses but interstate bus services like Greyhound were targeted. By the end of the decade, after protests and lawsuits, ADAPT finally saw bus lifts required by law as part of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. At that time, the group began looking for the next logical step in disability rights advocacy, while ensuring follow-through of transportation provisions in the ADA. That year the group changed its name to Americans Disabled Attendant Programs Today. In 1992 the protest from July 5 and 6, 1978 was commemorated with a plaque at the intersection of Colfax and Broadway (which is where the protest was held); the plaque stated: ‚Äú\\"WE WILL RIDE\\" The Gang of Nineteen * Linda Chism-Andre * Renate Rabe-Conrad * Willy Cornelison * Mary Ann Sisneros * Carolyn Finnell * George Roberts * Mel Conrardy * Bobby Simpson * Debbie Tracy * Jeannie Joyce * Kerry Schott * Jim Lundvall * Lori Heezen * Glenn Kopp * Bob Conrad * Larry Ruiz * Cindy Dunn * Paul Brady * Terri Fowler Placed by the City and County of Denver, July 26, 1992.\\" However, this plaque was replaced in 2005 to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The current plaque, also placed at the intersection of Colfax and Broadway, reads: \\"This bus stop is dedicated by the Regional Transportation District (RTD) in the memory of Reverend Wade Blank. Reverend Blank and 19 other members of a disability advocacy group blocked a RTD East Colfax Local bus on July 5 and 6, 1978. The RTD Board of Directors subsequently voted to begin purchasing wheelchair-accessible buses, and by 1985 Denver had become the first major metropolitan area in the United States to provide wheelchair- accessible service on all Local buses. This site was re-dedicated in 2005 to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\\" On September 17, 2003, the Free Our People March (involving ADAPT members) ended, with marchers arriving in the nation's capitol from Pennsylvania, to advocate for MiCASSA (see below), full implementation of the Supreme Court's Olmstead v. L.C. decision, Money Follows the Person legislation, and Medicaid reform other than block grants. The marchers traveled about eight to twelve miles per day. In May 2017 ADAPT organized a protest in Washington, D.C. against changes to Medicaid as part of Representative Paul Ryan's budget proposal that would have cut Medicaid funding and given more control of the program to the states. Around 100 disability protesters were arrested in D.C., and similar protests were led by local ADAPT groups all around the country. Throughout these protests, ADAPT used their Twitter and Facebook feeds to share photos and links to the media to cover the event, which included images of protesters being arrested, to gain and mobilize support from the broader community. Internet presence ADAPT's website provides information on its issues and actions. The site also archives photos and reports from past national actions. Most of the pictures posted are by the photographer Tom Olin, who has taken ADAPT photos for over two decades. ADAPT‚Äôs most well known visual logo, shown on their website, depicts the international wheelchair symbol, but with the person holding their arms aloft to break the chains that bind them. ADAPT also has a YouTube account which features short videos directly posted by ADAPT activists, documenting their support of the organization. ADAPT has a social media presence in the form of a Twitter and Facebook feed, both with over 1600 followers. This helps them connect to their followers and other activists, and to increase their public visibility. MiCASSA/Community Choice Act ADAPT developed MiCASSA, which stands for Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act, which is intended to help people with disabilities on Medicaid choose whether to spend their support services money on nursing homes or on personal care attendants. According to ADAPT, community supports are far cheaper than nursing homes. MiCASSA is now known as the Community Choice Act.  See also  *Disability rights movement *J.

Constantine Manasses (; c. 1130 - c. 1187) was a Byzantine chronicler who flourished in the 12th century during the reign of Manuel I Komnenos (1143-1180). He was the author of a chronicle or historical synopsis of events from the creation of the world to the end of the reign of Nikephoros Botaneiates (1081), sponsored by Irene Komnene, the emperor's sister-in-law. It consists of about 7000 lines in political verse. It obtained great popularity and appeared in a free prose translation; it was also translated into Bulgarian in the 14th century. Chronicle edition: Bekker, Bonn 1837; the Bulgarian translation, Cronica lui Constantin Manasses, by Ioan Bogdan and I. Bianu, Bucharest, 1922. In 1969 Bulgaria issued two sets of stamps depicting important scenes of the chronicle, to celebrate it. Manasses also wrote the poetical romance Loves of Aristander and Callithea, also in political verse. It is only known from the fragments preserved in the rose- garden of Macarius Chrysocephalus (14th century). Manasses also wrote a short biography of Oppian, and some descriptive pieces (all except one unpublished) on artistic and other subjects.

Personal life Born in Thale, Germany, Becker trained as a teacher. At eighteen he began a relationship with the Director of the State Archive in W√ºrzburg, Joseph Friedrich Abert, an older man. The relationship lasted ten years. Through this contact he met an array of influential and artistic people. He was an actor and production designer. Later in life he devoted himself completely to photography. While living in Freiburg and Vienna, he showed his first exhibitions and earned his first commissions. He supplemented his income by providing photographs for newspapers and magazines. W√ºrzburg W√ºrzburg is a small town in the southern state of Bavaria. Living in W√ºrzburg in the 1930s was a Jewish wine merchant by the name of Dr Leopold Obermayer, who apparently complained to the local police department that his mail was being opened. The complaint was investigated by the Gestapo, who took the liberty to search Obermayer's home and discovered a number of photographs of young men in his safe. One of these photographs was of Albrecht Becker. Becker was brought in for questioning in 1935 on suspicion of violating Paragraph 175. Becker reportedly declared: \\"Everybody knows I'm a homosexual.\\" Both Obermayer and Becker were put on trial. Becker was sentenced to three years in prison at N√ºrnberg. Obermayer was also convicted of violating Paragraph 175, but as a Jew was sent to Dachau concentration camp. He was tortured there and sent to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, where he died. Towards the end of the war as the need to replace losses increased Becker was released in order to serve in the Wehrmacht. He served on the Russian front until 1944. Becker spoke of his experiences during the war in the 2000 documentary Paragraph 175. Last years During the 1970s, Becker's photography encompassed an eclectic range of subjects including ushers at the Vienna Opera, monks in an Augustinian monastery, Berlin gravediggers, and the ruins of K√ºstrin. At the center of his work was the human body. He would photograph it either as a whole or part. Death Becker died in Hamburg, Germany in 2002, aged 95.

Due to financial issues, the station ceased operations and went off the air on May 23, 1990. Flinn Broadcasting Corporation purchased the station's license three years later and returned channel 49 to the air on May 25, 1994, carrying programming from the Home Shopping Network. The station changed its call letters to WPXL-TV on August 31, 1998; that same day, the station became a charter affiliate of the family- oriented network Pax TV (now Ion Television).

This Is Your Brain on Drugs was a large-scale US anti- narcotics campaign by Partnership for a Drug-Free America (PDFA) launched in 1987, that used three televised public service announcements (PSAs) and a related poster campaign. 1987 version The 30-second version of the first PSA, from 1987, shows a man (played by John Roselius) in a starkly furnished apartment who asks if there is anyone out there who still does not understand the dangers of drug abuse. He holds up an egg and says, \\"This is your brain,\\" before motioning to a frying pan and adding, \\"This is drugs.\\" He then cracks open the egg, fries the contents, and says, \\"This is your brain on drugs.\\" Finally, he looks up at the camera and asks, \\"Any questions?\\" In contrast, the 10-second and 15-second versions simply show a close-up of an egg dropping into a frying pan. This is accompanied by a voice-over saying in the 15-second version: \\"Okay, last time. This is drugs. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?\\" The 10-second version omits the first sentence. The PSA, titled \\"Frying Pan\\" (a.k.a. \\"Fried Egg\\" and \\"Any Questions?\\"), was conceived by art directors Scot Fletcher and Rick Bell, copywriter Larre Johnson and creative director Paul Keye at Los Angeles-based agency keye/donna/pearlstein. It was directed by Joe Pytka through his own Venice-based production company Pytka Productions and produced by agency producer Harvey Greenberg, Pytka executive producer Jane McCann and Pytka producer John Turney. Anthony Marinelli scored the shorter versions. 1997 version The second PSA, from 1997, featured 18-year-old actress Rachael Leigh Cook, who, as before, holds up an egg and says, \\"this is your brain,\\" before lifting up a frying pan with the words, \\"this is heroin\\", after which she places the egg on a kitchen counter‚Äî\\"this is what happens to your brain after snorting heroin\\"‚Äîand slams the pan down on it. She lifts the pan back up, saying, \\"and this is what your body goes through\\", in reference to the remnants of the smashed egg now dripping from the bottom of the pan and down her arm. Cook then says, \\"It's not over yet\\", and proceeds to smash everything in the kitchen with the frying pan in a rage, yelling \\"And this is what your family goes through! And your friends! And your money! And your job! And your self-respect! And your future!\\" She ends with \\"And your life.\\" Cook finally drops the pan on the counter of the now-wrecked kitchen, and, back to her calmer self, says, \\"Any questions?\\" This PSA, likewise titled \\"Frying Pan\\", was conceived by art director Doug Hill, copywriter Ken Cills and creative director Graham Turner at New York-based agency Margeotes/Fertitta & Partners. It was directed by Eden Tyler through New York-based production company Zooma Zooma, produced by agency producer Ed Kleban and Zooma Zooma producer Joseph Mantegna and edited by Jay Nelson at Santa Monica-based Avenue Edit. 2016 version The third PSA, from 2016, is a loose remake which shows an egg in a human hand, stating \\"This is your brain\\", alongside a frying pan that the other hand is pointing to, stating \\"This is drugs\\", and the egg is cracked and gets fried onto the pan, stating \\"This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?\\". This follows it with scenes of teens, with various ones saying \\"Um, yeah, I have questions\\", \\"Prescription drugs aren't as bad as street drugs, right?\\", \\"Weed's legal, isn't it?\\", \\"Drinking is worse than smoking weed. Isn't it?\\", \\"Why is heroin so addictive?\\", \\"Molly just makes you feel happy\\", \\"I have questions\\", \\"Mom, Dad, did you ever try drugs?\\" The narrator returns to say, \\"They're going to ask. Be ready.\\" 2017 War on Drugs Critique version In 2017, Rachael Leigh Cook used imagery from the This is Your Brain on Drugs commercials in a PSA by the Drug Policy Alliance. The PSA critiqued the War on Drugs and its contribution to mass incarceration, structural racism and poverty. The ad was posted to YouTube on April 20, 2017 in recognition of 4/20. 2018 Brain on Cannabis version In 2018, professional chef Todd Sugimoto was cast to mimic the original motions and lines from the first PSA, from 1987. The concept was meant to help raise awareness on the changing laws and perception of legal cannabis. Filmed in a posh and modern apartment, the chef asks if there is anyone out there who still isn't clear on the effects of cannabis on the brain. He holds up an egg and says, \\"This is your brain,\\" before motioning to a frying pan and adding, \\"This is cannabis.\\" He then cracks open the egg, then a montage of skillful chopping and advanced chef techniques are shown prior to a revealing of a gourmet egg dish, as he says, \\"This is your brain on cannabis.\\" Finally he looks up at the camera and asks, \\"Any questions?\\" This version of the PSA, titled \\"Brain on Cannabis\\", was conceived by creative director Dustin Iannotti, at Las Vegas-based agency Artisans on Fire. It was edited by agency-editor Zach Honea. Impact TV Guide named the commercial one of the top one hundred television advertisements of all time, and Entertainment Weekly named it the 8th best commercial of all time. The American Egg Board had an issue with the PSA because they didn't want their product associated with the unhealthiness of drug use. They worried that young children might misinterpret the TV message and think that eggs were harmful. A poster produced in the early 1990s called \\"Famous Brains on Drugs\\" parodied the concept by having eggs appear in the frying pan in forms intended to remind the viewer of certain people. For instance, a pan labeled \\"Saddam Hussein\\" had an egg with a crosshair over it, and a pan labeled \\"Milli Vanilli\\" contained a box of imitation eggs. There have also been parody T-shirts, such as versions based on The Simpsons (\\"This is your brain on donuts\\", showing an X-ray of Homer Simpson's head) and the Yankees‚ÄìRed Sox rivalry (shirts targeted to both allegiances of the famed rivalry), among others. Saturday Night Live parodied the PSA in its \\"This is your brain on drugs, with a side of bacon\\" skit. In an episode of the sitcom Roseanne, the title character reenacts the PSA while having a conversation with one of her children about drugs. An episode of the teen series Beverly Hills, 90210 ends with the characters Brandon and Brenda Walsh acting out the PSA with their friends in their favorite diner. After the show, the actual 30-second commercial aired, and Jason Priestley delivered his own anti-drug message on the air. In the eighteenth episode of the second season of the sitcom Married... with Children, \\"What Goes Around Comes Around\\" (1990), the character Al Bundy takes an egg, says \\"This is your brain,\\" then says \\"This is your brain on marriage,\\" drops it on the ground, and asks, \\"Any questions?\\" The 1991 film sequel Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare spoofed the PSA by having Johnny Depp (whose acting career began with the original A Nightmare on Elm Street movie) perform the skit. The PSA goes on as normal until Robert Englund (who plays Freddy Krueger) hits Depp with the frying pan and says, \\"Yeah! What are you on? Looks like a frying pan and some eggs to me.\\" Bill Hicks spoke negatively about the commercial frequently during his stand-up routine, claiming \\"I've seen a lot of weird shit on drugs, I've never ever ever ever ever looked at an egg and thought it was a fucking brain.\\" PBS Kids did a parody of the famous PSA as well, in a short titled \\"This is your brain on books\\", in which a gold egg falls on a frying pan with books on it, then falls into a human brain, in which he thinks about composing, computing, and creating, ending it all with \\"Any questions?\\". In the film Batman Forever (1995), the character the Riddler parodies the commercial saying, \\"This is your brain on the box. This is my brain on the box. Does anybody else feel like a fried egg?!\\" It is also spoofed in Scary Movie 2 (2001) in which rapper Beetlejuice appears in Shorty's skull, representing his brain on drugs. The second version was satirized in the first ever episode of the animated television sketch show Robot Chicken, \\"Junk in the Trunk\\" (2005). Rachael Leigh Cook (who provided the voice acting) goes on a psychopathic rampage, destroying everything she encounters, ending eventually with her smashing herself in the head and falling down a building. The title of the popular science book This Is Your Brain On Music: The Science of a Human Obsession (2006) by Daniel Levitin is a nod to the PSA. In the tenth episode of the second season of the TV series Breaking Bad, \\"Over\\" (2009), the character Jesse Pinkman, references the commercial, frying one egg and saying, \\"this is your brain\\" then adding another egg and saying \\"this is your brain on drugs.\\" In 2012, two PSAs based on the PDFA campaign were released by Tea Party activist Herman Cain. The violent death of a goldfish and a rabbit were supposed to represent what President Obama's stimulus plan did to the American economy. Rob DenBlyker, one of the creators of the webcomic Cyanide and Happiness, parodied the commercial in a 2013 installment where a father, after re-enacting the commercial, admits to his son that he himself is on drugs. \\"But I don't see how that's relevant,\\" he adds. The sixteenth episode of the ABC sitcom The Goldbergs, \\"Muscles Mirsky\\", referenced the PSA when Beverly was making breakfast. A recent CBS Cares PSA parodied this in talking about sunburn, which showed raw bacon that accompanied a voice saying \\"This is your skin\\", and a slice of it was then placed in a frying pan, cooking it, stating \\"This is your skin in the sun\\", and then follows it by a shot of a sun in which the voice says \\"Any questions?\\", accompanied by the phrase \\"Save your bacon. Use sunscreen.\\" superimposed over the sun. Whilst promoting the 2016 superhero film Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds did his take on the PSA in character. First he says \\"Hi. Deadpool here, with a very important announcement.\\" He holds up a chimichinga saying \\"This is your brain. Actually, it's a chimichinga. But, I'm making a point, because...\\" And points to a giant chimichinga on the table saying \\"This... is your brain on IMAX. Bigger is better, right?\\" Followed by clips from the film. When children's television series SpongeBob SquarePants aired on MTV in 2008, a promo was made to play before the show began that parodied this ad. A promo for the upcoming CBS series Limitless also parodied the script of the PSA, featuring the script \\"This is Brian. This is Brian on NZT. Any questions?\\". English virtual band Gorillaz used the PSA in the music video for their single \\"Sleeping Powder\\". The Late Late Show With James Corden parodied the PSA by having Corden begin to shoot a remake of the original, then engineer a series of outtakes and eat the eggs. To promote season 2 of Riverdale on Netflix, Camila Mendes, who plays Veronica Lodge, re-stages the 1997 version PSA, which featured actor Rachael Leigh Cook. It's shot-for-shot, except instead of egg, she uses a burger, and instead of talking about heroin, she talks about Jingle Jangle. The teaser \\"No Drug Like Me\\" music video by Carly Rae Jepsen re-stages the 1997 version PSA, which featured actor Rachael Leigh Cook. It's shot-for-shot and instead of talking about heroin, she talks about her song. Michael Seyer features audio from the video in his song.

It was the first in a series of games released in home console and personal computer formats. The game was heavily influenced by American slasher films and the works of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, and is a homage to the violent horror films of the 1980s. Marketing for the game heavily emphasized its violent nature; for example, the TurboGrafx-16 port of Splatterhouse had a faux parental advisory warning printed on the front of the box that read, \\"The horrifying theme of this game may be inappropriate for young children... and cowards.\\" Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. Splatterhouse is an arcade- style sidescrolling beat 'em up with platform elements, in which the player controls Rick, a parapsychology student who is trapped inside West Mansion. After his resurrection by the Terror Mask, Rick makes his way through the mansion, fighting off hordes of creatures in a vain attempt to save his girlfriend Jennifer from a grisly fate. Players of this game will also recognize a number of western horror film influences, such as Friday the 13th and Evil Dead II. Similar to many sidescrolling beat 'em up games, Rick can only move in a two-dimensional environment. He has the ability to jump and can punch and kick. Rick also has a Special Attack, where he will perform a dropkick that sends him skidding along the ground, damaging any enemies he hits. Rick can also perform a low kick, low punch, and jumping attacks, as well as pick up and use various weapons placed in the levels. All of the levels consist of walking left to right, with occasional auto-scrolling segments. However, alternative pathways through sections of the house are possible by falling down through holes or jumping up onto ladders. In this way, branching gameplay is possible, if only prevalent in the middle levels. Levels culminate in boss fights that take place in a single room. Unlike traditional sidescrolling fighters, boss fights have varying objectives and styles. Unlike most arcade games in the genre, Splatterhouse sends players back to checkpoints after losing lives or receiving a game over, discouraging \\"credit feeding\\" as a method of overcoming the various challenges. Plot Two students at the local university, Rick Taylor and Jennifer Willis, take refuge from a storm in West Mansion, a local landmark known as \\"Splatterhouse\\", for the rumors of hideous experiments purportedly conducted there by Dr. West, a renowned and missing parapsychologist. As they enter the mansion and the door shuts behind them, Jennifer screams. Rick awakens in a dungeon under the mansion having been resurrected thanks to the influence of the \\"Terror Mask\\", or in some versions, the \\"Hell Mask\\", a Mayan sacrificial artifact from West's house which is capable of sentient thought. The mask attaches itself to Rick, fusing with his body and transforming him into a monster with superhuman strength. With the mask's encouragement, Rick goes on a rampage through the dungeon and the mansion grounds, killing hordes of monsters. Inside the mansion, Rick finds Jennifer, prone on a couch and surrounded by a throng of creatures that retreat upon his arrival. After their departure, Jennifer transforms into a slightly taller, fanged monster that attempts to kill Rick while begging him for help. Rick is forced to kill Jennifer, who transforms back to normal and thanks him before she dies. Infuriated, Rick tracks the remaining monsters to a giant, bloody hole in the mansion's floor. Upon entering it, Rick discovers that the mansion itself is alive. He follows a bloody hallway to the house's \\"womb\\", which produces fetus-like monsters that attack him. Rick destroys the womb, which causes the house to burst into flames as it \\"dies\\". Escaping the burning mansion, Rick comes across a grave marker. The Terror Mask releases energy into the grave, reviving a giant monster named \\"Hell Chaos\\" that claws its way up from the earth and attempts to kill Rick. Rick destroys the creature, which unleashes a tormented ghost that dissipates into a series of bright lights. As the lights vanish, the mask shatters, turning Rick back to normal, and he flees as the house burns to the ground and the credits roll. However, after he leaves and the credits end, the Terror Mask reassembles itself and laughs evilly for several seconds as the word \\"END\\" appears in the bottom right corner of the screen. Ports Rick wields a 2√ó4 as a weapon in a basement with monsters chained to the walls (PC Engine) Home versions of Splatterhouse were released on the TurboGrafx-16, FM Towns and PC. In addition to loss of graphical detail and removal of some sounds (standard for a port to less powerful hardware), the following edits were made to both the Japanese PC-Engine and North American TurboGrafx-16 versions of the game: * The arcade version opens with an animation of Rick and Jennifer running through the storm and into the mansion, followed by an exterior shot of the mansion and the sound of Jennifer screaming. The console version opens simply with the exterior of the mansion, and no sound effects. * The weapon in Stage 1 and Stage 2 is changed from a meat cleaver to a wooden stick. * The overall violence and gore is toned down; enemies bleed less and the sound effects are less gruesome. * The weapon for the Stage 4 boss is changed from an axe to a golden meat cleaver, the only cleaver in the game. * The crawling hand in Stage 5 no longer flashes the middle finger. * The death of the womb boss of Stage 6 is changed from a graphic spilling of embryonic fluids into a generic fiery explosion. * The final boss uses different attacks. * The end cut scene is changed from the original arcade ending, in which the mask breaks from Rick's face, followed by a shot of him walking away from the burning mansion and an additional cut scene showing the mask reform and laugh. The ending in the TurboGrafx-16 version only shows the mask explode, followed by a picture of West Mansion burning while the credits roll, and finally a large red and orange \\"End\\" is displayed. The following edits are exclusive to the North American TurboGrafx-16 version: * The Terror Mask is changed from a white hockey mask to a red mask with black accents. This is to keep Rick from looking too much like Jason Voorhees. The mask became more skull-like in later games. * The cathedral arches are removed from the Stage 4 boss chamber background and the altar is removed from the following cut scene. * The inverted cross boss of Stage 4 is replaced with a severed head. * The final boss' grave is changed from a wooden cross to a tombstone. The TG-16 version was released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on March 16, 2007; in North America on March 19, 2007; in Japan on July 3, 2007; and in Australia on July 20, 2007. The arcade version was released on May 26, 2009 on the Japanese Virtual Console. The FM Towns version, ported by Ving Co. and released only in Japan in 1992, is a pixel-perfect rendition of the original arcade, with no substantial changes apart from a new menu interface in the title screen. There was also an LCD handheld version released, titled Splatter House, but it is not a port of either games. It is considered to be an original Splatterhouse game in and of itself, though many elements in it are similar to the original game. In 2010, the game was ported to J2ME/BREW mobile phones, Windows Mobile and iOS platforms to coincide with the release of the remake. The only change was in the Java-based mobile phone version, where Rick's mask is modeled after the skull-like one present in the remake. This change is not present in iOS version of the game, but it includes a \\"Splatter Rush\\" mode instead, where enemies continuously spawn from both ends of a wide screen. The remake also included the uncensored Japanese arcade version as an unlockable extra. It was also included as a part of the Namco Museum compilation for the Nintendo Switch, through the Nintendo eShop. The title is also playable on the Turbografx-16/PC Engine Mini Console. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Splatterhouse on their December 15, 1988 issue as being the sixth most- successful table arcade unit of the year. Following its European release at the ATEI show in January 1989, Computer and Video Games gave the arcade version a positive review. =Wii Virtual Console release= IGN's Lucas M. Thomas said of Splatterhouse that \\"Putting aside the aesthetic design and just looking at the game on the merits of its mechanics, Splatterhouse is lacking.\\" He complained about the limited variety of attacks, one way scrolling, and censorship present in the North American console version. Thomas did, however, compliment the game's horror themes and music, noting that the console graphics, despite being \\"toned down\\", are a \\"good representation of the arcade original\\". Frank Provo of GameSpot had similar complaints: \\"Ultimately, the problem with Splatterhouse is that there's not much to it. There are only seven levels, and you'll finish each one in just a few minutes,\\" he wrote, going on to explain that the enemies all follow easily memorized patterns, making the game very simple to play. In particular, Provo criticized the fact that the Virtual Console version was the censored console version, noting how he missed the meat cleavers and extra violence of the arcade game, ultimately giving it a negative review.

Hence today Ukulhas is exemplary island on dealing with mega environmental issues which results Ukulhas is marked as environmentally role model Island in its archipelago.Wooden sign boards Today ukulhas islanders do not require going out for dump their garbage; Island council manages island wastes in a systematic manner. For outside trash management, dustbins are kept in an adequate distance everywhere in the island. People in the island may not require throw their litters such as cans, bottle, papers etc. Therefore, the island and its beaches are kept clean and tidy. In ukulhas, households manage their wastes by segregation, such as recyclable items (e.g.; aluminum, copper, steel, plastics, papers etc.), organic items (e.g.; food items), and plant materials (e.g.; leaves, stems etc.). After the segregation the wastes are kept in the houses. Except Friday, each day council pick-up visits houses to collect segregated wastes for disposing and managing; Fees are collected by the council for the waste management. Collected house hold wastes are segregated by the ‚ÄòWaste Management Centre‚Äô into organic items, Recyclable items and Plant materials. After the segregation wastes are disposed. Since landfill method is very common in Maldives, Ukulhas is one of the first islands where landfill method is not practiced. Three major methods are used in ukulhas for the disposal; such as recycling, pyrolysis and Composting. Aluminium items such as beverage cans, copper such as wires, steel and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, polyethylene and PET bottles, Glass bottles and jars etc. are separated. Recyclable items are sold once or twice a month. For the pyrolysis, plant items, wooden materials, card boards, magazines, light paper, etc. are placed on a decomposition chamber which is burned into charcoal and ash. For the composting, organic matters are decomposed and recycled as a fertilizer. It is a key ingredient for organic farming. For decompose organic matters such as leaves, ‚Äògreen‚Äô food wastes are wetted make a heap and keep those heaps for a week or months to break down into humus. After the breaking down into humus, composed fertilizers are packed and labelled for the sale.http://www.miadhu.com/2012/03/local- news/memp-travels-to-ukulhas-island-to-test-waste-management- equipment/http://www.housing.gov.mv/v1/news/memp-travels-to-ukulhas-island-to- test-waste-management-equipment/http://www.aftfoundation.org/contribution-to- alifu-alifu-ukulhas-waste-management- centre/http://terrepolicycentre.com/pdf/movie-booklet- page.pdfhttp://www.ukulhas.com Education = Ukulhas School = ;GCE Advance Level Education in Ukulhas Island ‚ÄòUkulhahu School‚Äô established in the island of Ukulhas is recognized and notified as the first ever A-Level institution in the North Ari Atoll in the history of its archipelago. The A Level studies program (A Level campaign) was started and initiated with an immense effort led by the people of Ukulhas Island. After the inauguration of the A-Level program, Ukulhas community composed an organizing and managing committee for the A-Level program in the name of ‚ÄúA Level Committee‚Äù. When the A-level committee emerged from the first day itself they started its functions, trying to cross all the steps towards its establishment and sustainability. With enormous and tremendous efforts led together by the A Level Committee and the citizens of ukulhas the A-Level program has reaped immense success as the first A- level batch of the institution achieved the national top ten awards.[1] For the continuity and sustainability of the ‚ÄòUkulhas A Level program‚Äô from the beginning, the citizens of ukulhas have been filling their commitment volunteering and providing free aid for all the students at all means if it is in relation with their academic progress. Qualified students from other islands are highly invited to join the program with Ukulhas Community providing everything required for the whole A Level program including travel costs, accommodation, clothing, uniform, pocket money, books, stationeries etc. Ukulhas community spends more than 1.5 million rufiyaa each year for the program. It‚Äôs a huge and a fantastic opportunity to join the ‚ÄòUkulhas School‚Äô to pursue A-Level studies in a gentle and a friendly environment. Ukulhas School Healthcare  Based on historical findings, there were no provisions of formal health services in Ukulhas before 1982. Before 1982 people in Ukulhas used to obtain health services from traditional medical practitioners. Traditional medical practitioners used to treat patients by using herbal medicine, which referred to as plant‚Äôs seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark, flowers etc . Formal health services were first established in Ukulhas at the island‚Äôs administrative office on 7 June 1982 by establishing an independent section with a local Family Health worker. The family Health worker was a person who only qualified for the provision of limited, basic health services, such as local consultations, counseling, distribution of birth control drugs, dressing a wound, distribution of other symptomatic medicines etc. It was Family Health worker‚Äôs duty to visit local residences in a periodic manner to monitor the health standards of Islanders and to maintain records which have to be sent to the Concern central government Authorities. After several years of limited health services provided by a local Family Health worker, people of Ukulhas found an independent Health institution in the name of Health Post on 14 August 2004, with more facilities and equipment available than the ‚ÄòFamily Health Section‚Äô. Health post provided two trained traditional birth attendants with Family Health workers. On 1 June 2007, the day started with a new chapter by establishing a Health Center after many years of limited Health services with a professional Medical Officer (Medical Doctor), Staff Nurses and Administrative staffs. Health Center is equipped with modern sophisticated equipment including, ECG machine, Nebulization facilities, IV injections etc. The Centre also designed with consultation rooms, admission wards, and other required facilities. The Health Centre started its operation with a Pharmacy and an ambulance which operates for urgent and exceptional matters. Health Centre is operating with a qualified doctor who is assisted by nurses and is always on standby for urgent matters after his scheduled duty every day. The Centre is open for its services for Accidents and emergency care for 24 hours a day. Sport and leisure =Gymnasium and fitness training = 'Body Work' in Ukulhas is the first ever established body building and fitness training institution in North Ari Atoll. Sophisticated equipment available such as, bench press machine, chest fly machine, shoulder press machine, let pull down machine, biceps curl machine, leg extension machine etc. The gym is organized and run by the oldest Association in the island known as Glorious Sports Club (GSC). =Kudakudhinge Ufa (Children's park)= This magnificent park, Kudakudhinge Ufa stands proudly as a testament to the community's commitment to the well-being of the children. Children enjoy playgrounds and entertaining feature such as plastic toys, outdoor fitness equipment, leisure chairs, bungee trampoline and other suitable equipment. The park is designed for all ages of children, with adult supervision. The entire park is surrounded by security fencing with gates at main entry. Part of the playing area is a grassy lawn area with benches and shaded structures. Benches are placed as outdoor seating which have been provided by the landscape and slip resistant paving goes along with the theme of the design which starts from the entry. In front the main entrance, a beautiful fish pond is seen with various pond fishes such as cat fish, Algae eater, Fathead minnow, Gold Fish, Koi carp, Sturgeon etc. Precisely this park should be an example of why 'Ukulhas' is such a great place to work and live.  Culture  Boduberu is one of the most popular forms of traditional music and dance founds in Ukulhas even in the Maldives too. Boduberu is performed by about 15 people, including four drummers with background and a lead singer. Bodu beru is played with a set of drums and an Onugan‚Äôdu. 'Rahgudaa' (cultural music called 'Boduberu' band of Ukulhas) Onudgadu is a small piece of bamboo which lays horizontal grooves, from which raspy sounds are produced by scraping. The songs may be of heroism, romance or satire. The prelude to the song is a slow with emphasis on drumming, and dancing. As the song reaches a crescendo, one or two dancers maintain the wild beat with their frantic movements ending in some cases in a terrace. The costume of the performers is a sarong and white sleeved shirt. Religion = Kudamiski'y = 'Kudamikiy' The oldest mosque in Ukulhas The oldest mosque in Ukulhas Island The oldest mosque in Ukulhas. The oldest structure in the Ukulhas is 'Maamiskiy' or Kuda Miskiy (Old Friday Mosque), which is also known as oldest monument, built in 1656, during the reign of Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar. The coral-stone structures walls are intricately carved with patterns.

Lieutenant-Colonel Henry William Edmund Petty- Fitzmaurice, 6th Marquess of Lansdowne, DSO, MVO (14 January 1872 - 5 March 1936), styled Earl of Kerry until 1927, was a British soldier and politician. Background Lansdowne was the son of Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, and his wife, Maud, daughter of James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn and Lady Louisa Jane Russell. Military career Lord Kerry was originally commissioned into a volunteer battalion of the Oxfordshire Light Infantry, but transferred to the regular army as a second lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards on 14 August 1895, and was promoted to lieutenant on 2 March 1898.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1901 He served in South Africa during the Second Boer War, where he was from 25 January 1900 an extra aide-de camp to Lord Roberts, the commander in chief of British Forces in South Africa. For his service in the war, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). On the formation of the Irish Guards in 1900, he transferred to that regiment while still in South Africa, and was promoted captain on 6 October 1900. He resigned in 1906 with the rank of major. He returned to the Army during the First World War, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Political career Lansdowne was Liberal Unionist and later Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for West Derbyshire from 1908-18\\\\. He was a member of the Senate of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1929, to which he was nominated by the executive council. He succeeded his father as Marquess of Lansdowne in 1927, with a seat in the British House of Lords, meaning that he had the unusual distinction of serving in the national legislatures of two different countries at the same time.

Ukraintsev started his career in civil service in 1660 as a podyachy (; hypodiakonos from Greek means \\"assistant servant\\") in the Posolsky Prikaz (Diplomacy Department). He served under the supervision of Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin, which whom he would go on a diplomatic mission to Warsaw in 1662-1663. Ukraintsev took part in signing the Treaty of Andrusovo with Poland in 1667. In 1672-1673, he was sent as an envoy to Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands, where Ukraintsev conducted negotiations regarding these countries' participation in military campaigns against Turkey. When Artamon Matveev fell into disgrace in 1676, Ukraintsev unofficially took charge of the Posolsky Prikaz. In 1677, he was sent to Warsaw as a second ambassador. In 1679, Ukraintsev met with Hetman Ivan Samoylovych to negotiate joint military action against the Turks. Ironically, he also participated in Samoylovych's deposition during the Crimean campaigns in 1687. In 1686, Ukraintsev took part in signing the Eternal Peace Treaty with Poland. In 1689, Ukraintsev and Vasily Galitzine (then head of the Posolsky Prikaz) had to flee from the Crimean Tatars. After Galitzine's deposition, Yemelyan Ukraintsev joined his opponents and officially took charge of the Posolsky Prikaz, keeping this post for ensuing ten years. In 1699, he was appointed ambassador to Constantinople, where he would manage to sign a 30-year peace treaty with the Porte on favorable conditions on July 3, 1700 (Treaty of Constantinople). Upon his return from Turkey, Ukraintsev was appointed head of the Proviantsky Prikaz (Provisions Department). He kept this post until 1706, when he was accused of misuse, subjected to corporal punishment, and fined. Another historical account claims that Ukraintsev was also forced to make mantles and 1400 hats for the Preobrazhensky and Semyonovsky regiments. Despite this incident, his diplomatic career continued. In 1707-1708, Ukraintsev was appointed ambassador to Poland together with Prince Vasily Lukich Dolgorukov.

Such coverage can extend to defense costs arising out of criminal and regulatory investigations/trials as well; in fact, often civil and criminal actions are brought against directors/officers simultaneously. Intentional illegal acts, however, are typically not covered under D&O; policies. It has become closely associated with broader management liability insurance, which covers liabilities of the corporation itself as well as the personal liabilities for the directors and officers of the corporation.  Background  The insurance is closely related to corporate governance, corporations law, and the fiduciary duty owed to shareholders or other beneficiaries. Under the United States business judgment rule, the directors and officers are granted broad discretion in their business activities. In the United States, corporate law is typically at the state level; corporations are often domiciled in Delaware (with one estimate at 97% of corporations domiciled in either their home state or DelawareDelaware's Shrinking Half- Life. Stanford Law Review.), due to its developed corporate lawThe History of Delaware's Business Courts. American Bar Association. and tax benefits.Dyreng S, Lindsey BP, Thornock JR. (2011). Exploring the Role Delaware Plays as a Domestic Tax Haven. Publicly traded companies are subject to more federal claims, particularly due to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. = Corporate indemnification = In the United States, the articles of association often includes an indemnification provision holding the officers harmless for losses occurring due to their role in the company. The purchased insurance is typically in addition to this corporate indemnification, or reimburses the corporation. In some states corporations may be mandated to indemnify directors and officers in order to encourage people to take the positions and in most cases the corporations have the option to indemnify their officers. However, in certain cases the corporation may be explicitly forbidden from indemnifying such director or officer. Liabilities which aren't indemnified by the corporation are potentially covered by certain types of D&O; insurance (particularly Side-A Broad Form DIC policies).Liability Issues for Officers and Directors. AllBusiness. = Brief history = The insurance was first marketed in the 1930s by Lloyd's but into the 1960s the volume sold was \\"negligible\\".Gische DM, Werner ME. (2003).

Corporations began to allow for corporate indemnification in the 1940s and 1950s, and the 1960s \\"merger mania\\" was followed by costly litigation.Taffae P. (2009). The ABCs of D&O; Insurance Clauses. PropertyCasualty360.com In the 1980s, the United States experienced a \\"D&O; crisis\\" along with the overall liability crisis, with increased premiums, reduced availability, and numerous additional exclusionary clauses in the insurance policy.Daniels RJ, Hutton S. (1993). The Capricious Cushion: The Implications of the Directors and Insurance Liability Crisis on Canadian Corporate Governance. Canadian Business Law Journal. Due to changes in securities laws in the 1960s, the insurance was sold primarily based on the concerns of directors & officers of \\"personal financial protection\\" (protecting personal rather than corporate assets), but the coverages have evolved so that personal and corporate indemnification are both considered. The 1995 decision of the 9th Circuit in Nordstrom, Inc. v. Chubb & Son, Inc. resulted in the emphasis in \\"Side C\\" (corporate entity) coverage.Gladstone S. (2004). The Future of D&O; Insurance. Risk Management. The decision resolved an \\"allocation problem\\" of how to allocate costs between individual insureds, as the corporation was typically not insured while individuals were. There is no standard D&O; form, but each has shared a similar outline.  Coverages  Under the \\"traditional\\" D&O; policy applied to \\"public companies\\" (those having securities trading under national securities exchanges etc.), there are three (3) insuring clauses. These insuring clauses are termed: Side-A or \\"non-indemnified\\"; Side-B; or \\"indemnified\\"; and Side-C; \\"entity securities coverage\\". D&O; policies may also provide an additional Side-D clause, which provides for a sublimit for investigative costs coverage related to a shareholder derivative demand. In detail, the coverage clauses provide the following:Sprayregen JHM, Friedland JP, Ghasemi M. (2005). Directors & Officers Insurance. Thirty-first Annual Southeastern Bankruptcy Law Institute, Atlanta, Georgia. Authors are affiliated with Kirkland & Ellis LLP. *Side-A provides coverage to individual directors and officers when not indemnified by the corporation as a result of state law or financial incapability of the corporation; however, exclusions may apply if a corporation simply refuses to pay the legal defense/loss of a director or officer, or if a bankruptcy court issues an order preventing such indemnification *Side-B provides coverage for the corporation (organizations) when it indemnifies the directors and officers (corporate reimbursement) *Side-C provides coverage to the corporation (organizations) itself for securities claims brought against it (NOTE: securities claims only coverage applies to publicly traded companies and large private companies; small private companies may be able to obtain broader \\"entity\\" coverage) More extensive coverage can be obtained for individual directors and officers under a Broad Form Side-A DIC (\\"Difference in Conditions\\") policy purchased to not only provide excess Side-A coverage but also to fill the gaps in coverage under the traditional policy, respond when the traditional policy does not, protect the individual directors and officers in the face of U.S. bankruptcy courts deeming the D&O; policy part of the bankruptcy estate and otherwise more fully protect the personal assets of individual directors and officers. = Claims = The types of claims are dependent upon the nature of the company. Directors and officers of a corporation may be liable if they damage the corporation in breach of their legal duty, mix personal and business assets, or fail to disclose conflicts of interest. State law may protect the directors and officers from liability (particularly exculpatory provisions under state law relating to directors). Even innocent errors in judgment by executives may precipitate claims. The types of claims are dependent upon the nature of the corporation. For public companies, claims are primarily due to lawsuits by shareholders after financial difficulties, with a 2011 Towers Watson survey finding that 69% of publicly traded company respondents had a claim for a shareholder lawsuit in the past 10 years as opposed to 21% of private companies respondents.Directors and Officers Liability: 2011 Survey of Insurance Purchasing Trends. Towers Watson. Other claims arise from shareholder-derivative actions, creditors (particularly after entering the zone of insolvency), customers, regulators (including those that would bring civil and criminal charges), and competitors (for anti-trust or unfair trade practice allegations). For nonprofits, claims are typically related to employment practice and less commonly regulatory or other fiduciary claims. For private companies, claims are often from competitors or customers for antitrust or deceptive business practicesD&O; Insurance Overview. Boundas, Skarzynski, Walsh & Black LLC. and one survey of 451 executives found that lawsuits cost an average of $308,475.Why Do Privately-Held Firms Purchase Directors & Officers Liability Insurance . Andreini & Company. Generally citing: William E. Knepper and Ann Bailey, Liability of Corporate Officers and Directors (4th Edition). One relatively neglected area is the personal liability to non-shareholders that directors may face due to torts committed as a result of negligent supervision.Petrin M. (2010). The Curious Case of Directors‚Äô And Officers‚Äô Liability For Supervision and Management: Exploring the Intersection Of Corporate and Tort Law. American University Law Review. = Purchase and application = D&O; insurance is usually purchased by the company itself, even when it is for the sole benefit of directors and officers. Reasons for doing so are many, but commonly would assist a company in attracting and retaining directors. Where a country's legislation prevents the company from purchasing the insurance, a premium split between the directors and the company is often done, so as to demonstrate that the directors have paid a portion of the premium. Problems related to income tax liability may come into play when a corporation avoids country specific liability law in order to protect its individual directors and officers through insurance. If the company fails to disclose material information or willfully provides inaccurate information, the insurer may avoid payment due to misrepresentation. The \\"severability clause\\" in the policy conditions may be intended to protect against this by preventing misconduct by one insured from affecting insurance for other insureds; however, in certain jurisdictions it may be ineffective.Stadermann F, Banis C. (2008). From 'Severability Clause' to 'Innocent Directors Clause' in Dutch D&O; Policies. British Insurance Law Association. = Criminal acts exclusion = Intentional illegal acts or illegal profits are typically not covered under D&O; insurance policies; coverage would only extend to \\"wrongful acts\\" as defined under the policy, which may include certain acts, omissions, misstatements while acting for the organization. Due to exclusions and as a matter of public policy, coverage is not provided for criminal fraud. = Other exclusions = Directors and former directors may sue the company, particularly given their inside knowledge and potentially large stake in the organization. However, most D&O; policies contain an \\"insured versus insured\\" exclusion which may prevent any payment in these circumstances. It is intended to prevent collusion, where an insured company could sue a director and collect the insurance money. However, it is possible to \\"carve out\\" this exclusion so that it does not apply to certain cases, such derivative actions, receivership trustees, and whistleblower actions. Coverage may be \\"rescinded\\" (voided, essentially excluded) in some cases, especially if there is some mistake in the application as to the financial details. Non-rescindable coverage may be purchased in some cases which can prevent this lack of coverage. Also, claims that come about from an issue that was known before the insurance was bought are rejected. If you hide this information, it can make the policy void for non-disclosure.  Motivation and controversy  Directors and officers insurance is provided so that competent professionals can serve as supervisors of organizations without fear of personal financial loss. Directors are typically not managing the day-to-day operations of the organization and therefore cannot ensure that the organization will be successful; further, business is inherently risky. Thus the business judgment rule has developed to shield directors in most instances. However, insuring negligence in supervising organizations, or wrongful acts and misrepresentation in financial statements is controversial due to its effect on accountability, otherwise known as the moral hazard problem. In the United States, corporate boards have a \\"duty of care\\", but if personal financial consequences for violating that duty of care are lacking, the boards may not perform proper due diligence. In the famousSharfman B. (2008). The Enduring Legacy of Smith v. Van Gorkom. 33 Del. J. Corp. L. case of Smith v. Van Gorkom (1985), the Delaware Supreme Court found a board grossly negligent and therefore liable. The decision created a backlash and a statute change in Delaware which allowed a corporation to amend its charter to eliminate directors' personal liability for violation of the duty of care; a version of this statute has been passed in all states, and most large corporations have such an \\"exculpatory clause\\". In some cases scholars propose that the risk of personal liability for corporate officers be increased.Drury LL. (2007). What's the Cost of a Free Pass? A Call for the Re-Assessment of Statutes that Allow for the Elimination of Personal Liability for Directors. Tennessee Journal Business Law. = Empirical research = One empirical study found that increased D&O; insurance is associated with reduced shareholder benefits from mergers & acquisitions. = Monitoring role = Since insurance companies ultimately bear costs for negligent management, theoretically insurance companies may enforce better management practices and reduce moral hazard. Empirical research, however, has not found that insurance companies perform effective monitoring of management. = Berkshire Hathaway = Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company managed by Warren Buffett, does not purchase D&O; insurance for its directors, unlike most similar companies. Warren Buffett believes that the directors should face consequences of their mistakes the way that other shareholders do.No to D&O.; Insurance Journal. Notably, however, this statement overlooks the holding- company structure of Berkshire Hathaway, auxiliary indemnification agreements with Buffett, and the individual operating companies may still purchase such insurance.  Market size and vendors  In the United States, total direct premiums written amounted to about $2.9b from 2013 to 2014, with American International Group as the market leader with 16% market share. The leaders in the provision of Directors & Officers Liability Insurance include: AIG, Chubb Corp., The Travelers Companies, ACE Limited, XL Group, Zurich Financial Services, Allianz via Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty, HCC Insurance Holdings, The Hartford, and CNA Financial (among many others).

It is noted for the Maafushi Prison. History Maafushi was heavily damaged by the 2004 tsunami which impacted on over 100,000 of the Maldives 300,000 population. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, supported by the Irish and American Red Cross Societies, began work on a mains sewage system on 10 August 2006. The International Federation has also funded the building of homes for those who lost theirs during the tsunami. Both schemes are carried out in partnership with commercial contractors and with the support and involvement of the local community... Geography The island is south of the country's capital, Mal√©. Demography According to the latest Census conducted in 2014, the total population of Maafushi is at 2,692 out of which 2,340 are Maldivians, and 352 foreigners. There has been a 17% increase in the residing population of the Island since the previous Census which was done in 2006. The population of Maafushi represents 13.84% of the total locality (Kaafu Atoll). This boom in population is mainly due to the guest house / hotel industry growth witnessed during the last 5 years. Governance A photo of the beach outside WhiteShell Beach Inn. In accordance with the recently passed Decentralization Act of Maldives, Maafushi is governed by an elected Island Council composed of five Councillors. The Council is headed by the President of the Council. The Island Council reports to the Local Government Authority (LGA). As democracy and decentralization is at the infant stage in Maldives, the councillors, and the government find it difficult to deal with important issues like land, and resource utilization. There are still many legal issues that need to be settled, before the island council can confidently perform its duties independently. There is also the issue of lack of know-how among the councillors. Most councillors are without basic education, and find it difficult to manage the day-to-day affairs of the island. Economy Maafushi is one of the islands in Maldives with a thriving local economy. While more than sixty families benefit directly from fishing, tourism industry has taken a new turn since 2010. With the government regulation allowing opening of Guest Houses in local islands, Maafushi was the first to secure an investment in tourism accommodation. The first guest house was opened in January 2010, and since then, many more have opened and they have provided the local community with foreign currency inflows. Tourists from neighboring resort islands also visit Maafushi for island hopping and Maafushi provides them with shopping opportunity with souvenir shops at assigned areas of the island. =Tourism= Guest houses right As of August 2016 there were more than 55 guest houses in Maafushihttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g2553632-Maafushi_Island.html and it is the only local inhabited island with most number of guest houses and guest beds in the country. The guest houses provide the island with direct employment, and many other indirect economic benefits to almost every family in the island. Most guest houses are funded by direct investments by local residents of the island. However, recently there have been investments by businessmen in Male' and elsewhere. Guest houses provide various excursions, including, snorkeling, fishing, water sports, and picnic island excursions. There are also three dive centers in Maafushi. The main objective of allowing guest houses in local islands by the government in 2009 is to make economic growth more inclusive. As guest houses allow local residents to earn a living directly while residing in the island, it also makes tourism receipts more inclusive, and income distribution more even. Prior this policy, tourist establishments were allowed only on separate uninhabited islands, and they are mostly called \\"Resorts\\". Most these resorts are owned and operated by few businessmen in the country, and the rest are owned and operated by foreign companies. Hence, the true benefits of tourism were not penetrated to the local citizens of the country. This was evident by the most recent economic survey conducted by the Government, which revealed that over a period of 5 years, the income distribution of the country has become more uneven, although the country's GDP has expanded.

Owen is above sea-level and receives a reliable 416 mm (about 16.5 inches) of rain annually and was first settled in about 1865. It is about 80 km north of Adelaide in South Australia and is approximately 40 minutes by road to the nearest main regional centre of Gawler. It is in the Wakefield Regional Council. There was a second railway siding about northwest of the Government Town of Owen named Woods. The small village by this station is now considered to be part of Owen. At the 2016 census, Owen had a population of 261 in the town and 511 including the surrounding farmland.  Overview  For a small town, Owen is very well serviced having a community Church, post office, bowling club, Country Fire Service (CFS) station, primary school, public swimming pools, a pub, children's playground and a golf course. In its heyday in the 1950s, Owen also had a bank, police station, drapery and a butcher. The countryside surrounding Owen was once largely given over to sheep and cattle grazing. However, since the early 1990s the area has become better known for cropping (wheat, barley, canola, beans and, more recently, olives). The Adelaide-Balaklava broad-gauge railway line passed through Owen and the railway yard is marked by concrete grain silos typical of this region. The town's other main feature is a typical 1940s large concrete water tower of in height. The drift to country living and the expanding Adelaide city environs has seen a number of young families moving into the town. New homes are being established at the rate of 1-2 per year - a veritable building boom given the almost 40 years in which only a handful of homes were built in the town. In 1997, the primary school had only 35 pupils. By 2005, this number had risen to over 50, a sure sign of a stable future. Owen's main claim to fame is the annual small-horse carriage driving championships which are held on the town's oval around Easter time.  Media  Owen's local newspaper is the Plains Producer, founded in 1903 and published in Balaklava. Owen was also home to the short-lived Owen's Weekly and Dalkey District Courier (3 October - 21 November 1908) , which was printed in parallel with the Hamley Bridge Express (3-31 October 1908) by T.W. Broadway. Each was printed in their respective town, and with different mastheads but the same content.

In the films and live-action series, he is portrayed by Christopher Lambert. In the animated series, he is voiced by Lorne Kennedy. The Highlander franchise covers different fictional timelines. Though his fate is different in each of these timelines, generally Connor MacLeod's origins remain the same: he is a man born in the Scottish Highlands in the 16th century who becomes ageless after his First Death in 1536 and learns he is one of several immortals born with an energy called \\"the Quickening,\\" unable to die unless beheaded. He is taught about his nature and how to fight by another immortal named Juan S√°nchez-Villalobos Ram√≠rez (played in the films by Sean Connery). The movie Highlander III: The Sorcerer revealed a second immortal mentor named Nakano. The movie Highlander II: The Quickening introduced an alternate backstory that said Connor was an alien, while a later version of the same film said he was born in Earth's distant past before recorded history, then sent forward to the 16th century. Highlander II is generally regarded as outside the canon of the rest of the franchise. Character concept The character of Connor MacLeod and his role as an immortal swordsman was the creation of scriptwriter Gregory Widen. Widen was studying film at University of California, Los Angeles and working on a class writing project. Widen was inspired by a vacation to Scotland and England, as well as the 1977 Ridley Scott film The Duellists. According to Widen, \\"The idea of the story was basically a combination of a riff on The Duellists ‚Äì guy wants to finish a duel over years‚Äì and a visit I made both to Scotland and the Tower of London armour display, where I thought, 'What if you owned all this? What if you‚Äôd worn it all through history and were giving someone a tour of your life through it?' That scene is basically in the movie.\\" According to William Panzer, producer of Highlander: The Series, \\"And that's where everything fell into place ‚Äî the idea that there are Immortals and they were in conflict with each other, leading secret lives that the rest of us are unaware of.\\"Bill Panzer, at Thedigitalbits.com , last accessed September 4, 2007 Widen's instructor advised him to send in the class project script to an agent. It became the first draft of what would eventually be the screenplay for the 1986 film Highlander.The Telegraph - \\"There can be only one: Why Highlander will live forever\\" (2016). In a 2006 interview with The Action Elite, Gregory Widen remarked, \\"I‚Äôve always been amazed that a project I wrote as a UCLA student has had this kind of life. I think it‚Äôs appeal is the uniqueness of how the story was told and the fact it had a heart and a point of view about immortality.\\"The Action Elite - Interview with Gregory Widen (2016). Despite having immortality, Widen made MacLeod more relatable to audiences by depicting him as someone who experiences emotional loss and loneliness due to his power, falling in love with people and forging friendships but knowing he will lose them all. He was also an underdog in the story, one who wasn't as old, experienced, powerful, or physically intimidating as the enemy he would have to face. Kurt Russell was desired for the role but a deal could not be reached. Russell Mulcahy, director of Highlander, became interested in actor Christopher Lambert after seeing a photograph of the 28-year-old actor in his portrayal of Tarzan in Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan. At the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival in 2015, Mulcahy said he saw the photo in a magazine and showed the production staff. \\"I said, 'who's this?' They had no idea. He couldn't speak English. But he had the perfect look. And he learned English very fast.\\" In preparation, actor Christopher Lambert spent months working with a dialect coach (four hours in the morning) and sword- training with Bob Anderson (four hours in the afternoon) who had been a Darth Vader stunt double in the Star Wars franchise.Guardian - \\"How we made Highlander: Connery opened his homemade whiskey on the plane\\" (2016). During an interview, actor Christopher Lambert reflected on the character of MacLeod, as well as the characters he played in Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes and Fortress, and remarked these heroes \\"all have one thing in common: that is that they will never give up. If they have to die for a cause, they would go for it because the purpose is not themselves, it's the other people... You can't win if you don't try, so you've gotta try.\\" Gregory Widen had originally envisioned Connor as a very serious, grim character following centuries of violence and loss. The film however portrayed MacLeod as a person who has suffers loss and fears new attachment but doesn't deny the possibility of love, maintains a sense of humor about life, and tells his adopted daughter to have hope and remain optimistic. In a 2016 interview with HeyUGuys, Lambert said part of what he found appealing about Connor MacLeod was the man still having humor and hope despite his long life and many losses. \\"It‚Äôs the only role that I have played that is touching on the subject of immortality, through a character carrying five hundred years of violence, pain, love, and suffering on his shoulders, who is still walking around and being positive. That is what amazed me about him the most... It‚Äôs difficult living through one life but to see all the people around you dying over and over. How do you cope with that pain? How do you have the strength to keep on walking, to keep being positive and optimistic? To be capable of falling in love again when you know the pain it creates when you lose them.\\"HeyUGuys - \\"Exclusive: Christopher Lambert on 30 Years of Highlander\\" (2016). In a 2016 interview with The Guardian, Lambert said he reflected on Connor MacLeod following the loss of his own brother. \\"When my brother died of cancer, I had the same feeling I had during Highlander, with its idea that you cannot get the past back ‚Äì life has to go on. If Connor MacLeod can get through five or six lifetimes, we should be able to manage one.\\" Film continuity =Highlander (1986)= In the first Highlander movie, it is established that immortals are rare human beings born with \\"the Quickening.\\" Once they have experienced their First Death, they will stop aging and heal from any wound except the loss of their head. The Quickening connects them to nature and allows them to sense each other, and one immortal can absorb the Quickening power of another if they behead them. For this reason, some immortals hunt each other, a \\"Game\\" with only one rule: never fight on holy ground. It is said that when only a few immortals are left, they will be drawn to \\"a faraway land\\" to fight for the Prize: the combined power of all immortals before them, granting enough power and knowledge to enslave humanity. Connor MacLeod is born in 1518 in Glenfinnan, Scotland near the shores of Loch Shiel. In 1536, he enters his first battle when the Clan MacLeod fights the Clan Fraser. An immortal known as The Kurgan allies with Clan Fraser, sensing MacLeod is an immortal and deciding to take his head before the young man learns his true nature and becomes an experienced fighter. Kurgan delivers a fatal wound but is attacked by others of the Clan MacLeod before he can take Connor's head. After he recovers fully healed, Connor's family and lover accuse him of witchcraft and demand he be burned him at the stake. Clan chieftain Angus MacLeod decides to simply banish Connor. The exiled man roams the Scottish Highlands, eventually becoming a blacksmith and marrying Heather MacDonald in 1539. In 1541, he meets the immortal Egyptian Juan S√°nchez-Villalobos Ram√≠rez, who teaches him of his true nature and how to fight. While Connor only wants a family and a quiet life, Ram√≠rez informs him immortals cannot have children and argues it is their duty to make sure evil people such as the Kurgan don't win the Prize. \\"In the end, there can be only one.\\"ShopusMore's Birth of Connor While Connor is away one night, the Kurgan duels Ram√≠rez and kills him, then rapes Heather before leaving, thinking MacLeod has moved on from Scotland. After Heather dies of old age, Connor wanders the world, adopting the katana of Ram√≠rez as his own. During World War II, he rescues a young Jewish girl named Rachel Ellenstein from Nazis, adopting her as a daughter. By 1985, the immortal Highlander is living in New York as an antique dealer called \\"Russell Nash.\\" In 1985, the Gathering occurs. Connor meets forensics scientist Brenda Wyatt who uncovers his true nature. When the Kurgan and the Highlander are the last two immortals left alive, Brenda witnesses their final battle. Connor wins the Prize, becoming a mortal man who can have children and gaining the power to know the thoughts and dreams of all human beings. Returning to Scotland with Brenda, he is relieved that the Game is over and hopes to unite the world and help people reach greater understanding of each other. =Highlander II: The Quickening (1991)= During filming, the studio took control of the project and the story. Highlander II: The Quickening was released in 1994 and met with negative responses. A director's cut called Highlander II: Renegade Version was released in 2004, altering parts of the story. Both versions contradict parts of the original movie. 1994 Version ‚Äì The film reveals that Connor MacLeod and Ram√≠rez were originally born 500 years ago on the planet Zeist and were members of a revolution against the tyrant General Katana. Now depicted as a sorcerer-like figure, Ram√≠rez declares MacLeod their leader and creates a bond between them both through \\"the ancient power of the Quickening,\\" which he explains is magic. He later says not even death can break this bond. Katana captures the revolutionaries and the priests of Zeist exile them all to Earth where they will become immortal (though how is not explained). They can only end their ageless exile by battling each other and winning the Prize. The victor may then choose to either return to Zeist or remain on Earth as a mortal. It is said that while Connor did win the prize in 1985, he has not yet actually chosen whether to remain or not. Years after Connor wins the Prize, the ozone layer is destroyed by industrial pollution, causing the deaths of many (it is implied MacLeod's wife Brenda died as a result as well but this is not clear). The now-mortal Connor uses his considerable wealth to supervise the creation of an artificial shield around Earth that replaces the ozone layer but also hides the sun and sky from view. Eventually, the shield comes under the control of The Shield Corporation (TSC), which charges countries for protection. By 2024, Connor MacLeod is an old man and society has declined into widespread corruption and poverty. On Zeist, Katana decides to kill MacLeod rather than chance that he will change his mind and return to start another revolution. He sends two assassins to Earth, who become immortal as a result. Killing them, MacLeod regains his youth. The film then follows his fight against Katana (who also comes to Earth) and The Shield Corporation after he discovers the ozone layer has been healed for years. He is aided by political activist Louise Marcus, who becomes his lover, and by Ram√≠rez, who is resurrected when Connor summons him with the mystical Quickening. Ram√≠rez later sacrifices himself to help MacLeod escape a deadly trap. The film ends with MacLeod beheading Katana and deactivating the Shield. Mortal once more, Connor is content to start a new life with Louise. In the TV cut of this film, Connor's reasons for creating the Shield are further explained. The ending was expanded to show him returning to Zeist with Louise accompanying him. Highlander II: Renegade Version / Highlander II: Special Edition ‚Äì In recut versions of the movie, all verbal mention of Zeist is removed. The flashback scenes of Zeist are now said to take place on Earth in a society that once existed but was lost before recorded history. In this version of events, Ram√≠rez and MacLeod are already immortals who can only die by beheading due to each being born with the Quickening. Ram√≠rez is still a man who forms a connection with MacLeod through magic, though he no longer calls it the Quickening. He and MacLeod, along with others, are still revolutionaries opposed to General Katana, now also said to be an immortal. In the revised trial scene, the Priests and their Chief Justice mention that the immortal revolutionaries, as well as other immortal criminals, will be exiled into the far future where they will fight each other in trial by combat. The winner may then remain in the future as a mortal being to live out their days or return to the past with their immortality intact and their freedom restored by amnesty. The film added footage with MacLeod visiting Brenda Wyatt at her deathbed in 1995. She asks him to save humanity from the destruction of the ozone layer, explaining how he got personally involved in the creation of the Shield. The film also fixed a continuity error in the previous film when two different sword fights were merged into one. A scene is added where Louise and Connor go above the shield and confirm the ozone layer has been repaired. The ending is slightly different, indicating that Connor destroys the shield by releasing his Quickening energy, possibly becoming mortal again in the process. =Highlander III: The Sorcerer (1994)= This film, also called Highlander: The Final Dimension, acts as an alternate sequel to the original movie and erases the canon of Highlander II by confirming Connor was born in 16th century Scotland. The movie says Brenda Wyatt died in a car crash in 1987 after being married to Connor for two years, further underlining this is a new timeline (Highlander II said she died in 1995 from solar radiation poisoning). The film begins by revealing that after the death of his first wife Heather in the late 16th century, Connor travels to Japan to meet the sorcerer Nakano, a master of illusion and old acquaintance of Ram√≠rez. In a cave in Mount Niri, Nakano teaches Connor how to fight with Ram√≠rez's katana. The evil immortal Kane and two immortal soldiers arrive and kill Nakano, but the sorcerer casts a spell as his Quickening is released. As MacLeod escape, the cave is destroyed and buried, and Kane and his two soldiers are frozen by the magic, effectively removing them from the Game and preventing them from joining the Gathering in 1985. Further flashback scenes reveal MacLeod falling in love with Sarah Barrington in 18th century France, only for her to marry someone else and start a family after she mistakenly believes Connor died during the French Revolution. In 1994, the cave of Nakano is discovered by archaeologist Dr. Alexandra Johnson (who looks like Sarah Barrington). The cave being disturbed awakens Kane and his henchmen. Kane, now possessing Nakano's sorcery, immediately kills one of his men to gain power while sending the other to track down MacLeod. In Marrakech, Morocco, Connor is raising his adopted son John in peace when he senses a release of the Quickening and realizes the Game is not over. His suspicions are confirmed when he meets and kills Kane's other soldier. Investigating Nakano, Alex finds Connor and realizes he is immortal. When his katana is destroyed in battle, Alex gives Connor refined steel from Nakano's cave and he forges a new katana. Kane later kidnaps John to draw out Connor. The Highlander duels Kane and kills him, gaining his power and finally ending the Game. He then leaves to start a new life with John and Alex. Live-Action TV series continuity The live-action TV series takes place after the events of the original 1985 movie while revising it slightly. In this version of events, the events of the original film still happened with one major change: Connor did not win the Prize when he killed Kurgan because there were still several immortals remaining on Earth. Christopher Lambert declined to reprise his role of Connor for a weekly series, and so the show stars new character Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul). =Highlander: The Series (1992-1998)= Connor MacLeod appears in the first episode, \\"The Gathering,\\" visiting series protagonist Duncan and his lover Tessa No√´l while pursuing an evil immortal named Slan Quince. The show's first two episodes, along with the later movie Highlander: Endgame, explain that Duncan MacLeod was a boy adopted into the Clan MacLeod roughly 75 years after Connor's birth. Like Connor, Duncan dies in battle only to miraculously revive, leading his adopted father to conclude he is a demon or changeling. Duncan discovers he was adopted soon after but never learns his true parentage. Connor MacLeod returns to Scotland in 1625 and finds Duncan, training him in sword fighting and teaching him what it means to be immortal. The two become close friends though their personalities sometimes clash and eventually they go separate ways, only occasionally reuniting. Duncan later recalls that Connor \\"taught me how to live.\\" After the first episode, Connor never appears in the series but is occasionally mentioned with respect. The TV series introduces the Watchers, humans who record the lives and battles of immortals. It is revealed that Connor was studied from afar by many Watchers, including three named Alistair MacDougal, Nathaniel Post, and Dana Brooks. The second season episode \\"Watchers\\" (1993) confirms the battle with the Kurgan in 1985 happened in the series canon and reveals that many Watchers were relieved when Connor killed him, fearing that humanity would suffer if the villain had won the Prize. =Highlander: Endgame (2000)= The theatrical film Highlander: Endgame follows the continuity of the live-action TV series. No reference is made to the events of Highlander III: The Sorcerer or to Connor's adopted son John from that film and it seems the film exists in a separate canon. According to the movie, the TV series continuity version of Connor MacLeod has beheaded 262 immortals by the year 2000. Highlander: Endgame shows more of Connor and Duncan's shared past and reveals Connor's mother was persecuted and ultimately executed by the Clan MacLeod soon after his banishment. The night of her execution, Connor tries to save her but fails. Kneeling over her, Connor is startled by a priest he then kills in a rage. The priest's adopted son Jacob Kell later discovers he too is immortal and swears vengeance. Jacob Kell hunts many immortals across the centuries, often cheating by ignoring the rules of the Game. In 1990, Connor is on his way to visit his adopted daughter Rachel Ellenstein at his old antique shop. Kell uses a bomb to destroy it and Connor's old apartment, killing Rachel inside. Overcome by depression and disillusioned with his ageless life, Connor immediately leaves the Game and the world in general by entering a place called the Sanctuary, where he and other like-minded immortals are kept in a near-coma state, looked after by a group of Watchers who believe there must always be at least two immortals so no one wins the Prize and possibly dominates humanity. Ten years later when the film takes place, Jacob Kell forces Connor to leave the Sanctuary and the hero once again fights alongside Duncan. Unwilling to see anyone else he loves die and believing that neither he nor Duncan are powerful enough to stop Kell in a proper duel, Connor attacks his clansman, insisting the younger MacLeod take his power and knowledge. Refusing at first, Duncan sees Connor will not change his mind. As Connor says, \\"Goodbye, Duncan, my true brother,\\" Duncan beheads him. During his subsequent fight with Kell, Duncan momentarily has Connor's voice and appearance. With his newly increased power, Duncan kills Kell. He then buries Connor in the Scottish Highlands next to his first wife Heather. Some fans have argued the film must take place in 2004 in order for the events of Highlander III to have still happened to Connor, but the film itself makes no mention of taking place in the near future. Just as Highlander III took place in a continuity that doesn't acknowledge the TV series and actively contradicts it, Highlander: Endgame extends the TV series continuity while contradicting the films. The story implies this version of MacLeod never adopted a son named John nor began a relationship with Alex Johnson, both of whom he would've abandoned to live in the Sanctuary during the 1990s. Animated series Connor in Highlander: The Animated Series Highlander: The Animated Series aired from 1994 to 1996, presenting a new continuity and taking place on 27th century Earth, roughly 700 years after the planet suffers apocalyptic devastation from a meteorite impact. After the devastation causes much of human society to fall, all of Earth's immortals decide to stop the Game so they can preserve knowledge, uncover lost history, and guide humanity rather than kill each other. Those who agree cast away their swords and call themselves Jettators (from the French jette, \\"thrown away\\"). The only immortal who decides not to give us killing and conquest is Kortan, who is ruler over much of Earth by the 27th century. He is opposed by young immortal Quentin MacLeod (Miklos Perlos), the last of the Clan MacLeod, and the boy's mentor Don Vincente Marino Ram√≠rez (who resembles Sean Connery but is a different character altogether). Quentin has discovered a way to absorb the Quickening of other immortals without killing them, gaining their power and making them mortal in the process. He hopes one day to defeat Kortan. In the thirteenth episode of the animated series, entitled \\"The Sound of Madness,\\" a flashback reveals that Connor MacLeod (Lorne Kennedy) and Don Vincente Marino Ram√≠rez were friends in the 20th century and both became Jettators soon after the meteorite fell. When Kortan says he desires conquest and will not take the vow of non-violence, Connor (wearing his trench coat from the original movie) duels the villain, but loses. Realizing he will die in a moment, Connor prophesies that Kortan will be defeated by an immortal of the Clan MacLeod. Connor MacLeod is never seen in the series again.  Books and comics  Connor appears in the TV-series tie-in novel Highlander: The Element of Fire by Jason Henderson, published in 1995. Along with exploring the friendship between the two Highlanders and Duncan's training period, the book introduces an immortal pirate Khordas who haunts them both. Connor MacLeod is the lead character of Highlander comic books published by Dynamite Comics. Like the live-action TV series, the Dynamite Comics continuity treats the first film as canon but revises the battle with Kurgan to not be the final battle for the Prize. Unlike the TV series, the comics also reference characters from Highlander III: The Last Dimension. The 13-issue Highlander comic series published from 2006 to 2007 follow Connor on an adventure he experiences after the events of the first movie. Connor is the star of two mini-series that each act as a prequels to the original film: Highlander: The Way of the Sword and Highlander: The American Dream. He appears in the mini-series Highlander Origins: The Kurgan. The comics have met with mixed reception. Legacy Star Fox programmer Dylan Cuthbert gave Fox McCloud the family name based upon MacLeod though he modified the spelling for it to sound more \\"spacey\\".

The family hailed originally from Roxburghshire in the borders of Scotland. He grew up at Danbury, Essex. Hopkirk was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford. From an early age he was interested in spy novels carrying around Buchan's Greenmantle and Kipling's Kim. At the Dragon he played rugby, and shot at Bisley. During his national service, he was commissioned in the Royal Hampshire Regiment in January 1950 and served as a subaltern in the King's African Rifles in the same battalion as Lance-Corporal Idi Amin. Before turning full-time author, he was an ITN reporter and newscaster for two years, the New York City correspondent of Lord Beaverbrook's The Sunday Express, and then worked for nearly twenty years on The Times; five as its chief reporter, and latterly as a Middle East and Far East specialist. In the 1950s, he edited the West African news magazine Drum, sister paper to the South African Drum. Hopkirk travelled widely over many years in the regions where his six books are set ‚Äì Russia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, China, India, Pakistan, Iran, and eastern Turkey. He sought a life in dangerous situations as a journalist, being sent to Algeria to cover the revolutionary crisis in the French colonial administration. Inspired by Fitzroy Maclean's Eastern Approaches he began to think about the Far East. During the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961 he was based in New York covering the events for the Express. Hopkirk was twice arrested and held in secret police cells, once in Cuba, where he was accused of spying for the US Government. His contacts in Mexico obtained his release. In the Middle East, he was hijacked by Arab terrorists in Beirut, which led to his expulsion. The PLO hijacked his plane, a KLM jet bound for Amsterdam at the height of the economic oil crises in 1974. Hopkirk confronted them and persuaded the armed gang to surrender their weapons. His works have been officially translated into fourteen languages, and unofficial versions in local languages are apt to appear in the bazaars of Central Asia. In 1999, he was awarded the Sir Percy Sykes Memorial Medal for his writing and travels by the Royal Society for Asian Affairs.RSAA Awards Much of his research came from the India Office archives in the British Library (in London's St Pancras). Hopkirk's wife Kathleen Partridge wrote A Traveller's Companion to Central Asia, published by John Murray in 1994 (). Hopkirk died on 22 August 2014 at the age of 83.

It is the capital and most populous island of Lhaviyani Atoll. History According to local historian late Ali Hussain, Naifaru has been inhabited for more than 400 years. He concluded this based on some evidences he observed. among these are: # lack of evidence of Naifaru being a big town historically, like the abandoned cemeteries, foundations and rocky mounds of the buried stupas from the Buddhist era like of which we find in some other islands of the atoll like Maafilaafushi, Dhiffushimaidhoo. And lack of any record which mention Naifaru being a populated place historically. # Written record of a political prisoner named Hussain Velaanaa Thakurufaanu (Hussain Shah Bandhar) being banished to Naifaru in 1116 AH (1704‚Äì1705 CE). Since political prisoners are banished to islands with small populations, Ali Hussain concludes it must not have been very long since Naifaru was inhabited. # Written record of the endowment of Raafushi Island to Naifaru Kuda Miskiy (small mosque) in 1197 AH (1783 CE). Ali Hussain estimates it would take about two centuries for an island to populate enough to have an endowment be registered to its mosque. # Observed dates from local cemetery tombstones which goes back to 12th century AH (17th century CE) # A huge tombstone which was erected to the west of Hukuru Miskiy (Friday Mosque); according to local oral tradition it belonged to a martyr of the Battle of Dhonakulhi which took place in 1167 AH (1753 CE) Looking at all these evidences, Ali Hussain concludes Naifaru was inhabited at around 1000 AH (1591 CE). Ali Hussain also saw a written document which says that when islands like Dhiffushimaidhoo and Huruvalhi were inhabited islands, Naifaru and Madivaru were uninhabited islands leased to a citizen of Huruvalhi. He had employed a group of people from Raa Atoll Kothaafaru to get toddy from palm trees of Naifaru and Madivaru. When a fight broke out in Huruvalhi, he came to Naifaru with his family and inhabited it. Ali Hussain says, he neither accepts this narration nor rejects it.  Geography  Naifaru is at 5.4444¬∞‚Ä≤ north latitude and 73.3657¬∞‚Ä≤ east longitude. The island is north of the country's capital, Mal√©. The total area of Naifaru is , including the part of the island expanded in 2004 by reclaiming the surrounding lagoon of the island. Demography In 1931, Naifaru had a population of around 1800; in 1979 it has increased to 2810. As of the 2006 census, Naifaru had population of 3687, contributing 1.23% of total population of the country. Compared to the 2000 census, Naifaru had a slightly negative population growth (-0.09%). This negative change is due to emigration to the Capital. As of 31 December 2008, Naifaru had a registered population of 4720. As of 31 May 2013 it has increased to 5082. The population as of August 2017 stands at 5408. In the latest census conducted in 2014, Naifaru recorded a residing population of 4141 people. this includes 3844 Maldivians and 297 foreigners. Naifaru is the 6th most populous town in the Maldives after Mal√©, Addu City, Fuvahmulah, Kulhudhuffushi, and Thinadhoo. Governance =Municipal Council= Secretariat of the Naifaru Council Economy =Fishing= Fishing has been the major income generator for the islanders since the beginning. The location of the first tuna canning factory in the Maldives was selected to be the nearby island of Felivaru due to the high number of catch by Naifarians. Fishing is still a major income generator for the island, although working in resort islands has gained popularity among the youth in the last few years. =Retail business= Naifaru has more than 120 shops and markets that serve the island population as well the atoll population. These include hardware stores, food and consumer product stores, electronic shops, building materials, fabric stores, boutiques and automobile showrooms. =Guest houses= There are two guest houses in operation in Naifaru, and more are being built. Transportation There are two passenger boats operating between Naifaru and the capital Male; it takes about nine hours on the sea in order to reach the destination. A passenger boat from Dhaalu atoll travels between Naifaru and Male. Healthcare Faadhippolhu Atoll Hospital Lhaviyani Atoll Hospital (LHAH) is the only Medical facility in Naifaru. It is the state level Hospital of Faadhippolhu and so people from Naifaru, people from neighbor islands, and people from neighboring atolls visit it for medical procedures. Education =Secondary and primary education= Madhrasathul Ifthithaah is the second oldest education institute in the country. It was inaugurated in the year 1933 by the Naifaru born renown scholar and Supreme Judge Abdullah Fahmi Didi (Jalaluddin). It teaches students from LKG, UKG, Grade 1 up to grade 12. Students of grade 10 do the Cambridge O' levels and after finishing grade 12 they sit in London Ed Excel Advance Level examinations. Students from Madhrasathul Ifthithaah have scored good grades in the National Top Ten in the O' Levels and A Levels. The school population is more than 1000. =Preschool= Until 2016, Naifaru had three preschools; Nooraanee Preschool (NPS), Roashanee Preschool (RPS) and Lifelong Learning Preschool (LLP). NPS and RPS were managed by the local council while LLP was a private school. NPS and RPS are the oldest preschools in the Maldives. Nooraanee Preschool was opened in 1947. In 2017 the name of Roashanee Preschool changed to Iqra International Preschool and the school is now very different.

Ripley or E. P. Ripley, was the fourteenth president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.  Youth and education  Ripley was born on October 30, 1845, in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Although his family had settled in the American colonies as early as 1638, his family's most prestigious quality was that there were nine blacksmiths in his ancestry. Ripley attended public schools, entering the workforce in 1862 at a dry goods merchant's in Boston. Six years later, Ripley started his first job for a railroad as a freight agent for the Pennsylvania Railroad. After two years, he transferred to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad as a clerk. He worked his way up through various positions including New England agent, general eastern agent, general freight agent, traffic manager and finally general manager. In 1890 Ripley left the Burlington for a few years to work for the Milwaukee Road.  Santa Fe leadership  On December 1, 1895, as the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway emerged from receivership, Ripley became the Santa Fe's president. After the financial scandals that brought on the railroad's bankruptcy in the earlier part of the decade, Ripley had his work cut out for him to restore the public opinion of the railroad. He served as president until January 1, 1920. He is interred at Bronswood Cemetery in Oak Brook, Illinois.  Legacy  A Liberty Ship, hull number 2690, was named Edward P. Ripley in his honor (see List of Liberty ships). Disneyland Railroad locomotive number 2, a 4-4-0 built in 1954 by the Disney shops, was named E. P. Ripley in his honor. Ripley, California, is a town named after him and established in 1920 in the endpoint of the California Southern Railroad's (unrelated to the railroad linking San Diego and Barstow) line from Rice, California through Blythe; the line was envisioned to be a shortcut to San Diego. The Arizona and California Railroad last operated trains in this line in 2007 before abandoning most of the line in 2009. Ripley, Oklahoma, once on Santa Fe tracks, was also named after him. EP Ripley Park, was established in the heart of Marceline Missouri (Boyhood Hometown Of Walt Disney)in 1898. Walt Disney Hometown Museum Marceline was established by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1888 as a division point between Kansas City and Chicago.

The city is geographically located at the southern edge of Baa Atoll (Southern Maalhosmadulu Atoll or Maalhosmadulu Dhekunuburi). It has the highest population in the atoll and most of the government offices and public facilities.  History  Little is known about the history of Eydhafushi. The island's current population has been pretty recent, with estimated immigration of nearby islanders from the 17th‚Äì19th century. In the 1968, people from the nearby Maaddoo island, Funadhoo and Undoodhoo were immigrated to Eydhafushi under the supervision of the Maldivian government as they sought a better standard of living. Geography The island is northwest of the country's capital, Mal√©. Eydhafushi is located at 05¬∞ 06' 10\\" north latitude and 73¬∞ 05' 15\\" east longitude. After land reclamation, the total area of Eydhafushi is now , including the part of the island expanded in 2015 by reclaiming the lagoon surrounding the island. =Ecology= One of the growing issues at Eydhafushi is the rising temperatures. The island is sometimes referred by people as \\"hell\\" due to the extremely high temperatures, especially during mid-day. Due to lack of living space, in the past trees at homes were cut down. Recently, the tall trees on the streets were also cut down to lay tar on the main roads. There were no sufficient greening programs held to make up for the cutting down of trees, hence resulting in dusty streets and growing temperatures. Even after the reclamation project, there were no greening programs conducted to overcome the issue of the rising temperatures. Soneva Fushi resort planted trees at the island‚Äôs harbour a few years ago. However, the program did not proceed smoothly due to lack of proficient support. Demography  Governance  Eydhafushi shares a parliamentary district with Dharavandhoo and Maalhos called Eydhafushi Dhaairaa. The current member of parliament is Mr. Ahmed Saleem (Redwave Saleem) elected as a member of PPM. = Municipal Council = The island is administered by 5 elected councillors who are elected for a term of 3 years. The current members were elected from the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), and Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM). = Atoll Council = The atoll is administered by 3 councillors. All of them represent the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP).  Economy  = Fishing = In the past, fishing was the major income generator for the local people. However, the tourism industry has grown at an immense rate in the last few years leading to an increase in employment of young people offering good competitive salaries. = Retail = Eydhafushi has more than 20 shops and markets that serve the island population along with the whole atoll population. These include food and consumer product stores, hardware stores, electronic shops, building materials, fabric stores, boutiques and automobile showrooms. = Tourism = The island current economy is supported by people working in the resorts and construction industry. With the increasing number of tourist resorts nearby, the local people began to prefer working in the resorts mainly due to the better salaries the jobs offer. Most of the young people from the island join the resorts just after finishing school. These young people also have the chance to apply to multiple apprenticeship programs offered by some of most well known resorts in the country, such as the Four Seasons Landaa Giraavaru and Soneva Fushi.  Education  = Primary and Secondary education = The island boasts one of the most renowned school in Maldives, Baa Atoll Education Centre. Baa Atoll Education Centre is the first Maldivian government school established outside of Male' was inaugurated on 24 February 1978 by the then Minister of Education Honourable Abdul Sattar Moosa Didi. The school currently teaches up to 12th standard. = Pre School = Bahiyya Pre School and BAEC provide education for small children.

Professional wrestling career =Early career= Corino's older brother Steve is a professional wrestler as well, and while working for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) he introduced his sister to the ECW locker room. Corino befriended Francine, a manager for ECW, and in May 2000 Francine and Corino attended an IWA Reading wrestling show in Reading, Pennsylvania together. ECW alumnus The Sandman's wife Lori (who usually accompanied him to ringside) was unavailable, so The Sandman invited Corino to substitute for her. Corino accepted at the urging of Francine and enjoyed the experience so much that she worked for the same company again several weeks later. The next month, she joined the Independent Wrestling Federation (IWF) and began training under Rapid Fire Maldonado and her brother in the IWA Cruel School in Boyertown, Pennsylvania. Corino adopted the persona of Allison Danger, a tattooed punk. Her first match was a mixed tag match with Rapid Fire as her partner in Reading. Danger and Maldonado continued to team together, and on March 24, 2001, in Plainfield, New Jersey they won the IWF Tag Team Championships in a four way tag match. After Maldonado suffered an injury, Biggie Biggs replaced him as Danger's partner. They lost the titles to Hadrian and Damian Adams on September 16, 2001, in West Orange, New Jersey. Throughout 2003 Danger worked for Jersey All Pro Wrestling and IWA Mid South. Between July and August 2003 she toured Japan, replacing her friend Lucy Furr. =Ring of Honor= Danger in her entrance attire on the way to face Cindy Rogers Danger joined Ring of Honor (ROH) as the manager of the Christopher Street Connection. At the first show she took her first and only table bump at the hands of Da Hit Squad. After the Connection left ROH, she became the manager of The Prophecy, a heel stable led by Christopher Daniels who opposed ROH's \\"Code of Honor\\" and was feuding with The Group, led by Danger's brother Steve. On June 12, 2004, Prophecy members Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer turned face, abandoning the Prophecy name and firing Danger as their manager. She began feuding with Maff and Whitmer, and placed a bounty on their heads on June 24. Throughout the remainder of 2004 she hampered every action of her former clients, repeatedly costing them matches, and using her control of their contracts to book them in physically taxing matches. Despite her efforts, however, Maff and Whitmer defeated the Havana Pitbulls for the ROH Tag Team Championship on February 19, 2005. Danger then briefly feuded with Daizee Haze before leaving ROH. Danger returned to ROH at Death before Dishonor III on June 18, 2005, and alluded to the return of Christopher Daniels to the promotion (Daniels was pulled from all ROH shows by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2004 as a result of the Rob Feinstein controversy). She reformed her alliance with Daniels after he returned later that night. From July 2005 until Daniels left ROH in April 2007 she was his manager. The same weekend Daniels left ROH, Danger left as well. =Shimmer Women Athletes= Danger is heavily involved with the running of Chicago-based female independent circuit independent professional wrestling promotion Shimmer Women Athletes. She co- runs the promotion along with Dave Prazak, as well as being an active wrestler and color commentator for the DVDs. Her notable feuds in Shimmer have been against Rebecca Knox, Cindy Rogers, and Portia Perez. At Shimmer's April 26 taping, Danger suffered a fractured clavicle in the closing moments of a tag- team match with Sara Del Rey against Cheerleader Melissa and MsChif. She missed three months of in-ring action, but still attended the shows, commentating and valeting whenever she could. When she was medically cleared to wrestle again, Danger announced that she was pregnant and that she and husband Ares were expecting their first child in 2009. She engaged another big feud against Portia Perez of the Canadian NINJAs. After re-aggravating her shoulder injury on Volume 20, she made her return as part of the Volume 24 where she lost to Perez in a Street Fight match. Later in the night, as part of the Volume 25, she teamed with Daizee Haze winning a Tag Team match against the Canadian NINJAs after her pin over Perez. After missing Volume 26 she came back with a win over the Australian Kellie Skater. Later in the night however, as part of Volume 28, she lost against Nicole Matthews after Matthews hit Danger with a belt. On April 10, 2010, at the tapings of Volume 30, Danger defeated Perez in a Last Woman Standing match. At the Volume 37 tapings, Danger formed a tag team with Leva Bates known as Regeneration X, defeating Jamilia Craft and Mia Yim in their first match together. Danger later received her first championship match in Shimmer when she and Bates challenged Ayako Hamada and Ayumi Kurihara for the Shimmer Tag Team Championship at Volume 45. However, they were not successful in winning the titles. At Volume 48, Regeneration X received another opportunity at the titles as part of a four- way elimination tag team match, and at Volume 52 against Danger's previous rivals the Canadian NINJAs. They were unsuccessful in these matches as well. On April 9, 2013, Shimmer announced that Danger would be retiring from in-ring action after the following weekend's events. Danger wrestled her final match on April 14 on Volume 57. She and Leva Bates defeated Ayako Hamada and Cheerleader Melissa in a tag team match via reversed decision, when Melissa refused to release a submission hold on Danger. Post-match, Danger revealed that she had suffered a stroke the previous January, after which lesions were found in her brain; though they were not life-threatening, she was forced to end her in-ring career. =Other promotions= In late 2009 Danger made her return for Jersey All Pro Wrestling in their Women's Division. At the beginning she was scheduled to make a comeback against Daizee Haze but she attacked her in the backstage making Daizee unable to compete. She was replaced by Portuguese Princess Ariel but Allison still got the win. On January 9, 2010, Allison lost to Sassy Stephanie but after the match she brutally attacked her injuring her too. In mid 2011, Danger joined Adrenaline Unleashed Pro Wrestling in Las Vegas Nevada as the weekly instructor for the women's training in addition to the men's/women's/teen wrestling and core training. There was one very memorable match Allison Danger had with Allie Parker. During this match, Allison was wearing her trademark spandex tights. Her name \\"Danger\\" was printed vertically on the left side of her spandex tights. Personal life Corino attended Perkiomen Valley High School in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, where she was a cheerleader and took part in field hockey, softball and track running. After graduating from high school, she played ice hockey for two years. Corino married Swiss professional wrestler Marco Jaggi, known professionally as Ares, in 2008. She gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Kendall Grace, in February 2009. In May 2010, Corino launched her own podcast at the women's wrestling website Diva- Dirt.com. The show is co-hosted by her SHIMMER colleague Amber Gertner who appears as the backstage interviewer for the promotion.

Completed in 1942, she carried out multiple intelligence and special operations activities during World War II, the most notable of which was Operation Mincemeat. She was afterwards assigned to the 8th Submarine Flotilla in the Mediterranean on 25 August; she found herself selected to carry out special operations duties. Of the missions she carried out, three stand out among the rest. Design and description Schematic drawing of a S-class submarine The S-class submarines were designed to patrol the restricted waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The third batch was slightly enlarged and improved over the preceding second batch of the S-class. The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a draught of . They displaced on the surface and submerged.Akermann, p. 341 The S-class submarines had a crew of 48 officers and ratings. They had a diving depth of .McCartney, p. 7 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater.Bagnasco, p. 110 On the surface, the third batch boats had a range of at and at submerged. The boats were armed with seven 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. A half-dozen of these were in the bow and there was one external tube in the stern. They carried six reload torpedoes for the bow tubes for a grand total of thirteen torpedoes. Twelve mines could be carried in lieu of the internally stowed torpedoes. They were also armed with a 3-inch (76 mm) deck gun.Chesneau, pp. 51‚Äì52 It is uncertain if Seraph was completed with a Oerlikon light AA gun or had one added later. The third-batch S-class boats were fitted with either a Type 129AR or 138 ASDIC system and a Type 291 or 291W early-warning radar.Akermann, pp. 341, 345 Operation Flagpole Seraph first saw action in support of Operation Torch, the Allied landings in North Africa; her first combat mission, under the command of Lieutenant Norman \\"Bill\\" Jewell, was carrying out a periscope reconnaissance of the Algerian coast during the last two weeks of September 1942. Upon her return to Gibraltar, Seraph was assigned to Operation Flagpole, the carrying of General Dwight Eisenhower's deputy, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, to North Africa for secret negotiations with Vichy French officers. Loaded with collapsible canoes, submachine guns, walkie-talkies, and other supplies, the submarine carried Clark, two other United States Army generals, United States Navy Captain Jerauld Wright, several other officers, and three members of the British Special Boat Section - Captain G.B. ('Gruff') Courtney; and Lieutenants R.P. Livingstone and J.P. Foot. Seraph then sailed to the Algerian coast on 19 October 1942. On the night of 20 October her passengers disembarked ashore. The operation was very important as it helped to reduce French opposition to the Torch landings (although the French were not informed that the troop ships were already on their way and the landings were due in just a few days). General Clark and his party were then picked up on 25 October by the submarine after some inadvertent delays. After an uneventful return journey, Seraph landed her party in Gibraltar on 25 October.  Operation Kingpin: \\"the ship with two captains\\"  On 27 October, Lt.Cdr. Jewell was ordered to set sail again to the coast of southern France for a secret rendezvous. Seraph was ordered to patrol up and down the coast until she received a signal giving her the name of the port from which she was to pick up her passengers. On the night of 5 November she finally arrived at a location some east of Toulon, as arranged to secretly take aboard French General Henri Giraud, his son, and three staff officers for a meeting with Eisenhower in Gibraltar, with the intention to enlist the support of the pro- Vichy forces at Oran and Casablanca to the Allied cause. In picking up the general's party, a bit of legerdemain was needed: because Giraud flatly refused to deal with the British, and there was no US boat within , HMS Seraph briefly became the \\"USS Seraph\\", flying the US Navy ensign. Nominally the sub came under the command of Captain Jerauld Wright, who was earlier involved in the Flagpole operation, although Jewell took care of actual operations. In the spirit of things the British crew affected American accents that they imitated from the movies. However, it fooled nobody ‚Äî including Giraud, who had been told of the deception by Wright. After the pick-up, on 7 November Seraph transferred her charges to a PBY Catalina flying boat that was sent from Gibraltar to search for her after they lost contact with the sub due to a problem with her main radio. On 24 November, Seraph sailed on her first war patrol in the Mediterranean. She was soon called upon to join other submarines in carrying U.S. and British Commandos for reconnaissance operations in the area. On 2 December 1942 she torpedoed and damaged the Italian merchant ship Puccini. Later that month, on 23 December she rammed and damaged a U-boat, sustaining sufficient damage herself to necessitate repairs and refit back in Britain. Operation Mincemeat Seraph returned to Blyth, northern England, for a much needed overhaul and leave on 28 January 1943. A few weeks later, Jewell was briefed at the Admiralty on Operation Mincemeat, to be carried out during Seraphs return to the Mediterranean. This mission was part of Operation Barclay, a plan to convince the Germans that the Allies intended to land in Greece and Sardinia, and not Sicily. She set sail again on 19 April, carrying a special passenger. This was a corpse in a metal canister, packed in dry ice, and dressed in a Royal Marines uniform. Attached to the corpse was a briefcase containing faked \\"secret documents\\" designed to mislead the Axis. In the early hours of 30 April Seraph surfaced off the coast of Spain, near the port of Huelva. Jewell and his officers launched the body and briefcase in the water, disposing of the canister in deeper waters. Jewell then radioed the signal \\"MINCEMEAT completed\\" while the submarine continued to Gibraltar. The body was picked up by the Spanish, who decided it was a courier killed in an aircraft accident. The false documents were passed to the Germans and led them to divert forces from the defence of Sicily. Other missions By late April 1943 Seraph was back in the Mediterranean operating east of Sardinia and on 27 April she fired a salvo of three torpedoes at a merchant ship off the Strait of Bonifacio but was not successful. Again on the last two days of that month she made similar attacks but none of these was successful, and Seraph ended up being depth-charged each time. She was not damaged during these engagements, with no lives lost. In July, during the Allied invasion of Sicily, she acted as a guide ship for the invasion force. For the remainder of 1943 the Seraph operated against German and Italian forces in the Mediterranean theatre and attacked several convoys, but her performance in that area was lacklustre, sinking only a few small ships. The head of HMS Seraphs search (navigation) periscope In December 1943, she sailed to Chatham for a much needed refit. In March 1944, under Lt.Cdr. Trevor Russell-Walling, she carried out her final patrol in the English Channel, when she suffered accidental damage and was docked for repairs. During this time it was decided to convert her as a training boat for anti-submarine warfare operations. The Admiralty had received intelligence in early 1944 about new U-boats which were reported to be able to achieve a top speed of around underwater, compared to the of the fastest existing U-boats. As these new XXI-class U-boats were considered to pose a major threat, Seraph was modified at Devonport as a matter of urgency to have a high underwater speed so that trials and exercises could be carried out against a submarine having a similar underwater speed; for example in developing new tactics. The submarine was streamlined by careful attention to the attachments on the outside of the hull, the size of the bridge reduced, the gun was removed along with one of the periscopes and the radar mast, and torpedo tubes blanked over. The motors were upgraded and higher-capacity batteries fitted along with replacement of the propellors with the coarser pitched type used on the larger T class submarines.Brown, DK, Nelson to Vanguard Trials and ASW exercises were carried out in September and October 1944, giving an insight into the difficulties and possible remedies to the new underwater menace.Marc Milner (2003) Battle of the Atlantic The History Press After the war Seraph remained in active service after the war. In 1955 she was fitted with armour plating and used as a torpedo target boat. She was attached to a squadron commanded by her first skipper, now Captain David Jewell. Also during this time, Seraph appeared as herself in the British film The Man Who Never Was (1956), which details her exploits during Operation Mincemeat. Her identifying marks are visible in a number of scenes during the film. She remained in commission until 25 October 1962, 21 years to the day after her launching. When she arrived at Briton Ferry for scrapping on 20 December 1962, parts from her conning tower and a torpedo loading hatch were preserved as a memorial at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, where General Clark served as president from 1954‚Äì1965. This monument is the only shore installation in the United States where the Royal Navy ensign is authorised to be permanently flown by the British Admiralty. It flies alongside the US flag to commemorate Anglo-American cooperation during World War II.
