Early life and family Fowler was born in 1929 in Marton, the son of William Coulson Fowler and Faith Agnes Netherclift. He was educated at Manchester Street School in Feilding and Christ's College in Christchurch, and completed a Master of Architecture at The University of Auckland. In 1953 he married Barbara Hamilton Hall (died 2009). Architectural career Fowler started his career in 1954 at the London office of Ove Arup and Partner. In 1957 he returned to New Zealand where he worked in his own practice: Calder, Fowler, Styles and Turner in Wellington. In the early 1960s, Fowler designed Wellington's Overseas Passenger Terminal, which was to have served international passenger ships, but never saw its intended use due to the rising popularity of air travel. In an interview many years later, he said that he \\"was party to the design of the biggest white elephant that Wellington ever built.\\" He is a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Architects. Political career Michael Fowler Centre Fowler was first elected to the Wellington City Council in 1968. Four years later he stood for the parliamentary seat of Hutt in the 1972 general election for the National Party where he came runner up to Labour's Trevor Young. Fowler was elected Mayor of Wellington in 1974, in a very tight race with long serving incumbent Sir Frank Kitts, a post that he held until he retired in 1983. His 1977 re-election campaign was against local transgender entertainer Carmen Rupe, who ran with the support of local businessman Bob Jones, with the slogans \\"Get in behind\\" and \\"Carmen for Mayor\\" and a platform of gay marriage and legalised brothels (although neither of these are local-government matters in New Zealand). Fowler was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1981 Queen's Birthday Honours. Wellington's principal concert performance hall, the Michael Fowler Centre, opened in 1983, was named in his honour.Michael Fowler Centre history. Retrieved 25 May 2013. In the lead up to the 1984 general election Fowler was speculated as a contender for the National Party nomination for the Wellington Central electorate. He admitted he had been invited by the party's electorate chairman to stand, but had declined to run.  Criticism  Fowler was criticised for his comments in May 2011 where he backed a controversial Wellywood sign in a handwritten letter to The Dominion Post, describing its critics as \\"dumb, humourless, totally irrelevant and probably Irish\\". When later questioned, he was unapologetic stating that his comment \\"wasn't meant to be derogatory.\\" Irish residents in New Zealand expressed outrage at the comments.

The first and second seasons followed volunteers from urbanized backgrounds as they use survival skills in the back-country of Alaska during the fall and winter. The third season saw a relocation of the series to Venezuela, while keeping the same general format of season 2. The series was produced by Ricochet in the first season, and by Pilgrim Films in seasons 2 and 3. Season 1: \\"The Alaska Experiment\\" In the first season of the series, 4 teams of 10 urban professionals are dropped off in the Alaskan back-country with directions to shelters they would spend the next few weeks in. The series follows these groups through the weeks as they struggle to live off the land at their shelters. Paul Claus starred as the wilderness survival expertPaul Claus, Ultima Hule Lodge (retrieved 22 January 2012) and Neil Webster helped guide several of the participants on a moose hunt which included training in firing .338 Winchester Magnum and .22 rifles for mountain goat hunting (which Claus and his son separately took participants to do). Locations include Camp Riou Point and Back Bay (both in Icy Bay), Flower Lake (in the Upper Chitina River Valley), and Hawkins Glacier. Tributes: Bernice Pierson Greg Pierson Season 2: \\"Out of the Wild: The Alaska Experiment\\" In the second season, the series was retooled and renamed, with nine volunteers working together as one team traveling across the wilderness rather than staying in one place. Due to the greater difficulty for survival of large and inexperienced groups backpacking so remotely, each participant had an emergency GPS unit that could summon a rescue team to evacuate them from the experiment. After the first few days, almost half the participants leave the show via these GPS units. 4 people finally finish the experiment after almost a month. They are rescued by a train.

Season 3: ‚ÄúOut of the Wild: Venezuela‚Äù The format was very similar to the second season with nine volunteers being dropped off on the remote Mount Roraima in the southern wilderness of Venezuela. The volunteers were given a map, compass and a variety of modern and native survival gear. They were tasked with finding civilization without any other outside assistance. Along the way they were directed to designated camps as indicated on the map. Some camps provided pre- built huts and at other locations the volunteers had to construct their own shelters. Just as in the second season, each volunteer could activate a GPS beacon to summon a rescue team via helicopter to remove them from the experience. The series followed the group through jungle, savannah, swamp, scrubland and finally a river portion for which the group had to build a raft. Four volunteers were evacuated and five reached civilization after twenty-six days. Casting took place in July 2010, and the series was filmed in the fall of 2010.

The segment represents one of the major construction efforts of the canal; in order to avoid using locks to go over a ridge, the canal was dug deeply into it, far more than the depth of the canal itself. Workers dug the canal bed up to into the blue clay ridge that separated the St. Marys and Auglaize River watersheds. It is a United States National Historic Landmark. The cut is owned by the state and managed jointly by Johnny Appleseed MetroParks and the Heritage Trails Park District as Deep Cut Historical Park, with multi-use trails and a picnic area. Description and history The Miami and Erie Canal was one of Ohio's two major artificial waterways. Built between 1825 and 1845, the canal stretched from Cincinnati to Toledo, by way of Dayton; the canal brought settlers into western Ohio and provided access to markets for farmers. Construction of the canal, in particular the cut, was an extremely labor-intensive job, performed by local hires, convicted criminals, and Irish immigrants. The advent of railroads gradually rendered the canal system obsolete. The Deep Cut is located two miles (3 km) south of Spencerville on State Route 66. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. and The boundaries of the National Historic Landmark area are State Route 66, Mendon Road, Route 66A, and Henne Road, spanning the Allen/Auglaize county line.DeLorme.

That is, it is the sum : {\\\\sideset{}{'}\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n} where the prime indicates that n takes only values whose decimal expansion has no nines. The series was first studied by A. J. Kempner in 1914. The series is counterintuitive because, unlike the harmonic series, it converges. Kempner showed the sum of this series is less than 80. Baillie showed that, rounded to 20 decimals, the actual sum is . Heuristically, this series converges because most large integers contain every digit. For example, a random 100-digit integer is very likely to contain at least one '9', causing it to be excluded from the above sum. Schmelzer and Baillie found an efficient algorithm for the more general problem of any omitted string of digits. For example, the sum of where n has no instances of \\"42\\" is about . Another example: the sum of where n has no occurrence of the digit string \\"314159\\" is about . (All values are rounded in the last decimal place). Convergence Kempner's proof of convergence is repeated in many textbooks, for example Hardy and Wright and Apostol. We group the terms of the sum by the number of digits in the denominator. The number of n-digit positive integers that have no digit equal to '9' is 8 √ó 9n‚àí1 because there are 8 choices (1 through 8) for the first digit, and 9 independent choices (0 through 8) for each of the other n‚àí1 digits. Each of these numbers having no '9' is greater than or equal to 10n‚àí1, so the reciprocal of each of these numbers is less than or equal to 101‚àín. Therefore, the contribution of this group to the sum of reciprocals is less than 8 √ó ()n‚àí1. Therefore the whole sum of reciprocals is at most :8 \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left(\\\\frac{9}{10}\\\\right)^{n-1} = 80. The same argument works for any omitted non-zero digit. The number of n-digit positive integers that have no '0' is 9n, so the sum of where n has no digit '0' is at most :9 \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left(\\\\frac{9}{10}\\\\right)^{n-1} = 90. The series also converge if strings of k digits are omitted, for example if we omit all denominators that have a decimal substring of 42. This can be proved in almost the same way. First we observe that we can work with numbers in base 10k and omit all denominators that have the given string as a \\"digit\\". The analogous argument to the base 10 case shows that this series converges. Now switching back to base 10, we see that this series contains all denominators that omit the given string, as well as denominators that include it if it is not on a \\"k-digit\\" boundary. For example, if we are omitting 42, the base-100 series would omit 4217 and 1742, but not 1427, so it is larger than the series that omits all 42s. Farhi considered generalized Kempner series, namely, the sums S(d, n) of the reciprocals of the positive integers that have exactly n instances of the digit d where 0 ‚â§ d ‚â§ 9 (so that the original Kempner series is S(9, 0)). He showed that for each d the sequence of values S(d, n) for n ‚â• 1 is decreasing and converges to 10 ln 10\\\\. The sequence is not in general decreasing starting with n = 0; for example, for the original Kempner series we have S(9, 0) ‚âà 22.921 < 23.026 ‚âà 10 ln 10 < S(9, n) for n ‚â• 1\\\\. Approximation methods The series converges extremely slowly. Baillie remarks that after summing 1024 terms the remainder is still larger than 1. The upper bound of 80 is very crude, and Irwin showed by a slightly finer analysis of the bounds that the value of the Kempner series is near 23, since refined to the value above, 22.92067... Baillie developed a recursion that expresses the contribution from each (k + 1)-digit block in terms of the contributions of the k-digit blocks for all choices of omitted digit. This permits a very accurate estimate with a small amount of computation. Name of this series Most authors do not name this series. The name \\"Kempner series\\" is used in MathWorld and in Havil's book Gamma on the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant.

In 1917, this species had been introduced into Canada and the United States. In the Nearctic realm, these insects range from Southern Ontario and Northeastern United States, to the south of North Carolina, and west of Colorado. Habitat Alfalfa plant bugs require a certain set of optimal conditions in order to thrive and become a pest in any country. A. lineolatus are primarily located in humid environments with cold temperatures. Commonly one can find these plant bugs in either fields or grasslands, in both dry and damp areas.British Bugs However, alfalfa plant bugs are not successful in salty lakes, deserts, sand dunes, windy weather, or very warm climates. Adelphocoris lineolatus will easily adapt to cooler environmental conditions, which has allowed them to invade a large amount of territory in Canada. External anatomy and physical characteristics  Nymph of Adelphocoris lineolatus Adelphocoris lineolatus have an elongated body shape and are large in body size. Alfalfa plant bug males body size ranges from, 8.3-9.5 millimetres. Whereas, the females are a little bit smaller than the males having a body size between, 7.6 and 8.3 millimetres. Their antennae are usually the same length as their body size, sometimes a bit shorter. A longitudinal brown triangle is located on the middle of their corium. The scutellum of A. lineolatus have two longitudinal brown lines on the surface. The pronotum of the alfalfa plant bug will have two black spots on it. It commonly observed that their femora are spotted with brown specks. Also, the ocular index between male and female Adelphocoris lineolatus differs. Males have an ocular index of 0.83 millimetres. Whereas, females have an ocular index of 1.5 millimetres. Certain regions of their bodies are covered with black hairs, and others with pale coloured hairs. The body colour can range from a light green to a pale brown. Nymphs are green and have red eyes. In A. lineolatus nymphs there is an absence of wings, but in adult species wings are seen. Reproduction Alfalfa plant bugs exhibit migratory behaviour, which allows Adelphocoris lineolatus to rapidly increase their population sizes. Adult females can lay 80 to 300 eggs, into branches and young stems of host plants, females will begin to lay eggs in the end of July. The eggs will develop in 8‚Äì12 days, but some of the eggs will overwinter. Eggs that have overwintered in stems, hatch in late May or early June. Less than five percent of alfalfa plant bug eggs will hatch in the same year they are laid. A majority of the eggs will enter a period of diapause. This causes a decline in the reproductive activity of second-generation adults. The developmental process of A. lineolatus involves five nymphal instars, and between late June and October adults are seen. Ecological and economical damage Adelphocoris lineolatus nymphs and adults are generalists feeding on a variety of crops including alfalfa, bean, cotton, peach, and strawberry crops. Adults and nymphs will consume the reproductive and vegetative organs of their host plants, which are primarily alfalfa and cotton crops. By feeding on the reproductive and vegetative organs of their host plants, they cause stunted growth and deformation of flowers, fruits, and leaves. The eggs that have overwintered will hatch in spring and the A. lineolatus nymphs will begin to feed on various crops. Lucerne bugs will migrate onto summer host plants, such as, alfalfa and cotton because they will allow the successful colonization of A. lineolatus. Alfalfa and cotton crops can be either, flowering or non- flowering. Adelphocoris lineolatus have a stronger preference towards flowering crops, in comparison to non-flowering crops. Flowering alfalfa and cotton crops promote higher survival rates and nymphal development amongst this particular species. Non-flowering crops increase adult mortality rates and decrease fecundity in Adelphocoris lineolatus. On flowering alfalfa plants survival rates were five times higher than on non-flowering alfalfa crops for A. lineolatus adults. Flowering cotton crops had survival rates that were almost four times greater than that on the non-flowering cotton crops. Taking a closer look at Adelphocoris lineolatus nymphs, it was noted that nymphs took a greater amount of time to develop on non-flowering plants, which directly impacted the degree of damage they could cause to their host plants. A substantial degree of damage is done to flowering and non-flowering crops because Adelphocoris lineolatus nymphs and adults have similar feeding habits, allowing them to inhabit one particular plant for their whole life cycle. Nymphs and adults belonging to Adelphocoris lineolatus are capable of reducing crop yields by 50% within two years of their infestation on crops. The livelihood of many individuals within developing countries has been negatively affected due to the rapid spread of alfalfa plant bugs, due to their migratory behaviour. They have destroyed numerous alfalfa crops around the globe. In Canada alone they have caused a deficit of $50 million to the alfalfa plant industry. Semiochemicals Alfalfa plant bugs have a greater degree of attraction towards flowering plants in comparison to non-flowering plants. The three main crops that Adelphocoris lineolatus show the most attraction for are flowering alfalfa, cotton, and mung bean crops. Biologists have observed a relationship between three chemosensory proteins found in the antennae of A. lineolatus and the semiochemicals released by flowering alfalfa, cotton, and mung bean crops resulting in a greater attraction towards these crops. AlinCSP1, AlinCSP2, and AlinCSP-3 are the three chemosensory proteins found in the antennae of Adelphocoris lineolatus. Insects are heavily dependent upon their olfactory sensila in order to detect chemical stimuli from the environment they are found in. Within the Adelphocoris lineolatus species, it has been found that they detect the semiochemicals released by their host plants in order to invade them. The chemosensory proteins, AlinCSP1, AlinCSP2, and AlinCSP-3 contain a high binding affinity to the semiochemicals released by flowering alfalfa, cotton, and mung bean plants. The greatest amount of ecological and economical damage is experienced by these flowering plants because of the semiochemicals they release into the environment, attracting Adelphocoris lineolatus. Control techniques Adelphocoris lineolatus are commonly known as the alfalfa plant bug, due to the excessive amount of damage they cause to alfalfa crops around the world. In order to decrease and prevent the rapid dispersal of A. lineolatus certain control methods need to be implemented, to decrease the amount of ecological and economic damage these pests cause. Insecticides are not commonly used to decrease or stop Adelphocoris lineolatus from infesting crops because these insects have become resistant to certain chemicals present in insecticides. A. lineolatus nymphs have become resistant to the following chemical ingredients commonly used in insecticides, mono-methanimidamide, fufenozide, buprofezin, azad irachtin, and triazophos. An alternative from these chemicals would be to use insecticides made of pyrethroid, neonicotinoid, carbamate, avermectin, or organophosphate since alfalfa plant bugs are not resistant to these chemicals. Insecticides can be an effective and efficient method of controlling pests, but they do cause a great deal of damage to our environment and we should refrain from using them if possible. Insect pheromones have successfully been implemented to reduce the amount of damage Adelphocoris lineolatus cause to numerous agricultural crops. Sexually mature A. lineolatus produce a mixture of two pheromones known as, (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate (E2HB) and (E)-4-oxo-2-hexenal (4-OHE). These pheromones are responsible for high reproductive rates amongst the alfalfa plant bug. To reduce reproductivity between female and male Adelphocoris lineolatus, an excessive amount of hexyl butyrate (HB) needs to be added to the mixture of E2HB and 4-OHE. The addition of HB reduces the attraction between female and male A. lineolatus. Hexyl butyrate is responsible for stopping the release of sex pheromones from female alfalfa plant bugs, which disrupts communication between the two sexes, and reduces reproductive success in this particular species.

These relations have long been determined by the relations between China and the Soviet Union, Mongolia's other neighbour and main ally until early-1990. With the rapprochement between the USSR and China in the late 1980s, Sino-Mongolian relations also began to improve. Since the 1990s, China has become Mongolia's biggest trading partner, and a number of Chinese businesses are operating in Mongolia.  Background  The Han Chinese and Mongols (as well as their ancestors, the Proto-Mongols) have been in contact with each other for millennia. Throughout history, Mongolia and China have had complicated relations. The Great Wall was constructed to ward off the northern nomads attacks, from the Xiongnu during the Qin Dynasty, the Turks during the Tang Dynasty, and later, the Mongolians and Central Asians. In 1271, Mongols under Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, established the Yuan Dynasty and conquered all of China in 1279. In 1368, the Chinese under the Ming Dynasty successfully expelled the Mongols from China and in 1388, sacked the Northern Yuan's capital at Karakorum. The Ming Great Wall was strengthened and the period was characterized by repeated Mongol raids into China and Chinese raids into Mongolia. During the Qing conquest of the Ming, the Mongol leader Ligdan Khan allied with the Ming against the Qing until Ligdan was defeated by Qing forces and Inner Mongolia was conquered by the Qing. In 1644, the Ming Dynasty was overthrown by peasant rebels under Li Zicheng, who established the short lived Shun Dynasty which would soon be replaced by the Qing Dynasty. During the Qing rule from 1691, Inner and Outer Mongolia were incorporated into the empire. Ceremony of the destruction of Mongolia's autonomy in 1920 After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the Republic of China was established and Mongolia declared its independence after more than 200 years of Qing dynasty rule. During this period, the Beiyang government as the successor to the Qing claimed Mongolia as Chinese territory, but lacked any stable control over the region due to massive civil wars in the south and the rise of regional warlords in the Warlord Era. Consequently, Outer Mongolia sought Russian support to claim its independence. In 1919, Chinese general Xu Shuzheng advanced into Outer Mongolia and annulled its independence. In 1921, Chinese forces were driven out by White Russian forces led by Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg.Kuzmin, S.L. History of Baron Ungern: an Experience of Reconstruction. Moscow, KMK Sci. Pres, p.156-293. - Some months later they were driven out by the Red Army of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the Far Eastern Republic and pro-Soviet Mongolian forces. In 1924, the Mongolian People's Republic was proclaimed. With the onset of the Japanese invasion of China, little effort was given to reestablish Chinese control over Outer Mongolia. Following the end of World War II, the Republic of China, led by the Kuomintang, was forced to formally accept Outer Mongolian independence under Soviet pressure. In 1949, the Communists won the Chinese Civil War and re- recognized Mongolia's independent status. Communist era Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal visited Beijing in 1952 The People's Republic of China established diplomatic relations with Mongolia on October 16, 1949 and both nations signed a border treaty in 1962. With the Sino-Soviet split, Mongolia aligned itself with the Soviet Union and asked for the deployment of Soviet forces, leading to security concerns in China. As a result, bilateral ties remained tense until 1984, when a high-level Chinese delegation visited Mongolia and both nations began to survey and demarcate their borders. In 1986, a series of agreements to bolster trade and establish transport and air links was signed. In 1988, both nations signed a treaty on border control. Mongolia also began asserting a more independent policy and pursued more friendly ties with China. Mongolia has always been suspicious that China wants to claim Mongolian territory, and concerned by fears of China's overpopulation pouring into Mongolian territory.  Modern period  Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative In the Post-Cold War era, China has taken major steps to normalize its relationship with Mongolia, emphasizing its respect for Mongolia's sovereignty and independence. In 1994, Chinese Premier Li Peng signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation. China has become Mongolia's biggest trade partner and source of foreign investment. Bilateral trade reached US$1.13 billion by the first nine months of 2007, registering an increase of 90% from 2006. China offered to allow the use of its Tianjin port to give Mongolia and its goods access to trade within the Asia Pacific region. China also expanded its investments in Mongolia's mining industries, giving it access to the country's natural resources. Mongolia is also a participant in the Belt and Road Initiative. China is likely to support Mongolia's membership in to the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and granting it observer status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

It is also known as the Third Royal Air Force Base, operated by the Royal Moroccan Air Force. History Kenitra Air Base was previously known as Craw Field, named for Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Demas T. Craw, USAAF, who was killed while attempting to deliver a message from American General Lucian Truscott to the Vichy French Commander at Port Lyautey requesting that the French surrender. Although imprisoned, Craw's interpreter, Major Pierpont Hamilton, negotiated the French surrender during Operation Torch and the airport was eventually secured for the Allied forces. Pierpont Hamilton also received the Medal of Honor for his actions. The air base at Port Lyautey served as a staging area for many Allied operations in North Africa and the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) during World War II. For the first three months after capture the 21st Engineer Aviation Regiment worked on the airfield. In Feb. 1943 the Seabees of the 120th Naval Construction Battalion took over all construction activities.Port Lyautey, Chapter XX, The Mediterranean Area, Building the Navy's Bases in World War II, History of the Bureau of Yards and Docks and the Civil Engineer Corp, 1940-1946, Volume II, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE, WASHINGTON, p. 80 The United States Navy (USN) Fleet Air Wing 15 and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 480th Antisubmarine Group were based there with specialized aircraft including PBY Catalinas, B-24 Liberators, and Goodyear-built K-ships (blimps) used to search for German U-Boats in the Atlantic Ocean and especially in the shallow waters of the Straits of Gibraltar where radar and magnetic anomaly detection were viable. Craw Field was the final destination of the six K-ships of USN Blimp Squadron ZP-14 (Blimpron 14, the Africa Squadron) that made the first transatlantic crossing of non-rigid airships in 1944. Following World War II, the airfield was expanded to a major US Naval Air Station in 1951 and renamed NAS Port Lyautey. In this capacity, it primarily supported land-based US naval reconnaissance aircraft monitoring Soviet naval operations in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. Aircraft operating from NAS Port Lyautey included the P4M Mercator in the 1950s, the P-2 Neptune in the 1950s and 1960s, and the P-3 Orion, EP-3 Aries and EA-3 Skywarrior in the 1960s and 1970s until the installation's closure as a USN facility and transfer to the Royal Moroccan Air Force in 1977.Naval Air Station Port Lyautey On 16 August 1972 a coup attempt was launched by the Minister of National Defense, Mohamed Oufkir, assisted by Mohamed Amekrane, commander of Kenitra.

Biography According to hagiography, Theodorus was born into a wealthy Christian family and was well educated from a young age. Early in life he denied the excesses of his parents, and at the age of fourteen joined a monastery in the diocese of Sne, near the modern town of Esna, Egypt. A brother from Theodorus‚Äô monastery stayed with Pachomius in Tabennese while traveling and preached of the virtues of the Koinonia upon his return to Sne. Praying and weeping, Theodorus became determined that his destiny lay with Pachomius. Although initially denied passage to Tabennese by a Pachomian monk due to his wealthy background, Theodorus opted to follow the visiting monk, and his persistence (and lack of obedience) paid off. He was welcomed by Pachomius upon his arrival, and quickly integrated into the community at Tabennese around 328. Quickly becoming a favorite of Pachomius, Theodorus lived an enviably ascetic life in the monastery, and took on the title of the \\"brothers‚Äô comforter\\". Theodorus asserted his influence openly (which resulted in reprimands from Pachomius) and generally maintained himself as a prominent figure at Tabennese for several years, despite never being given a position of power in the monastic hierarchy. Finally, Pachomius called on him to preach to the brothers despite his youth, and eventually appointed him steward of Tabennese after several new monasteries had been built. Retiring to the monastery of Phbow, Pachomius gave Theodorus complete control over Tabennese, though recalled him from the position after witnessing several monks under Theodorus‚Äô watch violating the monastic rules without reprimand. Having failed to prove his governing ability and once more in a position no higher than when he had entered the monastery, Theodorus became a personal assistant to Pachomius and remained relatively quiet for some years. Despite his clear potential and popularity, Pachomius refused to grant Theodorus any kind of authority; though the old man's failing health soon changed things forever. After Theodorus had been assisting Pachomius at Tabennese for several years following his demotion, Pachomius became very ill and seemed to be on the verge of death. Pachomius had not named a successor, and several brothers pleaded with Theodorus to assert himself as head of the Koinonia when the sickly man died. Despite the assertion that Theodorus apparently did not want the rank of a father or this world's glory, he consented. Unfortunately for the would-be leader, Pachomius recovered, and upon hearing of Theodorus‚Äô decision, exiled the ambitious young man. After living a life of constant weeping and prayer in solitude, Pachomius forgave Theodorus and allowed him to live among the brothers once more. Normalcy returned, though never again would Pachomius fully trust his former prot√©g√©. In 348 Pachomius died, naming the brother Petronios as his successor rather than the clearly qualified Theodorus. The death of Petronios later that year would leave Apa Horsiesios in charge, and the popular Theodorus would retreat to the distant monastery of Phnoum. Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia, problems soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader. Refusing to work or communicate and demanding a new leader, many of the elder monks completely abandoned any notion of obedience to Horsiesios. The federation of monasteries was falling apart, and Theodorus rushed to Tabennese to placate the rebels. Soon after his arrival, Theodorus was the new de facto leader, though he claimed to be only acting on behalf of Horsiesios. For eighteen years Theodorus administered from Pachomius‚Äô old headquarters in Phbow, using techniques far more assertive than his predecessors, such as constantly shuffling the offices and locations of the most ambitious monks. Yet in spite of this somewhat unstable shifting, the Koinonia was ruled peacefully for nearly two decades, at which point Theodorus predicted he would soon die. Within a few months his prediction came true, and Apa Horsiesios once more took his place as the head of the communities in both title and authority.Pachomian Koinonia I: The Life of Our Father Pachomius. Trans. Armand Veilleux. Kalamazoo, Michigan: Cistercian Publications, 1980. LiteraturePersonal writings= Like those of Pachomius and the other leaders of the Koinonia, Theodorus‚Äô sermons were recorded by his followers and some chronicles of his correspondence with contemporary Christian figures have survived intact. The most substantial of these documents, which are in Coptic and believed to have come from Theodorus' hand, is a set of three instructions. These instructions consist of several small lessons and rules, which Theodorus presumably taught to the brothers, and while segments of each are incomprehensible because the original texts are mutilated and the reconstruction is conjectural, many segments remain intact. A variety of subjects are covered in these texts, though few passages offer any insight beyond the well-known facts that Theodorus greatly admired Pachomius and endorsed a very ascetic lifestyle for the brothers whom he guided. Scripture is cited liberally, though there is ultimately little to distinguish these texts from the writings of other early Christians under the Alexandrian sphere of influence. The same can be said for the two short letters Theodorus composed to the other monasteries of the federation that he inherited from Pachomius, which deal with the topics of Passover and vigilance against sin. Certainly these texts all offer insight into the values of the Pachomian monastic system as a whole and early Christianity itself, but little is intrinsically evident about the man who penned them.Pachomian Chronicles and Rules. Trans. Armand Veilleux. Kalamazoo, Michigan: Cistercian Publications, 1981. =The letter of Ammon= The letter of Ammon is the only firsthand description of what it was like to be within a monastery during the time in which Theodorus was in charge of the Koinonia. Ammon spent three years living with Theodorus in the monastery of Phbow, which served as the headquarters of the Koinonia starting when Pachomius relocated there around 336. Most of the letter consists of sayings Ammon heard from brothers who had personally interacted with Pachomius and Theodorus, much of which is praise for the two men with little real substance. Although Ammon was a diligent man who would later become a well-known bishop, his knowledge of the workings of the Koinonia was limited by his inability to understand Coptic. Pachomius and Theodorus were native Egyptians, and spoke the native Egyptian language known as Sahidic Coptic, as did a vast majority of the brothers who came to them. However, individuals who spoke other languages began to be accepted after Athanasius referred a Greek convert who had served him in Alexandria to Pachomius. This Greek man, who was known as Theodorus the Alexandrian, sought an ascetic life, and quickly impressed Pachomius with his piety. Although Pachomius was unable to easily communicate with him, he appointed this new Theodorus as the housemaster for the strangers who were also coming to become monks with him in Phbow, and gave him full authority over those who spoke Greek. Theodorus the Alexandrian eventually learned Coptic and was able to communicate with Pachomius and serve as the official translator of the Koinonia, but the community he administered always remained semi-autonomous from the main population of the monastery. Greek monks were forced to rely on Theodorus to communicate with anyone outside their small circle, and a distinct language barrier manifested itself. As the sources indicate, Ammon and the brothers he interacted with were on the side of this barrier opposite Theodorus. All accounts of Theodorus‚Äô sayings reported in Ammon's letters are described only as they were translated to him. Ammon acknowledges that when Theodorus spoke to him, he did so in the Egyptian language, while Theodorus the Alexandrian translated into Greek, and that all his communications were thus indirect. It was a burden for Ammon to ask Theodorus questions, since both the inquiry and response had to pass through Theodorus the Alexandrian, and as such most of his descriptions involve observable actions rather than speech. Furthermore, the stories and miracles he chronicles hearing from his brothers could not have come directly to them from an Egyptian brother, and must have filtered to them through Theodorus the Alexandrian. Since little is known or recorded about the intention of the Greek Theodorus, it is impossible to judge how his position as head translator may have affected information received by the community he headed, or how accurately they understood the words of Pachomius and the Egyptian Theodorus.The Letter of Ammon and Pachomian monasticism. Trans. James E. Goehring. New York: W. de Gruyter, 1986. =The monastic chronicle= The monastic chronicle of the Pachomian federation is by far the most detailed source that mentions Theodorus. The chronicle was completed sometime after the deaths of Pachomius and Theodorus, who are presented as the two centermost figures in the history of the Koinonia. Versions of this chronicle has been found in several different translations and pieced together from fragments but the Bohairic version has become the most frequently consulted. This is because it is by far the most detailed and comprehensible version, and written in a language more similar to the Sahidic Coptic spoken by most Pachomian monks than the Greek version. It can be estimated that the chronicle composed sometime between 368, when the last of the recorded events is believed to have transpired, and 404, when Saint Jerome is known to have translated a version of the chronicles into Latin. Many questions remain about the origins of this text, but since it is the only substantial biography about Theodorus, it remains a fundamental source.

Among his most prominent achievements was when he single-handedly took on a squadron of German-flown Fokker (Dutch make) planes officially downing 2 of them in one aerial battle piloting his Smith IV Spad XIII.https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/24/obituaries/a-raymond-brooks-is- dead-at-95-the-last-us-ace-of-world-war-i.html He was a pioneer in the development of radio navigational aids (NAVAIDs) used by pilots for location and navigation as well as air-to-ground communications. Brooks also participated in early endeavors to commercialize aviation as a passenger- carrying business and was one of the earliest commercial pilots involved with carrying mail (air mail) for the US Post Office Department. Early life and World War I Brooks was born in Framingham, Massachusetts. He graduated as valedictorian from Framingham Academy and High School in Massachusetts in 1913 and from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1917. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Signal Officer Reserve Corps and attended the School of Military Aeronautics with the Royal Flying Corps in Canada from September to November 1917. Brooks then trained with the Texas 139th Aero Squadron from November 1917 to February 1918. In March 1918, Brooks was transferred to France with the 139th Aero Squadron, where he flew the SPAD S.VII and shot down his first enemy aircraft on 29 July 1918. Afterwards he was transferred to the newly formed 22nd Aero Squadron to help lead the unit's new pilots into combat. After his third victory he became a flight commander of the 22nd Aero Squadron flying the SPAD XIII C.1. His combat actions earned him a recommendation for the Medal of Honor. The U.S. Army, upon review of the action awarded him the Distinguished Service Cross. Brooks' final SPAD, Smith IV, resides in the aircraft collection of the National Air and Space Museum Ray Brooks was one of the pilots featured in the series Dogfights presented by The History Channel. Season 2, Episode 7 titled \\"The First Dogfighters\\" depicts Brooks' solo dogfight against eight German Fokker D.VII aircraft on September 14, 1918. During the aerial m√™l√©e he shot down four Fokkers, though U.S. Army records only credited him with two. During this combat his wingman 1Lt. Philip Edward Hassinger was attacked and to this day is still listed as Missing In Action (MIA). Hassinger was credited with shooting down two German Fokkers before he went missing. Brooks was finally able to escape the last four pursuing enemy aircraft by using his superior diving speed. Brooks is the subject of a 1963 book entitled Capt. Arthur Ray Brooks: America's quiet ace of W.W.I by Walter A Musciano. He is also the subject of the painting Last Victory by noted aviation artist Roy Grinnell. Brooks returned to the United States in July 1919 and was stationed at Kelly Field, Texas, where he was promoted to Captain and assigned as the commander of the 1st Pursuit Group. He was subsequently assigned to the Air Service Field Officer's School, Langley Field, Virginia. He resigned from the army and received an Honorable Discharge in December 1922. After World War I As a civilian, Brooks established Florida Airways Corporation, which eventually became Eastern Airlines. He was also involved in the Contract Air Mail Route No. 10, and worked for the U.S. Department of Commerce, Aeronautics Branch where he was responsible for surveying what would become the nation's first air routes. He also supervised the first installations of radiobeacons to aid airmail pilots navigating between New York and Washington, D.C. He joined Bell Telephone Laboratories (1928), where he supervised air operations and the testing of electronic aids for air navigation and communications. He was responsible for the development of air- to-ground communications systems. He retired from Bell Labs as its Chief Pilot in 1960. He was also involved in numerous early flying clubs which were forming to encourage participation in aviation for both personal/pleasure and commercial purposes. Circa 1985, Mr. Brooks (age 90 at the time), was visiting the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum's restoration facility in Silver Hill, Maryland with a family member. Upon entering a storage hangar as part of the tour, he spotted a tattered World War I vintage SPAD XIII airplane, the type he flew during the war. As he drew nearer the aircraft, he was astonished to discover it was his very aircraft. He climbed into the cockpit and was immediately approached by a restoration technician who advised him in a very stern manner that these aircraft are delicate pieces of American history and visitors are not permitted to touch, much less sit in them. When Mr. Brooks explained that this was his airplane, the technician‚Äôs first thought was of a doddering old veteran, longing for the real or imagined glory days of yesteryear. While Mr. Brooks' speech and external mannerisms were befitting of a nonagenarian, his mind was as sharp as it was 30 or 40 years past. He spoke to the technician as if reading from a history book about the last time this aircraft was in action over France. Included in the lesson was the name and serial number of the plane, which was not readily visible. The technician was aware of the aircraft's history and asked the old gentleman to stay right where he was while he summoned the NASM curator emeritus, Paul E. Garber. Less than two years after this meeting, Ray Brooks' fully restored SPAD Smith IV was unveiled with great fanfare at the National Air and Space Museum's 'Great War in the Air' exhibit (Gallery 206). Mr. Brooks was in attendance as a guest of honor at the ribbon cutting ceremony and treated those present to a first-person history of several World War I missions in which he participated. Brooks remained involved with aviation for the remainder of his life. Even in his nineties, he enjoyed flying all sorts of aircraft, including ultralights, gliders and hot-air balloons. He belonged to many aviation-related and professional associations and organizations including the American Legion, Military Order of the World Wars, Combat Pilots Association, Order of Daedalians, Air Force Association, OX-5 Aviation Pioneers Association, Telephone Pioneers of America, Cross and Cockade, Associate Fellow of the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics, Quiet Birdmen, World War I Overseas Flyers and the American Fighter Aces Association. Brooks also remained involved with the alumni affairs of his alma mater‚ÄîMIT. He attended numerous air shows and reunions, including the sixty- fifth, and final reunion, held for the Lafayette Flying Corps at Peterson AFB, Colorado in 1983. In 1980, he was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame of New Jersey. An extensive collection of his diaries, correspondence and other papers is maintained by the National Aviation and Space Museum. These papers relate to his military career with the U.S. Army Air Service (1917‚Äì22), his years in both civilian government service and the private sector (1923‚Äì60), as well as a lifetime's involvement in numerous military, academic, aeronautical and professional associations and organizations. Additionally, there are examples of correspondence and autographed photographs from such aerospace notables as Eddie Rickenbacker, Jimmy Doolittle, Billy Mitchell, Clayton Bissell, Reed Chambers and Michael Collins. Brooks died at age 95 on July 17, 1991 at his home in Summit, New Jersey. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving American World War I ace who served in a U.S. Squadron. He is buried in a family plot in North Framingham, Massachusetts.via Associated press. \\"Arthur Brooks, Last American World War I Fighter-Pilot Ace\\", The Seattle Times, July 20, 1991.

These landforms include numerous glacial erratics and haystack rocks that occur near and on the Withrow Moraine, which is the terminal moraine of the Okanogan ice lobe.Bjornstad, B., and Kiver, E., 2012, On the Trail of the Ice Age Floods: The Northern Reaches: A geological field guide to northern Idaho and the Channeled Scabland. Keokee Books, Sandpoint, Idaho. 480 pp. Geomorphology Boulder Park is located on the Waterville Plateau of the Columbia Plateau in north central Washington state in the United States. It is a broad, dish-shaped upland basin that overall dips gently northward. The Waterville Plateau extends east from Columbia River to the Grand Coulee. This plateau is underlain by Columbia River Basalt that is covered by a discontinuous blanket of 14,000 to 20,000 year-old glacial deposits. This park lies about northeast and north of the arcuate ridge of the Withrow Moraine. It marks the southern, 17,000 year-old terminus of the Okanogan ice lobe and southern margin of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. Boulder Park and adjacent areas is covered by a discontinuous blanket of gravelly, sandy loam glacial till. These glacial deposits overlie and partially to completely fill Moses Coulee, a paleochannel cut by a pre-Wisconsin, megaflloods that predate the Last Glacial Maximum. It was cut by older Spokane Floods at a time prior to when the Okanogan ice lobe partially covered the Waterville Plateau during most of the last of the Last Glacial Maximum. At its maximum extent, this ice lobe was up to thick and wide. It effectively blocked most of the Columbia River Valley and created Glacial Lake Columbia.Gulick, C.W., and M.A. Korosec (1990) Geologic map of the Banks Lake 1:100,000 quadrangle, Washington.

Field Guide 4, Boulder, Colorado, Geological Society of America. p. 137-157 The boulders for which this National Natural Landmark is named, consist of glacial erratics and boulders known locally as haystack rocks that were transported southward by the Okanogan ice lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet. The glacial erratics consist largely of granodiorite and gneiss that were transported southward. Haystack rocks consist of locally derived basaltic boulders. Because haystack rocks are identical to the local bedrock, they by definition cannot be classified as glacial erratics. Haystack rocks are blocks of basalt ripped from the entablature of the Columbia River Basalt Group by glacial ice of the Okanogan ice lobe. Preferential weathering along the joints of the entablature results in piles of talus, which together with the weathered erratics, that from a distance look like black haystacks. Some haystack rocks, e.g. Yeager Rock, are the size of large houses. The boulders provide important evidence for glacial erosion and transport, as well as marking the direction of movement and the terminus of the Okanogan ice lobe and the southern margin of the Cordilleran ice sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum.Cheney, E.S.

Seattle, Washington, Northwest Geological Society. 44 p. Underlying the glacial deposits of the Okanogan ice lobe and outcropping, where it is absent, is the middle Miocene, Priest Rapids Member of the Wanapum Basalt. Within the area of this park, it consists of grayish-black, fine- to coarse-grained basalt lava flows that contain scattered, fine-grained phenocrysts of either plagioclase or plagioclase and olivine. The Wanapum Basalt is part of the late Miocene and early Pliocene Columbia River Basalt Group. This group covers parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in the United States of America. It forms a large igneous province that covers an area of 163,700 km2 (63,000 mile2) of the Pacific Northwest with an estimated volume of 174,300 km3 of basalt lava and other volcanics. Eruptions were most vigorous between 17 and 14 million years ago, when over 99% of the basalt was released. Less extensive eruptions continued between 14 and 6 million years ago.

Irishtown Nature Park is a large urban park located on the northern edge of Moncton within the city of Moncton, New Brunswick (Tankville). At 9 km2 it is one of the largest urban parks in Canada.  Sport and recreation  The park has a large (1.20 km2) lake which is popular for kayaking and canoeing. The park is also used for hiking, mountain biking and snowshoeing in the winter. There are several historic displays within the park including a small museum consisting of a fully restored one-room school. There is also a set of signs relating to the parks history as the city of Monctons first water supply dating back to the mid 19th century. Birdwatching is popular in the park due to the wide variety of birds which reside in the park including: * Black-capped chickadees * Nuthatches * Yellow-finches * Purple finches * Hairy woodpeckers * Downy woodpeckers * Doves  Access and trails  The multi use trails can be accessed from multiple entry points such as the main parking lot at 1155 Elmwood Drive, Caledonia parking lot at 595 Caledonia Road or at the Gerdhart trail entrance across from Cedarwood avenue. These trails are surfaced with compacted gravel which makes it accessible for all to walk, bike, or run and are cleared and sanded in the winter for walking. This multiuse trail is used by walkers, runners, wheel chairs, bikers and hikers. The footpaths (5.8 km) can be accessed from the surfaced trails. These trails are more natural trails made for the adventurer. They mostly run along the lake with sections where it is wet have been surfaced with wood chips or boardwalks for easier access.

It was occupied in 1999 and provided a range of mostly free activities for local people until its eviction in 2009 by Southwark Council.  Occupation  The Spike Surplus Scheme was established in 1999 when a fly-tipped, vandalised site at 39b Consort Road in the London Borough of Southwark was squatted. The building had in the past been a doss-house or \\"spike\\" (a shelter of last resort) serving the unemployed, homeless, and urban poor for over a century. At the time of the occupation, the exterior grounds had been used for fly-tipping. On arrival, the members of the scheme immediately cleared them using a JCB digger.  Activities  The social centre provided rehearsal/recording facilities, health/martial arts space and a community garden. Running on a \\"do it yourself\\" and free-where-possible or donations level, the facilities were used by a wide variety of local people. Other users were community garden permaculture groups, martial arts, and various alternative therapy groups. Alongside other squatted projects such as 121 Centre, 491 Gallery, 56a Infoshop and RampART, the Spike developed into an alternative institution promoting social movements and local initiatives.  Eviction  Having established a peppercorn rent contract, Southwark Council decided not to renew the contract in 2008, giving the centre until September 26 to raise ¬£440,000 to buy the plot. Despite various fundraising drives, including selling 'Peckham diamonds' which were bits of glass from broken car windows filed down and sold in plastic wallets, the centre was unable to buy the site. In December 2008, the council gave notice of eviction, saying they would give two weeks' notice of the actual date. The centre was then evicted without notice on February 12, 2009. People were forced to negotiate with bailiffs to regain musical equipment.

The squadron flies the Northrop Grumman E-8C JSTARS, providing airborne battle management, command and control, surveillance, and target acquisition. Mission The 16th Squadron operates the Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System), an advanced ground surveillance and battle management system. J-STARS detects, locates, classifies, tracks and targets ground movements on the battlefield, communicating real-time information through secure data links with combat command posts. HistoryWorld War II= The squadron was first activated as the 380th Fighter Squadron, part of IV Fighter Command in early 1943. It engaged in the air defense of the San Francisco area as well as acting as a Replacement Training Unit until the end of 1943. It trained as a North American P-51 Mustang operational squadron before deploying to the European Theater of Operations. In Europe it became part of IX Fighter Command in England. Operated both as a tactical fighter squadron, providing air support to Allied ground forces in France as well as an air defense squadron, attacking enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat over Europe. 380th Fighter Squadron P-51 at Azeville Airfield The squadron was converted to a tactical reconnaissance squadron in August 1944, when it was redesignated the 160th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. It engaged in hazardous reconnaissance flights over enemy-controlled territory unarmed, gathering intelligence for Allied commanders until the end of combat in Europe, May 1945. The unit advanced eastward across France using advanced landing grounds, then into the Low Countries and Occupied Germany. The squadron remained in Germany as part of the occupation forces, returning to Langley Field, Virginia in June 1947. The unit remained assigned to Tactical Air Command as a reconnaissance squadron. The squadron was inactivated in 1949. =Cold War= In 1950 the squadron was activated once again at Langley, now designated the 16th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron.The renumbering was required because the numbers 101‚Äì300 were reserved for Air National Guard units (now 101‚Äì299). AF Instruction 38-101, para. 5.3.4. When the squadron was allotted to the Air National Guard in 2002, it retained its number outside this block of numbers. It moved to Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina in 1958 where it re-equipped with McDonnell RF-101C Voodoo reconnaissance aircraft. The squadron deployed to south Florida in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, flying hazardous overflights over Cuba gathering intelligence photos. The unit upgraded to the McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom II in 1965. It also operated a flight of Martin EB-57E Canberra electronic warfare aircraft. It added Douglas EB-66 Destroyer jamming aircraft beginning in 1971 as part of the phaseout of the Destroyer at Shaw. It was the last USAF active duty B-57 squadron, retiring the aircraft in 1976 when F-4G Phantom IIs took over its mission. RF-4C Phantom II of the 16th Tactical Reconnaissance SquadronAircraft is McDonnell RF-4C-34-MC Phantom II, serial 67-436. Note the NATO European camouflage schema, \\"SW\\" tail code and low visibility USAF markings. This was one of the last RF-4Cs flown by the 363d Wing before their retirement in 1989. The 16th remained the single RF-4C squadron at Shaw after the 1982 realignment of its parent 363d from a tactical reconnaissance to tactical fighter wing. It continued reconnaissance training in the United States until 1989 when the RF-4Cs were transferred to 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas, and the squadron was inactivated. =Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System= The squadron was reactivated as the 16th Airborne Command and Control Squadron in 1996 at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia as an E-8 J-STARS squadron. In 2002, the J-Stars mission was transferred to the Georgia Air National Guard and the 116th Air Control Wing and the squadron became a Guard unit. Ten years later the mission returned to the regular Air Force, with Georgia Air National Guard associate units joining the mission.

Wolfgang Schreyer (20 November 1927 - 14 November 2017) was a German writer of fiction, historic adventures mixed with documentary, science fiction for TV shows and movies and is best known as the author of over 20 adventure stories. Life Wolfgang Schreyer was born the son of a pharmacist. On leaving secondary school he was conscripted as a Flakhelfer before, in April 1944, he joined the Nazi Party and served in the Wehrmacht. He became a POW and was released by the Americans in 1946. From 1947 until 1949 he was a chemists' apprentice, working in that profession until 1950. From 1950 to 1952 he was the manager of a pharmaceutical company in the German Democratic Republic. Since the publication of his first crime novel, \\"Gro√ügarage S√ºdwest\\" he worked as a freelance author. He travelled several times to the Caribbean and to the United States. Since 1958, the GDR's Staatssicherheitsdienst (Stasi) kept him under special surveillance. Until 1972 Schreyer lived in Magdeburg; since then he lived in Ahrenshoop on the coast of the Baltic Sea. Schreyer was the author of numerous novels, which are mainly considered entertainment, containing some criticism of society. Most successful were the stories set in Central America and the Caribbean, in which he skillfully mixed fiction and documentary. Other works are crime stories, a science-fiction story, film scripts, TV and radio drama.

The original hotel covered the western half of the block, facing Mellon Square. =Ownership history= The hotel was bought from its original owners, the Pittsburgh Hotel Company, in 1928 by the Eppley Hotel Company. Eugene Eppley financed a major expansion in 1929, filling the remaining eastern half of the block, that made the William Penn the second largest hotel in the world. The expansion brought the number of rooms to 1600 and included a ballroom atop the hotel conceived by noted designer Joseph Urban. However Eppley lost control of the hotel during the Great DepressionLee, M. (1991) \\"A Grande Dame Named William Penn,\\" Pennsylvania Heritage Magazine. Spring 1991. and the new owners brought in Statler Hotels, which managed the hotel from 1940-1951. Eppley regained controlling interest between 1950-1954, assuming management of the hotel back from Statler on January 1, 1952. The hotel's sale on June 4, 1956 from the Eppley Hotel Company to the Sheraton Corporation was part of the second largest hotel sale in United States history.\\"Closing the gap,\\" Time magazine June 4, 1956.

Sheraton sold the hotel on May 22, 1968 to Nomarl, a group of local investors, for $7.75 million and the William Penn returned to its original name. With less demand for hotels in the city, Nomarl reduced the number of rooms from 1300 to 900, with the unused rooms turned to dorms for Duquesne University. Nomarl, in turn, sold the hotel to Alcoa in 1971. In 1984, Alcoa brought in Westin Hotels to manage the hotel, which became the Westin William Penn, following $20 million in renovations which reduced the hotel from 840 to 650 rooms within the enormous building.

Before joining Northwestern in 1985, he taught for four years at Munich University and for thirteen years at Boston University. After retiring from Northwestern in 2006, he served for three years as William H. Orrick Visiting Professor at Yale University. Over the course of his academic career, McCarthy's work was supported by grants and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Guggenheim Foundation. Early in his career he wrote and taught principally in the philosophy of logic and mathematics and then in the philosophy of the social sciences. Subsequently, and for the bulk of his career, he worked in the general area of critical social and political theory, and in particular on the work of J√ºrgen Habermas, of which he is widely regarded as one of the foremost English-language interpreters. During his last decade of teaching, McCarthy focused on theoretical issues in the history of racist and imperialist thought, and particularly on their interweaving in theories of progress and development. Critical theory The phrases \\"critical theory\\" and \\"Frankfurt School\\" are commonly used to refer to a tradition of philosophy and social theory that emerged in Germany between the World Wars in response to what were perceived to be deep flaws in modern Western culture and society. Centered in Frankfurt, its first generation of thinkers included such figures as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, and Walter Benjamin; the preeminent representative of the second, post-World War II generation was J√ºrgen Habermas, who began his academic career as Adorno's assistant. The third generation of critical theorists, to which McCarthy belongs, was from the start rather more international in its makeup, and more global in its outlook. McCarthy's contribution to this tradition of thought comprises, first, further development of its philosophical and methodological underpinnings, particularly on issues surrounding the putative universality of modern Western ideas, practices, and institutions; second, interpretation and elaboration of Habermas's ideas that brought them into closer contact with Anglo-American traditions of philosophy and social theory, especially American Pragmatism; and third, application of the critical-theoretical perspective so developed to issues of racism and imperialism, which had been relatively undertheorized in the work of the first two generations. These contributions, together with his general editorship of the series \\"Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought\\" (MIT Press, c. 100 volumes), and his graduate training of some two dozen members of the fourth generation of critical theorists, are the grounds upon which McCarthy is generally held to be a founding member of the American branch of critical social and political theory. Race and empire In the first decade of the present millennium, in a series of articles and papers that culminated in a book on Race, Empire, and the Idea of Human Development (Cambridge UP, 2009), McCarthy turned his attention to the ideologies of race and empire that generally accompanied the rise of the West, and to the particular versions thereof that were integral to shaping American culture and society. His organizing theme is that ideas of sociocultural development‚Äîcivilization, progress, modernization, etc. -- have been the principal lens through which the relations of the West to the rest of the world have been viewed. Through that lens differences have appeared to be hierarchically ordered along various lines, from talent and temperament to morals and aptitude for self-government. McCarthy develops this theme by examining both racial theories of difference‚Äîfrom Kant, through social Darwinism, to the cultural racism of the present‚Äîand universal histories of cultural development that underwrote imperialism and neoimperialism. He concludes that despite the depredations and dangers of ideologies of progress, we have no alternative in a rapidly globalizing world but to rethink our conceptions of development so as to accommodate the multiple modernities now taking shape, without however, renouncing the aspiration to unity-in- difference for which there is no sensible substitute.

Military career Fraser was the second son of William Fraser of Park, near Fraserburgh (a kinsman of George Fraser, 15th Lord Saltoun), and his wife, Katherine n√©e Kinellar. On 29 September 1778, Fraser was appointed a lieutenant in the 73rd Highlanders, afterwards the 71st Highland Light Infantry. He was later on board Rodney's fleet with a second battalion (afterwards disbanded) of this regiment during the actions with the Spanish Caraccas fleet under Juan de L√°ngara and at the relief of Gibraltar. He served at the defence of Gibraltar in 1780‚Äì82, until the loss of his right leg, his second wound during the defence, compelled him to return home. Fraser was captain of a garrison invalid company at Hull in 1785‚Äì93, and at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, raised men for an independent company. He became a major on 28 August 1794, and a lieutenant colonel, royal garrison battalion, on 1 September 1795. He served at Gibraltar in 1796‚Äì8, part of the time as acting judge advocate and civil judge. On 1 January 1800 he was appointed colonel of the Royal African Corps, composed of military offenders from various regiments pardoned on condition of life-service in Africa and the West Indies. With this corps, he served on the west coast of Africa in 1801‚Äì4, and made a brave but unsuccessful defence of Gor√©e in Senegal, against a superior French force from Cayenne. Gor√©e was compelled to surrender on 18 January 1804, but not before the enemy's loss exceeded the total strength of the defenders at the outset. After his exchange, Fraser was appointed to command an expedition against Senegal, which never started. He became a major general in 1808, served in Guernsey in 1808‚Äì9, and in the latter year he was appointed to the staff at Gibraltar. Fraser commanded that garrison until the arrival of General Campbell. He was then sent to negotiate for the admission of British troops into the Spanish fortress of Ceuta (on the Moroccan coast opposite Gibraltar); afterwards he commanded the British garrison there until his return to England on promotion to lieutenant general in 1813. In 1809, in recognition of its distinguished conduct in the West Indies, the Royal African Corps was reorganised as the Royal York Rangers, another Royal African Corps being formed in its place. Fraser retained the colonelcy of the rangers until the regiment was disbanded after the peace. From 1815 to 1819 he lived at what was later known as Bedford Lodge on Campden Hill in Kensington, until the 6th Duke of Bedford took over the lease. He then lived at Niddry Lodge in Kensington from 1831 to 1843. He was made Lieutenant-Governor of Chester Castle in 1828, GCH in 1832, and was a member of the consolidated board of general officers. He became a general in 1838. Fraser married, first, on 15 April 1790, Everilda, daughter of James Hamer of Hamer Hall, Lancashire, and they had one son and two daughters, one of whom, Everilda (d. November 1840), married General Francis Rawdon Chesney (1789‚Äì1872). His second marriage, about three years before his death, was to Miss A'Court. Fraser was described by his kinsman, Lord Saltoun, as a brave, chivalrous, upright old soldier. He died at Campden Hill, Kensington, London, on 14 November 1843 and was buried at St Barnabas' Church, West Kensington, London.

There is a baroque church of St. Peter and St. Paul, and ruins of a gothic stronghold Hr√°dek below the village.  History  Tasov was founded in the 12th century. First written note is from the year 1233, when the owner of Tasov became Z√°vi≈° z Tasova. In 1234 Tasov changes hands and is owned by Mladota. The village Tasov quickly became a major religious centre serving parishes in nearby villages of Doln√≠ Bory, Mosti≈°tƒõ Zho≈ô, Vicenice, N√°mƒõ≈°t, B≈ôezn√≠k, Kralice, Hartvikovice, Konƒõ≈°√≠n, Zvole, Nov√© Vesel√≠, Svratka, Radost√≠n. In 1237 Tasov moves into the hands of Bohu≈° z Tasova and in 1281 is transferred to Vznata, whose son Jan becomes a bishop in Olomouc. In 1356 becomes the property of Tas and in 1390 is owned by Jan Tas who in the same year sold parts to Sezam. Family Rohovsky becomes a prominent family in Tasov where they stayed until the middle of 20th century, at which time they are forcefully moved out by the communist government. Jan Tas builds a castle nearby called Castle Dub. Between the years of 1573 and 1644 is Tasov owned by V√°clav Berka from Dub√©, husband of Alena Mezi≈ô√≠ƒçsk√° from Lomnice. In 1644 Tasov is inherited by the family F√ºrstenberk that greatly architecturally improved Tasov and neighboring town Budi≈°ov. The fire department is founded in 1885. The year 1923 marks the finishing of the community house. The architect responsible for the community house and also house of Jakub Deml is Bohumil Fuchs, later named the national artist. Public transport starts its service in Tasov in 1927. Electricity is brought in during the years 1928-1929. 1966 is the year when television was brought to Tasov. A new school building was finished after the fall of communism in the year of 1996.  Jakub Deml  Jakub Deml, one of the best Czech poets of the 20th century, was born in Tasov. Since 1922, he lived there permanently in a little \\"villa\\", the first completed building designed by the architect Bohumil Fuchs.Deml's villa The building was subsidised by the government and also by Otokar B≈ôezina, Pavla Kytlicov√° and T. G. Masaryk. Deml wrote the official chronicle of Tasov until 1929 when the local council forced him to stop and found another author, following a trial accusing Deml of offending the republic and the nation.Jakub Deml Deml often wrote about Tasov (the village is sometimes used in a book's title too, such as Pozdrav Tasova (Tasov's Greeting);Pozdrav Tasova also one of the posthumous compilations of his works is called simply Tasov) - and made it immortal by his genius.

Biography David M. Furches was born in Davie County, North Carolina in 1832. He read law under Chief Justice Richmond M. Pearson at the Richmond Hill Law School and served in the state constitutional convention in 1865, representing Davie County. Furches practiced law in Davie and later Iredell County, North Carolina and became a prominent member of the North Carolina Republican Party. In 1875, he was appointed a state superior court judge, a position he held until 1879. He lost two races for the United States House of Representatives, one in 1872 and the other in 1880, and was his party's nominee for Governor of North Carolina in 1892, losing to Elias Carr. In 1894, Furches was elected to the state Supreme Court. In 1900 the justices, by a vote of four to one, declared unconstitutional important legislation enacted by the North Carolina General Assembly of 1899-1900, which was controlled by Democrats. When Chief Justice William T. Faircloth died in December 1900, fellow Republican Gov. Daniel L. Russell appointed Furches to the post. He married twice, to Eliza Bingham and Lula Corpening.

Bishul versus cooking One of the 39 prohibited activities on the Sabbath is bishul (), or \\"cooking.\\" However, bishul is not an exact equivalent of \\"cooking.\\" The Hebrew term bishul as it relates to Shabbat is the \\"use of heat to alter the quality of an item,\\"Igrot Moshe Orach Chaim 2:85 and this applies whether the heat is applied through baking, boiling, frying, roasting and most other types of cooking.Bavli Shabbat 40aTalmud Yerushalmi Shabbat 87:2 The prohibition of bishul applies to all types of food and drink, even to foods and drinks which are edible when raw or cold.Although Maimonides classifies the cooking foods that are edible when raw as rabbinically prohibited, the Birchei Yosef is in doubt whether this is biblically or rabbinically prohibited Heat sources  The prohibited activity of bishul is separate and distinct from that of havarah (◊î◊ë◊¢◊®◊î, \\"kindling a fire\\"). Performing bishul with a pre-existing flame is forbidden on Shabbat The prohibition of bishul, however, is not limited to the use of fire as a heat source; it is forbidden to perform bishul with any source of heat, whether it be an actual flame, or an electric stove/range, a hot plate, an urnBeit Yitzchak Yoreh De'ah 120Maharam 2:246 or a microwave oven.Igrot Moshe Orach Chaim 3:52 Moreover, placing food into a kli rishon may constitute bishul in certain instances. However using heat from the sun to cook is allowed on shabbat. (talmud shabbat 39a) Reheating foods While it is prohibited in most instances to initially heat a food item to the temperature of yad soledes bo, foods that have already been fully cooked may sometimes be reheated. In terms of reheating, a distinction is made between dry foods and liquids. Dry food that has been completely cooked is no longer subject to the prohibition of bishul; this is based on the principle of ain bishul achar bishul (◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊ë◊ô◊©◊ï◊ú ◊ê◊ó◊® ◊ë◊ô◊©◊ï◊ú, \\"Cooking does not take effect after cooking\\"). Thus, a completely cooked, dry food item, such as a piece of chicken or potato kugel, may be reheated once it has been fully cooked. However, there is a great dispute as to whether this rule applies to liquids: Maimonides,Hilchot Shabbat 3:3 the Rashba and the Ran assert that liquids are in fact no different from solid dry foods, whereas Rashi,Bavli Shabbat 18 the RoshShabbat chapter 3 and Rabbeinu Yonahas quoted by the Ran in Shabbat chapter 4 assert that this rule does not apply and reheating of liquids is forbidden, applying the principle of yeish bishul achar bishul (◊ô◊© ◊ë◊ô◊©◊ï◊ú ◊ê◊ó◊® ◊ë◊ô◊©◊ï◊ú, \\"Cooking does take effect after cooking\\") to liquids. This prohibition of reheating liquids only applies when the liquid has completely cooled. If the liquid has only partially cooled and still retains enough heat to be enjoyed as the warm liquid as it was intended to be,Shulchan Aruch HaRav 69 it may be reheated. Kli rishon, literally the first utensil, refers to a utensil that is used for cooking, baking or roasting food or liquid, and contains that hot food or liquid. When hot food or liquid is transferred from the kli rishon into a second utensil, this utensil is called a kli sheni. A kli shlishi is the third utensil into which hot food or liquid is transferred. The idea of Kli shlishi being less stringent than a Kli Sheni is not clear in the talmud or rishonim. All vessels that are no longer a Kli Rishon have the status of kli sheni as the status of a kli sheni is based on the fact that the heat is generated by the liquid within the vessel rather than by the walls of the vessel. In that regard Kli sheni and Kli shlishi etc. are exactly the same . Hot beverages  The problem of preparing hot beverages on Shabbat revolves around the temperature of the water. If the water is hot enough to cook the tea leaves, it would constitute malacha. Pouring straight from an urn (also considered a klei rishon) would cause the cooking of the substance. For a solid substance the outer and concrete layer will definitely be cooked (bishul kdai klipah), which would be malacha. For a liquid there is no concrete layer, and therefore no specific part that is being cooked. Therefore, it is ruled that a liquid is not considered cooked if it is not yad soledet bo or . A kos sheini can be used to bypass this problem. Using a Kos sheini is acceptable because when the liquid is poured (Erui kos sheini) some of the heat is transferred into the atmosphere, and therefore the liquid loses some heat. Most people hold that this will not cause enough heat to be emitted and therefore the tea leaves will still be cooked. To lower the temperature of the water further people rule that a klei shlishi must be used. Once again in the pouring process (erui klei sheini) more heat is emitted and therefore some people hold that the tea will not be cooked and it is therefore permissible to make tea with this water.39 Melachot by Rabbi Dovid Ribiat, http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/ostroff/archives/shabbos5_4.htm, http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-cooking-on-shabbos/02.htm, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsCLWPztCQY However, many other authorities hold that tea leaves fall under the category of items which cook easily (kalei habishul), even in the diminished heat of a kos shelishi. Consequently, those who are most scrupulous in their observance will prepare a concentrated tea extract before the Sabbath; as a liquid, water from a kos sheini can be added to the extract to heat it. Fire safety In 2015, a house fire killed seven children in Brooklyn, New York. The 2015 fire was preceded by at least four other Shabbat fires in Brooklyn in the past 15 years caused by appliances for heating food being left on or candles burning during the Jewish Sabbath in order to comply with Orthodox interpretation of Jewish Law. In 2005, three children died in a fire in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, caused when stove burners were left on during Passover. After the 2015 fire, the New York City Fire Department distributed a pamphlet titled \\"Fire Safety for Jewish Observances\\" to nearby homes. In response to the fire, many Jews in Brooklyn purchased smoke detectors before the following Sabbath.

The Bow and Bromley by-election was a by-election held on 26 November 1912 for the British House of Commons constituency of Bow and Bromley. It was triggered when the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP), George Lansbury, accepted the post of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds as a technical measure enabling him to leave Parliament. Background Bow and Bromley was a marginal constituency. It had been held by the Liberal Party from 1906 until 1910 and by the Conservative Party from 1895 until 1906 and during 1910. At the general election of December 1910, Lansbury had gained the seat for Labour with a majority of 11.1%. Lansbury had become a strong supporter of women's suffrage. Unusually among male politicians of the time, he supported the actions of militant suffragettes such as the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).John Shepherd, A Life on the Left : George Lansbury (1859‚Äî1940) : a Case Study in Recent Labour Biography While support for women's suffrage was official Labour policy, Lansbury felt that this support was lukewarm, and so in October 1912 he travelled to Boulogne-sur-Mer with Emmeline Pankhurst, where he met WSPU leader Christabel Pankhurst.George Dangerfield, The Strange Death of Liberal England Campaign Lansbury decided to resign his seat and contest the resulting by-election on a platform of \\"Votes for Women\\". He was unable to gain official Labour Party support, and instead ran as the \\"Women's Suffrage and Socialist\\" candidate.John Shepherd, George Lansbury: At the Heart of Old Labour He was supported by his Constituency Labour Party (CLP), including J. H. Banks and Edgar Lansbury, by some prominent Labour figures including Keir Hardie and Philip Snowden, by Liberal Party MP Josiah Wedgwood and by journalist H. N. Brailsford. Millicent Fawcett, leader of the WSPU's rival the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies also campaigned for Lansbury. The WSPU were very active in supporting Lansbury in the by-election, but some tensions arose between them and the CLP. The WSPU were adamant that their campaign would not be controlled by a male-led organisation, while the local activists regarded them as outsiders. This in particular created problems on polling day, when WSPU cars were not made available to carry people to vote. Sylvia Pankhurst's branch of the WSPU was on the same road as Lansbury's campaign headquarters. She supported his campaign, but was critical of him for standing prematurely, against counsel from the labour movement, and for prioritising women's suffrage above all other issues.Mary Davis, Sylvia Pankhurst: A Life in Radical Politics Lansbury's manifesto did include other measures, including opposition to the National Insurance Bill and an explanation of his differences with the Labour leadership. The campaign was widely covered by the official Labour newspaper the Daily Citizen and strongly supported by Lansbury's own recently launched paper the Daily Herald. The Liberal Party's leadership opposed the militant activities of the WSPU by imprisoning its members. When some suffragettes went on hunger strike, it authorised force feeding. Lansbury strongly disagreed with this, and in Parliament in the summer of 1912, he told H. H. Asquith, the Liberal Prime Minister \\"You will go down in history as the man who tortured innocent women. You ought to be driven from public life.\\"Roger Fulford, Votes for Women (p. 274) Despite this, the Liberals did not stand a candidate in the by-election. The Labour Party also declined to stand an official candidate, so Lansbury's only opponent was Reginald Blair of the Conservative Party. Blair was supported by the Primrose League and the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage and campaigned under slogans including \\"Women Do Not Want Votes\\". Result Blair took the seat from Lansbury with a majority of over 700 votes. Lansbury believed that his resignation had permanently alienated some of his constituents, and subsequently declared \\"Never Resign!\\" Aftermath The Bow & Bromley Independent Labour Party disintegrated.Socialists, Liberals and Labour. The Struggle for London, 1885‚Äì1914 by Paul Thomson. (London, 1967), pp. 229‚Äì30). Reginald Blair entered parliament to speak and vote on a number of issues, including voting against granting the vote to women in 1917. He held the seat until 1922, when Lansbury retook it. Lansbury meanwhile promoted socialism in the Daily Herald and led the Poplar Rates Rebellion of 1921. The WSPU moved away from Lansbury and became increasingly anti- socialist, while this was a decisive point in Sylvia Pankhurst's split from her family towards communism. The following year, her section of the WSPU became the East London Federation of Suffragettes.

As well as teaching, the College's aims were/are to preserve the heritage of the bagpipe by collecting piping artefacts, manuscripts and memorabilia and by providing a focal point for pipers the world over. College lessons are subsidised by profits from the College Shop which sells instruments, music, Highland wear and bagpipe accessories. A charity, the College often teaches students of low means for free. The College of Piping Tutor Book 1, by the then Joint Principals Seumas MacNeill and Thomas Pearston, was first issued in 1952, and is easily the biggest selling book on the bagpipe ever issued, selling to date (2011) 400,000 copies. This book is also available in Scottish Gaelic, French, German and Italian. In 2008 it became available in digital format and in 2011 available on iPad and iPhone. Since 1948 the College of Piping has published the Piping Times monthly magazine, once described by Captain John MacLellan, former Director of the Army School of Piping at Edinburgh Castle, as the biggest single repository of bagpipe knowledge in the world. The magazine has a current worldwide readership estimated in 2011 at 10,000. That same year it became available on iPhone and iPad having previously been available in digital format since 2008. The PT as it is affectionately known adheres to the highest standards of journalism and is often provocative and fearless in its criticism of what it sees as contrary to the interests of pipers and pipe bands. In 2005 it campaigned successfully to have the World Pipe Band Championships televised by the BBC and three years later fought to save one of the leading pipe bands in the country, the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band, from budget cuts imposed by a new Chief Constable. The College pioneered outreach teaching of the bagpipe when, in the early 1950s, Seumas MacNeill established schools of piping in North America. This undoubtedly led to an upsurge of interest in Scottish bagpiping on that continent and in no small way contributed to the high standard of piping in Canada and the United States currently enjoyed there. In 2007 the College established the first outreach teaching school on the European mainland when it launched its Winter School in Germany in association with the Pipers Corner shop at Br√ºggen. This school has since relocated to Homburg in Saarland. The College has two annual school in the US in California and New England in June and July each year. The College of Piping is a registered charity in the United Kingdom. In March 2018 The National Piping Centre took over The College of Piping which then ceased to exist. The premises at Otago Street are used by the National Piping Centre for teaching, competition and recital and is known as 'The National Piping Centre Otago Street, Formerly known as The College of Piping.'

This may occur no earlier than when three \\"small\\" stars appear in the sky.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim There are varying opinions as to how much time elapses following sunset until this occurs. This difference of opinions results in different ways to predetermine the fixed time when the Shabbat will end on a given Saturday night. The time varies, depending on one's geographic location and the time of year. Regardless of location, the time that Shabbat ends, which is approximately one hour later than the time for candle lighting the day before, fluctuates approximately four hours throughout the calendar year and by up to 17 minutes from one week to the next (or by more than an hour if the time has changed during the previous week). There are three ways one can declare the end of Shabbat in order to be allowed to resume activities forbidden during Shabbat: #Reciting Ata Honantanu: This special paragraph is added to the Amidah during Maariv on Saturday evening, and is generally recited by men to end Shabbat #Reciting Baruch Hamavdil: The verse \\"Baruch Hamavdil Bein Kodesh LeHol\\" is generally recited by women, who traditionally do not recite the Maariv prayer #Havdalah: Havdalah is a required ritual on Motza'ei Shabbat. Reciting or listening to Havdalah defines the end of Shabbat. But one who lights the Havdalah candle or else wishes to perform any activity otherwise prohibited during Shabbat must declare an end to Shabbat by one of the above two methods. It is permitted to resume activities that are prohibited on Shabbat after any one of the three methods.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim ReferencesExternal links *Chabad calendar Category:Shabbat ","title":"Motza'ei Shabbat"},{"id":"17962630","text":"Rich Hill, near Bel Alton, Maryland, was owned by Colonel Samuel Cox, a Confederate sympathizer during the American Civil War.

A clarifier is generally used to remove solid particulates or suspended solids from liquid for clarification and/or thickening. Concentrated impurities, discharged from the bottom of the tank are known as sludge, while the particles that float to the surface of the liquid are called scum. Three wastewater/sewage clarifiers at the  ªAikahi wastewater treatment plant in Hawaii. They appear to have a floating cover to reduce the odor because the plant is very close to a residential area. Circular clarifier with surface skimmer visible in the lower right. As the skimmer slowly rotates around the clarifier, skimmed floating material is pushed into the trap visible above the fenced enclosure at the lower left. ApplicationsPretreatment= Before the water enters the clarifier, coagulation and flocculation reagents, such as polyelectrolytes and ferric sulfate,Brentwood Industries, Inc. (2013). \\"Tube Settler Systems For Clarification.\\" Accessed 14 October 2013. can be added. These reagents cause finely suspended particles to clump together and form larger and denser particles, called flocs, that settle more quickly and stably. This allows the separation of the solids in the clarifier to occur more efficiently and easily; aiding in the conservation of energy. Isolating the particle components first using these processes may reduce the volume of downstream water treatment processes like filtration. =Potable water treatment= Water being purified for human consumption, is treated with floculation reagents, then sent to the clarifier where removal of the flocculated coagulate occurs producing clarified water. The clarifier works by permitting the heavier and larger particles to settle to the bottom of the clarifier. The particles then form a bottom layer of sludge requiring regular removal and disposal. Clarified water then proceeds through several more steps before being sent for storage and use. =Waste water treatment= Sedimentation tanks have been used to treat wastewater for millennia.Chatzakis, M.K., Lyrintzis, A.G., Mara, D.D., and Angelakis, A.N. (2006). \\"Sedimentation Tanks through the Ages.\\" Proceedings of the 1st IWA International Symposium on Water and Wastewater Technologies in Ancient Civilizations, Iraklio, Greece, 28‚Äì30 October 2006, pp. 757‚Äì762. Primary treatment of sewage is removal of floating and settleable solids through sedimentation. Primary clarifiers reduce the content of suspended solids and pollutants embedded in those suspended solids. Because of the large amount of reagent necessary to treat domestic wastewater, preliminary chemical coagulation and flocculation are generally not used, remaining suspended solids being reduced by following stages of the system. However, coagulation and flocculation can be used for building a compact treatment plant (also called a \\"package treatment plant\\"), or for further polishing of the treated water. Sedimentation tanks called secondary clarifiers remove flocs of biological growth created in some methods of secondary treatment including activated sludge, trickling filters and rotating biological contactors. =Mining= Methods used to treat suspended solids in mining wastewater include sedimentation and floc blanket clarification and filtration.Gorshkov, V. A., Kharionovsky A. A., \\"Main Methods and Techniques of Mine Water Treatment in the USA\\", International Journal of Mine Water, 4 (1983), Spain. pp. 27-34. Sedimentation is used by Rio Tinto Minerals to refine raw ore into refined borates. After dissolving the ore, the saturated borate solution is pumped into a large settling tank. Borates float on top of the liquor while rock and clay settles to the bottom.Rio Tinto Minerals. \\"Mining & Refining Borates.\\" Accessed 13 October 2013. Technology Rectangular sedimentation tanks with effluent weir structure visible above the fluid surface. Drained circular sedimentation tank showing central inlet baffles on the right with solids scraper and skimmer arms visible under the rotating bridge. Although sedimentation might occur in tanks of other shapes, removal of accumulated solids is easiest with conveyor belts in rectangular tanks or with scrapers rotating around the central axis of circular tanks. Mechanical solids removal devices move as slowly as practical to minimize resuspension of settled solids. Tanks are sized to give water an optimal residence time within the tank. Economy favors using small tanks; but if flow rate through the tank is too high, most particles will not have sufficient time to settle, and will be carried with the treated water. Considerable attention is focused on reducing water inlet and outlet velocities to minimize turbulence and promote effective settling throughout available tank volume. Baffles are used to prevent fluid velocities at the tank entrance from extending into the tank; and overflow weirs are used to uniformly distribute flow from liquid leaving the tank over a wide area of the surface to minimize resuspension of settling particles.Weber, pp. 128‚Äì131. =Tube settlers= Tube settlers are commonly used in rectangular clarifiers to increase the settling capacity by reducing the vertical distance a suspended particle must travel. High efficiency tube settlers use a stack of parallel tubes, rectangles or flat pieces separated by a few inches (several centimeters) and sloping upwards in the direction of flow. This structure creates a large number of narrow parallel flow pathways encouraging uniform laminar flow as modeled by Stokes' law.Weber, p. 130. These structures work in two ways: #They provide a very large surface area onto which particles may fall and become stabilized. #Because flow is temporarily accelerated between the plates and then immediately slows down, this helps to aggregate very fine particles that can settle as the flow exits the plates. Structures inclined between 45¬∞ and 60¬∞ may allow gravity drainage of accumulated solids, but shallower angles of inclination typically require periodic draining and cleaning. Tube settlers may allow the use of a smaller clarifier and may enable finer particles to be separated with residence times less than 10 minutes. Typically such structures are used for difficult-to-treat waters, especially those containing colloidal materials. Tube settlers capture the fine particles allowing the larger particles to travel to the bottom of the clarifier in a more uniform form. The fine particles then build up into a larger mass which then slides down the tube channels. The reduction in solids present in the outflow allows a reduction in the clarifier footprint when designing. Tubes made of PVC plastic are a minor cost in clarifier design improvements and may lead to an increase of operating rate of 2 to 4 times.SBS Enviro Concepts (2008). \\"Tube Settlers.\\" Accessed 14 October 2013Foroozan, L.

Accessed 14 October 2013. =Operation= In order to maintain and promote the proper processing of a clarifier, it is important to remove any corrosive, reactive and polymerisable component first, or any material that may foul the outlet stream of water to avoid any unwanted side reactions, changes in the product or cause damage to any of the water treatment equipment. This is done by routine inspections and the frequent cleaning of the quiescent zones and the inlet and outlet areas of the clarifier in order to ascertain the extent of sediment build up and to clean and remove any scouring, litter, weeds or debris that may have accumulated over time.Western Regional Aquaculture Center, University of Washington. Seattle, WA (2001). \\"Settling Basin Design.\\" WRAC Publication No. 106. Water being introduced into the clarifier should be controlled to reduce the velocity of the inlet flow. Reducing the velocity maximizes the hydraulic retention time inside the clarifier for sedimentation and helps to avoid excessive turbulence and mixing; thereby promoting the effective settling of the suspended particles. To further discourage the overt mixing within the clarifier and increase the retention time allowed for the particles to settle, the inlet flow should also be distributed evenly across the entire cross section of the settling zone inside the clarifier, where the volume is maintained at 37.7 percent capacity. The sludge formed from the settled particles at the bottom of each clarifier, if left for an extended period of time, may become gluey and viscous, causing difficulties in its removal. This formation of sludge, promotes anaerobic conditions and a healthy environment for the growth of bacteria. This can cause the resuspension of particles by gases and the release of dissolved nutrients throughout the water fluid, reducing the effectiveness of the clarifier. Major health issues and problems can also occur further down the track of the water purification system or hinder the health of the fish found downstream of the clarifier. New development Improvements and modifications have been made to enhance clarifier performance dependent on the constraints of the substance undergoing the separation. Addition of flocculants is common to aid separation in clarifiers, but density difference of flocculant concentrate may cause treated water to have an excessive flocculant concentration. Uniform flocculent concentration can be improved and flocculant dosage reduced by installation of an intermediate diffused wall perpendicular to the flow in the clarifier.Zytner, Richard G. \\"Solids Separation.\\" School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Accessed 14 October 2013. The two dominant forces acting upon the solid particles in clarifiers are gravity and particle interactions. Disproportional flow can lead to turbulent and hydraulic instability and potential flow short-circuiting. Installation of perforated baffle walls in modern clarifiers promotes uniform flow across the basin. Rectangular clarifiers are commonly used for high efficiency and low running cost. Improvements of these clarifiers were made to stabilize flow by elongation and narrowing of the tank.

On September 3, 1971, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History Loren Andrus was born in 1816 in New York, and moved with his parents to Washington Township in 1828. In 1837, when he was 21, Loren Andrus was taken on as an assistant engineer for the survey of the Clinton-Kalamazoo Canal. Andrus married Lucina Davis, and in 1849 the couple set up a farm on a large tract of land where this house now stands. In the late 1850s, the more prominent local residents spurred a small building boom, with each person striving to put up the most impressive residence. Andrus caught the bug, and in 1858 offered his brother-in-law, local architect and carpenter David Stewart, a steep sum to quickly design and build a distinctive house. Using Orson Squire Fowler's A Home For All as a guide, they began constructing this house, finishing in 1860. Andrus was quite active in local cultural organizations, and the house served as a social center for the community. It was also used as a \\"station\\" on the Underground railway. In 1890, Lucinda Davis Andrus died. Loren Andrus sold the house in 1894 and moved to Detroit. After Andrus's death, the house changed hands several times, and was even used as a restaurant in the late 1930s. In 1945, the Detroit Board of Education established Albert H. Schmidt Foundation Farm on the property to train high school and college students in agricultural techniques. The house served as a dormitory, and was operated by Wayne State University as an extension of their agricultural college. The house was scheduled to be torn down until William and Phyllis Hamilton bought the house and restored it. They turned it into a living museum with three generations of the Hamilton family living and working there. The house was later sold back into private hands and converted back into a single family residence. It is now owned by the Friends of the Loren Andrus Octagon House, Inc., which bought it in 1987. In the 1990s and early 2000s most of the land the Octagon house sat on was converted into subdivisions. Description The Loren Andrus Octagon House is a two-story, eight-sided structure constructed of brick. The roof has extravagant Italianate supporting brackets and an octagonal cupola with weatherboard sheathing on top. A large porch supported by Neo-Corinthian wood columns wraps around seven of the eight sides of the house. On the eighth side, a single- story brick kitchen wing with low gable roof extends to the rear. The house has two-sash double-hung windows with shaped wood lintels. On the interior, the octagon houses four rooms on each level. In the center of the house is a dramatic spiral staircase, which extends upward from the main floor all the way to the cupola. Triangular alcoves lead off the stair to each of the rooms. Ceilings throughout the house are twelve feet high.

Airlift However, the National Guard Bureau's and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's desire to retain the unit brought a new mission and a numeric designation to the organization, the 140th Aeromedical Transport Squadron which was allotted to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, and activated on 1 July 1956 using propeller-driven aircraft. The 140th Aeromedical Transport Squadron was bestowed the lineage and history of the inactivated Pennsylvania ANG 148th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. The unit was re-equipped, flying the C-46 Commando and in 1958 the C-119 Flying Boxcar. In 1960, the 140th was notified that it would be converting once again to the much larger and faster C-121 Constellation. Due to runway requirements, the C-121s could not fly from Reading Airport and on 1 February 1961, the unit relocated to its current location at Olmsted Air Force Base (present day Harrisburg Air National Guard Base) due to the inadequate facilities at Reading. On 15 October 1964, the 140th Air Transport Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level by the National Guard Bureau. However, due to a designation conflict with an existing 140th Fighter Group with the Colorado ANG, the units designation was changed to the 168th Air Transport Squadron, being assigned to the new 168th Air Transport Group as its flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 168th Headquarters, 168th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 168th Combat Support Squadron, and the 168th USAF Dispensary. Special operations Threatened by the closure of Olmsted Air Force Base and by the downsizing of all conventionally powered transport aircraft, the National Guard Bureau volunteered the unit for a psychological warfare capability named \\"Coronet Solo.\\" Following the Arab-Israeli War of June 1967, psychological warfare once again became a U.S. military priority. The unit was again re- designated as the 193rd Tactical Electronic Warfare Group and transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC). Four of its C-121s were converted to EC-121S Coronet Solos for its electronic warfare mission. The mission later transitioned to the EC-130E (1980) and eventually to the EC-130J (2004). Soon after the 193d SOG received EC-130s, the Air National Guard unit participated in the rescue of American citizens in Operation Urgent Fury in 1983. Then known as Volant Solo, the aircraft acted as an airborne radio station, keeping the citizens of Grenada informed about the U.S. military action. Several years later in 1989, Volant Solo was instrumental in the success of coordinated psychological operations in Operation Just Cause. During this mission it broadcast throughout the initial phases of the operation, helping to end the Noriega regime. In the mid-1980s, along with all other USAF special operations units, it was assigned to the 23d Air Force of the Military Airlift Command (MAC). In 1990, the 193d joined the newly formed Air Force Special Operations Command, and the wing's aircraft were redesignated Commando Solo, with no change in mission. In 1990‚Äì91, Commando Solo was deployed to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in support of Operations Desert Shield and DESERT STORM. Its missions included broadcasting the \\"Voice of the Gulf\\" and other highly successful programs intended to convince Iraqi soldiers to surrender. In 1994, Commando Solo was used to broadcast radio and TV messages to the citizens and leaders of Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was featured in these broadcasts, which contributed to the orderly transition from military rule to democracy. Continuing its tradition, in 1997 the 193 SOW and Commando Solo supported the United Nations' Operation Joint Guard with radio and TV broadcasts over Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of stabilization forces operations. In 1998, the unit and its aircraft participated in Operation Desert Thunder, a deployment to Southwest Asia to convince Iraq to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions. The Commando Solo was again sent into action in 1999 in support of Operation Allied Force. The aircraft was tasked to broadcast radio and television into Kosovo to prevent ethnic cleansing and assist in the expulsion of the Serbs from the region. In 2001, the Commando Solo aircraft broadcast messages to the local Afghan population and Taliban soldiers during Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2003, the Commando Solo was deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Most recently, the EC-130J was redeployed to the Middle East in support of the War on Terror. =Lineage= * Activated on 1 October 1942 by special authority prior to constitution as 347th Fighter Squadron on 2 October 1942. : Inactivated on 7 November 1945. * Re-designated 148th Fighter Squadron, and allotted to Pennsylvania ANG, on 24 May 1946 : 148th Fighter Squadron extended federal recognition on 27 February 1947 : Federalized and placed on active duty, 10 February 1951 : Re-designated: 148th Fighter Squadron, 10 February 1951 : Released from active duty and returned to Pennsylvania commonwealth control, 1 November 1952 : Re-designated: 148th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 1 November 1952 : Re-designated: 148th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 1 July 1955 : Inactivated on 30 June 1956 * Re-designated: 140th Aeromedical Transport Squadron and activated 1 July 1956 : Re-designated: 168th Air Transport Squadron, 16 February 1964 : Re-designated: 168th Military Airlift Squadron, 8 January 1966 : Re-designated: 193d Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron, 1 June 1967 : Re-designated: 193d Electronic Combat Squadron, 6 October 1980 : Re-designated: 193d Special Operations Squadron, 15 November 1983 =Assignments= * 350th Fighter Group, 1 October 1942 ‚Äì 7 November 1945 * 53d Fighter Wing, 27 February 1947 * 112th Fighter Group, 22 April 1949 * 113th Fighter Group, 10 February 1951 * 4710th Defense Wing, 6 February 1952 * 112th Fighter-Bomber Group, 1 November 1952 * 112th Fighter-Interceptor Group, 1 July 1955 ‚Äì 30 June 1956 * Pennsylvania Air National Guard, 1 July 1956 1956 ‚Äì present : Gained by: Military Air Transport Service * 168th Air Transport Group, 16 February 1964 * 168th Military Airlift Group, 8 January 1966 * 193d Tactical Electronic Warfare Group, 1 June 1967 * 193d Electronic Combat Group, 6 October 1980 * 193d Special Operations Group, 15 November 1983 * 193d Operations Group, 1 June 1995 =Stations= * Bushey Hall (AAF-341), England, 1 October 1942 * RAF Snailwell (AAF-361), England, 4 October 1942 : Ground echelon, which was formed in US, was at Harding Army Air Field, La, until c. 2 November 1942 * RAF Kings Cliffe (AAF-367), England, 8 December 1942 ‚Äì 4 January 1943 * Casablanca-Anfa Airport, French Morocco, 20 November 1942 * Oujda Airfield, French Morocco, 6 January 1943 * La Senia Airfield, Algeria, 12 February 1943 * Orleansville Airfield, Algeria, 9 March 1943 * Le Sers Airfield, Tunisia, 21 April 1943 * Djidjelli Airfield, Algeria, 14 May 1943 * Rerhaia Airfield, Algeria, 18 November 1943 * Corsica, c. 6 December 1943 : Detachment operated from Capodichino Airport, Naples, Italy, 10 Feb‚ÄìMar 1944 * Sardinia, 19 Ju1 1944 * Tarquinia Airfield, Italy, 15 September 1944 * Pisa Airfield, Italy, 2 December 1944 ‚Äì 14 July 1945 * Seymour Johnson Field, NC, 25 Aug ‚Äì 7 November 1945. * Reading Municipal Airport, Pennsylvania, 24 May 1946 ‚Äì 10 February 1951; 1 November 1952 ‚Äì 30 June 1956; 1 July 1956 : Operated from Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, 10 February 1951 ‚Äì 1 November 1952 * Olmstead Air Force Base, Pennsylvania, 1 February 1961 * Harrisburg International Airport, Pennsylvania, 30 June 1969 : Designated: Harrisburg Air National Guard Base, Pennsylvania, 1991 ‚Äì present =Aircraft= * P-39 Airacobra, 1942‚Äì1944 * P-400 Airacobra, 1942‚Äì1943 * P-38 Lightning, 1943 * P-47 Thunderbolt, 1944‚Äì1945 * A-26 Invader, 1947‚Äì1949 * F-51 Mustang, 1949‚Äì1951; 1952‚Äì1956 * F-84C Thunderjet, 1951 * F-94C Starfire, 1951‚Äì1952 * C-46 Commando, 1956‚Äì1958 * C-119 Flying Boxcar, 1958‚Äì1961 * C-121 Constellation, 1961‚Äì1967 * EC-121 Constellation 1967‚Äì1980 * EC-130E Commando Solo 1980‚Äì2004 * EC-130J Commando Solo 2004 ‚Äì present References * Ravenstein, Charles A.

The site is produced by Nexstar Media Group. Zap2it affiliates include Wave Broadband, Cox, Dish Network, Disney, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post. History TMS first began to offer online listings services as a content provider to the online services Prodigy in the late 1980s and America Online in the early 1990s. TMS launched its first branded online television listings service, TV Quest, in 1993 on the AppleLink online service. TV Quest later migrated to Apple's eWorld services and to the internet in the mid-1990s. Version 1.0 of Zap2it debuted on the web in May 2000. In its earliest iteration, the site was a combination of TMS-owned listings sites TVQuest and MovieQuest plus the then-recently purchased content site UltimateTV. UltimateTV offered viewers and industry insiders breaking news, Nielsen ratings, live celebrity chats and more. The site provided video clips, interviews and promos in its Promo Lounge area. The earliest Zap2it focused on films, television and original web-based content. The site offered original editorials along with listings information for films, television and online. It also listed online content such as short films, interactive games and webisodes offered by Atom Films, Shockwave.com and iFilm. Zap2it's television listings and film showtimes were generated by TMS data, with web listings by Yack data. The site's editorial pages, including the front page, were redesigned in 2001. In early 2003, the editorial focus of Zap2it was narrowed down to television and films, and the site was again redesigned. An agreement with Fandango in 2005 allowed for the introduction of online movie ticketing for select theaters. Blogs, including It Happened Last Night, which offered show recaps, were first launched in 2006 and expanded thereafter. In 2007, the site launched \\"click-to-record\\" functionality allowing users with TiVo digital video recorders to remotely schedule recordings directly from within the Zap2it television listings. The site launched TVOvermind, a blog dedicated to episodic recaps hosted as a subdomain on the Zap2it website, in 2008. It was later purchased by BC Media Group in 2012. On October 3, 2016, the site was rebranded as Screener. In April 2017, Tribune Media announced the end of editorial content on Screener TV. No new editorial content has been added since. As of January 2018, the only thing that's left on the site is the TV Listings section and TV by the Numbers, as the site has since reverted to the Zap2it name. TV by the Numbers ended operations at the end of January 2020. Product development In early 2007, Zap2it released enhanced television listings on its main site. Upgrades to the product included improved performance, better customization capabilities and the introduction of sharing tools and a user rating system. Following a testing period, the television-listings product was made available to affiliates. In 2008, a revised movie-showtimes product was developed on the main site. It more prominently showcased movie trailers and offered expanded cast and crew lists which linked to celebrity profile pages. Editorial development In February 2009, Zap2it began to play an expanded role within the Tribune Company. The site became the central aggregator of entertainment content produced by Tribune-owned online properties including latimes.com, The Envelope, chicagotribune.com and others. As part of this development, a major site redesign was planned for midyear 2009.

Movement into Niger The Nigerien Arab populations include groups drawn from the Shoa or Baggara Arabs, the first clans of whom are believed to have arrived in what is now Niger sometime in the 19th century. Small groups of the Ouled Sliman, overrunning the Kanem Empire, filtered into the area between the late 19th century and 1923, joining with those Shoa pastoralists who were already centered in Tintouma area. In the 1950s a small number of Kanem-Chadian Arabs moved into the area, but the population remained small.

Retrieved June 16, 2008. The massacre occurred in December 1984. Background According to a 2003 report by the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the guerrilla group Shining Path was very active in the Huanta Province since the start of the Internal conflict in Peru in 1980.CVR, Ejecuciones extrajudiciales en Putis, p. 143. During 1983, Shining Path murdered the lieutenant governor of Putis, Santos Quispe Saavedra and carried out similar acts of violence in nearby towns; as a consequence, the inhabitants of Putis were forced to seek refuge in the nearby mountains.CVR, Ejecuciones extrajudiciales en Putis, p. 144. To parry this threat, the Peruvian Army established a military base in Putis in November 1984 and called on all refugees to return to the town.CVR, Ejecuciones extrajudiciales en Putis, pp. 144-145. Massacre By December 1984, most of the population had returned to the Putis settlement. The military ordered the men of the community to dig a pit, then gathered the local population around it, executed all of them with gunfire and buried them in the excavated pit.CVR, Ejecuciones extrajudiciales en Putis, p. 145. It is believed that the reasons for these executions were suspicions that the inhabitants of Putis were sympathetic to Shining Path and a desire to steal and sell the cattle of the community.CVR, Ejecuciones extrajudiciales en Putis, pp. 148-149. The total number of victims is estimated at 123 men and women from the settlements of Cayramayo, Vizcat√°npata, Orccohuasi and Putis; 19 of those murdered were minors.CVR, Ejecuciones extrajudiciales en Putis, pp. 150-152. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified two mass graves in Putis, one behind the church and the other inside the school.CVR, Ejecuciones extrajudiciales en Putis, p. 149. Some persons from Putis survived the massacre by staying in the mountains, where they remained until a few of them returned in 1997; as of 2002 some ten families lived in Putis.CVR, Ejecuciones extrajudiciales en Putis, p. 150.

Around 50 relatives of the persons killed joined the investigators to watch the recovery of their family members remains.Reuters, Years after slaughter, Peru opens giant burial pit.

Despite the exhumation procedures, no one has been indicted so far for the Putis massacre as the Peruvian Military refuses to give any explanation about the events, claiming all related documentation was destroyed in a fire.BBC News, Peruvians seek relatives in mass grave.

This practice is now obsolete. Countermarking can be done for a variety of reasons. If the currency is reformed, existing coins may be rendered void. In this situation, coins already in circulation could be marked with the new value (according to the new currency system). The life span of existing coins could thus be extended, which might under some circumstances be a cheaper alternative to recalling the coins, melting them and striking replacements. Similarly, foreign coins could be marked as legal or accepted currency, thus allowing them to circulate in the area where they were countermarked. Countermarking can also be done for political reasons, i.e. a new state or r√©gime demonstrating its authority by countermarking coins issued by the previous state. Some experts recommend not to use the term countermark and counterstamp as synonyms, but in different contexts. A counterstamp is applied by a die, and by machine to an existing coin, while a countermark is punched onto the coin, mostly by hand, using a punch and a hammer or a primitive hand-operated machine. Often countermarks are applied by private persons, as is the case with chops (often referred to as chopmarks), which were punched by money changers, bankers or shroffs onto foreign coins circulating in China in the 19th century. In contrast the use of counterstamps should be authorized by a local or national Government. The term punchmark, is mainly used when referring to the earliest Indian silver coins which are coin-like pieces of metal of a standard weight that are bearing various symbols which were applied with punches, resulting in what are known as punchmarked coins.

The patients were originally those who suffer from service-connected disabilities arising from their services with the USAFFE, recognized guerrilla units, Philippine Scouts, and Philippine Commonwealth Army, which was later extended to AFP retirees and their dependents. History The Veterans Memorial Medical Center was established pursuant to Public Law 865, 80th U.S. Congress on July 8, 1948 which provided $9.4 million for the construction of a hospital facility with the land to be donated by the Philippine government. The law was implemented in the country by an agreement between the U.S. and the Philippines signed by then Pres. Elpidio Quirino and the U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Myron Cowen. Various amendments have been introduced and the latest is Republic Act 6948 which has liberalized the definition of veterans which now included the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) retirees. Likewise, the hospitalization benefit was extended to the veteran dependents. It is one of three units under the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office (PVAO). PVAO is a bureau under the Department of National Defense. The other two units under PVAO are the PVAO Proper, and Military Shrines Service. The land was originally intended to be location of the new Malacanan Palace on the original masterplan of Quezon City in 1939. It is now being eyed to be privatized as part of the Quezon City Central Business District Redevelopment Plan or Triangle Park. Service Coverage Filipino veterans covered under this program embrace: # The Philippine Revolutionary Forces that took up arms against the Spaniards and the Americans during the past Philippine revolutions and wars, # members of the First Philippine National Guards, either before or after its integration into the Army of the United States of America, # Filipino citizens who are enlisted and or commissioned and served during World War I under the Allied Armed Forces, # Philippine Scouts who were in the service prior to October 6, 1945, with wartime service, # USAFFE with wartime service in the Philippines, # Recognized World War II guerrilla units in the Philippines and # AFP units that participated in the Korean War. All that a patient needs to present in seeking admission is a certificate of his military service from the Philippine Veterans Board and this plus his marriage certificate and birth certificate of minor child if the dependent is in need of hospital care. Emergency cases, however, may be brought to the hospital directly after which pertinent papers may be secured later on.

Slade was praised in official reports, including by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who also voiced some criticisms of him privately.Burnham & McGuigan, p. 264-265 Slade received an Army Gold Medal, and was honoured three times with the thanks of Parliament.Liddell, p.179 Slade's descendants include two admirals, namely son Sir Adolphus Slade and grandson Sir Edmond Slade. Despite achieving high rank during and after active soldiering, Slade was criticised as a general of cavalry by some contemporaries and historians. Background and early military life Slade was the son of John Slade (d. 1801) of Maunsel House, Somerset, a Victualling Commissioner, and his wife, Charlotte n√©e Portal. He obtained a commission as cornet in the 10th Dragoons on 11 May 1780, and became a lieutenant on 28 April 1783, captain on 24 October 1787, major on 1 March 1794, and lieutenant colonel on 29 April 1795. On 18 October 1798, he exchanged to the 1st Dragoons (the Royals). He was appointed equerry to the Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland in 1800, and became a colonel in the army on 29 April 1802. In June 1804, he was made brigadier, and gave up command of the Royals.Liddell, p.177 He is said to \\"have danced with Marie Antoinette who gave him a snuff box\\".Maunsel House bio-details Peninsular War cavalry general In October 1808, Slade was sent to Corunna in command of a hussar brigade. He led the 10th Hussars in the successful cavalry action at Sahag√∫n on 20 December. The 10th arrived too late to play an active role in the action, primarily because Slade insisted on making a stirring, and apparently over-long, speech ending in the words: \\"... blood and slaughter, march!\\"Fletcher, p. 91 Slade made an enemy of Henry, Lord Paget, who commanded all the cavalry in the Corunna campaign. Paget made no pretence of hiding his low opinion of Slade, once calling him \\"... that damned stupid fellow\\", in a voice that many nearby officers and troopers heard.Hibbert, p. 71 Slade shared in the arduous work of the cavalry during John Moore's retreat, and served as a volunteer at the Battle of Corunna, when the cavalry had embarked. He was employed on the staff in England for six months, but returned to the Peninsula in August 1809 with a brigade of dragoons, and served there for four years. He participated in the battles of Busaco and Fuentes de O√±oro. He commanded the cavalry division, in Stapleton Cotton's absence, during Andr√© Mass√©na's retreat from Portugal in the spring of 1811. Wellington mentioned him favourably in his dispatch of 14 March. On 11 June 1812, when he was under Rowland Hill in Estremadura, Slade was beaten by Charles Lallemand in a cavalry action at Maguilla. Each side deployed 700 dragoons in two regiments.Smith, p. 378 The British had the advantage in the first encounter, and followed headlong in pursuit through a defile, beyond which they found the French reserve drawn up. Their own reserve had joined in the pursuit and lost its formation. The brigade panicked, was pursued by the French for several miles, and lost more than 100 prisoners.Fletcher, pp. 166-178Oman, pp. 105-106 Slade rode with the leading squadrons, instead of attending to the supports, and Wellington and others blamed him. Wellington was furious, writing privately: \\"I have never been more annoyed than by Slade's affair. Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at every thing. They never consider the situation, never think of manoeuvring before an enemy, and never keep back or provide for a reserve.\\"Wellington to Hill, 18th June , Supplementary Despatches,IX, p. 238 Such criticism from his commander-in-chief was echoed by some of his subordinates; one cavalry officer wrote: \\"As a leader of cavalry he was deplorable. He was a byword for inefficiency throughout the army.\\"Cassels, p. 140 Another officer wrote, commenting specifically on the Battle of Sabugal: ‚Äú[General Slade] ‚Ä¶ let no possible opportunity for inaction to pass him - pretending not to comprehend orders, which the events passing before him would have made comprehensible to a trumpeter, ‚Ä¶ a curse to the cause, and a disgrace to the service.‚ÄùBurnham and McGuigan, p. 265 Sir Charles Oman expressed the view that he was capable only of following definite orders and lacked initiative.Oman, p. 151 It has been claimed that Slade eroded the morale of his brigade between 1811 and 1812, with this being partly the cause of the reverse at Maguilla.Fletcher, pp. 7-8 That Slade, accused of ineptitude by contemporaries, remained in command of a brigade until mid-1813 has been attributed by commentators to Wellington's widely perceived inability to rid himself of undesirable senior officers, except by employing various subterfuges.Fletcher, pp. 7-8Oman, p. 152Weller, p. 28Teffteller, p. 70 Later career and honours In May 1813, Slade's brigade was transferred to Henry Fane, and he went home, and was employed for a year in Ireland. The official reason for Slade losing his command was that he was senior to Major General Henry Clinton, who had been given the local rank of lieutenant general.Liddell, pp.178-79 Slade received an Army Gold Medal and one clasp for Corunna and Fuentes d'O√±oro. He had been promoted to major general on 25 October 1809, became a lieutenant general on 4 June 1814, and a general on 10 January 1837. In 1831, he was given the colonelcy of the 5th Dragoon Guards; on 30 September 1831 he was made a baronet, and in 1835 he was appointed a GCH. He was honoured three times with the thanks of Parliament.Liddell, p.179 He died on 13 August 1859 at his home, Montys Court, and was buried at Norton Fitzwarren, near Taunton, Somerset, having been 'the oldest living member of the army save one'. Family Sir John married firstly, on 20 September 1792, Anna Eliza Dawson (died 24 December 1819), daughter of James Dawson of Forkhill, County Armagh.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 330 - 331. HistoryOrigins of the Clan= The Stewards or Seneschals of Dol in Brittany came to Scotland through Normandy and England when David I of Scotland returned in 1124 to claim his throne. In Scotland they rose to a high rank, becoming High Stewards of Scotland. Through a marriage to Marjorie Bruce, daughter of king Robert the Bruce, the Stewarts acquired the throne of Scotland when David II of Scotland, only son of Robert the Bruce died. Robert Stewart, who reigned as Robert II of Scotland gave to his illegitimate son by Moira Leitch (according to tradition), Sir John Stewart (1360‚Äì1445), the Isle of Bute, the Isle of Arran and the Isle of Cumbrae. The king conferred these lands into a County and made his son the Sheriff. This was confirmed in a charter by Robert III of Scotland in 1400. =15th century= James Stewart was Sheriff of Bute between 1445 and 1449. He was succeeded by his son, William Stewart, who was also Keeper of Brodick Castle on Arran. His son was Ninian Stewart who was confirmed in the office of Sheriff of Bute as well as the lands of Ardmaleish, Greenan, the Mill of Kilcatten and also Corrigillis. Ninian Stewart was created Hereditary Captain and Keeper of Rothesay Castle on Bute in 1498 by James IV of Scotland, an honour still held by the family today, and shown in their coat of arms. =16th century= Ninian Stewart married three times. In 1539 he was succeeded by his son James Stewart. James suffered during the feud between the Earl of Arran who was regent of Scotland and the Earl of Lennox. James Stewart was succeeded by his son, John Stewart, who attended the Parliament in Edinburgh as the Commissioner for Bute. The family favoured the French spelling of the name as Stuart, which was introduced by Mary, Queen of Scots, and is still used by the present Chiefs. =17th century and Civil War= Rothesay Castle was held by the Chiefs of Clan Stuart of Bute in the 15th century and during the Scottish Civil War of the 17th century. On 28 March 1627 Sir James Stuart of Bute was created 1st Stuart Baronet, of Bute in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia by Charles I of England. During the early part of the Scottish Civil War he garrisoned Rothesay Castle and raised soldiers for the king at his own expense. Stuart was appointed royal lieutenant for the west of Scotland. He decided to take possession of Dumbarton Castle but two frigates that were sent to assist fell foul of stormy weather, with one being completely wrecked. As a result, Sir James Stuart was forced to flee to Ireland. When Oliver Cromwell was victorious Sir James Stuart was forced to pay a substantial fine to redeem his estates that had been sequestrated. Sir James Stuart's grandson was another James Stuart, who upon the forfeiture of the Earl of Argyll in 1681, was appointed as Colonel of the local Militia. This James Stuart supported the accession of William of Orange and his wife, Queen Mary Stuart. =18th century and Jacobite Risings= During the reign of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, James Stuart was made a Privy Councillor and a Commissioner for the negotiation of Treaty of Union. He was created 1st Earl of Bute on 14 April 1703, as well as 1st Viscount Kingarth and 1st Lord Mount Stuart, Cumra and Inchmarnock, all in the Peerage of Scotland. However, by 1706, the Earl was convinced that a union with England would not work and withdrew his support when he realised that Parliament would vote in favour of the alliance. Stuart married the eldest daughter of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh. After the succession of George I of Great Britain, James Stuart, 2nd Earl of Bute, was appointed as Commissioner for Trade and Police in Scotland, Lord Lieutenant of Bute and also a Gentleman of the Bedchamber from 1721 to 1723. During the Jacobite Rising of 1715 he commanded the Bute and Argyll Militia and kept that part of the country peaceful. John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, was a tutor to Prince George and when the prince became king George III, the 3rd Earl of Bute was made Groom of the Stool between 1760 and 1761, a Privy Councillor, First Lord of the Treasury and eventually Prime Minister of Great Britain and Ireland in 1762.https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime- ministers/john-stuart-3rd-earl-of-bute\\" He concluded a treaty with France in 1763 which brought to an end the Seven Years' War. He was succeeded by his son, John Stewart, Lord Mount Stuart, Cumra and Inchmarnock, who married Lady Elizabeth Penelope McDouall-Crichton, the only daughter, child and heiress of Patrick McDouall-Crichton, 6th Earl of Dumfries, etc., in the Peerage of Scotland, and wife Margaret Crauford. In 1796 his rank as 3rd Earl of Bute was advanced to 1st Marquess of Bute in the Peerage of Great Britain. =19th century= John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute, was a noted Member of Parliament in the House of Commons and industrialist who is largely responsible for developing the docks in Cardiff to rival those in Liverpool. By the time of his successor's death in 1900, Cardiff had become the greatest coal port in the World. John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, industrial magnate, antiquarian, scholar, philanthropist, and architectural patron, rebuilt Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle as tributes to the high art of the Middle Ages and was created a Knight-Companion of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle. =20th century= John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute, was a passionate in Architecture who was also created a Knight-Companion of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, while his son John Crichton-Stuart, 5th Marquess of Bute, a maternal descendant of William IV of the United Kingdom by Dorothea Bland, was an expert in Ornithology. He was succeeded by his son, John Crichton-Stuart, 6th Marquess of Bute, who had a passion for Scottish heritage and received a Knight-Commander degree of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his efforts before he died in 1993.

History  The SPUMS was founded on May 3, 1971 in the wardroom of HMAS PENGUIN. The founding members of SPUMS were Carl Edmonds, Bob Thomas, Douglas Walker, Ian Unsworth, and Cedric Deal and they were joined by approximately 20 others as \\"charter members\\". The society was incorporated in 1990.  Purpose  The aims of SPUMS have never changed since its inception: * To promote and facilitate the study of all aspects of underwater and hyperbaric medicine; * To provide information on underwater and hyperbaric medicine; * To publish a journal and; * To convene members of each Society annually at a scientific conference.  Training  SPUMS offers a Diploma of Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine. This certification, was the first non-naval certification and for years the only postgraduate education available. The first Diplomas by examination were awarded to Chris Acott, Gavin Dawson, and John Knight in 1975.  Publications  In 1971, a newsletter was published by Dr. Carl Edmonds and distributed to diving medical professionals. This newsletter grew to become the Journal of the South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society in 1975. The journal's name was changed to Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine in 2007 and incorporated the Journal of the European Underwater and Baromedical Society in 2008. Prior to 2008, 77% of the journal articles were from Australia and New Zealand. After 2008 the journal's two largest contributors have been Australia and the United Kingdom with 44% of the articles and 20 other countries contributing the remainder. The journal contains original and review articles, case series and reports, educational and general interest material in the form of: * The diving doctor's diary; * The world as it is; * Critical appraisals (CATs) and Cochrane reviews; * Opinion papers and Commentaries; * Reprints of full Articles and Abstracts from the literature; * Letters to the Editor; * Book reviews; * Society News & Notices. Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine is ISI-indexed on SCIE and indexed on EMBASE. In 2011, Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine was approved for indexation in MEDLINE. The journal also began accepting advertisements from industry to assist with the cost of maintaining a high quality journal but also made clear that advertisements did not represent endorsement of those products or services by the organizations.

The CEC was established in 1994 by the member states of Canada, Mexico, and the United States to address regional environmental concerns under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), the environmental side accord to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Commission's 1997 report, Ecological Regions of North America, provides a framework that may be used by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and academic researchers as a basis for risk analysis, resource management, and environmental study of the continent's ecosystems. In the United States, the EPA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are the principal federal agencies working with the CEC to define and map ecoregions. Ecoregions may be identified by similarities in geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife distributions, and hydrology. The classification system has four levels, but only Levels I and III are shown on this list. Level I divides North America into 15 broad ecoregions; of these, 12 lie partly or wholly within the United States. Fifty Level II regions were created to allow for a narrower delineation of Level I areas. Three level I areas were not subdivided for level 2. Level III subdivides the continent into 182 smaller ecoregions; of these, 104 lie partly or wholly with the United States. Level IV is a further subdivision of Level III ecoregions. Level IV mapping is still underway but is complete across most of the United States. For an example of Level IV data, see List of ecoregions in Oregon and the associated articles.

Amador Bueno (c. 1584 ‚Äì c. 1649) was a landowner and colonial administrator of the Captaincy of S√£o Vicente (Colonial Brazil). Bueno was born around 1584 in the city of S√£o Paulo, Captaincy of S√£o Vicente which is now the State of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. He was born to Bartolomeu Bueno da Ribeira, a Galician settler from Ourense and Maria Pires, from S√£o Paulo, daughter of Salvador Pires and M√©cia Fernandes.http://buratto.org/paulistana/Buenos_1.htm Amador held several public office posts through royal appointment and elections. Since 1580, the Kingdom of Portugal was in a dynastic union with the Kingdom of Spain, up until 1640, when the Portuguese acclaimed John IV of Portugal as the new king. A largely Spanish contingent in S√£o Paulo tried to break away from both in 1641. Without Bueno's consent, they claimed him to be their king. Bueno finally dissuaded the group and urged loyalty to John IV. Unrest among the citizens of S√£o Paulo caused that Bueno had to seek sanctuary in the convent of Saint Bento. It is said he tried to reason with the crowds outside the convent from one of the porticos, but they would not return to their homes until the fathers of the convent went out and addressed the multitudes. They would later support the new King of Portugal and keep the unity of the colony of Brazil. It is not known exactly when he died but estimates are between 1646 and 1650. Amador Bueno left many descendants, some of the most famous include: Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Walter Moreira Salles, Barbara Heliodora, Get√∫lio Vargas, Tancredo Neves, and Roberto Marinho, among many others.http://www.usinadeletras.com.br/exibelotexto.phtml?cod=189&cat;=Ensaios According to Albert F.

It should not be confused with Wikipedia articles based on the classification system developed by the World Wildlife Fund, such as List of ecoregions (WWF) and Lists of ecoregions by country. The commission was established in 1994 by the member states of Canada, Mexico, and the United States to address regional environmental concerns under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), the environmental side accord to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Commission's 1997 report, Ecological Regions of North America, provides a framework that may be used by government agencies, non- governmental organizations, and academic researchers as a basis for risk analysis, resource management, and environmental study of the continent's ecosystems. Ecoregions may be identified by similarities in geology, physiography, vegetation, climate soils, land use, wildlife distributions, and hydrology. The classification system has four levels. Only the first three levels are shown on this list. \\"Level I\\" divides North America into 15 broad ecoregions. \\"Level II\\" subdivides the continent into 52 smaller ecoregions. \\"Level III\\" subdivides those regions again into 182 ecoregions. \\"Level IV\\" is a further subdivision of Level III ecoregions. Level IV mapping is still underway but is complete across most of the United States. For an example of Level IV data, see List of ecoregions in Oregon and the associated articles. Arctic CordilleraOverview= The Arctic Cordillera is one of the world's fifteen diverse ecoregions, characterized by a vast mountain chain spanning the spine of the range. The geographic range is composed along the provinces of Labrador: including Eastern Baffin, Devon Island, Ellesmere, Bylot Island, the Thorngat Mountains, and some parts of the Northeastern fringe. The landscape is dominated by massive polar icefields, alpine glaciers, inland fjords, and large bordering bodies of water, distinctive of many similar arctic regions in the world. Although the terrain is infamous for its unforgiving conditions, humans maintained an established population of 1000 people ‚Äì 80% of which were Inuit. In addition, the landscape is 75% covered by ice or exposed bedrock, with a continuous permafrost that persists throughout the year, making plant and animal life somewhat scarce. The temperature of the Arctic Cordillera ranges from 6 ¬∞C in summer, down to ‚àí16 ¬∞C in winter. Vegetation is largely absent in this area due to permanent ice and snow. Natural resources and human influence The Arctic Cordillera is a cold, harsh environment making plant life and animal-life sparse; even soil is rare in this ecoregion. Moss, cottongrass, and Arctic heather are examples of plant life that can be found in valleys. Meanwhile, polar bears, seals, and walruses roam the shores and survive off the thriving marine ecosystem.Bell, Trevor. \\"Arctic Cordillera Ecozone.\\" Natural Environment. J.R.

Rising temperatures in the Arctic are causing ice shelves, and the habitats they provide, to shrink from year to year. Researchers of global warming also express concern for the economic, political, and social consequences of the resulting decline in fisheries stocks expected because of the changing climate.Jeffers, Jennifer. \\"Climate Change and the Arctic: Adapting to Changes in Fisheries Stocks and Governance Regimes.\\" Ecology Law Quarterly 37.3 (2010): 917-66. ELQ. Web. Climate The Arctic Cordillera is one of Canada‚Äôs most inhospitable climates. The northern part is covered by the ice caps and glaciers cover a large part of the south. It was not always as cold as it is today. 40 million- year-old tree stumps found in 1985 on Axel Heiberg Island suggest that the area used to be warmer and wetter with much more biodiversity. Today the weather is generally very cold and dry with a few weeks of sun and rain in the summer. Snow is the most common form of precipitation in the Cordillera. The region only gets 20‚àí60 centimeters of precipitation annually. The temperature in this ecoregion averages around 4 degrees Celsius during the summer. In the winter the temperature is ‚àí35 degrees Celsius on average. A polar cell is a system of winds that influence the climate of the Cordillera. It is made up of the Westerlies, which are winds that blow warm air east to west from 30 to 60 degrees latitude up to the poles, and the Polar Easterlies, which blow cold air back south where it will repeat the process. Hydrology This region can be divided up into three major areas Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island, and the coastline of the most northern part of Labrador. Nearly 75% of the land within this ecoregion is exposed bedrock or ice. The majority of the water in this ecoregion is locked up in frozen ice and snow, therefore there are very few named rivers or other bodies of water within this region. The annual amount precipitation is about 200 mm, which usually falls down as snow or ice. Huge ice caps dominate the landscape, and they spawn large glaciers that are pushed down steep fjords and into the sea. When the temperature gets above freezing for an extended period time a little amount of runoff is created, which is generally under 200 mm annually. Geology, topography and soil The Arctic Cordillera is dominated by vast mountain ranges stretching for thousands of miles, virtually untouched by man. These mountains were formed millions of years ago during the mid-Mesozoic when the North American Plate moved northward, pushing earth and rock upwards. The mountains of the north contain metamorphic and igneous rock, and are predominantly sedimentary rock. On the other hand, the southern mountains are greater, composed of granite gneiss and magmatic volcanic rock. These mountains are characterized as being highly erodible with very steep and jagged cliffs with narrow ledges. The highest peak in the Arctic Cordillera mountain range is Barbeau Peak ‚Äì standing almost nine thousand feet tall. In general, the Arctic Cordillera Mountain Range is most similar (in composition and age) to the Appalachian Mountain Range of the United States. However, as the Appalachian Mountains are slightly older, their cliffs have been eroded, and are less jagged than those of the Arctic Cordillera. This ecoregion is also home to very limited amounts of exposed soil. Only in extremely sheltered places ‚Äì such as that of caves ‚Äì is surface soil present. The remaining soil is hidden beneath deep snow and ice, and is kept in a constant state of permafrost. Plant communities The Arctic Cordillera is a very high stress environment for plants to try and grow and regenerate. Vegetation is largely absent due to permanent ice and snow. Due to the extremely cold, dry climate, along with the ice-fields and lack of soil materials, the high and mid-elevations are largely devoid of significant populations of plants. In the warmer valleys at low elevations and along coastal margins, the plant cover is more extensive, consisting of herbaceous and shrub-type communities. Stream-banks and coastlines are the most biologically productive areas here. The plants in this region have a history of being survivors and stress tolerant to high winds, low temperatures, few available macronutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Plants have adaptations such as fluffy seed masses, staying low to the ground, and use of other plant masses for extra insulation. Keystone species Due to the harsh environments and extremely low temperatures that encompass the Arctic Cordillera, there is not a large variety of plants and animals that are able to survive and exist as a population. However, some animal species, both herbivores and carnivores, are able to survive the extreme weather and terrain. Among these animals are wolves, polar bears, Arctic foxes, musk-oxen, and caribou. For the most part, the large carnivores are the dominant species in the ecoregion, mainly the polar bear. It is the keystone species for the area due to many of its habits, including its diet and hunting strategies. In addition, the life history of the 22,000 polar bears in the Arctic clearly defines its current existence in the Arctic Cordillera.Kerr, R. (2002). A warmer arctic means change for all. August 30, 2002. Retrieved from http://sfx.uvm.edu/UVM. March 11, 2013 The large carnivorous species defines the ecoregion due to its intimate relationship with the ice as well as its extremely intelligent hunting tactics.Durner, G.M. (2009, November 05). Polar bear sea-ice relationships. Alaska science center. No other predatory animal defines the Arctic Cordillera as well as the large white polar bear and that is why when people think about arctic animals, they think about the polar bear. As long as the polar bear exists, it will be the keystone species of the Arctic Cordillera. However, this existence relies solely on the degree of ice melt that is encountered in the future.Richardson, E. (2009). Polar Bear Life History and Population Dynamics. InfoNorth. Retrieved from http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic62-4-491.pdf Endangered species =Polar bear= Polar bear The polar bear is one of the most notably affected species in the Arctic Cordillera, mainly due to their heavy reliance on arctic ice for hunting and bedding grounds. Habitat loss, caused by global warming, has led to many dangerous behavioral changes including a new behavior called long swims. These are swims lasting as long as ten days performed by mother bears to attempt to find food for their cubs, which generally lead to the death of the cub. Because of their stature and aggressiveness, direct conservation practices are not very useful to the polar bear. Instead, scientific observation to better understand these animals is the largest form of traditional conservation.\\"Conservation of Polar Bears in Canada\\".

The black spruce is a species of least concern because of habitat loss and deforestation from the spruce budworm moth.Fellin, D. and J. Dewey (March 1992). Western Spruce Budworm Forest Insect & Disease Leaflet 53, U.S. Forest Service. Retrieved on: September 14, 2008.

Retrieved 2 April 2013. =Bowhead whale= Bowhead whale Another species that is of great importance to this ecoregion is the endangered Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus). Five total stocks of this species exist in the region within the arctic oceans and adjacent seas: the Spitsbergen stock, Baffin Bay/Davis Strait, stock and Hudson Bay/Foxe Basin Stock, Sea of Okhotsk Stock, and the Bering/Chukchi/Beaufort Stock. Historically, these whales have served as a cultural icon, and an important source of food and fuel to the Inuit people. At this point in time, their populations were estimated between 30,000 and 50,000 individuals. However, with the expansion of commercial whaling in the 16th and 17th century, this species was exploited to dangerously low numbers. Commercial hunting of bowheads was officially ended in 1921, when moratoria were established to protect the remaining 3,000 individuals left in the wild.\\"Bowhead Whale (Balaena Mysticetus) - Office of Protected Resources - NOAA Fisheries.\\" Bowhead Whale (Balaena Mysticetus) - Office of Protected Resources - NOAA Fisheries. NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources, 5 December 2012. Web. 24 February 2013. Today, those same moratoria are still in effect, but the Bowhead population has been reinstated to a manageable population of between 7,000 and 10,000 individuals. Nonetheless, these whales have been (and remain) on the IUCN Red List since 1984. One of the most important conservation efforts for this species is \\"legal\\" protection by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which came into force in 1935. This convention was further strengthened and ratified by Canada in 1977 to support the International Whaling Commission‚Äôs (IWC) recommendation for full protection of the bowhead whale. Further conservation efforts have involved more physically demanding solutions, including the recommended funding of specialized technical machines that have the capability to remove debris that commonly kills these whales due to entanglement and accidental indigestion. Tundra The location of the tundra in North America is highlighted in light blue. One of the planet's most recent biomes, a result of the last ice age only 10,000 years ago, the tundra contains unique flora and fauna formed during the last glaciation in areas unrestricted by permanent ice. The tundra region is found in high latitudes, primarily in Alaska, Canada, Russia, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, as well as the Antarctic Islands. Consisting of the arctic, alpine and Antarctic regions, and stemming from the Samer language, tundra literally means a \\"high and dry place\\". =Plant communities= The adversity of soil and climatic conditions proves for low production levels, as well as little biomass accumulation due to slow rates of nutrient release in cold and wet soils, specifically as a result of limited nitrogen and phosphorus (Nadelhoffer et al. 1996) Additionally, there are low temperatures and strong winds in the tundra causing most vegetation to be dominated by woody plants that hug the soil. Within the tundra, some dominant plant species include lichen, cotton grass, and Arctic willow. Lichens Lichens dominate the tundra as the regions major primary producer. A symbiotic combination of algae and fungi, a lichen is able to survive in the harsh conditions of the tundra (Biodiversity Institute of Ontario et al. 2010). Their unique structure and survivability makes lichen a prominent and keystone plant species in the tundra ecosystem. Cotton grass is another dominant plant species in the tundra producing much of its growth early in the summer. Being a member of the sedge family, it forms a large part of the vegetation in the tundra because it is able to deal with harsh and cold temperatures. This perennial plant contains flowering heads with dense brittles that are spread during heavy winds, enabling pollination (Wein and Bliss 1974). Additionally, its survivability in the tundra can be attributed to cotton grass‚Äôs ability to photosynthesize in low temperatures and low light. The Arctic willow, commonly named rock willow, is found in the North American tundra. Most uniquely, the Arctic willow often has long trailing branches that root where they intersect with the surface of the ground, and the roots are shallow as to thrive in the frozen ground of the tundra (Wielgolaski 1972). In addition to species such as lichens, cotton grass, and Arctic willows, shrubs, sedges, lichens, mosses, and vascular plants dominate the tundra plant community (Folch and Camarasa 2000). Despite the tundra eco-region‚Äôs reputation of being a cold and desolate ‚Äòpolar desert‚Äô, it is actually a varying landscape supporting a diverse amount of plant and animal species. =Animal species= Since the tundra has such a harsh environment, the animals who live here have adapted in a way to call the tundra their home. The keystone species of the tundra can be as small as a lemming to as large as a musk ox. The low biodiversity means that fluctuation in individual animals can substantially affect the entire ecosystem. The main predators of the tundra are the polar bear, the Arctic wolf and the Arctic fox. They all have thick white coats that help them blend into their environment and stalk prey. The polar bear spends majority of its time out on the ice hunting seals and sometimes when small rodents are scarce on land the Arctic fox will follow the bears and eat their scraps. Wolves use teamwork to attack herds of caribou or musk ox for food. Lemming are small rodents that fluctuate every three to four years and with their fluctuations also comes the fluctuation of their predators such as the Arctic fox and the snowy owl.Chernov, I. I. (1985). 8. The living tundra (pp. 174‚àí176). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The keystone herbivores are the musk ox and the caribou. They have thick shaggy coats that they shed during the warmer months. Caribou use their nimble legs to escape quickly from predators while the musk ox use each other to make a fierce wall of horns.Tundra Animals. (n.d.). Tundra Animals. Retrieved March 11, 2013, from http://www.tundraanimals.net/ These animals help keep each other alive as well as the ecosystem around them. =Geology, topography and soil= The tundra is an extremely harsh, cold, windy and unique ecosystem found on the extreme north and south latitudes of our Earth. The soil consists mostly of frozen permafrost, which makes it difficult for extended root systems to grow, water to drain and support of a wide variety of plant life. This permafrost is also responsible for creating an extremely unusual topography. The land of the tundra is constantly changing as permafrost and snow melts and refreezes through the changing seasons. Land slumps and depressions occur as a result of melting permafrost that takes up less space when the soil was frozen. Depressions that occur as a result of melting permafrost are known as thermokarst, and are often in the form of pits, funnel-shaped sinkholes, valleys, ravines and sometimes caves. Pingos are another feature of the tundra, and can be defined as a cone shaped hill or mound of soil with a core of ice. Lastly, polygons make up a crucial part of the tundra and are created when two large cracks create a large ice wedge and slowly slumps into itself filling with water as heat from sunlight melts the permafrost. Often small lakes are formed from polygons on the surface of the tundra. The flora and fauna must adapt to extremely harsh conditions, however has been able to do so successfully through evolutionary change. Many threats exist today to the tundra biome including mining, oil drilling, increased habitat loss, human habitations moving farther north and global warming which is melting more and more permafrost and changing the delicate balance of the soils. It is imperative that we fully understand how our ecosystems function in order to monitor their stability through our changing climate. =Climate= The tundra is characterized by a harsh, frost-laden landscape with negative temperatures, a lack of precipitation and nutrients, and extremely short seasons. In the winter it is cold and dark, and in the summer when the snow and the top layer of permafrost melt, it is very soggy and the tundra is covered with marshes, lakes, bogs and streams. Spring and fall are only short periods between winter and summer. In the peak of winter, average temperatures can reach ‚àí30 ¬∞F. In arctic regions, there generally is not a great difference between daytime highs and nighttime lows, as the sun generally never rises or simply hangs briefly on the horizon. Summers in the tundra, on the other hand, are very short, in some locations only lasting a few weeks. Daily temperatures can reach up to 60 ¬∞F but overnight lows go down into the 30s, 20s or lower, depending on the region. This results in daily average temperatures to come out to around 50 ¬∞F. It may rain or snow, and frost still occurs. The average annual temperature is ‚àí18 ¬∞F. Nights can last for weeks, and when the sun barely rises during some months in the winter, the temperature can drop to ‚àí94 ¬∞F. During the summer the sun shines almost 24 hours a day. Temperatures can get up to 54 ¬∞F but it can get as cold as 37 ¬∞F. Average summer temperatures range from 37 ¬∞F to 60 ¬∞F. The tundra is very much like a desert in terms of precipitation. Yearly average precipitation varies by region, but generally there is only about of precipitation per year and in some regions it can have up to . This precipitation usually falls in the form of light, fluffy snow. =Environmental threats= Due to its vulnerable state, the powerful forces of climate change, ozone depletion, air pollution, and construction threaten the tundra's survival. The melting of permafrost increases as a result of global warming, which could drastically alter both the landscape and the biodiversity of the region. The ozone depletion at both the North and South Poles increase the strength of ultraviolet rays that harm the tundra. Air pollution around the world creates smog clouds that contaminate the lichen in the ecosystem, which is a major food source in the region. The construction of pipelines and roads to obtain oil, gas, and minerals cause physical disturbances and habitat fragmentation. There are a number of possible solutions, according to National Geographic, including switching to alternative energy, establishing protected areas and park reserves to restrict human influence, limit road construction, mining activities, and the building of pipelines in tundra habitat, and limiting tourism and respecting local cultures.\\"Tundra Threats\\" 2013 The creation of the Arctic National Refuge is an example of a measure being enacted to protect the North American tundra. The Arctic Refuge was originally created in 1960 by the Public Land Order 2214, which was created \\"for the purpose of preserving unique wildlife, wilderness and recreational values\\" and \\"withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining but not the mineral leasing laws, nor disposals of materials\\".Public Land Order 2214,\\" 2008 In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) re-designated the Range as a part of the larger Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and declared \\"that the ‚Äòproduction of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is prohibited and no leasing or other development leading to production of oil and gas from the [Refuge] shall be undertaken until authorized by an act of Congress‚Äô\\".Purposes of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge =Endangered species= Though species have adapted to the harsh climate of the tundra, several species have become endangered due to changing environmental factors. Both plant species and animal species have become endangered. The Aleutian shield fern is a plant species that has been endangered due to caribou tramping and grazing, slumping from growing substrate, and human foot traffic. Animal species that are endangered in the tundra include the Arctic fox, caribou, and polar bears. These animals have been endangered due to overhunting, infestation of disease, loss of diet and habitat due to climate change, and human destructive activities, such as searches for natural gas and oil, mining, and road building. In an effort to conserve these endangered species, many regulations and standards are being put into action along with establishing prohibition of unauthorized plant collecting. Standards are being set in regards to mining and mineral explorations. This will help in not disturbing the habitats as much. In addition to this, protection of caribou grounds has been established along with regulations in regards to removal of gravel roads for airstrips and road fill, which takes away from many of the animals‚Äô critical territories. =Effects of climate change= The tundra is one of the first places on Earth we have noted the effects of climate change. As an indicator biome, the tundra is a crucial part of the whole global climate system and can help predict the changes the rest of the world will face. The Earth depends on regulating mechanisms and air circulation patterns the tundra provides to keep climates steady worldwide. Human-induced climate change is devastating the tundra because intense complications are present in remote areas, free from human interference. Changes in climate, permafrost, ice pack, and glacier formations pose a serious threat to the stability of global climate because these conditions are influenced and reinforced by positive feedback loops. Temperatures in the tundra are rising to the highest temperatures recorded in four centuries and are rising more rapidly than anywhere worldwide The land surfaces in the tundra are no longer reflecting radiation from the sun out of the atmosphere. Soils and open water are absorbing heat from the sun and leading to more warming. Changes in the tundra influence climate change in lower latitudes because air pressure changes are shifting global air and ocean circulation patterns. Sea ice extent in the tundra has reached lowest recorded levels in centuries and this will dramatically affect people and wildlife worldwide. Changes in climate will be noticed first and seen most intensely in the northern regions of the planet. The tundra will show effects from climate change the soonest and will hopefully serve as a catalyst for action for people all over the world. =Natural resources= According to the US Energy Information Administration, the arctic tundra holds an estimated 13% or 90 billion barrels of the world's undiscovered conventional oil sources. However, there are a number of challenges to oil exploration, drilling, and transportation in an arctic tundra environment that limits the profitability of the venture.Budzik, 2009 Oil and gas fields in the arctic need to be large, with lots of proven reserves, because oil companies need that money to make the investment profitable. Natural gas is a more recoverable resource than oil in tundra eco-regions. It is estimated that there are 221.4 million undiscovered, technically recoverable cubic feet of natural gas in the Arctic. Oil sands, often pejoratively referred to as tar sands, are a phenomenon unique to the tundra environment and are profitable and plentiful in the Athabasca region of the Alberta sands.USEIA 2012 Oil sands consist of bitumen, which contains petroleum, found in a natural state combined with clays, sands, and water. Oil sands must be heavily processed and refined to yield synthetic crude oil, similar to conventional crude oil. Arctic tundra may contain minerals such as coal, copper, gold, iron, nickel, diamonds and the base feedstock for uranium oxide called pitchblende.Dowie 2009 =Iconic components= The arctic tundra has an exceptionally short growing period, minimal sunlight and limited resources, creating a brutal environment for plants and animals. By adapting to these harsh conditions, animals and plants represent iconic characteristics of the tundra. Plants grow in aggregated formations which provide shelter from wind, ice and also improves seed success. Animals have adapted with specialized organs, such as a rete mirabile, an organ that efficiently transfers heat. Frogs and amphibians use \\"anti-freeze\\" to prevent organ damage while hibernating. Polar bears, foxes and owls use insulated fur and feathers to protect for the cold conditions. These complex interactions between plants, animals and abiotic factors in the tundra are held together by the permafrost layer, located under the soil. However climate change is causing this crucial layer of frozen soil to melt. As a result, tundra communities are becoming unstable and basic processes are breaking down. Other factors such as oil development and drilling in tundra ecosystems has completely disheveled the wildlife and vegetation populations. Tundra exploration vehicles used for oil development and polar bear tours (\\"an eco-friendly\\" industry) leave traces of tire marks for 20-plus years after disturbance occurs. Other factors such as high CO2 emissions from tourism and from warming tundra soil, creates a positive feedback loop, acceleration changes to the tundra. =Northern Arctic= *Sverdrup Islands Lowland (ecoregion) *Ellesmere Mountains and Eureka Hills (ecoregion) *Parry Islands Plateau (ecoregion) *Lancaster and Borden Peninsula Plateaus (ecoregion) *Foxe Uplands (ecoregion) *Baffin Uplands (ecoregion) *Gulf of Boothia and Foxe Basin Plains (ecoregion) *Victoria Island Lowlands (ecoregion) *Banks Island and Amundsen Gulf Lowlands (ecoregion) =Alaska Tundra= *Arctic Coastal Plain (ecoregion) *Arctic Foothills (ecoregion) *Subarctic Coastal Plains (ecoregion) *Seward Peninsula (ecoregion) *Bristol Bay-Nushagak Lowlands (ecoregion) *Aleutian Islands (ecoregion) =Brooks Range Tundra= *Brooks Range/Richardson Mountains (ecoregion) =Southern Arctic= *Amundsen Plains (ecoregion) *Aberdeen Plains (ecoregion) *Central Ungava Peninsula and Ottawa and Belcher Islands (ecoregion) *Queen Maud Gulf and Chantrey Inlet Lowlands (ecoregion) TaigaIntroduction= The taiga ecoregion includes much of the interior Alaska as well as the Yukon forested area, and extends on the west from the Bering Sea to the Richardson Mountains in on the east, with the Brooks Range on the north and the Alaska Range on the south end. It is a region with a vast mosaic of habitats and a fragile yet extensive patchwork of ecological characteristics. All aspects of the region such as soils and plant species, hydrology, and climate interact, and are affected by climate change, new emerging natural resources, and other environmental threats such as deforestation. These threats alter the biotic and abiotic components of the region, which lead to further degradation and to various endangered species. Taiga in Alaska =Soils and plant species= The main type of soil in the taiga is a Spodosol. These soils contain a Spodic horizon, a sandy layer of soil that has high accumulations of iron and aluminum oxides, which lays underneath a leached A horizon. The color contrast between the Spodic horizon and the overlying horizon is very easy to identify. The color change is the result of the migration of iron and aluminum oxides from small, but consistent amounts of rainfall from the top horizon to the lower horizon of soil. The decomposition of organic matter is very slow in the taiga because of the cold climate and low moisture. With slow decomposition of organic matter nutrient cycling is very slow and the nutrient level of the soil is also very low. The soils in the taiga are quite acidic as well. A relatively small amount of rainfall coupled with slow decomposition of organic material allows the acidic plant debris to sit and saturate the top horizons of the soil profile. As a result of the infertile soil only a few plant species can really thrive in taiga. The common plant species in the taiga are coniferous trees. Not only do conifer trees thrive in acidic soils, they actually make the soil more acidic. Acidic leaflitter (or needles) from conifers falls to the forest floor and the precipitation leaches the acids down into the soil. Other species that can tolerate the acidic soils of the taiga are lichens and mosses, yellow nutsedge and water horsetail. The depth to bedrock has an effect on the plants that grow well in the taiga as well. A shallow depth to bedrock forces the plants to have shallow roots, limiting overall stability and water uptake. =Keystone species= Beaver, Canadian lynx, bobcat, wolverine, and snowshoe hare are all keystone species in the taiga area. These species are keystone because they have learned to adapt to the cold climate of the area and are able to survive year round. These species survive year round in taiga by changing fur color and growing extra fur. They have adapted to use each other to survive too. All of the predators depend on the snowshoe hare at some point during the year. All of the species also depend on forests in the area for shelter. =Hydrology= Watersheds characterize much of the taiga ecoregion as interconnecting rivers, streams, lakes and coastline. Due to a cool climate, low evaporation levels keeps moisture levels high and enables water to have serious influences for ecosystems. The vast majority of water in the taiga is freshwater, occupying lakes and rivers. Many watersheds are dominated by large rivers that dump huge amounts of freshwater into the ocean such as the Lena river in Central Siberia. This exportation of freshwater helps control the thermohaline circulation and the global climate. Flow rates of taiga rivers are variable and \\"flashy\\" due to the presence of a permafrost that keeps water from percolating deep into the soil. Due to global warming, flow rates have increased as more of the permafrost melts every year. In addition to \\"flashy\\" flow levels, the permafrost in the taiga allows dissolved inorganic nitrogen and organic carbon levels in the water to be higher while calcium, magnesium, sulfate, and hydrogen bicarbonate levels are shown to be much lower. As a dominant characteristic in the soil, the permafrost also influences the degree to which water percolates into the soil. Where there is a year-long permafrost, the water table is located much deeper in the soil and is less available to organisms, while a discontinuous permafrost provides much shallower access. Lakes that cover the taiga are characteristically formed by receding glaciers, and therefore have many unique features. The vast majority of lakes and ponds in the taiga ecoregion are oligotrophic, and have much higher levels of allochthonous versus autochthonous matter. This is due to glacier formation and has implications in how trophic levels interact with limiting nutrients. These oligotrophic lakes show organic nitrogen and carbon as more limiting nutrients for trophic growth over phosphorus. This contrasts sharply with mesotrophic or eutrophic lakes from similar climates. =Climate= When we look at the climate of the taiga, we are looking at average temperatures, abiotic factors such as precipitation, and circulatory patterns. According to the study in Global Change Biology, the average yearly temperatures across the Alaskan and Canadian taiga ranged from ‚àí26.6 ¬∞C to 4.8 ¬∞C. This indicates the extreme cold weather the taiga has for the majority of the year. As for precipitation, the majority of it is snow, but rain is also an important factor. According to The International Journal of Climatology, precipitation in the form of rain ranged from 40 mm average in August, to 15 mm average in April over a multi-year study. Rain is not the only kind of precipitation that affects the taiga; the main factor in precipitation is usually snow. According to CEC Ecological Regions of North America, snow and freshwater ice can occupy the taiga for half to three quarters of the year. A CEC Ecological Regions of North America document states that the lowest average precipitation is on the western side of taiga; can be as little as 200 mm and on the east coast it can be as high as exceeding 1,000 mm. As for circulatory patterns, we're finding that the temperature increases have led to a seasons shift. Global Change Biology also has noted with the change in temperature over time, as well as the overall climate change, the growing season has lengthened. Their findings illustrate that the growing season has grown 2.66 days per ten years. This growing season change as a result of global warming is having an extreme effect on the taiga. =Environmental threats= Climate change has played its role in threatening the taiga ecoregion. Equally as harmful are the human effects like deforestation, however many associations and regulations are working to protect the taiga and reverse the damage. Climate change is resulting in rising temperatures, and decreases in moisture, which cause parasites and other insects to be more active thus causing tree stress and death. Thawing permafrost has led to many forests experiencing less stability and they become \\"drunken forests\\" (the decrease in soil stability causes the trees to lean or fall over). Increased tree death then leads to a carbon dioxide outflux, thus further propagating the increases in global warming. It is essential for climate change to be combated with global action, which is what the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was created to do. Other measures to protect the taiga would be to prohibit unsustainable deforestation, switch to renewable energy, and protect old growth forests, (they sequester the most carbon dioxide). The taiga also suffers from more direct human effects such as logging and mining sites. Logging has been a very profitable business in the region, however fragmentation of forests leads to loss of habitats, relocation of keystone species, increases in erosion, increases in magnitude and frequency of flooding, and altered soil composition. Regions in which permafrost has thawed and trees have fallen take centuries to recover. Canadian and Russian governments enacted a Protection Belt, which covers 21.1 million ha, and initiatives like the Far East Association for the use of non-timber forest products, gives economic significance to the forests while avoiding logging. In addition to logging, studies have measured over 99,300 tones of airborne pollutants from just one metal extracting plant over a 50-year span. These pollutants are 90% sulfur dioxide, which is a precursor to acid rain. Other emissions include nitrogen oxides, sulfurous anhydrides, and inorganic dust. Forests in a radius of these sites can serve little to no biological services once affected, and there has been little appearance of protection measures to regulate mining plants. =Endangered species= The taiga is inhabited by many species, some of which are endangered, and include the Canadian lynx, gray wolf, and grizzly bear. The Canadian lynx is one well-known animal to inhabit the North American taiga region and is listed as threatened in the U.S. The mother lynx will have a litter of about 4 kittens in the spring. Following the birth, the female is the sole caretaker, not letting them out of her sight until 12 months when they begin to learn to hunt. According to the USDS Forest Service, protection for the lynx has increased since 2000, which marks the date it became protected under the Endangered Species Act. Since much of the lynx‚Äôs habitat is land managed by the agency, efforts to maintain and increase the habitat for the Canadian lynx using forest management plans are underway. The taiga region is also interspersed with various plant species. The endangered or threatened species include Labrador tea, lady‚Äôs slipper orchid, helleborine orchid, long leaf pine, ligonberry plant, Newfoundland pine marten, Methuselahs beard, lodgepole pine, and Scots pine. The life history of the long leaf pine is a tree species that has been around for quite sometime, and can reach more than 250 years in age. To begin the tree‚Äôs life, a seed falls from the parent in October to late November awaiting water to begin germination in a few weeks. For those individuals that make it, they will enter what is known as the grass stage. During this stage the roots are being established, and the bud of the tree is protected from fire. Years later, the long leaf will reach about in height and the diameter will increase with time. Somewhere around 30 years after the trees will begin to produce cones with fertile seeds and average about at maturity. One recent study discusses the effects of logging in the 1950s on pine species. Since then, conservation efforts have increased the number of pine (and other) tree species. The Nature Conservancy is prioritizing its protection efforts to rebuild long leaf pine forests through land purchases, conservation easements, and management of land sites. Restoration is also a large part of efforts to ensure the long leaf pine remains extant. By planting seedlings, controlling competitive vegetation, and controlled burning methods, scientists and volunteers are working to increase the number of the long leaf pine. Canadian lynx near Whitehorse, Yukon =Effects of climate change= Over the next 100 years, global annual mean temperatures are expected to rise by 1.4‚àí5.8 ¬∞C, but changes in high latitudes where the boreal biome exists will be much more extreme (perhaps as much as a 10 ¬∞C rise). Warming observed at high latitudes over the past 50 years exceeds the global average by as much as a factor of 5 (2‚Äì3 ¬∞C in Alaska versus the 0.53¬∞ global mean). The effects of increased temperature on boreal forest growth has varied, often depending on tree species, site type and region, as well as whether or not the warming is accompanied by increases or decreases in precipitation. However, studies of tree rings from all parts of the boreal zone have indicated an inverse growth response to temperature, likely as a result of direct temperature and drought stress. As global warming increases, negative effects on growth are likely to become more widespread as ecosystems and species will be unable to adapt to increasingly extreme environmental conditions. Perhaps the most significant effect of climate change on the boreal region is the increase in severity of disturbance regimes, particularly fire and insect outbreaks. Fire is the dominant type of disturbance in boreal North America, but the past 30 plus years have seen a gradual increase in fire frequency and severity as a result of warmer and drier conditions. From the 1960s to the 1990s, the annual area burned increased from an average of 1.4 to 3.1 million hectares per year. Insect outbreaks also represent an increasingly significant threat. Historically, temperatures have been low enough in the wintertime to control insect populations, but under global warming, many insects are surviving and reproducing during the winter months, causing severe damage to forests across the North American boreal. The main culprits are the mountain pine beetle in the western provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, and the spruce bark beetle in Alaska. =Traditional and emerging natural resources= Taiga (boreal forests) have amazing natural resources that are being exploited by humans. Human activities have a huge effect on the taiga ecoregions mainly through extensive logging, natural gas extraction and mine-fracking. This results in loss of habitat and increases the rate of deforestation. It is important to use the natural resources but its key to use natural resources sustainably and not over exploit them. In recent years rules and regulations have been set in place to conserve the forests in order to reduce the amount of trees that are cut. There has been an increase in oil extraction and mining throughout the United States and Canada. Exploitation of tar sands oil reserves has increased mining. This is a large operation that started in Alberta Canada. Oil extraction has a direct effect on the taiga forests because the most valuable and abundant oil resources come from taiga forests. Tar sands have affected over 75% of the habitat in Alberta taiga forest due to the clearing of the forests and the oil ponds that come from the extraction. These tar sands also create awful toxic oil ponds that affect the wildlife and surrounding vegetation. Oil extraction also affects the forest soil, which harms tree and plant growth. Today, the world population has an increasingly high ecological footprint and a large part of that has to do with the populations carbon footprint. As a result of that, oil supplies have increased, which has spread across the U.S. and into other countries. This is detrimental to natural ecosystems. Taiga being the largest region is seeing major consequences of our actions on extracting oil and natural gas. This is also causing climate change temperatures to increase at a rapid rate, which is affecting wildlife and forests. However, even though Human activities are responsible for the exploitation of these natural resources humans are the solution and have the tools to fix this issue. It is crucial that humans reduce the consumption rate of these natural resources in order to increase environmental conditions. =References= *A, Justin. \\"Bobcat - Felis Rufus.\\" Bobcat - Felis Rufus.

Washington, Oregon, and Idaho are mainly drained by the Columbia River, its tributaries, and other streams that flow to the Pacific Ocean. The Columbia River Basin is the fourth largest watershed in North America. According to a 2004 GIS inventory by the Environmental Protection Agency, there are approximately 10,535 lakes and reservoirs in the Pacific Northwest. The largest lakes in the Pacific Northwest include Lake Washington, Lake Roosevelt, Lake Chelan, Upper Klamath Lake, Lake Pend Oreille, Priest Lake, and Lake Coeur d‚ÄôAlene. In British Columbia the Fraser River watershed covers one-fourth of the land and extends from Mount Robson to the Georgia Strait and Gulf Islands. This basin is the fifth largest drainage basin in Canada and contains thirteen main sub- watersheds, each consisting of small rivers, streams, creeks, marshes, bogs, and swamps. The largest lake in British Columbia is Williston Lake which covers 680 square miles. Alaska contains abundant natural resources which include ground and surface water. The southwestern part of Alaska is drained by the Yukon River and its tributaries that include the Porcupine, Tanana, and Koyukuk Rivers. The Yukon River is the third longest river and fourth largest drainage basin in North America with a drainage area of 832,700 square kilometers. Alaska contains over three million lakes and the largest is Lake Iliamna which covers an area of 1,000 square miles. =Vegetative cover= Vegetative cover is extremely diverse within the northwestern forested mountain ecological region as the region can be broken down into different zones based on elevation, temperature and mean annual rainfall. Alpine communities; areas of high elevation (> 8,200 feet) can support the growth of herbs, grasses, lichen, and shrubs well adapted for these harsh conditions. Common plants here include mountain sorrel, capitate sedge, mat muhly, Newberry knotweed, and red huckleberry. Lichens such as the witch‚Äôs hair lichen and cup lichen also persist here. Subalpine communities; located below the alpine communities (6,500-8,200 feet) support the presence of lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, pacific silver fir, grand fir, and Engelmann spruce. The Engelmann spruce‚Äìsubalpine fir forest association occupies the greatest water- yielding areas in the Rocky Mountains and the natural adaptations of these trees are important in maintaining stable vegetation. The mountainous slopes and rolling plains slope from about 5,500 feet at the foot of the Rocky Mountains to about 2,000 feet in the lowest elevations. The dominant trees present in the region consist of; ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and quaking aspen the drier southeast and central portions. Western hemlock, western red cedar, Douglas fir, and western white pine make up the majority of the moist west and southwest portions. White spruce is also found at this elevation and is a keystone tree species found in the Alaskan interior. The dry southern interior grasslands and forests generally occur at low elevations (under 4000 feet) and usually have a lower canopy closure than forests at higher elevations that receive more precipitation They are characterized by very warm to hot, dry summers, and moderately cool winters with little snowfall. Frequent low-severity, stand-maintaining fires are thought to have played a key historic role in shaping these ecosystems. Much of this area consists of small scrub like ponderosa pine with bluebunch wheatgrass, blue grass, June-grass, and big sagebrush dominating the understory. =Fauna= This ecoregion is abundant with varying types of mammals, fish, and birds. Many dominant animal species, such as the bighorn sheep and hoary marmot, have adapted to the terrain of the region. The talus slopes provide burrowing shelters for the hoary marmot, and the bighorn sheep have adapted to climb the steep slopes in order to find shelter from predators (National Park Service). Top carnivorous predators include coyotes, wolves, and cougars. The grizzly bear is a keystone species found in this region. As an \\"ecosystem engineer\\", they regulate the species they prey on, disperse plant seeds, aerate the soil as they dig, and bring salmon carcasses into the forest (Suzuki). The dominant fish species of the region, in which the grizzly bear preys on, is pacific salmon. The typical bird species that can be found here include blue grouse, Steller‚Äôs jay, and black-billed magpie (Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 2008). =Endangered species= The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is considered a species of utmost concern in the Northwestern Forested Mountains region. This small raptor was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The current population is 15,000 birds, all of which are located in North America. Over 70% of the species‚Äô habitat was destroyed in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the timber industry is causing that number to increase. Both northern spotted owls and the timber industry prefer old-growth forests, so as demand for timber products increases, the spotted owl‚Äôs habitat decreases. Forest management plans that stress limits on timber harvest and suggest alternative options are being formed, along with plans to prevent habitat fragmentation. The barred owl is also causing a decrease in the population numbers of the northern spotted owl, as they are a larger, more competitive species that have begun to use the same habitat, however, no major plans have been formed to manage this situation. Malheur wire-lettuce (Stephanomeria malheurensis) is also an endangered species in the region. Only one population of this plant survives in the wild, located in Harney, Oregon. The self-pollinating shrub is found at high elevations in volcanic soils. Because the range is so small, any disturbance in the habitat could be detrimental. One of the main threats is Cheatgrass, which can expand to completely cover the ground and use up resources also needed by Malheur wire-lettuce. It is generally agreed that in order to protect the species, efforts must be focused on forming new populations, and more importantly, maintaining the condition of the current site in Oregon. =Natural resources= The Northwestern Forested Mountain ecoregion is rich in natural resources. Historically the most sought after resources were the minerals found here. The presence of gold drove much of the early settlers to this ecoregion. These early settlers extracted gold from the streams, and timber for building, flora, and fauna. Today many more resources are utilized by the economies of this area. Large scale mining operations have become less common throughout the entirety of the region. There are a few prospective industrial mines lobbying for permitting to dig in both Canada and Alaska. Canada is the 6th-largest petroleum producer in the world. The largest point of extraction within this ecoregion is in Alberta, Canada. This area is abundant in tar sands, a crude form of petroleum. In order to begin this operation large tracts of boreal forest are removed. After the large pits are dug there is a constant risk of further environmental degradation through oil spillage. Logging in the past was often conducted through large clear cuts. The environmental effects of large clearcuts became apparent and are now less common. There are logging techniques that can benefit the ecological integrity of a system. Group selection can mimic natural processes and increase both horizontal and vertical structure to a forest. As well as increase biotic diversity of both flora and fauna. Tourism generates a considerable amount of revenue for the different economies of this area. Tourists come to these areas for a multitude of outdoor activities. In the winter tourists travel from all across the globe to ski the Rocky Mountains, British Columbia, and Alaska ranges. In the summer the national parks draw in millions. Other summer activities include but not limited to hunting, fishing, mountain biking, backpacking, rafting, kayaking, and wildlife viewing/ photography. Resource use and extraction is sustainable when a system can replenish resources faster than they are being used. A practice is unsustainable when usage exceeds this threshold thereby damaging the ecological integrity of the ecoregion. =Climate= Extending from the lower Yukon of Canada all the way into northern California and Nevada, the northwestern-forested mountains range in different about three climate zones; moist maritime, arid dry, and sub arctic. The moist maritime climate of the Northwestern Forested Mountains is found along a narrow strip of coastal Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and southern Alaska in North America. It is formed by westerly winds coming off of the Pacific Ocean, which hit the mountains and rise to a cooler atmosphere. This causes rainy, cloudy, and moist atmospheric conditions where up to 100 inches of rain per year can be seen, and is a temperate zone ranging from about 15 ¬∞F in the winter to about 65 ¬∞F in the winter. The arid dry zone is west of the mountain ranges and doesn't receive much rain due to the north to south orientation of the mountains, which block clouds and precipitation. It can range from the upper 80s (¬∞F) in the summer to single digits in the winter. It generally only receives about of rain per year. The sub arctic region ranges from Fairbanks, Alaska to the Yukon of Canada and averages a mean of 50 ¬∞F. in the summer and is often negative 13 in the winter. On the mountain tops it can receive up to of precipitation per year, and often considered the snowiest place on earth. The Northwestern Forested Mountains experience phenomena called decadal oscillations, the La Ni√±a and El Ni√±o. This is a shift in temperatures from warmer (La Ni√±a) to colder (El Ni√±o) and each phase generally last about a decade. These phases are caused by many factors including, jet streams, trade winds, precipitation, land surface, temperature, ocean surface temperature, and sea level pressure. =Environmental threats to the Northwestern Forested Mountains= The biggest threats to this region are fires and invasive pests. As fires occur, they alter the forest composition dramatically. Fire scars create entry for heart rot and other fatal conditions. Burned soils repel water and the runoff creates sediment and ash polluting rivers and streams, harming fish and wildlife that depend on these water sources. An especially troubling aspect of fires‚Äô aftermath is the increased vulnerability of trees to non-native invasive pests. Burned stands create a perfect habitat for pests who will find shelter in the regrowth. These pests create tunneling galleries that further weaken a tree‚Äôs ability to fend off pathogens that lead to mortality. Preventing forest fires and controlling pest populations go hand-in-hand, which leaves room for any combination of treatment plans. Especially helpful is the use of prescribed burns, which consists of randomly dropping a match on a grid that has been divided and planted at scattered time periods. After the fire, workers must go in to peel bark off felled logs, and, if possible, remove dead, dying, and severely damaged/stressed trees as soon as possible. =Climate change in the Northwestern Forested Mountains= The effects of fossil fuels emissions, the largest contributor to climate change, cause rising CO2 levels in the earth‚Äôs atmosphere. This raises atmospheric temperatures and levels of precipitation in the Northwestern Forested Mountains. Being a very mountainous region, weather patterns contribute higher levels of precipitation. This can cause landslides, channel erosion and floods. The warmer air temperatures also create more rain and less snow, something dangerous for many animal and tree species; with less snow pack comes more vulnerability for trees and insects. A large contributor to fire susceptible forests is past land use; the higher air temperatures make wildfires more common. Wildfires are extremely detrimental for species inhabiting the landscape; they destroy habitats and it takes many years to restore the land to how it used to be. These effects caused by climate change can destroy animal habitats and species diversity. Not only will these climate catastrophes directly reduce animal populations, but it will indirectly disrupt trophic levels by reducing food sources for many keystone species. Climate change contributes to a worsening economy in this region as well by taking away valuable resources for recreational uses, like snow for skiing and fish for fishing. =Boreal Cordillera= *Interior Highlands and Klondike Plateau (ecoregion) *Alaska Range (ecoregion) *Copper Plateau (ecoregion) *Wrangell and St. Elias Mountains (ecoregion) *Watson Highlands (ecoregion) *Yukon-Stikine Highlands/Boreal Mountains and Plateaus (ecoregion) =Western Cordillera= *Skeena-Omineca-Central Canadian Rocky Mountains (ecoregion) *Chilcotin Ranges and Fraser Plateau (ecoregion) *Columbia Mountains/Northern Rockies (ecoregion) *Canadian Rockies (ecoregion) *North Cascades (ecoregion) *Cypress Upland (ecoregion) *Cascades (ecoregion) *Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills (ecoregion) *Blue Mountains (ecoregion) *Middle Rockies (ecoregion) *Klamath Mountains (ecoregion) *Sierra Nevada (ecoregion) *Wasatch and Uinta Mountains (ecoregion) *Southern Rockies (ecoregion) *Idaho Batholith (ecoregion) Marine West Coast ForestTopography/geography/soil= The region is strongly influenced by the large mountain ranges stretching throughout most of the coast. Changes in elevation cause changes in plant/animal diversity, this can be exemplified through observing the alpine tundra's vegetation which consists of shrubs, herbs, mosses, and lichens; while lower elevations, the temperate coastal forest hold magnificently large trees such as western hemlock, California redwood, and the red alder. These differences are in direct correlation with the availability of oxygen, and other nutrients at higher elevations. The mountains also create rain-shadow areas due to the clouds having to release their precipitation in order to get over the mountains, or be blocked all together. Trees, which perform better under stress, grow in these areas such as the Douglas fir (www.countriesquest.com). As for the soil, the region generally has a thin podzol soil, causing it to be extremely acidic. Farmers must compensate by applying fertilizers and lime to lower the acidic levels for agricultural viability.http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/gtr/gtr-nrs-80chapters/9-perakis.pdf Digging even deeper the then soil within the region will reveal mostly igneous and sedimentary rock. Colluvium and morainal deposits make up most of the surface materials. Mountains, which so intensely affect the region, are massive formations resulting from upheaval caused by continental collisionsWhy the West stands tall =Climate= The climate of the marine west coast forests is humid. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification System, this climate is very damp throughout most of the year, receiving a great amount of rainfall along with heavy cloud cover. The marine climate can also be defined with its narrow range of temperatures throughout the year. Precipitation is ample and consistent in the marine west coast, with many days of rainfall and a large annual accumulation. Many areas in the marine west coast climate have more than 150 days of rainfall per a year, along with averaging around 50 to 250 centimeters per a year of total rainfall (Britannica, 2013). The average temperatures of areas within the marine west coast forests usually range from 10 ¬∞C to 15 ¬∞C (Britannica, 2013). These mild temperatures are in collaboration with the moderating effect of ocean bodies on air temperatures due to the constant influx of oceanic air influencing the marine west coast throughout the year (Ritter, 2009). The marine west coast is located in the path of westerly winds from the ocean that contribute to its cloudy skies, significant amount of precipitation, and mild temperatures (Hollow, 2001). The rainfall, seasons, and temperature are all dependent on each other and are all affected by the global circulatory pattern. =Hydrology= The main watersheds in the region are the Puget Sound and Columbia River Watershed. Due to the region‚Äôs proximity to the Pacific Ocean, this ecoregion experiences large amounts of precipitation annually, creating a very humid and wet climate. The majority of river and stream activity is directly influenced by the annual precipitation patterns. In the rainy season from October to May, most of the low elevation rivers and streams experience peak run off levels. Rivers and streams at higher elevation are more influenced by snow melt and therefore experience peak run off from late spring into early summer due to the snowmelt. The permeability levels of bedrock in the area of interest dictate surface water in the region. Volcanic parent material, as found in Oregon, tends to result in lower levels of ground water due to the low permeability of the rock. Although areas with volcanic parent material may have fewer ground water aquifers, these areas tend to have better developed stream networks and higher stream drainage levels (Moore, 765). Areas with newer volcanic bedrock have higher levels of permeability, and are therefore more likely to have ground water aquifers. These areas will experience lower stream drainage densities and less developed stream networks due to the greater rate of ground water recharge (Moore, 765). =Keystone plants= The plants in this region are responsible for holding the geography and geology of the area intact. The North-South orientation of the mountain ranges combines with the moist polar air masses and mild westerlies coming eastward off the Pacific Ocean to form a weather pattern that dominates the area. This pattern consists of a temperate moist zone on the west side of the mountains and a drier moderate climate on the east side. The moist conditions along with glacial valleys cut by the glaciers allow for a variety of plant life to thrive. The softwood stands of the highlands are keystone species in maintaining land integrity. The ability of the firs and spruces to populate the high altitude and shallow soil works like glue to hold the soil in place. As you drop in altitude pines and cedars do the same for the lower slopes. Erosion control is key to keeping the glacial valleys and their rivers free from silt build up, which has the ability to devastate the salmon population, as well as holding the integrity of the mountain ranges. =Dominant species= Marine West Coast Forests combine aquatic ecosystems with temperate rainforests to provide habitat for an abundance of wildlife. The sea otter is considered a keystone species because of the critical role it plays in maintaining the structure of the ecosystem. Sea otters feed on sea urchins, which are herbivores of kelps. A large mass of kelp can become an underwater kelp forest, which is considered by many to be one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. Two more dominant species found in the Marine West Coast Forest are the gray wolf and grizzly bears. Grizzly bears provide a connection between the marine coast and the forests when they eat nitrogen- rich salmon and transfer the nutrients to the forests. The Pacific salmon provide strong sources of nitrogen for the aquatic ecosystems. Due to the high precipitation in this Eco region, the nitrogen levels can be very low. The Pacific salmon helps to normalize the nitrogen levels. Without anyone of these species, the ecosystem would fall apart. The Marine West Coast Forests are a unique habitat for a diverse group of species. =Threatened and endangered species= Several species struggle to survive in the ever disappearing and degrading ecosystems of the northwest. These species face a high risk of extinction; some iconic examples of those listed as threatened or endangered in this ecoregion include the giant sequoia, coast redwood, and marbled murrelet. The giant sequoia and coast redwood are listed as a vulnerable under the IUCN Red List standards (Conifer Specialist Group 1998). Large-scale logging, felling 90 to 95 percent of the old-growth forest between 1856 and 1955, is primarily to blame for these species‚Äô now limited range. The remainder of most populations of giant sequoias and coast redwoods is now almost entirely in parks and reserves (Farjon & Page 1999). Fire prevention policy, however, is most to blame for the continued declining of populations, as the build-up of undergrowth hampers the regeneration of both species (Vankat 1977). Luckily, plans to improve management and plant trees on cleared land are in place (Farjon & Page 1999). Though the marbled murrelet is still considered abundant, its population has undergone a rapid decline, principally because the old-growth forests in which they breed are subject to logging (Piatt et al. 2006). Current estimates are nearly half of historic numbers, suggesting just 350,000 to 420,000 remain (Piatt et al. 2007). The IUCN has listed the species as endangered (BirdLife International 2012). Hard forest edges resulting from forest fragmentation greatly subject murrelet nests to corvid predation and other associated disturbances (Peery et al. 2004). Declines in areas where logging is not an issue can be explained by the overexploitation and subsequent collapse of the pacific sardine fishery. Nylon gill-nets in shallow waters and oil spills have cause considerable mortality, as well (Piatt & Naslund 1995). In response, conservation measures have been implemented to slow the species‚Äô decline, including: the prevention of logging within identified breeding areas (Nelson 1997), the development of detailed research and recovery plans (Kaiser et al. 1994, CMMRT 2003, Escene 2007), and the protection of 179 square kilometers on Afognak Island by the Exxon Valdex Trustee Council (EVOSTC 1995). = Environmental threats = The Marine West Coast Forest's primary environmental threats are human development and population growth, logging, spruce bark beetle populations, and invasive species. This ecological region is home to large cities like Vancouver, Portland, Anchorage, and Seattle. As these cities continue to grow in population, greater tracts of land are being developed, and more resources are needed to accommodate these higher populations. Logging is another large human induced environmental threat to the ecoregion. Logging causes habitat fragmentation and adversely affects important species such as spotted owl, grizzly bear, and Kermode \\"spirit\\" bears, who all require large tracts of land to survive (Demarchi, Nelson, Kavanagh, Sims, Mann, 2013). The spruce-bark beetle is an insect that destroys spruce trees by tunneling into the bark of the trees. These beetles are widespread in the northern part of the ecoregion in states such as Alaska (Alaska Department of Fish and Game, 2013). The beetle‚Äôs distribution and survival rate has increased in the last decade due to climate change. Invasive species are also rampant in the ecoregion. These foreign plants and animals disrupt naturally occurring species in the ecoregion. Several solutions have been enacted to solve the environmental threats of the Marine West Coast Forest. Public land ownership is positively correlated with environmental preservation, as seen by the parts of the ecoregion located in Alaska (Alaska Department of Fish and Game, 2013). When land is privately owned, the most effective measures are education of the beautiful natural areas, smart land use, and planned efficient growth (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2006). =Climate change= The Marine West Coast Forests are located along the coast and some islands of northern California up to Alaska. The rise of the sea level will increase soil erosion of these marine areas (Coastal Areas Impacts and Adaptation). Depending on to what degree the sea level will rise, the introduction of salt water to the soil in the marine forest can slow and or destroy the growth of marine forest plants as well as the habitat of forest animals (Oberrecht). Freshwater flow will greatly disrupt the ecology of the Marine West Coast Forest. The trend seems to be that wet regions are getting wetter and the dry regions are getting drier (Song). The Marine West Coastal Region is a wet region that will most likely see these increases in precipitation levels. The precipitation level increasing will change the stream chemistry of vital spawning areas for salmon. Spawning salmon are most successful when the water is cold and with a steady flow (Coastal Areas Impacts & Adaptation). The rising temperature of the streams from rainfall instead of snowfall will be more likely to also develop and spread disease through salmon (Coastal Areas Impacts & Adaptation). The estuaries, where the ocean and river water meet is a very vulnerable area. The rising sea level will bring more salt water into the estuaries (Oberrecht). The salinity of the water will increase further up rivers and this can alter the mixing and flushing rates of the estuary, increasing pollution dramatically (Oberrecht). The change of balance in an estuary will also decrease the buffer effect that estuaries have against storms (Oberrecht). =References= *Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

It is one of the more rare in the world, with only five locations: the Mediterranean Basin, Southwest Australia, the Cape Province‚ÄîWestern Cape of South Africa, the Chilean Matorral, and the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion of California and the Baja California Peninsula. The region is typified by warm dry summers and mild wet winters. This is unusual as most climates have more precipitation in the summer. There are three variations to the Mediterranean climate in California, a cool summer/cool winter variation, a cool summer/cool winter with summer fog variation, and a hot summer/cool winter variation. The average temperatures for the cool summer variations are below 71 ¬∞F in the summer and between 64 and 27 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter. Average summer temperatures for the hot summer variation are above 71 degrees Fahrenheit. Average annual precipitation for this climate is per year. =Hydrology= Defined by the Pacific Coast on the west, the Sierra Nevada (mountains) and the deserts of California on the east, and the Northern California Coast Ranges on the north, the Mediterranean California ecoregion has unique physical characteristics that play a large role in the natural systems of the region, including hydrology. ;Precipitation The unusual precipitation pattern of the Mediterranean climate is due to subtropical high-pressure systems in the summer and the polar jet stream in the winter. Rainfall in the summer is uncommon because the marine layer becomes capped with dry sinking air. The marine layer is an air mass over a large body of water brought about by a temperature inversion from the cooling effect of the water on the warmer air. The marine layer is often accompanied by fog. The polar jet stream in the winter brings with it rain and snow. The jet stream is an extremely powerful air current flowing west to east often at over 100 miles per hour. The precipitation in the region is closely associated with winter frontal storms from the Pacific Ocean, which bring cool air and rain to the area. The annual rainfall varies in different elevations, but the average range is between annually. Much of the rain in Central and Northern California flows out the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, which with numerous tributaries run through an upper part of the ecoregion. Fog is also an important aspect of the hydrologic cycle in this ecoregion; the cooling of air over the warm seawater create an dense fog that covers large areas of the coast. This fog affects the vegetation and overall environment on the coast. On the contrary, fire also influences this region. The fire-flood sequence that occurs post-fire can greatly effect populations of species in the region. The combination of the geophysical characteristics, little rainfall, and the bodies of water in the region make it a unique, distinct environment. =Geology= Mediterranean climate California's geology is characterized by the meeting of the North American Plate and Pacific Plate, with much of its region near or influenced by the San Andreas Fault along the junction. When the two plates collided the Pacific Plate was pushed under the North American Plate, and the California Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada were uplifted. The Coast Ranges are largely metamorphic rock formed from the submergence of the Pacific Plate, and the Sierra are uplifted granite batholiths. Not along the San Andreas Fault, the granitic Peninsular Ranges system also uplifted with the collision, and runs from Southern California, down the Baja California Peninsula, into Baja California Sur state, northwest Mexico. The Transverse Ranges are another major Southern California mountain system primarily in the Mediterranean climate zone. Large earthquakes can do considerable damage to populated areas, and to the state's water, transportation, and energy infrastructure. The Central Valley of California is a significant feature of Mediterranean climate California. It was an ancient oceanic inlet that eventually sediment filled in, the deposition supplied by erosion of the surrounding mountain ranges. The soil is composed of both the metamorphic, oceanic crust-like Coastal Range sediment and the mineral-rich granitic Sierra sediment. The combination creates very fertile soil. The flatness and fertility of the soil, along with the almost year-round sunshine has attracted much agriculture to the area. As a result, native species no longer dominate the landscape. The southern portion, named the San Joaquin Valley, also produces two-thirds of California‚Äôs oil from underground reserves. Fossils are found where adjacent tar pits occur.

The Mediterranean California ecoregion, is well known for its large variety and abundance of animals. One of these important animals is the American golden eagle, which plays a massive role in maintaining the ecoregion‚Äôs ecosystem through its top-down predation on smaller, more abundant animals. The golden eagle is considered to be the apex predator of this community, and there are no other species bigger than them on the food chain. Their lifespan can be up to around 30 years in the wild and even longer in captivity. Native to mountain areas and grasslands, California is a great region for this bird of prey to thrive in. The main reason for the golden eagle being a keystone species of this ecoregion is their ability to keep small herbivorous mammal populations in line. \\"Prairie Dogs, ground squirrels, other rodents, hares, and rabbits, all of which eat grass and seeds, constitute 77.9% of the golden eagles diet.\\" They also are known to prey on animals such as, cranes, black-tailed jack rabbits, swans, deer, coyotes, badgers, mountain goats, bobcats, and various fish species. Another less popular species, but yet still keystone to this region, is the kangaroo rat. Studies have shown that kangaroo rats play very large roles in maintaining the population sizes and animal diversity throughout the region. Although they are small and on the verge of extinction, these animals play a large role in maintaining plant diversity, which helps the various herbivores with food supply, and also protection for other small animals seeking shelter. kangaroo rats occupy many land habitats ranging from desserts, and grasslands, to chaparral areas making them present in all areas of the Mediterranean California ecoregion. Kangaroo rats like to feed on many various grass seeds, as well as mesquite beans and thus is the reason that plants tend to not grow as well when sharing the same community with these rats. On occasions though, these animals like to feed on green vegetation, and insects. Unfortunately for the rat though, it is preyed upon by many predators. These predators include, owls, snakes, bobcats, foxes, badgers, coyotes, cats and dogs, and many more. Other dominant species in the region include, mountain lions, coyotes, sea otters, brown bears, and various large birds of prey. Dominant plant communities *See main: Flora of the California chaparral and woodlands. California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) field, at the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve. The vegetation in the Mediterranean California ecoregion is a mixture of grasses and shrubs called chaparral with some oak forests as well. This area is very highly populated and agriculture is prevalent in the valleys (Comm. of Env. Coop. 2011). Evergreen trees and shrubs‚Äîsuch as heaths‚Äîmainly dominate Mediterranean vegetation with a shrubby to herbaceous understory. Mediterranean vegetation embodies less than 5% of terrestrial ecosystems around the world. A very important aspect of this ecosystem is its frequent wildfires leading to most of its vegetation adapting fire response mechanisms (Vil√† and Sardans 1999). Common shrubs within this region are chamise or greasewood (Adenostoma fasciculatum), manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), coast sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and California-lilacs (Ceanothus spp.) (Conrad 1987). Because the climate is so dry and experiences frequent fires, competition is high among plants within this ecoregion. The Mediterranean community found in southern California is said to have a successional stage after wildfires. The fire leaves patches of bare ground which then are quickly filled with newly germinated seeds. Native and introduced herbs persist for the first year following a fire. Shrubs and subshrubs slowly fill in and hit their peak at four to eight years after the fire. Extinctions, unlike many other communities are frequently the cause of environmental extremes rather than competitive invasive species (Zedler et al. 1983). Human disturbance can increase wildfires with the introduction of grasses such as Bromus rubens which can be readily established in the newly burned, cleared patches. These grasses are more densely compacted and create more fuel for fires. Agricultural grazing can also greatly decrease the chaparral (tangled shrubby brush habitat), which is the home of many native endemic species (Fleming et al. 2009, Zedler et al. 1983).

Endangered species An endangered species is a species of organisms, either flora or fauna, which face a very high risk of extinction in a proximate time frame, much sooner than the long-term horizon in which species typically persist. There are many species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants that live in the Mediterranean California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. Yet due to a variety of factors including habitat loss due to the 30 million humans who share the land, some species are endangered. Endangered, threatened, and vulnerable species of the Mediterranean California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion include: *Fauna: Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis), California condor, clapper rail, least tern, least Bell‚Äôs vireo, California gnatcatcher, Smith‚Äôs blue butterfly, several species of kangaroo rat, Mission blue butterfly (Aricia icarioides missionensis), salt-marsh harvest mouse, San Joaquin kit fox, blunt nosed leopard lizard, San Francisco garter snake, Santa Cruz long- toed salamander, tidewater goby, green sea turtle, southern sea otter, and the Guadalupe fur seal *Flora: coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum), coastal sage scrub oak (Quercus dumosa), Pitkin Marsh lily (Lilium pardalinum subsp. pitkinense), Santa Cruz cypress (Cupressus abramsiana), Southern California black walnut (Juglans californica). The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) is one of the most iconic species in the state. With over a wingspan, condors are the largest flying land bird in North America. They are opportunistic scavengers that prey on large dead mammals. The main factors that led to the species endangered status were settlement of the west, shooting, poisoning from lead and DDT, egg collecting, and general habitat degradation. Serious conservation efforts have been made since the 1960s and this severely endangered species has begun a recovery path. A condor recovery program has been started and a wild population is steadily growing. Another species is the tiny and secretive San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis subsp. mutica) is one of the most endangered animals in California. The kit fox is the size of a cat, with big ears, a long bushy tail and furry toes that help to keep it cool in its hot and dry Californian Mediterranean environment. Biologists state that there are fewer than 7,000 San Joaquin kit foxes. San Joaquin kit fox populations rise and fall with the amount of annual rainfall: more rain means more kit foxes. Changes in precipitation patterns, including reduced rainfall and increase changes of drought, all caused by climate change, would affect San Joaquin kit fox populations. The change in the Central Valley from open grasslands to farms, orchards, houses and roads has most affected San Joaquin kit foxes, causing death, illness, injury, difficulty in finding a mate and difficulty in finding food. These kit foxes also are killed and out competed for resources by coyotes and red foxes. Another threat is poison used to kill rats and mice. A recent decision by the federal government to limit to use of these poisons outdoors may keep kit foxes safe. =Natural resources= Humans have used resources of this ecoregion for many years, dating all the way back to early Native Americans. Some traditional resources that are still used today are in danger of being overharvested. These include the Pacific Ocean fisheries, the dwindling timber industry, the rivers flowing from the mountains and the grasslands. All of these resources are either being over harvested or destroyed through agricultural and industrial development. Grasslands hold many native oak trees that are being lost due to overgrazing or forest fires. The overgrazing is attributed to the increasing number of cattle farms while the forest fires come from the use of natural water for human and agricultural use. As more water is used, oak trees lose out without this key component and fires increase due to drying out of the grasslands and forests. The government has tried to install conservation programs to halter the increased use of the land and waterways, but more must be done to create a truly sustainable environment. Emerging resources from the region are mainly high value agricultural crops. These include stone fruits, sugar beets, rice, nuts, grapes, cotton and specialized cattle systems. Many of these cannot be grown in other parts of the country and thrive in this type of climate. However, because of the dry seasons, these products require large amounts of water as well as varied chemicals and fertilizers to increase production. Many of these farming enterprises are enormous and not sustainable. They leach out chemicals, bring in mass amounts of inputs, and degrade a lot of the land. As with the traditional resources, the government has implemented conservation programs, but only a limited amount. Climate change Climate change in the Mediterranean California ecoregion is expected to ultimately have negative effects on the ecosystem and the region's biodiversity. The coast of California is expected to warm by as much as 2 ¬∞C in the next 50 years. This is going to cause hotter and drier seasons; the normally wet winters (when a majority of the ecosystem's rain in received) will be drier, and the summers will be especially hotter as well. Increased wildfires will result from the region's warming ‚Äì mainly in the summer. The shrubbery and trees characteristic of the California chaparral will not fare well in the warmer (and increased fire) region; grasses that are able to regrow asexually or from special off chutes will fare the best. Ultimately the soil quality is going to degrade due to the increased burnings and increased temperatures. Overall, climate change does not bode well for the Mediterranean California ecosystem. Environmental threats to the region There are several large threats to this region. Many of California‚Äôs large population centers are located within it which causes stress on the surrounding environment because people have a desire to move to California so new homes and industry have to be established in order to accommodate all of the people moving into the region and this requires expansion. Research shows that this eco region is already 20% urban environments and 15% agricultural lands. The research also concluded that population density and urban area has increased by 13% between 1990 and 2000 while agricultural lands in the region have only expanded by 1%. The study conducted also showed direct relationships between the growth of the population and the number of species that were threatened in the area. Expansion will break up the contiguous landscape and move humans closer to the native flora and fauna which will over pressure species that need large open tracts of land to thrive and harm the species diversity of the region. Prevailing winds coming from the west off of the Pacific Ocean all of the pollution created gets carried up to these higher inland sites and causes the species there to suffer with the pollution generated. The region is also plagued by wildfires. The area is becoming arid species diversity will drop as organisms adapted for dryer climates thrive. No current management plans are in place, a Species refugia to save struggling species that inhabit this region has been proposed by some. Forests similar to these are more resilient to such events due to the spatial arrangement, it would be possible to replicate this in the current forest and make it resilient to the fires that will increase in the near future.

Stretching inland from the Atlantic coast about 385 miles (620 km), they reach from Michigan in the north and Texas in the south; they cover the land of New England to Florida, Alabama to Michigan, and Missouri to the Appalachian Mountains. This ecoregion enjoys a mild and moist climate, though it is generally warmer as latitude decreases and drier as longitude increases.Gilliam FS, Goodale CL, Pardo LH, Geiser LH, and Lilleskov, EA. 2011.

Assessment of Nitrogen deposition effects and empirical critical loads of Nitrogen for ecoregions of the United States. Gen. Tech. Rep. NRS-80. Newtown Square, PA: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Northern Research Station: 99-116. Warm summers and mild to cool winters have provided favorable growing conditions for a number of plant species, the dominant being large, broadleaf, deciduous trees and (to a lesser extent) needle-leaf, coniferous, evergreen trees. Indeed, before the arrival of Europeans, this area was almost completely forested. After their arrival a few centuries ago, much of the eastern forests had been cleared for timber and to make way for cropland. In more recent time, however, these open areas have been abandoned and are slowly returning to forest. Although heavily influenced by people, the Eastern Temperate Forests have proven to be a very resilient region; these great forests still provide habitat for many birds, animals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects, as well as recreational and economic benefits for the people of the region.Commission for Environmental Cooperation (Lead Author);Mark McGinley (Topic Editor) \\"Eastern Temperate Forests ecoregion (CEC)\\".

In this region, there are four distinct seasons- winter, spring, summer, and fall. This seasonal variation is caused by exposure to both warm and cold air masses due to the biomes mid-latitude positioning between the polar regions and the tropics and is reflected in both the seasonal temperatures and precipitation levels. The highest temperatures, averaging 21 ¬∞C, occur during the summer months of July and August, and the lowest temperatures, averaging 0 ¬∞C, occur during the winter months of December, January, and February. The year-round average temperature within the region is 10 ¬∞C.Pullen, S., Ballard, K. (2004). \\"The Forest Biome\\". University of California Museum of Paleontology.

Retrieved from: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Experiments/Biome/graphs.php#temperate The Eastern Temperate Forest region can thus be described as \\"warm, humid, and temperate\\" with abundant levels of precipitation year-round. There are many global patterns that affect and contribute to the climate of the Eastern Temperate Forest region, such as global ocean currents, El Nino, La Nina, the Gulf Stream current, and global air circulation patterns. El Ni√±o, caused by warmer sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, can lead to \\"wet winters\\" and warm episodes occurring between the months of December and February in the southeastern region of the United States Eastern Temperate Forest.Pierce, David W. (June 1997) \\"What is an El Nino?\\" Experimental Climate Prediction Center.

Retrieved from: http://www.elnino.noaa.gov/lanina_new_faq.html The global ocean current that effects the Eastern Temperate Forest most is the Gulf Stream current which brings a warm flow of water from South to North along the eastern coast of North America in the Atlantic Ocean, it keeps temperatures in this region relatively warm. The winds that have the greatest effect on the climate of the region are the prevailing westerlies and the tropical easterlies. The prevailing westerlies, caused by the Coriolis Effect, explain why most major events that occur in North America come from the west and proceed east, which is where the majority of the Eastern Temperate Forest is located.National Geographer.

Retrieved from: http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/earth/earths- atmosphere/wind/ =Dominant plant and animal species= Fall foliage of the Eastern Temperate Forests The Eastern Temperate Forest Ecoregion has favorable growing conditions for a number of plant species, the dominant being large, broadleaf, deciduous trees. Before the arrival of Europeans, this area was almost completely forested. After their arrival a few centuries ago, much of these forests had been cleared for timber and to make way for cropland. In more recent time, however, these open areas have been abandoned and are slowly returning to forest. Of the many plant species that inhabit the Eastern Temperate Forests today, those of the oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus), maple (Acer), basswood (Tilia), and pine (Pinus) genera are the most characteristic and defining of this ecoregion.[Vankat, John. The Natural Vegetation of North America. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1979. Print.] These plants can be broken down into several main communities: northern hardwood, beech-maple, maple- basswood, mixed mesophytic, oak-hickory, and southern mixed hardwood forests. With the exception of Pinus, all of these species are angiosperms, meaning that they produce flowers and fruits, an important food source to many animals who inhabit the region. The flowers of angiosperms provide nectar, their leaves are important vegetable matter for herbivores, and their seeds are rich in fat and protein rich that allow many animals to fatten up for their winter hibernation. The trees of the Eastern Temperate Forests provide food, shelter, and a suitable habitat for countless species of both flora and fauna; they yield lumber, fuel, recreation, and aesthetic enjoyment to not only the people who live in this region, but also those who visit and enjoy products produced from the resources gleaned from these vast forests. Arboreal species are widely found in the region due to the high density of tree cover, providing a suitable habitat and food source for the animals; this includes birds and many ground squirrels. Migratory songbirds are common in the eastern temperate forests once the canopy opens up in the spring. Mammals that are native to the eastern forests are white-tailed deer, black bears, ground squirrels (gray squirrels and chipmunks), as well as red and grey foxes. Bird species include, the black-throated warbler, piping plover, and the yellow- breasted chat. Amphibious species that are common to the region are the American toad and the box turtle. White-tailed deer populations are very large across the eastern US, making it both a dominant and defining species. The white-tailed deer competes with other herbivores for limited food resources directly affecting the ecosystem, as well as indirectly affecting the area by altering habitats for small vertebrates and mammals. According to the Virginia Journal of Science‚Äôs research on white-tailed deer, deer are grazers primarily, feeding on the leaves of shrubs and such; however in the winter months they are found browsing the woody stems of shrubs and saplings. White-tailed deer have four stomachs, each with their own specific digestive action. The complex breaking down of food allows the deer to each woody plants and other things that most animals cannot digest. Areas with high deer populations, will see a dramatic shift in forest cover because small saplings and shrubs growth will be retarded on hindered due to their browsing habits. White tailed deer are polygamous; in the northern parts of the region they will mate in November and for more southern dwelling populations mating occurs in January. A female will give birth to one to three fawns, after a 6-month gestation period. After about 3 months, the young will leave their parents. White tailed deer typically live about three years but can live up to 15 years. White-tailed deer exemplify a \\"k-selection\\" species. They have long gestation periods, can reproduce more than once in a lifetime and are only a few offspring are produced at once. =Endangered species= The United States has more endangered species than all of the other continents combined, the Eastern Temperate Forest‚Äôs endangered and threatened species make up a little less than a quarter of that number.[\\"Endangered Species.\\" ASPCA.org] Endangered and threatened mammals (but not limited to) include, the Louisiana black bear, the red wolf, the Key deer, the eastern puma (cougar) the West Indian manatee, the North Atlantic right whale, the Mississippi sandhill crane, the piping plover, and the leatherback sea turtle. Endangered and threatened flowering/non- flowering plants include, the Virginia round-leaf birch, the Tennessee yellow- eyed grass, the Michaux's sumac, the Florida torreya and the Louisiana quillwort, among many others. The region is also home to the only two endangered lichen species, rock gnome lichen and Florida perforate reindeer lichen. Piping plover, Charadrius melodus The piping plover is a bird that has been on the endangered species list since 1985 in the Great Lakes watershed (including: NY, PA, IL, MI, and WI.) This species nearly became extinct after over hunting in the 19th and early 20th century due to use of feathers for fashion hats.Charadrius melodus. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Current potential sources of endangerment include, the development of coastlines for recreation, and detrimental material washing up to shore.Piping Plover (Charadrius Melodus) 5-Year Review: Summary and Evaluation. The management of the habitat sites, closing off sections of the beach where birds are nesting, creation of a mimic habitat, predation management, restriction of beach vehicles, and vegetation control are current conservation efforts being enforced.[The Birds of North America, Haig] The Louisiana quillwort has been on the list of endangered species since 1992; contrary to its name it is only now found in MI and AL.Louisiana Quillwort (Isoetes louisianensis) 5-Year Review: Summary and Evaluation Threats to this species include, pollution (herbicides and chemicals), construction in proximity to stream, vehicle traffic on or near stream, changes in flow rate and erosion (these two factors most likely caused from climate change.)Mississippi Louisiana Quillwort, Lyman Conservation efforts being enforces are, updates to where the population status is, permanently protecting existing habitats (through local and federal levels), look for potential populations that are not accounted for, preserve the genetic stock of the species remaining, and more in-depth habitat studies leading to population fluctuation. =Geology, topography, and soils= The Appalachian Mountains are a main topic of research, regarding the geology of the surrounding area. They formed when the ancestral continents of North America and Africa collided together and are about 480 million years old. The folded and thrust faulted igneous rocks, marine sedimentary rock and rocks that look like that of the ancient ocean floor, reveal that they got pushed up during plate collisions.[America's Volcanic Past - Appalachians, Blue Ridge, Great Smoky Mountains. (2003, May 20). USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO). Retrieved March 3, 2013, from ] Ice ages, during the Pleistocene epoch (after the Appalachians formed), contributed a great deal to the current appearance of the surrounding area. Surfaces that were once covered by ice were eroded and smoothed out during glacier movement. Therefore, the Appalachians used to be much taller when they formed, than they are today. Glaciers also deposited parent materials of the underlying bedrocks, which contribute to the formation of soils later on. There are very clear soil horizons, when looking at a cross section of this land. These are labeled and described (see Figure 2) as: O: organic matter, A: fine particles of organic matter and mineral material, B: material layer where most nutrients accumulate, C: parent material, and R: bedrock1. The U.S. Soil Taxonomy classifies Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Spodosols as good soils that can support temperate forests that like mature soils that can support deep root systems1. Different levels of nitrogen also have a big effect on a soils capability of supporting life. The presence of too much nitrogen can cause declines in species richness and abundance. The types of vegetation that exist in the Appalachian area heavily rely on the existing soil types and amount of nutrients available.[Kalisz, P.J. Soil Properties of Steep Appalachian Old Fields. Ecological Society of America: Ecology. August 1986. Vol. 67, Issue 4.] =Traditional and emerging natural resources= The Eastern Temperate region has a vast wealth of natural resources that are utilized by people. The two most common traditional resources include timber and coal. Timber specifically hardwoods, which make up the majority of timber from this region, are utilized widely for furniture production. In 1997 there was about 6 billion dollars worth of solid wood exports with 36% coming from the eastern United States.[Hodgetts, Rachel, and Roseanne Freese. \\"An Economic Overview of the United States Solid Wood Industry.\\". USDA/FAS, 2000. Web. 24 Feb 2013. .>] Coal is the other major traditional resource of the region. Coal is found on the western slopes of the Appalachian mountain range as well as in parts of Illinois and Indiana. In 2003 U.S. coal production was about 1.07 billion short tons and while not all of this comes from the eastern region a large portion of it does as 6 of the top 10 coal producing states are from within this region as of 2012.[Bonskowski, Richard, William Watson, and Fred Freme. \\"COAL PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES ‚Äì AN HISTORICAL OVERVIEW\\". Energy Information Administration, 2006. Web. 24 Feb 2013. ][\\"U.S. Coal Production by State & by Rank.\\". National Mining Association, 2012. Web. 24 Feb 2013. ] Natural gas and oil from hydraulic fracturing is an interesting relatively new emerging resource from the region. \\"Fracking\\" as it is commonly known involves sending pressurized water or sand into shale deposits into order to open up more cracks for which natural gas and oil can flow through, into the pipes and out of the ground. There were 8.982 drills as of 2011 in Pennsylvania alone that operated under hydraulic fracturing.[Amico, Chris, Danny DeBelius, Scott Detrow, and Matt Stiles. \\"Natural Gas Drilling in Pennsylvania\\". National Public Radio, 2011. Web. 24 Feb 2013. .] Though this is an intriguing emerging resource for the region it also is extremely controversial as oil and gas from the \\"fracking\\" process can sometimes seep into ground water and contaminate it. =Current environmental threats/ Impact of climate change= There are three major current threats to the Eastern Temperate Forest. These include agriculture, invasive species and overpopulation/urbanization. A major use of land in the eastern temperate forest is for agricultural purposes due to the rich soils which are easily converted to farmland. Pesticides in particular threaten the health of the eastern temperate forest region because they are used in massive quantities for agricultural production but are also widely popular in homes, businesses, schools, hospitals, and parks to maintain lawns or fields. Another problem with no easy solution that faces the eastern temperate forest are non-native invasive species like the emerald ash borer. The emerald ash borer is thought to have been introduced to Michigan from China about 15 years ago.[US Department of Agriculture, US Forest Service. (2012). Emerald ash borer. Retrieved from website: http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/disturbance/invasive_species/eab/] The adult beetles target ash trees as places to lay their eggs, when the larvae hatch they bore through the bark and kill the tree. The health of the ash population is of major concern because they provide habitat for many wildlife species and edible seeds for birds, mammals, and insects. The biggest threat besides climate change to the eastern temperate forest is its high density of human inhabitants. According to the Commission for Environmental Cooperation approximately 160 million people or over 40 percent of North America‚Äôs population, lives within the ecological region of the eastern temperate forest12. Such population density can be attributed to the concentration of the continents economic, political, and industrial power in this region. Major cities and sprawling suburban communities between them have drastically changed the regions landscape and fragmented local habitat. Roads and highways divide habitat and limit migration while urbanization and deforestation completely eliminate suitable habitat and food sources. Studies conducted by Kansas State University have shown that fragmentation can decrease population productivity by isolating populations, crowding species, and causing edge effect.[Al-jabber, J. A. (2003). Habitat fragmentation: Effects and implications. Informally published manuscript, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, Retrieved from http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/a/Documents/Habitat Fragmentation Effects and Implication.pdf] As the planet faces more intense and severe effects of climate changes, each element of the eastern temperate region will be affected, from flora and fauna, to soil and water. Vegetation mortality, soil content, species existence, water levels, and overall functionality of the Eco region will continue to change and be altered as global warming and the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. Climate change correlates with disturbances such as insect outbreaks, harsh weather, and susceptibility of forests to invasive species, all of which can affect the functions of a forest. Insect breakouts can completely destroy an entire habitat within one season. With increased drought and higher temperatures, the weakened forest can suffer from multiple tree species loss, along with the loss of animals and creatures that serve vital predatory roles within the ecosystem. Plants that are considered to be moist-forest herbs, such as Cohoosh and Clintonia, are threatened by the lack of available water that is vital to their survival. As climate change more rapidly progresses, temperature increases will affect the length of the growing season. Tree species growing range will shift to adapt to the new climates, typically moving to higher altitudes or more northern regions. For example, mountaintop tree species like the red spruce will potentially die out because there is no higher altitude that is available for relocation. In addition to the northern migration, southern species such as the red oak have expanded their territories. Therefore, as species that thrive in the lower areas of the region are expanding into a greater space, they are beginning to compete for resources and nutrients with pre-existing native species. This can be said for many bird species as well. A study conducted by the USDA Forest Service confirms that 27 out of 38 bird species that inhabit eastern temperate forests, have expanded their territory further north. The water cycle is also incredibly susceptible to the effects of climate change. The water quality and ecosystems within lakes, streams, and rivers are all greatly affected by the alterations of precipitation patterns. Increases in runoff potentially increase the chemical contents within the water, such as nitrate and acid pulses. Aquatic species are stressed by not only the warmer temperatures themselves, but also the low flows and timing of ice-outs and thaws. Such factors affect oxygenation cycles, productive cycles, and reproductive cycles. Seeing as though the Eastern Temperate Forest region is considered to be a significant evolutionary zone for fauna, the effects of climate change can substantially alter the balances and chains of not only the Ecoregion, but the planet as well. =Level II (Sub) Ecoregions= The Eastern Temperate Forest ecoregion is divided into five Level II ecoregions: Mixed Wood plains, Central USA plains, Southeastern USA plains, Ozark and Ouachita- Appalachian Forests, and Mississippi Alluvial and Southeastern Coastal Plains. The land formation of the area of the Mixed Wood plains is predominantly plains, with some hills, and the bodies of water are many small lakes. The surface materials of the region are moraines and lacustrine and the soil composition includes forest soils and fine textured soils. The mean annual precipitation of the area ranges from and the mean annual temperature generally varies between 4‚Äì10 ¬∞C. In this area, human activity includes fruit and dairy agriculture, major urban areas, and some forestry and tourism attractions. The most prominent wildlife observed are white tailed deer, moose, and the grey squirrel, and vegetation includes a wide range of trees such as oak, hickory, maple, beech, and some pine and basswood species. The second sub-ecoregion is the Central USA Plains, an area of , that has a landform of smooth plains. The majority of this region‚Äôs surface material is moraine with some lacustrine, and the soil consists of calcium enriched prairie soils and forest soils on moraine. The climate consists of a mean annual precipitation of 760‚Äì1,100 mm and average temperatures varying from 7‚Äì13 ¬∞C. Human activities largely include corn and soybean agriculture, major urban areas, and local dairy operations. Vegetation is mostly prairie type in the west, but also includes oak, hickory, elm, ash, beech, and maple. White tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, and grey squirrels are the most commonly represented wildlife. The Southeastern USA plains are the third Level II ecoregion and have a land area of . The majority of this land consists of irregular plains with low hills, which is made up of predominantly residuum and some loess on weakly developed soils. The climate of this region is an annual precipitation of and average temperatures of 13‚àí19 ¬∞C. Human activities include predominantly forestry with tobacco, hog, and cotton agriculture, along with major urban areas. There is a wide array of wildlife which can include white-tailed deer, grey squirrels, armadillos, wild turkeys, northern cardinals, and mockingbirds. The vegetation of the area is less diverse and includes oak, hickory, loblolly, and shortleaf pines. The Ozark and Ouachita-Appalachian Forests region is an area mostly consisting of hills and low mountains, with some wild valleys that make up the of land. This land is primarily residuum and colluvium matter on weakly developed soils and is put to use by humans through forestry, coal mining, some local agriculture, and tourism operations. The temperature averages around 17‚Äì18 ¬∞C annually and precipitation can be anywhere from , which provides a suitable environment for mixed oaks and hickory, white pine, birch, beech, maple, and hemlock trees. In this environment, black bears, white tailed deer, chipmunks, and wild turkeys are commonly found The final of the five Level II ecoregions in the Eastern Temperate Forest is Mississippi Alluvial and Southeastern Coastal Plains. The of land in this region is home to a very vast amount of organisms including animals such as white-tailed deer, opossums, armadillos, American alligators, mockingbirds, and egrets, along with varying vegetation from bottomland forests (ash, oak, tupelo, bald cypress) and southern mixed forests (beech, sweet gum, magnolias, oaks, pine, saw palmetto). The climate of 13‚àí27 ¬∞C and precipitation varying between annually provides adequate conditions for forestry, citrus, soybean, and cotton agriculture, fishing, and tourism. =Mixed Wood Plains= *Eastern Great Lakes and Hudson Lowlands (ecoregion) *Lake Erie Lowland (ecoregion) *Northern Appalachian Plateau and Uplands (ecoregion) *North Central Hardwood Forests (ecoregion) *Driftless Area (ecoregion) *S.

Thus, frost does not occur under these conditions.Commission for Environmental Cooperation. (1997). Ecological regions of north america. Retrieved from The temperatures remain fairly uniform throughout the year; therefore there is not a change of seasons. There is also no dry season, as all months experience precipitation. The average annual precipitation ranges from eight to fourteen feet per year. The high levels of precipitation usually cause poor soil quality because soluble nutrients are lost due to the nutrient leaching process. The average humidity is between 77‚àí88%. Nine out of twelve months of the year are considered \\"wet\\" months. The overall climate of the tropical wet forests ecoregion can best be described as humid, warm, and wet. George Hadley, a scientist who researched during the 18th century suggested that warm tropical air rises and moves north. Colder high latitude air flows south nearer to the Earth‚Äôs surface where it displaces the former air. Hadley‚Äôs explanation is highly accepted and still expanded upon today. The warm, moist air in tropical wet forests is unstable; meaning as soon as the air rises it becomes saturated.General circulation of the atmosphere. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/edu/k12/.atmosphere_circulation In addition, there are large amounts of heat, or convection occurring at the same time. The vast bulk of vertical movement of air occurs in the Hadley cell and thus provides an explanation for the global circulation patterns.Kushnir, Y. (2000). General circulation and climate zones. Retrieved from http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/gen_circ/index.html The direction of the wind at various levels of the atmosphere determines local climate and can result in severe weather patterns. For example, in an El Nino winter the presence of warm water in the eastern Pacific Ocean can shift the position of a subtropical jet stream. This results in heavy rainfall in the tropical wet forest ecoregion. Also, in a warming climate the Hadley cell could increase the severity of climate. As a result, the ecoregion may become hotter and wetter for longer periods of time.Tropical rain forests. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/troprain.htm =Hydrology= Hydrology in Tropical Wet Rainforests keeps the flow of water throughout the ecosystem, which nourishes plants, keeps local aquifers and rivers active and the environment in the area functioning.Bailey, R. G. (2009). Ecoregions of the united states. New York, NY: Springer New York. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-89516-17?LI=true The watershed and basin pattern have three major contexts; first, low-gradient drainage, second, typically high ground water table, and third, extensive drainage canal network. This idea applies to all areas, but have unique outcomes in Tropical Wet Rain Forests in North America specifically. Tropical Wet Rainforests have an excess of vegetation, compared to many other ecoregion types such as savannahs, and therefore have a much slower drainage rate than other ecosystems.Bryant, F. (2013). Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission. Retrieved from http://myfwc.com/ When an ecosystem has a high ground water table it separates the time between drainage and absorption of water in an area. It helps organisms to absorb nutrients, while also slowly filling up aquifers in the ecosystem. So primarily the down time between rainfall and drainage is slowed due to vegetation and climate, but now due to the vastness of the ecosystem, the drainage canal network is large and water can fall in one place, and end up in many other places at the end of the draining process. =Geology, topography, and soil= Wet tropical forests in North America span from sea level to an altitude of . They have particular geologic, topographic and soil conditions that characterize them. These characteristics influence biotic structures and relationships and have contributed to the high biodiversity of the ecoregion. The geology of these forests is primarily composed of folded and metamorphic hills, which are covered by a thin layer of alluvium (loose sediments and soil). The bedrock is sedimentary and rich in silica and dates back to the Precenozoic periods when much of the region was underwater. The topography of wet tropical forests includes valleys, hills, ridges and low mountains. Depending on elevation and the location of such features, areas as referred to as either lowland or highland. These elevation and topographical changes allow for a higher variety of specialized conditions, which increases habitat. The inclination changes (or slope) of the forest floor greatly affects water drainage and the leaching of nutrients, and valleys can have an accumulation of sediments and nutrients versus plateaus and ridges. But the most important topographic characteristic is the extensive network of rivers that weave across the landscape, acting as a drainage system to the forest that can receive upwards of 250 inches of rain a year. Tropical Forest river The soils in wet tropical forests are some of the most diverse of any region, and they are the cause for many biological adaptations. There is a combination of highly weathered and leached soils as well as less weathered alluvial soils, categorized as \\"oxisols\\" and \\"ultisols\\". Their pH can vary immensely, sometimes being as acidic as 4.0. The soils are generally shallow, often only a few inches deep. The soil is produced from decomposing organic matter and the breakdown of bedrock, but is generally poor in nutrients; most nutrients are found as superficial detritus and within the living components of the ecosystem. There are multiple reasons for why the soil is generally very poor in nutrients. Firstly, the warm and humid climate allows for a rapid decomposition rate, meaning that nutrients do not stay present in or on top of the soil for long before being absorbed by the biota. Secondly, the acidity of the soil, caused by the few cation exchange sites to be occupied by hydrogen ions, increases the loss of minerals such as iron, aluminium oxides and phosphorus. Thirdly, leaching, which is the continuous downward movement and loss of solutes and minerals from the soil, happens regularly due to the heavy rainfall. An observer would not be able to tell that the soil is poor from the lush, dense vegetation in these wet tropical forests; but shortly after an area of forest is cleared for agriculture (usually through slash-and-burn) the small amount of nutrients wash away and the soil becomes infertile. The ecosystems have developed highly specialized ways of mitigating effects such as leaching, but these functions are fragile, and need to be protected. This includes tree adaptations such as buttress roots and thick root mats that grow laterally along the forest floor. These adaptations mitigate nutrient loss by capturing the nutrients in falling detritus, before the nutrients are absorbed and decomposed into the soil, and lost from leaching by the heavy rains. The geologic, topographic and soil changes across wet tropical forest ecosystems has contributed to the astonishing biodiversity in biota we see today. Buttress roots =Plant communities= The plant communities of the tropical wet forest are the most diverse, abundant, and lush plant life in the world. The plants define the tropical wet forest by contributing to ecosystem functions, such as producing nourished rainfall and storing atmospheric carbon. Tropical wet forests are characterized by the complex, physical structure of the ecosystem. There are many layers of plant communities, though they are rarely visible from the ground. Shrubs and creepers fill the forest floor with saplings dispersed throughout. Large trees hold their full crowns in the canopy, prohibiting sunlight to plants below. Beneath the canopy of trees lies a network of stout branches, thick limbs, and climbers. Sometimes even above these trees, the largest of canopies fill the sky like individual islands.(Kricher, 2011) thumb Large trees, such as the pacque, allspice, and breadnut tree, provide habitat for most animal species and other plant species. The leaves are usually oval, thick, and waxy with pointed drip-tips to alleviate water collection. Roots are often buttressed (flaring from above ground), radiated across the forest floor, or stilted as prop roots. Lichens, orchids, and mosses cover the trunks of trees, retaining moisture and hosting small invertebrates. Most tropical trees have large, colorful, fragrant blossoms and plump fruits, perfect feeding for animals and insects. Climbers, hemiepiphytes, and epiphytes are the major groups of non-tree species, although they tend to inhabit trees. Climbers provide a road system in canopies for motile animals.(Ghazoul et al., 2010) Vines are large in biomass and are an essential food source to many fauna. Hemiepiphytes have the most unusual growth forms and are parasitic to larger trees. Epiphytes claim space on a branch and set roots, trap minimal soil, and photosynthesize. They adhere tightly to the bark of trees but, are not internally parasitic. As rain forests become drier and more disturbed, these native species become more rare. The loss of these plant communities severely affects the world, in regard to increase of carbon dioxide, high floods, and impure water. =Key animal species= Jaguar-Biouniverzoo The two main keystone species of the Tropical Wet Forest ecoregion are the American crocodile and the Mexican jaguar. They are both top predators and influence the population of their pray. American crocodiles create habitat for many creatures through their water holes and the paths they create. Their diet consists of fish, snails, birds, frogs, and mammals that come to the water‚Äôs edge. Males can grow up to 15 feet long and weigh up to 2,000 pounds while females range from 8‚Äì13 feet. Their average life span is around 45 years. Females lay a clutch between 20‚àí60 eggs which hatch after an average of 85 days. The mother leaves the young to fend for themselves after a few days.Mazzotti, F. (1999). American crocodiles (crocodylus acutus) in Florida. Retrieved from http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw157 The jaguar is the third largest cat in the world and the largest in North America. It is between 5 and 8 feet, nose to tail, and weighs between 140 and 300 pounds. Their average lifespan in the wild is 12‚Äì16 years while in captivity it ranges from 20‚Äì27 years. They have been observed to prey on around 85 different species, the most common of which are terrestrial mammals, they prefer giant anteaters, capybaras. Females become sexually mature around 2‚Äì3 years while males become sexually mature around 3‚Äì4 years. They have a gestation period about 100 days and give birth to an average litter of 2 cubs. The cubs are able to open their eyes after about 8 days and are able to walk 10 days after that. They stay with their mother for a year and half.Center for biological diversity. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/mammals/jaguar/natural_history.html =Natural resources= Tropical wet forests are known for their wide diversity of natural resources. Historically, the primary harvestable products they produce are from plants including exotic lumber such as mahogany, red cedar, and also gum tree for rubber. Other plants that can be utilized from this region include common food items such as bananas, cacao, oranges, coffee, sesame, alfalfa, cotton, and a variety of peppers. Following Spanish and English colonization of the area there was a shift towards larger scaled agriculture plantations. With these plantations came increased production of sugar cane, beans, pineapples, and chiles as well as an increase in harvesting of precious lumbers. This trend continued largely up into the 1960s when large swaths of land were cleared to make room for cattle ranches. Consecutively came the influx from the petrochemical industry to extract the vast reservoirs of oil that exist underground. This new development led to even larger portions of land being cleared for oil drilling sites and roads compounding the existing problem of deforestation in the region. One ray of hope for the future of natural resource procurement in tropical wet forests is the search for medicinally valuable plant secondary compounds. Plants that contain compounds that can treat ailments ranging from analgesics, antibiotics, heart drugs, enzymes, hormones, diuretics, anti-parasitics, dentifrices, laxatives, dysentery treatments, anti-coagulants and hundreds more exist and could prove to be a valuable economically viable as well as sustainable alternative to current resources being utilized in the area. =Environmental threats= Deforestation is the main threat to the North Americans tropical wet forests and has devastating consequences. Deforestation causes habitat loss and habitat fragmentation which have drastic effects on biodiversity.Turner, I. M. (1996). \\"Species Loss in Fragments of Tropical Rain Forest: A Review of the Evidence.\\" Journal of Applied Ecology. Vol. 33 No. 2. pp. 200-209. Deforestation of tropical wet forests has caused many native species to become endangered or extinct at an alarming rate. The Tropical Wet Forests around the global are being deforested at an alarming rate. For example, some counties like Florida have lost 50%Davis, S. M., Gunderson, L. H., Park, W. A., Richardson, J. R., and Mattson, J. E. 1994. Landscape dimension, composition, and function in a changing Everglades ecosystem. In Everglades: The Ecosystem and Its Restoration (S. M. Davis and J. C. Ogden, eds), pp. 419‚Äì44. St. Lucie Press, Delray Beach, FL. of their tropical wet forest habitat and Costa Rica has lost about 90%. Protection of the tropical wet forests we have left is very important for its continued existence. Many Reserves have been created in an attempt to protect the little we have left of these forests. Some examples of this in the United States are Florida's Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress National Preserve. Another important tool for the continued existence of tropical wet forests is Restoration. There have been successful restoration projects of a tropical wet forest with native species in Costa Rica. These restoration projects have been shown to significantly improve the native animal and plant species survival. It is necessary for good management plans to be developed if we are to use tropical wet forests sustainably. =Endangered species, threats, and conservation= Harpy eagle The IUCN Red List has 65,521 species listed as threatened in the tropical wet forests. The Harpia harpyja, harpy eagle is one threatened species in the tropical wet forests, they are the largest neotropical bird of prey, nest in the tallest trees, prey mostly on animals that live in trees, lay between 1‚àí2 eggs but only allowing 1 egg to hatch, reproduce every 2‚Äì4 years, and reaches sexual maturity between the ages of 4 and 5. The harpy eagle is suffering because of slow reproductive rates, hunting, food competition, fragmentation, and habitat destruction. There are many orchid species that are threatened in the tropical wet forests. Orchids are a smart plant that manipulate other species into pollinating them, and once pollinated they produce seeds that are eventually released in hopes to be carried to a specific type of fungi (depending on the orchid) where it will attach for mycorrhizal symbioses, and then bloom after a few years or decades depending on the environment and species. Many orchid species are suffering because of overharvesting, burning, clearing, and development. Many efforts are being done to help save both species. Spreading knowledge (educating), creating reserves, and coming up with alternatives are the top three actions being done to conserve both species. = Effects of climate change = Over the last 100 years the Earth's temperature has increased 0.6 degrees Celsius and it is predicted to increase an additional 3.5 degrees over the next century. Tropical wet forests account for only 6% of earth's land surface yet are responsible for 40% of earth‚Äôs oxygen production. Any type of change to this system can prove to have significant detrimental effects in terms of global oxygen availability. In addition, due to the sensitivity and fragile interactions between organisms and the atmosphere, ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration rates, will experience even larger adverse effects. Amounts of precipitation and moisture availability are also areas of concern. Global precipitation is expected to rise two-fold in tropical areas. This will cause shifts in vegetation as moist forest species expand into new areas of moisture. Increasing atmospheric emissions also plays an integral role in precipitation patterns. Annual rainfall is projected to decrease across the Everglades National Park causing a hydrologic change across the entire region. Dry vegetative communities will outnumber hydric vegetative communities in this particular area. Furthermore, a one degree increase in atmospheric temperature is the result from a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Effects of this increase on forest soil temperature include reduced tree growth and higher decomposition rates of deep soil organic matter. Ultimately, as the forests become a larger carbon source to the atmosphere, ecosystem services cease to function, and the delicate balance found in the tropics is disrupted, the climate warming cycle intensifies. =The iconic ecosystems of the region= An iconic ecosystem of this region is the complex interaction and the variety of biota along with fairly consistent abiotic factors; even though this eco region covers roughly seven percent of the earth's surface, its tree community is the most diverse on the planet. It would not be unusual to have 100 different tree species coexisting within a one-hectare plot. The tree community contains many broad-leafed evergreen trees, which form a high canopy (30‚Äì40 meters) above the ground. The understory contains a variety of more shade tolerant plants, which is a necessity for survival due to the thick canopy above. The vegetation is \\"spatially heterogeneous\\". This plant community survives in nutrient-poor soils conditions making disturbances (such as deforestation) to have greater effects because regeneration of the forest takes much longer. Tributaries and river systems have formed from the large amount of rainfall and typically carry a lot of sediments, but increase water demands and the construction of dams can further alter and strain these ecosystems. *Humid Gulf of Mexico Coastal Plain (ecoregion) *Humid Gulf of Mexico Coastal Hills (ecoregion) =Plain and Hills of the Yucatan Peninsula= *Yucatan Peninsula Plain/Deciduous Tropical Forest (ecoregion) *Yucatan Peninsula Plain/Semi- Evergreen Tropical Forest (ecoregion) *Yucatan Peninsula Hills (ecoregion) =Sierra Los Tuxtlas= *Los Tuxtlas Sierra =Everglades= *Southern Florida Coastal Plain (ecoregion) =Western Pacific Plain and Hills= *Nayarit and Sinaloa Plain (ecoregion) *Jalisco/Nayarit Hills and Plains (ecoregion) =Coastal Plain and Hills of Soconusco= *Coastal Plain and Hills of Soconusco (ecoregion) =References= * *Bailey, R.

Due to this fact, they are often used for agricultural, business, or petroleum purposes. These factors have been taking a toll on the desert climate, organisms, and landscape. These deserts are the Mojave, Sonoran, Chihuahuan and the Great Basin. =Plant communities= The North American Deserts are home to a variety of plant species. These plants are categorized as either xerophytes, adapted to the arid conditions of the desert, or phreatophytes, which are plants with very deep roots that are dependent on a permanent water supply and survive by tapping groundwater.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. (2013). Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/418771/North-American- Desert/41399/Soils Agave lechuguilla These species have come to possess several adaptations that allow them to survive and thrive in these dry and harsh conditions. One of the most common of these species is the barrel cactus (Echinocactus and Ferocactus). This plant was important to Native Americans and served a number of purposes, including use for food and water and creating fish hooks from the spines. Another common species is the Shin Digger (Agave lechuguilla). With its shallow roots, it is able to take in a large quantity of water and store it in its pedals for extended periods of time.\\"Lechuguilla: Agave Lechuguilla.\\" Lechuguilla: Agave Lechuguilla. Kenneth Ingham Consulting, LLC, n.d. Web. 24 April 2013. . The Ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens) is another plant frequently found in this area, which is a very unusually shaped plant. Because of this, it is often referred to as a \\"vine cactus.\\" This plant has an adaptive ability to photosynthesize during very dry conditions and gather large quantities of water when it is available.Royo, A. R. \\"Ocotillo.\\" Fouquieria Splendens (DesertUSA). DesertUSA, n.d. Web. 24 April 2013. . The Great Basin is also home to the oldest species in the world, the bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). Its needles allow it to retain water and use very little of it during its lifetime. It is able to grow on exposed rocky surfaces in higher elevations about forested areas. With these advantages come some drawbacks, including its very slow growth rate, which leaves it vulnerable to being out-competed by faster growing trees.http://www.nps.gov (2013, February 14). Retrieved from National Park Service website: http://www.nps.gov/grba/naturescience/treesandshrubs.htm =Dominant/characteristic species= There are a variety of mammals that define the North American Deserts such as the bighorn sheep, mule deer, white- tailed deer, ground squirrel, coyote, prairie dog, cottontail rabbit, desert packrat, and mountain lion. There are a number of birds and reptiles that thrive in these ecosystems as well. The cactus wren, Gambel's quail, burrowing owl, red-tailed hawk, hummingbird, desert tortoise, and vulture to name a few. An example of a keystone species in the North American deserts would be the coyote or mountain lion. These two predators can control the population and distribution of a large number of prey species. A single mountain lion can roam an area of hundreds of kilometers, in which deer, rabbits, and bird species are partly controlled by a predator of this caliber. They will change the feeding behavior or where they decide to nest or burrow is largely a reaction to the mountain lions activity. Another example, such as the hummingbird, new plants or animals could also come into the habitat and push out native species. In the Sonoran Desert, the hummingbird pollinates many native species of cactus and other plants. The hummingbirds in this region, such as the Costa's hummingbird, have evolved to have very long beaks and tongues that wrap around the skull in order to reach the nectar for that sweet sugar staple. =Topography, geology, and soils= The Great Basin Desert is the only Cold desert, bordered by the Rocky Mountain range to the east, and the Sierra Nevada ‚Äì Cascade to the west. The northernmost part of the desert lies above sea level, and due to high summer temperatures, not all of the fallen precipitation is fully absorbed into the soil, resulting in a high sodium concentration.Smith, S.D, Monson, R.K, Anderson, J.E. Adaptations of Desert Organisms: Physiological Ecology of North American Desert Plains. (1997) In other areas, mountain erosion has caused deep soils of fine particles, which allows for standing lakes. The Mojave lies between the Sonoran (south) and the Great Basin (north). Here, soil is shallow, rocky, and dry. The average elevation is between above sea level. The Mojave has several mountain range boundaries, the Garlock and the San Andres. They are made up of the two largest faults in the state of California. The Sonoran is referred to as the Base and Range geologic province. Here, the Mogollon rim exists of sandstone and limestone piled over millions of years. The basin and valley were made from volcanic eruption 40 million years ago, and the underlying rock is made primarily of cretaceous (aged granites). The Chihuahuan desert is made up of calcareous soils that have a high pH and calcium concentration. The soil is thin, sandy, and gravel like, and rests atop deep layers of limestone. Higher elevations allow water to sink deeper into soils that are made of finer particles, and deep sedimentary fans exist. Limestone beds show that this desert was at one point fully submerged beneath the sea. This desert features elevations ranging from above sea level, to below. =Hydrology= There are common patterns of hydrological cycles throughout the North American Deserts, but specifics of times and source of water range. All four deserts rely on rivers, precipitation, and underground aquifers to replenish their water supply.\\"North American Deserts.\\" DesertUSA. N.p., n.d. Web. 11 March 2013. . The water in the North American desert is mainly freshwater.

But, differences in seasonal rain create the differing hydrological cycles. The Great Basin receives most its rainfall in the winter. This leads to creation of playa lakes in the spring, as the snowfall melts and flows down surrounding mountains.\\"Playa Lakes  Wetlands  US EPA.\\" EPA. US Environmental Protection Agency, 6 March 2012. Web. 10 March 2013. . The Sonoran Desert has a bimodal precipitation pattern that includes winter storms and summer monsoons, which help sustain flora.\\"Sonoran Desert.\\" Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. N.p., n.d. Web. 9 March 2013. . The Chihuahuan Desert relies primarily on its intense summer monsoon for water. During the summer is when the area sees the accumulation of playa lakes. They may all have similar characteristics, but the difference in location and evaluation attribute to the diversity of their hydrological sources and cycles. Although the Northern American Deserts are characteristically dry, they still contain the water necessary to fuel their ecosystem and sustain the life of humans, animals, and plants alike. =Climate= North American deserts can be categorized by climate categories of hot and cold deserts. The cold deserts include the Thompson Okanagan Plateau, Columbian Plateau, Northern and Central Basins, Colorado Plateaus, and the Snake River Plane. All of these North American Deserts are included in the cold category, which indicates that they have a dry mid-latitude steppe or desert climate. These areas are affected by their interior position within the continent leading to broader temperature ranges and considerable rainfall. More specifically, these areas are affected by the rain shadow created by neighboring mountain ranges, acting as a barrier to westerly flowing air carrying moisture. All of these cold deserts experience about 100‚Äì300 mm of precipitation in a year indicating a semi-arid climate. The warm deserts of North America include The Mojave Basin and Range, the Sonoran desert, and the Chihuahuan desert. These areas have a tropical desert climate, and are known as the hottest and driest place on the continent. This is due to the continental interior location on the leeward side of mountains, with constant subtropical high pressures. The high temperatures throughout the year are due to the high percentage of sunshine caused by high sun angles. Increased distance from a body of water leads to a lack of clouds, which is associated with much cooler nighttime temperatures because all the heat of the day is lost. The only source of water in the warm deserts is an oasis; this creates an arid climate in the area distinguishable by the lack of moisture in the soil due to annual precipitation being less than half of the annual potential evapotranspiration. =Ecological concerns= The North American Desert biome is facing a variety of ecological threats. Human disturbance poses the number one concern to this fragile ecosystem. The Sonoran desert contains the two large cities of Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, which contain over 3 million people.AAAS Atlas of Population and Environment. (n.d.). AAAS Atlas of Population and Environment. Retrieved February 26, 2013, from http://atlas.aaas.org/index.php?part=3&sec;=son These dense human populations deplete the water table of the entire desert and are sending the desert towards desertification. Also, the Chihuahuan desert is seeing the effects of agricultural expansions, invasive species, illegal poaching, and extractions of resources such as salt, lime, and sand.Chihuahuan Desert  Places  WWF. (n.d.). WWF - Endangered Species Conservation  World Wildlife Fund. Retrieved February 26, 2013, from http://worldwildlife.org/places/chihuahuan-desert These activities in the desert lead to eventual desertification and a loss of overall biodiversity. A number of organizations such as the United States Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund have begun working together to conserve the threatened desert ecosystem. The less heavily populated areas of the desert are being sought out and conserved in order to prevent future human habitation and disturbance. Also, several organizations are now monitoring the use and health of the Rio Grande system located in the Chihuahuan desert, while also building new low tech water treatment facilities that will help to prevent overall water table depletion. The World Wildlife Fund is replanting disturbed, upland vegetation in order to retain species habitat and biodiversity. These measures are helping to protect and preserve the four North American Desert ecosystems. =Endangered species= The giant kangaroo rat is one of the most peculiar looking rodents around. The Dipodomys ingens can grow up to 34.7 centimeters in length and have a tail of up to 19.8 centimeters long. They can weigh up to 180 grams. It is mainly found in the San Joaquin Valley in California. The giant kangaroo rat forages for food from sunset to sunrise. Its diet consists mainly of seeds, that are sun dried and some greenery. They store food in their cheeks until they bring it back to their burrow systems, where they store food that could last them up to 2 years of drought. The giant kangaroo rats develop rather quickly. Depending on the environmental conditions, they can reproduce after about 5 months. Their litter size varies but averages about 3.75 offspring. These rodents are rather resilient when it comes to surviving under natural conditions, such as drought and low plant productivity. However, when the human factor is introduced, they have a much less successful survival rate. Aqueducts and other water projects started crisscrossing the giant kangaroo rat habitat. Agriculture moved in because of the new water routes and suddenly the habitat of many species became agricultural land. Kangaroo rats became a pest for farmers and rodenticide-treated grain became common practice which took out another chunk of their population. Nichol's Turk's head cactus (Echinocactus horizonthalonius var. nicholii) is one of multiple species of Echinocactus horizonthalonius. The Nichol‚Äôs Turk‚Äôs head cactus ranges from blue-green to yellow-green. It tends to be around 46 centimeters tall and has about a 20 centimeter diameter. It has 8 ribs that are lined with spines.

The biggest threats to these cacti are habitat loss to new development, vehicle/off-roading damage, mining, and human collection. Among other threats, erosion from foot traffic from drug and human trafficking in the area. =Climate change= North American Deserts, as in most arid systems, experience water and temperature change as the most limiting factors in this ecoregion. Climate change's major effects thus far have been an increase in average annual temperature as well as an increase in average annual rainfall. The most prevalent factor is the increase in rainfall events and the severity of the events. Between 1931 and 2000, there have been measurable increases in seasonal rainfall during the summertime monsoon in the southern United States and northern Mexico. Because of this increase in rainfall, changes in the vegetative cover have caused native species to disappear and invasive species populations to rise. The kangaroo rat, which also supported Mojave rattlesnake and burying owl populations, has essentially disappeared from the Chihuahan Desert, while the non-native Bailey‚Äôs pocket mouse has colonized the area. Increased rainfall has also led to decrease in soil quality and less vegetative cover, which leads to increasingly higher temperatures. In the Sonoran Desert, anthropogenic land degradation as well as natural erosion from increased rainfall has caused a 4‚Äì5 degree increase in average afternoon temperatures, which means for many species less available water and nutrients they need to survive. These effects will lead to less biodiversity in the area, which is one of the main combatant factors that biota have against climate change. As the effects of climate change continue to develop, North American Deserts will be increasingly affected, leading worsening biodiversity loss and decreases in the ecoregion productivity. Deserts are one of the most delicate ecosystems, relying on limited water and nutrient sources to survive. When these careful relationships are disturbed by the unpredictable and worsening effects of climate change, it will be very hard for these ecosystems to recover or endure. Bailey's pocket mouse =Natural resources= In the North American Deserts there are emerging natural resources within the ecosystem. A few natural resources within the desert consist of oil, sunlight, copper, zinc, and water.USGS. (1997). Mineral Resource in Deserts. Retrieved from http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/minerals/ Some of these resources are renewable and some are non-renewable. Most of these resources are being exploited by humans and most actions are not sustainable. Sunlight is one of the deserts most important resource as it is renewable and has sustainable exploitations. Deserts within North America tend to have fields of solar panels, so they can reuse the sun as energy. Areas such as New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, and the Great Basin area, put up fields for green energy.CERES. (2013). California‚Äôs Desert Resources. Retrieved from We monitored how the sun provides energy for resources such as plants and animals; we decided to make solar panels to produce energy for us. Water is also a resource found in the desert that can be reused and has sustainable exploitations. Oil is the most exploited resource within the deserts. In the North American desert most of the oil is found within the Great Basin region and this resource is non- renewable.Houghton Mifflin Company. (2005). California‚Äôs Resources. Retrieved from http://www.eduplace.com/ss/socsci/ca/books/bkd/ilessons/ils_gr4_ca_u1_c01_l4.pdf Oil is mined out of rocks and creates massive holes that disrupt the ecosystem.

Along with oil, this resource is also scarce as it is non-renewable and also has the same mining affects as oil does. This resource can be used for things such as computers, TVs, cell phones, and other electronics. Copper is mainly found in California.

(Compare to map of Level IV ecoregions.) This list of ecoregions in Oregon provides an overview of ecoregions in the U.S. state of Oregon designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC). The Commission's 1997 report, Ecological Regions of North America, provides a spatial framework that may be used by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and academic researchers as a basis for risk analysis, resource management, and environmental study of the continent's ecosystems. Ecoregions may be identified by similarities in geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife distributions, and hydrology. The classification system has four levels. Levels I, III, and IV are shown on this list. Level I divides North America into 15 ecoregions; of these, 3 are present in Oregon. Level III subdivides the continent into 182 ecoregions; of these, 9 lay partly within Oregon's borders. Level IV is a further subdivision of Level III ecoregions. There are 65 Level IV ecoregions in Oregon, many of which continue into adjacent areas in the neighboring states of Washington, Idaho, Nevada, and California. The task of defining and mapping these ecoregions was carried out by the Oregon Ecoregion Project, a collaborative effort involving the EPA, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the United States Forest Service (USFS), and other state and federal agencies. The new classification system they developed may differ from previous frameworks developed separately by the agencies. Oregon is ecologically diverse. The west side of the state has a marine-influenced climate and receives plentiful precipitation three seasons of the year. In contrast, Eastern Oregon lies in the rain shadow of the Cascades and is much drier. The climatic gradient is evident in the state's landscapes: forested mountains, glaciated peaks, shrub- and grass-covered plains, agricultural valleys, beaches, desert playas, and wetlands.

It stretches along the Pacific Coast from the tip of the Olympic Peninsula in the north to the San Francisco Bay in the south, including Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, and the Long Beach Peninsula in Washington, the entire length of the Oregon Coast, and the Northern California Coast. Named for the Coast Range mountains, it encompasses the lower elevations of the Olympic Mountains, the Oregon Coast Range, the Californian North Coast Ranges, and surrounding lowlands. The low mountains of the ecoregion are covered by highly productive, rain-drenched evergreen forests that are home to the three tallest conifer species in the world: Coast redwood, Coast Douglas-fir, and Sitka spruce. Historically, Sitka spruce forests dominated the fog-shrouded coast, while a mosaic of western redcedar, western hemlock, and seral Douglas-fir blanketed the inland areas. Today, Douglas-fir plantations are prevalent on the intensively logged and managed landscape. Lithology influences land management strategies; slopes underlain by sedimentary rock are more susceptible to failure following clearcutting and road building than those underlain by volcanic rock. The Coast Range ecoregion has been subdivided into fifteen Level IV ecoregions. Level IV ecoregions Full map). =Coastal Lowlands (1a)= The Coastal Lowlands ecoregion contains beaches, sand dunes and spits, and low marine terraces below elevation. Characteristic features include wet forests, shallow freshwater lakes, estuarine marshes, and low-gradient, meandering tannic streams and rivers. Residential, commercial, and recreational developments are expanding in the coastal corridor. Many wetlands in the floodplains of the region's streams have been drained and converted into pastures for dairy farms, and associated stream degradation has occurred. Mature forests in the region are dominated by a canopy of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and Douglas-fir, with salal, sword fern, vine maple, and Oregon grape in the shrub layer. The riparian zone supports red alder, western redcedar, and bigleaf maple with an understory of salmonberry; California bay-laurel is common in the south. Estuaries and coastal wetlands may feature Baltic rush, Lyngby's sedge, tufted hairgrass, Pacific silverleaf, and seaside arrowgrass with shore pine, sweet gale, and Hooker's willow. Stabilized dunes support shore pine over salal, rhododendron, and evergreen blueberry, with dune wildrye, Chilean strawberry, and dune bentgrass. Soil textures range from silty clay loam to sandy loam. The region covers in Oregon and in Washington, with the largest contiguous areas found near Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, the mouth of the Columbia River, Tillamook Bay, and along the southern Oregon Coast. Public lands include the Grays Harbor, Willapa, Nestucca Bay, Siletz Bay, and Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuges, the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, and numerous state parks. =Coastal Uplands (1b)= The Coastal Uplands ecoregion includes the headlands, high marine terraces, hills, and low mountains surrounding the Coastal Lowlands, with medium to high gradient tannic streams. Elevation varies from 400 to 2500 feet (120 to 760 m). The climate is marine-influenced with an extended winter rainy season and minimal seasonal temperature extremes. Abundant fog during the summer dry season reduces vegetation moisture stress. The Uplands region roughly corresponds with the historic distribution of Sitka spruce. After extensive logging, most of the Sitka spruce is gone, and today the forests are dominated by Douglas-fir and western hemlock, with a shrub layer of salal, sword fern, vine maple, Oregon grape, rhododendron, and evergreen blueberry. Wetter slopes and riparian areas feature red alder, bigleaf maple, and western redcedar, with a salmonberry and currant understory. The headlands are covered by grasslands. The region is nearly three times the size of the Coastal Lowlands, covering in Washington and in Oregon. Public lands include the Drift Creek Wilderness, the Siuslaw National Forest, and the Lewis and Clark and Cape Meares national wildlife refuges. California has not been mapped yet. =Low Olympics (1c)= The Low Olympics ecoregion contains foothills and lower mountains of the Olympic Range, with U-shaped valleys and high gradient streams. It rises to an elevation of approximately . Higher areas were glaciated. Copious precipitation (up to a year) supports a lush, epiphyte-rich rainforest of western hemlock, western red cedar, and Douglas-fir, with Pacific silver fir at higher elevations. Riparian zones support red alder and bigleaf maple forests. Much of the region is in the third rotation of logging, including land within the Olympic National Forest. However, a portion of the region lies within Olympic National Park and contains ancient forests with extremely high biomass. The region covers , entirely on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. The higher elevations of the Olympic Mountains to the east are designated as part of the North Cascades ecoregion. =Volcanics (1d)= The Volcanics ecoregion consists of steeply sloping mountains and capes underlain by fractured basaltic rocks. Elevation generally varies from 600 to 4100 feet (180 to 1250 m), although in some places the volcanic rock extends down to sea level. The region is marked by columnar and pillow basalt outcrops. Its mountains may have been offshore seamounts engulfed by continental sediments about 200 million years ago. High gradient, cascading streams and rivers occur, and the basaltic substrate preserves summer flows that are more consistent than streams on the sedimentary rocks in surrounding ecoregions. The streams still support runs of spring chinook salmon and summer steelhead. The region's Douglas-fir plantations are heavily logged. Mature forests consist of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, salal, sword fern, vine maple, Oregon grape, and rhododendron. Wetter slopes and riparian areas may support western redcedar, bigleaf maple, red alder, salmonberry, and oxalis. Grassy coastal headlands and mountaintop balds feature Roemer's fescue, thin bentgrass, California oatgrass, and diverse forbs. This large but disjunct ecoregion covers in Oregon and in Washington, including parts of the Olympic and Siuslaw National Forests and the Cummins Creek and Rock Creek Wildernesses, as well as higher elevations in the Cape Meares National Wildlife Refuge. California has not been mapped yet. =Outwash (1e)= The Outwash ecoregion is a gently sloping fan of glacial outwash material that forms a series of undulating terraces and plateaus. Elevation varies from 20 to 1000 feet (6 to 300 m). The region lies outside the zone of marine influence, and its medium gradient streams and rivers have lower summer flow than most other parts of the Coast Range. Mature forest types include Douglas-fir, western hemlock, red alder, bigleaf maple, and western red cedar, but today the region is largely dominated by industrial timber plantations. It is the smallest of the Coast Range subregions, covering in Grays Harbor County north of Aberdeen, Washington. =Willapa Hills (1f)= The Willapa Hills ecoregion (named for the Willapa Hills) consists of low, rolling hills and low, gently sloping mountains with medium gradient streams and rivers. It rises to an elevation of approximately . This region has a lower drainage density than other upland areas in the Coast Range. Logging is relatively easy and less expensive in this accessible terrain, and industrial timberland has almost completely replaced the historic forests. When disturbed, the silt- and clay-textured soils are easily eroded, thereby degrading stream quality. The vegetation consists of Douglas-fir and western hemlock forests, with sword fern, vine maple, salal, Oregon grape, and rhododendron shrub layer. Wetter slopes and riparian areas support red alder, western redcedar, bigleaf maple, salmonberry, and oxalis. Large herds of Roosevelt elk winter in the region. The region covers in southwestern Washington and in northwestern Oregon, inland from the coast. =Mid-Coastal Sedimentary (1g)= The mountainous Mid- Coastal Sedimentary ecoregion lies outside of the coastal fog zone and is typically underlain by massive beds of sandstone and siltstone. Elevation varies from 300 to 3000 feet (90 to 900 m). The region is more rugged than the geologically similar Willapa Hills. Its Douglas-fir forests are intensively managed for logging, and the slopes are prone to failure when disturbed, particularly south of the Siuslaw River. Stream sedimentation is higher than in the Volcanics ecoregion. The mature forest consists of Douglas-fir and western hemlock, with salal, sword fern, vine maple, Oregon grape, and rhododendron; tanoak may be found on drier slopes to the south. Wetter slopes and riparian areas support bigleaf maple, western redcedar, grand fir, red alder, salmonberry, and oxalis, with California bay-laurel in the south. This is the largest of the Coast Range subregions, covering in the Central and Southern Oregon Coast Range. =Southern Oregon Coastal Mountains (1h)= The Southern Oregon Coastal Mountains ecoregion is a geologically and botanically diverse ecoregion that is a transition zone between the Coast Range and the Siskiyou Mountains, which form part of the Klamath Mountains ecoregion to the east. Rising to an elevation of approximately , this region has the climate of the Coast Range but the varied lithology of the higher, more dissected Siskiyou Mountains, underlain by Jurassic sandstone, metamorphosed sediments, granite, and serpentinite. Distributions of northern and southern vegetation blend together here and species diversity is high. Douglas-fir, western hemlock, tanoak, Port Orford cedar, and western redcedar are present, along with salal, sword fern, vine maple, Oregon grape, rhododendron, California bay-laurel, bigleaf maple, grand fir, red alder, salmonberry, and oxalis. The region covers in a remote area of Curry County in southwestern Oregon containing the Sixes and Elk River drainages. It includes Grassy Knob Wilderness within the Siskiyou National Forest. =Redwood Zone (1i)= The low mountains of the Redwood Zone ecoregion lie entirely within the coastal fog zone. Elevation varies from 50 to 1800 feet (15 to 550 m). Historically, unbroken redwood forests moderated the local climate by trapping the coastal fog and producing shade. Remnants of unlogged redwood forest still survive east of Brookings, Oregon. Today, the region is characteristically covered by a mixed forest of coast redwood and Douglas-fir, with a shrub layer of vine maple, rhododendron, sword fern, and oxalis. The region covers in the far southwestern corner of Oregon. Larger sections in northwestern California have not been mapped yet.

Slightly larger than the Willamette Valley for which it is named, the ecoregion contains fluvial terraces and floodplains of the Willamette River system, scattered hills, buttes, and adjacent foothills. It is distinguished from the neighboring Coast Range, Cascades, and Klamath Mountains ecoregions by lower precipitation, lower elevation, less relief, and a different mosaic of vegetation. Mean annual rainfall is 37 to 60 inches (96 to 152 cm), and summers are generally dry. Historically, the region was covered by rolling prairies, oak savanna, coniferous forests, extensive wetlands, and deciduous riparian forests. Today, it contains the bulk of Oregon's population, industry, commerce, and agriculture. Productive soils and a temperate climate make it one of the most important agricultural areas in Oregon. Setting The ecoregion covers an area of , lying mostly in Oregon, with a small portion lying across the Columbia River in southern Washington. The ecoregion lies in the Willamette Valley, which runs from south to north between the Oregon Coast Range to the west and the Cascades Range to the east. The ecoregion is drained mostly by the Willamette River and its tributaries, which flows into the Columbia River straddled by Portland, Oregon. Landscape and threats Hillsboro Wilsonville Historically, the Willamette Valley forests were mostly an oak savanna, tall grasslands with scattered Garry oaks (Quercus garryana), and groves of coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. menziesii). The river floodplains contained extensive wetlands, stands of willow, alder, and cottonwood, and gallery forests. This landscape was maintained by the Native American inhabitants of the valley who set frequent fires which encouraged the open grasslands and killed young trees. The American settlers of the region, since the 19th century, suppressed fires and converted much of the valley to agriculture, which has caused much of the former grassland and savanna to revert to closed-canopy forest. Less than one- tenth of one percent of the original savanna vegetation remains. The remaining enclaves include a section of Garry oak savanna preserved at Mount Pisgah Arboretum in Eugene. Level IV ecoregions Full map). The Willamette Valley ecoregion is made up of four Level IV ecoregions: =Portland/Vancouver Basin (3a)= The Portland/Vancouver Basin ecoregion (named for the cities of Portland and Vancouver) is a geological depression at the base of the Portland Hills fault-block. It contains the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers and is composed of deltaic sands and gravels deposited by Pleistocene floods, notably the Missoula Floods. Elevation varies from 0 to 300 feet (0 to 90 m), with buttes as high as 650 feet (200 m). Historically, the basin was characterized by Garry oak groves and Douglas-fir forests on the uplands; black cottonwood groves on riverbanks and islands; Oregon ash, red alder, and western redcedar in riparian areas; and prairie openings maintained by Native American burning, with camas, sedges, tufted hairgrass, fescue, and California oatgrass. Numerous wetlands, oxbow lakes, and ponds can still be found, but today the region is dominated by urban and suburban development, pastures, cropland, and tree farms. The climate is usually marine-influenced, but easterly winds from the Columbia River Gorge periodically bring continental temperature extremes. The region covers in Washington and in Oregon, including the northern and eastern suburbs of the Portland metropolitan area. It contains several National Wildlife Refuges within the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge Complex. =Willamette River and Tributaries Gallery Forest (3b)= The Willamette River and Tributaries Gallery Forest ecoregion includes low-gradient, meandering river channels, oxbow lakes, and meander scars incised into the broad floodplains of the Willamette River and its tributaries. Elevation varies from 40 to 500 feet (12 to 150 m). The region includes the historic floodplains of the Willamette River system, which rarely function today due to flood control dams in the upper basin that have reduced the frequency and volume of floods and contributed to the decline of the endemic, endangered Oregon chub. A small section, designated as the Willamette Floodplain, has been protected within the William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge. Historically, riparian gallery forests containing ash, black cottonwood, alder, and bigleaf maple grew on fertile, alluvial soils. Today, most of the forests have been replaced by agriculture and residential development. The region covers in Oregon in a narrow band rarely more than wide that extends along nearly the entire length of the Willamette River and the lower reaches of the McKenzie, Long Tom, Santiam, Yamhill, Molalla, Clackamas, and Tualatin rivers, including the Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge. Ankeny National Wildlife Refuge in the Prairie Terraces ecoregion =Prairie Terraces (3c)= The Prairie Terraces ecoregion includes all terraces of the Willamette River upstream of the Portland/Vancouver Basin. It is dissected by low-gradient, meandering streams and rivers. Elevation varies from 160 to 500 feet (50 to 150 m). The region's broad fluvial terraces once supported oak savanna and prairies, featuring Garry oak, camas, sedges, tufted hairgrass, fescue, and California oatgrass. Wetter areas supported Oregon ash, Douglas-fir, bigleaf maple, black cottonwood, and an understory of poison-oak, hazel, and Indian plum, with some Ponderosa pine to the south. Today, only relict native prairie remains. The poorly drained soils derived from glacial lake deposits are extensively farmed for grass seed and small grains, as grasses tolerate poor drainage and poor rooting conditions better than other crops. Historically, seasonal wetlands and ponds were common, but many streams are now channelized, and the wetlands have been reclaimed for grain crops. In addition to agriculture, the Prairie Terraces have experienced the brunt of urban and suburban development along the Interstate 5 corridor. The region covers in Oregon along the length of the valley and includes the Baskett Slough and Ankeny national wildlife refuges. =Valley Foothills (3d)= The Valley Foothills ecoregion is a transitional zone between the agricultural Willamette Valley and the more heavily forested Cascade and Coast ranges. It contains rolling foothills with medium gradient, sinuous streams, and a few buttes and low mountains, rising to an elevation of approximately . The region receives less rainfall than its more mountainous neighbors, and consequently the potential natural vegetation is distinct. The eastern foothills are wetter than those that lie on the western side of the valley in the lee of the Coast Range. Historically, the drier areas supported Garry oak and madrone woodlands and prairies, with California oatgrass, fescue, blue wildrye, brodiaea, and other prairie forbs; while the moister areas supported Douglas-fir forests, with sword fern, oceanspray, hazel, baldhip rose, poison oak, and wild blackberry. Today, the valley foothills are characterized by rural residential development, pastures, timberland, vineyards, Christmas tree farms, and orchards. The largest of the Willamette Valley subregions, it covers in Oregon and in Washington.

As an undergraduate, Henige attended the University of Toledo, Ohio in the 1960s, obtaining first a B.A. then a Master's degree in history.University of Wisconsin Foundation (2005, p.24) In 1973 he completed a PhD in African History in 1973 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He undertook Fieldwork towards his degree in Ghana, West Africa. Henige's long association with the Memorial Library began during his PhD studies, when he worked for the library. After completing his PhD, Henige taught for a year at the University of Birmingham's Centre of West African Studies, a research department established a decade earlier by the noted Africanist scholar John D. Fage. Preferring the autonomy of a bibliographer to lecturing, Henige returned to Wisconsin in 1974See comments in University of Wisconsin Foundation (2005, p.24). to take a position at the Memorial Library. He thereafter completed a master's degree in Library and information science in 1978. Henige was the founder and editor of the journal History in Africa from 1974 to 2010.

Somewhat smaller than the Cascade mountain range for which it is named, the ecoregion extends north to Snoqualmie Pass, near Seattle, and south to Hayden Pass, near the Oregon-California border, including the peaks and western slopes of most of the High Cascades. A discontiguous section is located on Mount Shasta in California. The mountainous region is underlain by Cenozoic volcanic rock that has been affected by alpine glaciations. The eastern part of the region contains active and dormant volcanoes in the Cascades Volcanic Arc, with elevations of up to . The western Cascades are older, lower, and dissected by numerous, steep-sided stream valleys. The region has a moist, temperate climate, which supports an extensive and highly productive coniferous forest that is intensively managed for logging, as well as recreational use. Subalpine meadows occur at higher elevations. Much of the region consists of public lands managed by the federal government, including the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie, Wenatchee, Gifford Pinchot, Mount Hood, Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Willamette, Umpqua, and Rogue River National Forests; the Clearwater, Norse Peak, Tatoosh, William O. Douglas, Goat Rocks, Mount Adams, Indian Heaven, Trapper Creek, Salmon‚ÄìHuckleberry, Mount Hood, Table Rock, Bull of the Woods, Opal Creek, Middle Santiam, Menagerie, Mount Jefferson, Mount Washington, Three Sisters, Diamond Peak, Boulder Creek, Mount Thielsen, Rogue‚ÄìUmpqua Divide, Sky Lakes, and Mountain Lakes Wilderness Areas; Mount Rainier and Crater Lake National Parks; and the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. The Cascades is bordered on the north by the North Cascades ecoregion, on the south by the Klamath Mountains ecoregion, on the east by the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills, and on the west by the Willamette Valley and Puget Lowland ecoregions. It been subdivided into six Level IV ecoregions in Washington and Oregon, as described below. Level IV mapping is not yet complete in California. Animals include black bears, deer, elk, bobcats, cougars, coyotes, skunks, raccoons, and chipmunks. Level IV ecoregions Full map). =Western Cascades Lowlands and Valleys (4a)= The Western Cascades Lowlands and Valleys ecoregion comprises a network of steep ridges and narrow valleys on the lower slopes of the Cascade Mountains. Elevation varies from . Its mild, wet climate promotes lush forests dominated by western hemlock and Douglas-fir, with western redcedar, bigleaf maple, red alder, vine maple, salal, rhododendron, Oregon grape, huckleberry, thimbleberry, swordfern, oxalis, hazel, and blackberry. Soils are warmer here than in higher elevation ecoregions, and it is one of the most important timber producing areas in the Pacific Northwest. The steep valleys trending to the west contain high and medium gradient rivers and streams that support cold water salmonids, including the threatened Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout. Notable river drainages in Oregon include the North Umpqua, North and Middle Forks of the Willamette, McKenzie, North Santiam, South Santiam, Clackamas, Salmon and Bull Run River watersheds; and in Washington, the Lewis, Cowlitz, Nisqually, Puyallup, White, and Green River watersheds. Reservoirs store winter snowmelt for irrigation and municipal water supply in the Willamette Valley. The Westerns Cascades Lowlands and Valleys is the largest of the Cascades subregions, covering in Oregon and in Washington. =Western Cascades Montane Highlands (4b)= The Western Cascades Montane Highlands ecoregion is characterized by steeply sloping, dissected mountains with high to medium gradient streams and glacial rock-basin lakes. Elevation varies from . The western Cascades are older and more eroded than the lava plateau and prominent snow-covered cones of the High Cascades to the east. They are underlain by dark basalt in contrast to the gray andesite of the High Cascades. The region has lower temperatures and receives more winter snow than the lowlands and valleys to the west. Soils have a frigid or cryic temperature regimes. Abundant precipitation supports forests dominated by Douglas-fir and western hemlock, with mountain hemlock, noble fir, subalpine fir, grand fir, Pacific silver fir, red alder, and Pacific yew, and an understory of vine maple, rhododendron, Oregon grape, huckleberry, and thimbleberry. Today, the region is heavily managed for logging and recreation, and it is an important water source for lower elevation urban, suburban, and agricultural areas. It is the second-largest of the Cascades subregions, covering in Oregon and in Washington. =Cascade Crest Montane Forest (4c)= The Cascade Crest Montane Forest ecoregion consists of an undulating plateau punctuated by volcanic buttes and cones that reach a maximum elevation of about . Volcanism in the Pliocene epoch overtopped the existing Miocene volcanics of the Western Cascades Montane Highlands. Later, Pleistocene glaciation left numerous rock- basin lakes throughout the plateau. Sinuous, medium gradient streams cross the subdued, glaciated terrain. The region is extensively forested with mountain hemlock, Pacific silver fir, and subalpine fir, with some grand fir, noble fir, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine, and an understory of vine maple, huckleberry, rhododendron, beargrass, twinflower, and wintergreen. Mountain meadows support sedges, dwarf willows, and tufted hairgrass. The region covers in Oregon and in Washington, running along the spine of the Cascades; an isolated pocket of this ecoregion can be found on Newberry Volcano southeast of Bend. =Cascades Subalpine/Alpine (4d)= The Cascades Subalpine/Alpine ecoregion is an area of high, glaciated, volcanic peaks rising above subalpine meadows, with cascading streams, glacial cirques, and tarns. Pleistocene glaciation reshaped the mountains above , leaving moraines, glacial lakes, and U-shaped glacial canyons. Glaciers and permanent snowfields still occur on the highest peaks, decreasing from north to south. The vegetation is adapted to high elevations, cold winter temperatures, a short growing season, and a deep winter snow pack. Herbaceous and shrubby subalpine meadow vegetation and scattered patches of mountain hemlock, subalpine fir, and whitebark pine occur near the timberline. Wet meadows support Brewer's sedge, Holm's sedge, black alpine sedge, tufted hairgrass, and alpine aster. Elsewhere, there is bare rock. The region covers in Washington and in Oregon and contains many of the prominent volcanic peaks of the high Cascades, including Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters, Mount Bachelor, Diamond Peak, Mount Scott, and Mount McLoughlin. =High Southern Cascades Montane Forest (4e)= The High Southern Cascades Montane Forest ecoregion is an undulating, glaciated, volcanic plateau punctuated by isolated buttes and cones. Many tarns occur. With an elevation that varies from , it is an intermediate zone between the Southern Cascades and the Subalpine/Alpine zone. Cryic soils support mixed coniferous forests dominated by mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, and Pacific silver fir; they are colder than the mesic and frigid soils of the Southern Cascades. Grand fir, white fir, and Shasta red fir also occur and become more common toward the south and east. Whitebark pine is found at high elevations. Understory plants include woodrush, Prince's pine, lupine, and sidebells shinleaf. At the highest elevations, open meadows support Shasta buckwheat, Newberry knotweed, and Brewer's sedge. The region tends to be drier than the Cascade Crest Montane Forest, with a longer summer drought and more intermittent streams. The region covers in Southern Oregon and includes the lower elevations of Crater Lake National Park. =Southern Cascades (4f)= The Southern Cascades ecoregion is lower in elevation and less rugged than the surrounding regions and is characterized by gently sloping mountains and broad valleys. Elevation varies from . The climate is drier than other parts of the Cascades, and the vegetation reflects the long summer drought. River and stream discharge are also significantly lower than in systems to the north. Western hemlock and western red cedar, which are indicator species in the Western Cascades ecoregions, decline southward in the Southern Cascades, and are replaced by Sierra Nevada species such as California incense-cedar, white fir, Shasta red fir, and sugar pine, with an understory of snowberry, twinflower, Oregon grape, serviceberry, golden chinkapin, and oceanspray. At lower elevations, Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine are prevalent. The region covers in Southern Oregon, in the South Umpqua and Rogue River watersheds, separated from the Western Cascades by the Calapooya Divide.

In the rain shadow of the Cascade Range, the eastern side of the mountains experiences greater temperature extremes and receives less precipitation than the west side. Open forests of ponderosa pine and some lodgepole pine distinguish this region from the Cascades ecoregion, where hemlock and fir forests are more common, and from the lower, drier ecoregions to the east, where shrubs and grasslands are predominant. The vegetation is adapted to the prevailing dry, continental climate and frequent wildfire. Volcanic cones and buttes are common in much of the region. The Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills ecoregion has been subdivided into ten Level IV ecoregions, as described below. Level IV mapping is not yet complete in California, and the information below includes only the sections in Washington and Oregon. Level IV ecoregions Full map). =Yakima Plateau and Slopes (9a)= The high, unglaciated Yakima Plateau and Slopes ecoregion is characterized by plateaus, buttes, and canyons, with medium to high gradient permanent and intermittent streams and rivers on a surface of basalt. Natural springs occur, especially in the south. Elevation varies from . The dry continental climate supports open woodlands dominated by ponderosa pine and bitterbrush, with some Douglas-fir and Oregon white oak. Fire is an integral part of the ecosystem. The region covers in Washington, mainly on land belonging to the Yakama Nation. =Grand Fir Mixed Forest (9b)= The Grand Fir Mixed Forest ecoregion is characterized by high, glaciated plateaus, mountains, and canyons containing high gradient streams and rivers. Scattered lakes occur in glacial rock basins. Elevation varies from . The frigid soils and snowy, continental climate support a mix of grand fir and Douglas-fir, with some ponderosa pine and western larch. Plants in the understory include vine maple, hazel, snowberry, and oceanspray. The region covers in Washington and in Oregon, on the eastern slopes of Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, and Mount Hood, and on Black Butte. It contains land belonging to the Yakama Nation and public land within the Wenatchee, Gifford Pinchot, Deschutes, and Mount Hood National Forests (including the Badger Creek Wilderness). =Oak/Conifer Foothills (9c)= The Oak/Conifer Foothills ecoregion is lower and drier than the Grand Fir Mixed Forest and more diverse than other parts of the Eastern Cascades. It consists of foothills, low mountains, plateaus, and valleys from . Marine weather enters the region via the Columbia River Gorge, moderating the otherwise continental climate. As a result, soil, climate, and vegetation share characteristics of both eastern and western Oregon. The region is characterized by Oregon white oak woodlands and ponderosa pine forests in the east and Douglas-fir and western hemlock forests in the west. Some grasslands also occur. Understory plants include Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, antelope bitterbrush, Oregon grape, hazel, and snowberry. Common land uses include forestry, recreation, grazing, rural residential development, orchards, and, in the valleys, grain and hay farming. The land is mostly privately owned. The region covers in Washington and in Oregon along the Columbia River corridor, including the lower reaches of the White Salmon and Klickitat River drainages. =Ponderosa Pine/Bitterbrush Woodland (9d)= The Ponderosa Pine/Bitterbrush Woodland ecoregion has a terrain dominated by high, undulating volcanic plateaus and canyons, with permanent, medium gradient streams. Elevation varies from . Stream flow is consistent year-round, due to the volcanic hydrogeology. The well-drained, frigid soils are derived from Mazama Ash, which was produced by the catastrophic eruption of Mount Mazama about 6,845 years ago, and support nearly homogenous stands of ponderosa pine. Historically, frequent fires burned undergrowth, creating open groves of pines. Lodgepole pine is largely absent here. Understory vegetation varies with elevation; at lower elevations, antelope bitterbrush is important winter browse for deer. At higher elevations, greenleaf manzanita and snowberry are found. Riparian areas support mountain alder, stream dogwood, willows, and sedges. The region covers in Oregon, east of Mount Jefferson, Three Fingered Jack, and the Three Sisters, in the Deschutes National Forest and on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. =Pumice Plateau (9e)= The Pumice Plateau ecoregion is a high volcanic plateau, characteristically covered by thick deposits of Mount Mazama ash and pumice. Elevation varies from . Residual soils are very deep, highly permeable, and subject to drought, with intermittent, low to medium gradient streams and spring-fed creeks and marshes. Freezing temperatures are possible any time of year. Ponderosa pine forests are common on slopes, with white fir at higher elevations. Colder depressions and flats, where pumice deposits are thickest, are dominated by lodgepole pine, with an understory of antelope bitterbrush and Idaho fescue. Riparian areas support mountain alder, stream dogwood, willows, and quaking aspen. The Pumice Plateau is the largest of the Eastern Cascades subregions, covering in Oregon between Bend and Klamath Falls. It contains extensive areas within the Deschutes and Fremont-Winema National Forests (including the Gearhart Mountain Wilderness) and the lower elevations of the Newberry National Volcanic Monument. =Cold Wet Pumice Plateau Basins (9f)= The Cold Wet Pumice Plateau Basins ecoregion includes Sycan Marsh, Klamath Marsh, and La Pine Basin, which are surrounded by the Pumice Plateau but have distinct vegetation and topography. At an elevation of , they function as cold air catch-basins during the winter, which results in lower minimum temperatures. Soils in the basins have water tables at or near the surface for significant periods of the year, in contrast to the soils of the Pumice Plateau. The La Pine Basin is underlain by thick lacustrine deposits that exhibit high groundwater levels during the spring snowmelt. It supports lodgepole pine stands, as well as wet, forested wetlands of lodgepole pine, willow, and aspen. Scattered ponderosa pine shrub forest is found on the driest soils. The Sycan and Klamath marshes support wetland meadow vegetation, including tules and tufted hairgrass. Marshes, lakes, reservoirs, wetland forests, and medium and low gradient rivers provide important habitat for migratory waterfowl. The region covers in Oregon, a mixture of private and public lands, including the Deschutes and Fremont-Winema National Forests and the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. =Klamath/Goose Lake Warm Wet Basins (9g)= The Klamath/Goose Lake Warm Wet Basins ecoregion (named for Upper Klamath and Goose lakes) is drier than elsewhere in the eastern Cascades, yet it contains floodplains, terraces, and a pluvial lake basin. Elevation varies from . A variety of wildrye, bluegrass, and wheatgrass species once covered the basins, but most of the wet meadows and wetlands have been drained for rural residential development, pasture, and cropland, including alfalfa, potatoes, and small grains. Potential vegetation includes bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, antelope bitterbrush, big sagebrush, and low sagebrush on the steppes, with tules, cattails, and sedges in the wetlands. Several marshland wildlife refuges within the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges Complex are key to preserving regional biodiversity, particularly at-risk bird and fish species. The region covers in Klamath and Lake counties, Oregon. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet. =Fremont Pine/Fir Forest (9h)= The Fremont Pine/Fir Forest ecoregion contains steeply to moderately sloping mountains and high plateaus that rarely exceed timberline. Elevation varies from . Residual soils are common in the region, in contrast to the Pumice Plateau, where soils have been deeply buried by pumice and ash. Reservoirs, a few glacial rock-basin lakes, many springs, and high gradient intermittent and ephemeral streams occur. The continental climate and diverse terrain support a range of vegetation types. Ponderosa pine and western juniper woodlands are common at lower elevations. White fir, sugar pine, whitebark pine, lodgepole pine, and California incense-cedar are found on north slopes and at higher elevations. Understory plants include snowberry, heartleaf arnica, Wheeler bluegrass, antelope bitterbrush, and longstolon sedge. The region covers in Oregon, mainly on public land within the Fremont-Winema National Forest. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet. =Southern Cascades Slope (9i)= The Southern Cascades Slope ecoregion is a transitional zone between the Cascades ecoregion and the drier Eastern Cascade Slopes and Foothills, characterized by moderately sloping mountains with medium to high gradient streams. Elevation varies from . It is higher than other subregions in the Eastern Cascades and typically receives greater precipitation. Forests of ponderosa pine blanket the mountainous landscape; white fir, Shasta red fir, Douglas-fir, and incense cedar grow at higher elevations. Understory plants include Idaho fescue, antelope bitterbrush, Ross' sedge, western fescue, snowberry, and golden chinkapin. The region covers in Oregon, south of Aspen Butte in the Klamath River watershed, including Bear Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet. =Klamath Juniper Woodland (9j)= The Klamath Juniper Woodland ecoregion is composed of undulating hills, benches, and escarpments covered with a mosaic of rangeland and woodland, at an elevation of . Mean annual precipitation ranges from per year. Western juniper grows on shallow, rocky soils with an understory of low sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, bitterbrush, and bunchgrasses. Several species found in the shrub-steppe grasslands are uncommon in eastern Oregon, such as woolly wyethia, Klamath plum, and birchleaf mountain-mahogany. The diverse shrublands provide important wildlife habitat. Reservoirs dot the landscape and are important to lowland irrigation. The region covers in Oregon, south of Klamath Falls in the Lost River watershed, a mixture of public and private land. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet.

It is also contiguous with the World Wildlife Fund's Blue Mountain forests ecoregion. Setting This ecoregion extends from the Redmond area of Central Oregon, across a wide swath of the Columbia Plateau in Eastern Oregon, to Hells Canyon on the Snake River at the border of the three states. The ecoregion is named for the Blue Mountains and contains a complex of basins and mountain ranges that, at average 2100-2900m, are lower and more open than the neighboring Cascades and Northern Rocky Mountains but do include some steep landscape of which Hells Canyon at 1,660m is North America's deepest gorge. The mountains of the ecoregion include the Strawberry Range, Greenhorn, Elkhorn, Aldrich and Maury Mountains in the Blue Mountains, the gentler Ochoco Mountains to the west and the rugged Wallowa Mountains to the east. Rivers include the Grande Ronde, Powder Rivers and Malheur Rivers, all tributaries of the Snake and the John Day and Umatilla Rivers, tributaries of the Columbia. Like the Cascades, but unlike the Northern Rockies, the Blue Mountains are mostly volcanic in origin. However, the core of the Blue Mountains and the highest ranges, the Wallowa and Elkhorn mountains, are composed of granitic intrusives, deep sea sediments, and metamorphosed rocks. Flora Habitats within the ecoregion include desert-like shrubland, bluebunch grasslands, pine forest and alpine highlands as well as riverbanks and wetlands. This area is home to some of North America's largest stands of old growth forest including ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Englemann spruce(Picea engelmannii) and other spruces, western larch (Larix occidentalis) and grand fir (Abies grandis) and other firs (Abies spp.). Other important plants are sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), juniper (Juniperus occidentalis), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), lodgepole pine (pinus contorta), shrubs, meadows, grasslands and alpine plants. Fauna Birds of the area include bald eagle, northern spotted owl, Lewis's woodpecker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted nuthatch, golden-crowned kinglet and many migratory species, with the riverbanks important habitat for this birdlife. Mammals that move through the mountain grasslands include elk (including the largest herd in North America at Hells Canyon), bighorn sheep and mule deer. Native fish include Chinook Salmon, Steelhead, Redband Trout, Coho Salmon, Bull Trout, and Pacific Lamprey. Threats and preservation These habitats are vulnerable to logging, livestock grazing, river and fire control schemes and only about 10% of the original forest remains intact. The region includes significant landholdings by the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Much of the land is grazed by cattle, unlike the Cascades and Northern Rockies ecoregions. Cited for Washington information instead of an Ecoregions of Washington poster, which has not yet been located. Large blocks of intact forest remaining include: Eagle Cap Wilderness in the Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest, Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, the North Fork John Day Wilderness, Wenaha‚ÄìTucannon Wilderness of Umatilla National Forest, Strawberry Mountain Wilderness in Malheur National Forest and the northern part of Ochoco National Forest. These are all quite fragmented and logging of ponderosa pine in particular is an ongoing threat. Level IV ecoregions The Blue Mountains ecoregion has been subdivided into fourteen Level IV ecoregions, as described below. The EPA has not yet published an Ecoregions of Washington poster similar to the informational posters for Oregon and Idaho, and the Washington information presented here is not as complete as the information about the other two states. Full map). =John Day/Clarno Uplands (11a)= The John Day/Clarno Uplands ecoregion forms a ring of semi-arid foothills and low mountains surrounding the western perimeter of the Blue Mountains. Elevation varies from 1,200 to 5,500 feet (366 to 1,676 m). Highly dissected hills, palisades, and colorful ash beds flank the valleys of the John Day and Crooked rivers. Scattered buttes occur. The region has a continental climate moderated somewhat by marine influence. Grasslands support Bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, basin wildrye, Wyoming big sagebrush, and Thurber needlegrass. Higher elevations feature western juniper in transition to the ponderosa pine forests of the neighboring John Day/Clarno Highlands. Juniper woodlands have expanded markedly into the sagebrush-grassland during the twentieth century due to a combination of climatic factors, fire suppression, and grazing pressure. Riparian areas support white alder, mockorange, western chokecherry, clematis, willows, black cottonwood, and water birch. The largest of the Blue Mountains subregions, the John Day/Clarno Uplands covers in Oregon, including all three units of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument and portions of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation and the Crooked River National Grassland. =John Day/Clarno Highlands (11b)= The John Day/Clarno Highlands ecoregion is characterized by moderately to highly dissected hills and low mountains that are uniformly covered by Western ponderosa pine forest with a grass and shrub understory. Elevation varies from 3,000 to 6,200 feet (914 to 1,990 m). The region includes broad streams fed more by springs than by snow melt. The continental climate is tempered by a marine influence; it is not as dry, nor are temperature extremes as great, as in the Continental Zone Highlands. Historically, frequent low intensity wildfires reduced fuel loading in forests of widely spaced old-growth ponderosa pine. Today, after years of fire suppression and high grade logging, land managers attempt to emulate historical fire regimes to reverse the trend toward dense thickets of young growth that carry hot, stand-replacing fires. Potential vegetation is mostly open ponderosa pine, with some Douglas-fir, western juniper, mountain-mahogany, snowberry, mountain big sagebrush, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. Riparian areas support grand fir, mountain alder, red-twig dogwood, ninebark, Wood's rose, Rocky Mountain maple, and willows. The region covers in Oregon, including parts of the Ochoco, Malheur, and Umatilla national forests and lower elevations in the Mill Creek, Bridge Creek, Black Canyon and North Fork John Day wilderness areas. =Maritime-Influenced Zone (11c)= The Maritime-Influenced Zone ecoregion is the portion of the Blue Mountains ecoregion that directly intercepts marine weather systems moving east through the Columbia River Gorge. It is characterized by a dissected, gently-sloping to hilly volcanic plateau and mountain valleys. Elevation varies from 3,000 to 6,000 feet (914 to 1,829 m). Loess and ash soils over a substrate of basalt retain sufficient moisture to support forest cover at lower elevations than elsewhere in the Blue Mountains. A dense and diverse shrub layer grows beneath the relatively open canopy of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, which may delay tree regeneration after logging. Vegetation is dominated by Western ponderosa pine forests, with some Douglas-fir and grand fir. The understory and riparian shrub cover feature snowberry, spiraea, ninebark, serviceberry, and red-twig dogwood. The herbaceous ground cover features heartleaf arnica, pinegrass, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, Sandberg's bluegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass. The region covers in Oregon, as well as small areas across the border in Washington, and includes public land within the Umatilla National Forest. =Melange (11d)= The Melange ecoregion is characterized by dissected mid- elevation mountains with the complex geology typical of m√©lange formations. Elevation varies from 3,500 to 7,500 feet (1,067 to 2,286 m). The mountains are mostly blanketed in Tertiary basalt but have a core of mixed metamorphic, metavolcanic, metasedimentary, and sedimentary rocks. Soils are droughty and high in magnesium, creating a poor medium for plant growth; reforestation problems limit logging. Placer mining for gold altered the structure of many stream channels and left extensive tailings piles in riparian areas. Lithology affects soil, vegetation, and the quantity and quality of surface water, which vary across the region. Forests are dominated by Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine, with subalpine fir, western larch, and grand fir; elsewhere, juniper steppe woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands are found. Understory plants include mountain-mahogany, snowberry, serviceberry, grouse huckleberry, snowberry, prince's pine, sidebells pyrola, twinflower, pinegrass, elk sedge, heartleaf arnica, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. Riparian areas support mountain alder, red-twig dogwood, prickly currant, black currant, Columbia monk's hood, and bluebells. The region covers in Oregon and in Idaho, including parts of the Malheur, Umatilla, and Payette national forests and lower elevations in the Strawberry Mountain, Monument Rock, and North Fork John Day Wildernesses. =Wallowas/Seven Devils Mountains (11e)= The Wallowas/Seven Devils Mountains ecoregion consists of deeply dissected mountains in the Wallowas and Seven Devil ranges. It occupies the mid-elevation zone between the Subalpine-Alpine Zone and the Continental Zone Foothills, at an elevation of 3,000 to 9,200 feet (914 to 2,804 m). Perennial streams following fault lines have eroded deep canyons. The character of the region's xeric forest varies between moister maritime-influenced and drier continental areas, particularly in the diversity and extent of the shrub understory. The region is dominated by Western ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, and grand fir, with western larch, ninebark, snowberry, Rocky Mountain maple, serviceberry, mountain big sagebrush, low sagebrush, big huckleberry, grouse huckleberry, twinflower, prince's pine, elk sedge, and pinegrass. Higher elevations support subalpine fir. The region covers in Oregon and in Idaho, containing parts of the Wallowa-Whitman, Nez Perce, and Payette national forests. =Canyons and Dissected Highlands (11f)= The Canyons and Dissected Highlands ecoregion is characterized by steeply sloping, upper river canyons and dissected plateaus in the rain shadow of the mountains. It includes the southern Seven Devils Mountains and pieces of the uplifted Columbia Plateau, where the basalt has been eroded to a series of knife-edge ridges flanked by deep canyons. The region occupies the elevational zone above the unforested Canyons and Dissected Uplands, at an elevation of 4,000 to 6,400 feet (1,219 to 1,951 m). The steep terrain limits human activities. The region is drier than the marine-influenced Mesic Forest Zone that exists at similar elevations to the west. Moisture retaining loess and ash soils support Douglas-fir, larch, and grand fir on relatively level benches and Douglas-fir in unstable colluvial soils on steep canyon slopes. Western ponderosa pine forest is also present, with ninebark, snowberry, oceanspray, heartleaf arnica, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and bluegrass. Riparian areas support mountain alder, stinking and prickly currant, thimbleberry, and Columbia monk's hood. The region covers in Oregon, in Idaho, and smaller areas in Washington, including parts of the Wallowa- Whitman, Nez Perce, and Payette National Forests, the Wenaha‚ÄìTucannon Wilderness, and the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. =Canyons and Dissected Uplands (11g)= The Canyons and Dissected Uplands ecoregion is characterized by deep river canyons and dissected plateaus at an elevation of 1,000 to 5,000 feet (304 to 1,524 m). The Snake, Grand Ronde, Imnaha, and Salmon river canyons have cut through the Columbia Plateau to depths of 2,000 to 5,000 feet (610 to 1,524 m). Basalt and metamorphosed rocks are typically exposed in the canyon walls; the rock assemblage differs from the basalts of the Lower Snake and Clearwater Canyons in the Columbia Plateau ecoregion. The canyons provide a refuge for elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, and a concentration of wintering bald eagles. Of the major historic Snake River salmon stocks, the coho and sockeye are extinct, the chinook are threatened, and summer steelhead are in decline. The depth of the canyons and the exposed metamorphic rocks result in stony soils on canyon slopes that retain little moisture. Lower north-facing slopes and upper south-facing slopes support Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and Idaho fescue. Lower south-facing slopes support bluebunch wheatgrass and arrowleaf balsamroot. Upper north-facing slopes support grand fir, ninebark, and pinegrass. Overgrazed areas are dominated by cheatgrass and exotic annuals. Riparian areas in the Snake River canyons feature hackberry and bluebunch wheatgrass. The tributary canyons feature mockorange, poison-ivy, red-twig dogwood, snowberry, and Rocky Mountain maple. The region covers in Oregon, in Idaho, and smaller areas in Washington, including much of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area and parts of the Wallowa-Whitman, Payette, and Nez Perce national forests. =Continental Zone Highlands (11h)= The Continental Zone Highlands ecoregion is a moderately dissected, mountainous volcanic plateau, with scattered cinder cones, at an elevation of 4,000 to 6,700 feet (1,219 to 2,042 m). The region experiences seasonal temperature extremes and low annual precipitation. Many of its perennial streams flow south to end in the alkaline basins of the High Desert Wetlands of the Northern Basin and Range ecoregion. Frequent wildfires once influenced the open character of the forest. The predominant forest cover is ponderosa pine with a shrub or bunchgrass understory; the region lacks a zone of true firs found in other highland areas in the Blue Mountains. Characteristic species include ponderosa pine, Douglas- fir, grand fir, juniper, antelope bitterbrush, snowberry, mountain-mahogany, mountain big sagebrush, stiff sagebrush, elk sedge, pinegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue. The region covers in Oregon, including parts of the Ochoco and Malheur National Forests. =Continental Zone Foothills (11i)= The Continental Zone Foothills ecoregion consists of foothills, hills, and scattered buttes lying between Oregon's Blue and Wallowa mountains and the northwestern Snake River Plain, at an elevation of 1,800 to 6,600 feet (550 to 2,010 m). The combined masses of the Cascade Range and the Blue and Wallowa mountains block any maritime influence, creating a continental climate. As a result, plants are subject to wide temperature ranges, high evapotranspiration, and high early-season moisture stress. The distribution of desert shrubs varies with soil depth, texture, and elevation. The sagebrush steppe features mountain-mahogany, bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, and, on schist, Nevada greasebush. Scattered Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests also occur. The region provides important wildlife habitat. Mountain-mahogany and bitterbrush provide winter cover and forage for mule deer. Rodents, songbirds, and upland game birds also use the fruits of bitterbrush. The second largest of the Blue Mountains subregions, the Continental Zone Foothills is located in the easternmost part of the region, covering in Oregon and in Idaho. =Blue Mountain Basins (11k)= The Blue Mountain Basins ecoregion is characterized by flat to rolling alluvial valleys containing floodplains, fluvial terraces, and scattered buttes in the Wallowa, Grande Ronde, and Baker valleys. The Wallowa Valley also includes outwash terraces, moraines, and a low elevation basalt plateau. Elevation varies from 2,600 to 5,000 feet (792 to 1,524 m). All three valleys are faultbounded grabens or depressions filled with sediments. The Wallowa and Grande Ronde valleys have a marine-moderated climate and moisture-retaining loess soils. The Baker Valley, located in the rain shadow of the Elkhorn Mountains, is drier and has areas of alkaline soil. All three valleys receive stream flow from the surrounding mountains. Most of the floodplain wetlands have been drained for agriculture, but a remnant exists in the Grande Ronde Basin at the Ladd Marsh state wildlife area. The Baker Valley features sagebrush steppe composed of Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue. The Wallowa and Grande Ronde valleys features grassland containing bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue. Wetlands support tufted hairgrass, sedges, basin wildrye, and black greasewood. The region covers in Oregon, along the I-84 corridor between La Grande and Baker City and in the Wallowa Valley near Enterprise. =Mesic Forest Zone (11l)= The disjunct Mesic Forest Zone ecoregion is characterized by a dissected, volcanic plateau and mid-elevation mountains containing the highest forested areas in the Blue Mountains, western Wallowa Mountains, and western Seven Devils Mountains. Elevation varies from 4,000 to 7,700 feet (1,219 to 2,347 m). The climate is influenced by maritime air traveling up the Columbia River Gorge, with higher precipitation than other forested regions in the Blue Mountains. Snow persists late into the spring. The ashy soil holds moisture during the dry season and supports a productive spruce-fir forest. The region's boundaries correspond to the distribution of true fir forest before the modern era of fire suppression and high grade logging. Cold slopes feature subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, big huckleberry, grouse huckleberry, Utah honeysuckle, sidebells pyrola, roundleaved violet, and northwestern sedge. Cool moist slopes feature grand fir, western larch, queen's cup beadlily, and prince's pine. Drier slopes feature Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain maple, ninebark, pinegrass, elk sedge, and bigleaf sandwort. Lower, drier sites support ponderosa pine. The region covers in Oregon, in Idaho, and small areas in Washington, including parts of the Malheur, Ochoco, Umatilla, and Wallowa- Whitman national forests, and significant portions of the Mill Creek, Bridge Creek, Black Canyon, Monument Rock, North Fork John Day, North Fork Umatilla, and Eagle Cap wildernesses. =Subalpine-Alpine Zone (11m)= The Subalpine- Alpine Zone ecoregion includes high elevation, glaciated mountains with ar√™tes, cirques, and tarns. High gradient streams have boulder and cobble substrates. Elevation varies from 6,500 to 9,900 feet (1,981 to 3,018 m). The region begins where the forest cover becomes broken by alpine meadows and continues through alpine meadowland to include the exposed rock, permanent snowfields, and glacial ice of the highest mountain peaks. Very open forests of subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and whitebark pine tolerate the cold soils, deep snowpack, and extremely short growing season near timberline. Dry south-facing slopes support mountain big sagebrush and Idaho fescue. At the treeline, krummholz is found. Wet meadows support heather and Parry's rush. Historically, green fescue and sedges covered high alpine meadows and ridges, particularly in the Wallowas; but, following intense sheep grazing in the early twentieth century, many alpine plant associations reverted to seral or exotic species on rocky subsoil. The region covers Oregon, in the heart of the Eagle Cap and Strawberry Mountain Wildernesses, and in Idaho, in the Payette National Forest. =Deschutes River Valley (11n)= The Deschutes River Valley ecoregion, named for the Deschutes River, which it partially contains, is a broad valley with deeply incised streams. The southern part is capped by basalt and nearly level. In the northern part, the basalt cap is absent, and the terrain is more rolling and dissected. Elevation varies from 2,000 to 4,000 feet (610 to 1,219 m), with buttes as high as . The climate has a marine influence, and the region is less arid than the botanically similar High Lava Plains of the Northern Basin and Range ecoregion to the southeast. Because of the proximity of the High Cascades, stream density and water availability are high. As a result, human population density is much higher than in the High Lava Plains. Canals carry river water to irrigated farms on floodplains and terraces growing grass seed, winter wheat, potatoes, alfalfa, mint, onions, carrots for seed, and garlic. Potential natural vegetation includes Wyoming big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, basin big sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and needle-and-thread on the sagebrush steppe, with western juniper on shallow, rocky soils. Riparian areas support white alder, black hawthorn, ponderosa pine, and juniper. Himalayan blackberry, reed canary grass, and sweet clover are introduced species. The region covers along the Deschutes and Crooked rivers in Oregon, in a triangle defined roughly by Warm Springs, Prineville, and Bend. It includes parts of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation and the Crooked River National Grassland. =Cold Basins (11o)= The Cold Basins ecoregion contains cold, wet valleys and basins and wet meadows at an elevation of 3,600 to 6,000 feet (1,097 to 1,829 m). The high meadows are often alluvial and have a high water table and silt or clay soils. Streams, if not channelized, are meandering and have a dynamic interaction with their flood plains. These unconstrained streams provide pool habitats that are important to salmonids. The short growing season and saturated soil make these basins unsuitable for most crops, except hay, but they are heavily grazed by cattle and elk. Potential natural vegetation includes sedges, mountain big sagebrush, low sagebrush, and Idaho fescue on the sagebrush steppe and tufted hairgrass, Baltic rush, and alien Kentucky bluegrass in the wetlands and wet meadows. The smallest of the Blue Mountains subregions, the Cold Basins covers in several disjunct areas in central and eastern Oregon.

The ecoregion extends across a wide swath of the Columbia River Basin from The Dalles, Oregon to Lewiston, Idaho to Okanogan, Washington near the Canada‚ÄìUS border. It includes nearly of the Columbia River, as well as the lower reaches of major tributaries such as the Snake and Yakima rivers and the associated drainage basins. It is named for the Columbia River Plateau, a flood basalt plateau formed by the Columbia River Basalt Group during the late Miocene and early Pliocene. The arid sagebrush steppe and grasslands of the region are flanked by moister, predominantly forested, mountainous ecoregions on all sides. The underlying basalt is up to thick and partially covered by thick loess deposits. Where precipitation amounts are sufficient, the deep loess soils have been extensively cultivated for wheat. Water from the Columbia River is subject to resource allocation debates involving fisheries, navigation, hydropower, recreation, and irrigation, and the Columbia Basin Project has dramatically converted much of the region to agricultural use. Cited for Washington information instead of an Ecoregions of Washington poster, which has not yet been located. The Columbia Plateau ecoregion has been subdivided into at least fourteen Level IV ecoregions, as described below. The EPA has not yet published an Ecoregions of Washington poster similar to the informational posters for Oregon and Idaho, and the Washington information presented here is not as complete as the information about the other two states. Level IV ecoregions Full map). =Channeled Scablands (10a)= The Channeled Scablands ecoregion contains the coulees and Channeled Scablands of Washington carved out by the cataclysmic Missoula floods, from Wenatchee to Spokane, including public land within the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area and Wenatchee National Forest. =Loess Islands (10b)= The Loess Islands ecoregion consists of large pockets of thick loess deposits surrounded by the Channeled Scablands throughout Eastern Washington, including public land within the Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge and the Juniper Dunes Wilderness. =Umatilla Plateau (10c)= The Umatilla Plateau ecoregion, named for the Umatilla who originally inhabited the area, is characterized by a nearly level to rolling, treeless plateau, underlain by basalt and veneered with loess deposits. Elevation varies from 1,000 to 3,200 feet (300 to 980 m). Glacial features such as patterned ground are common. Areas with thick loess deposits are farmed for dryland winter wheat or irrigated alfalfa and barley. Rangeland dominates more rugged areas where loess deposits are thinner or nonexistent. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 15 inches (230 to 380 mm) and increases with elevation. In uncultivated areas, moisture levels are generally high enough to support grasslands of bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and Idaho fescue, without associated sagebrush, which is more common in the Pleistocene Lake Basins. Stiff sagebrush may be found on very shallow soils. Alien cheatgrass covers broad areas. The region covers in Eastern Oregon, including the Umatilla Indian Reservation and agricultural areas south of the Columbia River. =Okanogan Drift Hills (10d)= The Okanogan Drift Hills ecoregion is located in Douglas and Okanogan Counties, Washington, including part of the Colville Indian Reservation. Quincy Lake, one of the Pleistocene Lake Basins, is a remnant of the temporary Pleistocene lakes that were created by flood waters from glacial Lake Missoula. =Pleistocene Lake Basins (10e)= The Pleistocene Lake Basins ecoregion is a nearly level to undulating lake plain that contained vast temporary Pleistocene lakes that were created by flood waters from glacial lakes Missoula and Columbia. In Oregon, the flood waters accumulated from the eastern entrance of the Columbia River Gorge upstream to the Wallula Gap to form ancient Lake Condon. Elevation varies from 300 to 1,200 feet (90 to 370 m). Today, the region is the driest and warmest part of the Columbia Plateau, with mean annual precipitation varying from 7 to 10 inches (180 to 250 mm). Major irrigation projects provide Columbia River water to the region, allowing the conversion of large areas into agriculture. Where present, native vegetation consists of needle-and-thread, Indian ricegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and basin big sagebrush. Alien cheatgrass covers broad areas. The largest of the Columbia Plateau subregions, the Pleistocene Lake Basins covers in Eastern Oregon and larger areas in Washington, encompassing lower elevations throughout the Mid-Columbia Basin. It includes part of the Yakama Indian Reservation, as well as public lands within the Umatilla, Cold Springs, McNary, and Columbia national wildlife refuges, the Hanford Nuclear Site, and the Hanford Reach National Monument. =Dissected Loess Uplands (10f)= The Dissected Loess Uplands ecoregion consists of disjunct rolling hills and flat plateau remnants cut by the Lower Snake and Clearwater Canyons. Elevation varies from 1,500 to 3,600 feet (460 to 1,100 m). Pure grasslands dominate lower elevations, with bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and Sandberg bluegrass. Mountain brush grows on north facing slopes and higher, moister sites, with snowberry and wild rose. Livestock grazing and farming have eliminated much of the original plant cover. Nevertheless, the Dissected Loess Uplands is not as suited to farming as neighboring regions because it has thinner soils. The Dissected Loess Uplands covers in western Idaho and larger areas in southeastern Washington, south of the Snake River between Dayton and Lewiston, including part of the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. Arrowleaf Balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagittata), Antelope Bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) and scattered Ponderosa Pine grow in the Yakima Folds (ecoregion 10g) =Yakima Folds (10g)= The Yakima Folds ecoregion, named for the Yakama people who originally inhabited the area, consists of unforested anticlinal ridges composed of layer upon layer of basalt many thousands of feet thick. Elevation varies from 1,000 to 3,500 feet (300 to 1070 m). Loess blankets the south-facing slopes and supports dryland wheat farming. Steep, rocky north-facing slopes are commonly used for livestock grazing. The region receives an average of 10 to 12 inches (250 to 300 mm) of rain per year. Sagebrush and bunchgrass associations dominate plant assemblages outside of heavily farmed or grazed areas, with needle-and-thread, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, and basin big sagebrush. Alien cheatgrass covers broad areas. The region covers in Oregon and much larger areas in Washington, extending from the Horse Heaven Hills in the south to the Kittitas Valley in the north, including parts of Yakama Indian Reservation, Hanford Reach National Monument, Wenas Wildlife Area, and the Yakima Training Center. =Palouse Hills (10h)= The Palouse Hills ecoregion contains the unglaciated Western foothills of the Northern Rocky Mountains known as the Palouse Hills, after the Palouse River that runs through them and the Palus tribe who originally inhabited the area. Elevation varies from 2,500 to 3,000 feet (760 to 910 m). Mountain-fed perennial streams occur, and intermittent, loess-bottomed streams rise within the region. The soils are rich in organic matter and very productive, supporting extensive wheat farming, but they are easily eroded. Dry stream channels may be tilled. The region supports fescue-wheatgrass, fescue- snowberry, and fescue-hawthorn associations, as well as ponderosa pine savanna and open ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests. The region covers along the Idaho border, including parts of the St. Joe National Forest and the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation, and larger areas in Whitman and Spokane Counties, Washington. =Deep Loess Foothills (10i)= The Deep Loess Foothills ecoregion contains the lower elevation, northwest-facing slopes of the eastern Blue Mountains, with perennial streams fed by snow melt from the adjacent high mountains. Elevation varies from 1,500 to 3,000 feet (460 to 910 m). Moisture levels are high enough to support grasslands of Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass, but the region is dominated by non- irrigated winter wheat, barley, alfalfa, and green pea farming on the highly productive, loess-rich soils. The region covers in Oregon and a contiguous area in Washington, in a narrow band from Pendleton to Dayton, including part of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. =Nez Perce Prairie (10j)= The Nez Perce Prairie is a loess-covered plateau named after the Nez Perce tribe who originally inhabited the area and whose reservation is located here today. It is higher, cooler, less hilly, and has shallower soils than the Palouse Hills. Elevation varies from 2,000 to 4,100 feet (600 to 1250 m), with buttes up to . Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass are native, with Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine on north-facing slopes. Cropland is now extensive and grows wheat, barley, peas, and hay. The headwaters of many perennial streams are impacted by agricultural land use, negatively impacting the water quality of downstream canyon reaches. The region covers in Idaho, on the Nez Perce Indian Reservation and surrounding areas. =Deschutes/John Day Canyons (10k)= The Deschutes/John Day Canyons ecoregion consists of very steep to precipitous canyonlands containing the Deschutes and John Day Rivers. Deeply cut into the basalt, the canyons fragment a lightly populated portion of the Umatilla Plateau. Canyon depths up to create drier conditions than on the plateau above. Sparse bunchgrasses, Wyoming big sagebrush, and cheatgrass grow on the rocky, colluvial soil. Riparian vegetation in narrow reaches is often limited to a band of white alder at the water line, with some mockorange, western clematis, and chokecherry; broader floodplains and gravel bars are dominated by introduced species, such as reed canarygrass, sweetclover, and teasel. The rivers support chinook salmon and steelhead runs. The region covers in Oregon, along the lower reaches of the Deschutes and John Day rivers and their tributaries. =Lower Snake and Clearwater Canyons (10l)= The Lower Snake and Clearwater Canyons ecoregion consists of deep canyons cut through the basalts of the Columbia Plateau by the Snake and Clearwater Rivers. Canyon depths exceed and create drier conditions than in neighboring regions; mean annual precipitation is only 12 to 25 inches (300 to 640 mm). Outside of towns and transportation corridors, the canyons provide good habitat for bighorn sheep and game birds, with grasslands of bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, bluegrass, and Wyoming big sagebrush. The region covers in Idaho and slightly larger areas in Washington, along the lower reaches of the Snake and Clearwater rivers and their tributaries. =Okanogan Valley (10m)= The Okanogan Valley ecoregion is located along the lower reaches of the Okanogan and Methow Rivers and their tributaries in northeastern Washington, including land managed by the Okanogan National Forest. This ecoregion extends northward into the southern Okanagan Valley of British Columbia up to the southern shores of Skaha Lake. This includes towns such as Osoyoos, Oliver, and Okanagan Falls. =Umatilla Dissected Uplands (10n)= The Umatilla Dissected Uplands ecoregion consists of dissected, hilly uplands with a terrace-like appearance, where the dry grasslands of the Columbia Plateau meet the forested Blue Mountains ecoregion. Slopes are rolling to very steep. Elevation varies from 1,600 to 4,400 feet (490 to 1,340 m). The hills and uplands are covered with Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass. Near the Blue Mountains, some north-facing slopes have Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, with snowberry, pinegrass, and ninebark. The region is mostly used as rangeland because it lacks the thick, arable loess deposits that cover the agricultural Umatilla Plateau. Scablands, composed of arrays of earth mounds surrounded by rock polygons, are relics of Pleistocene glacial periods. The region covers in Eastern Oregon, in a narrow band along the northern edge of the Umatilla National Forest, mostly outside the national forest's boundaries.

It follows the Snake River across Idaho, stretching roughly from the Wyoming border to Eastern Oregon in the xeric intermontane west. Characterized by plains and low hills, it is considerably lower and less rugged than surrounding ecoregions. Many of the alluvial valleys bordering the Snake River are used for agriculture. Where irrigation water and soil depth are sufficient, sugar beets, potatoes, alfalfa, small grains, and vegetables are grown. Elsewhere, livestock grazing is widespread. Cattle feedlots and dairy operations are found locally. Potential natural vegetation is mostly sagebrush steppe, but barren lava fields and saltbush-greasewood associations also occur. Streams generally have lower gradients, are warmer, and have finer grained substrates than do streams in the montane ecoregions. Natural fish assemblages in the region are typically a mix of mesothermal minnows and suckers, but some stenothermal salmonids and sculpins are also present. The region has many large springs along the Snake River that support endemic fish and mollusc species. Shoshone Falls is a major zoogeographic barrier, and different species occur above and below it. The Snake River Plain ecoregion has been subdivided into ten Level IV ecoregions, as described below. Level IV ecoregions Full map). =Treasure Valley (12a)= The Treasure Valley ecoregion (named for the Treasure Valley) is an unglaciated rolling valley containing many canals and incised rivers. Elevation varies from 2,000 to 2,800 feet (640 to 853 m). The valley is underlain by Quaternary alluvium, loess, lacustrine, and alluvial fan deposits. Soils have an aridic moisture regime, and they originally supported sagebrush-grassland before the valley was converted to agriculture. Canals and diversions in this portion of the Snake River Plain supply water to pastureland and cropland as well as municipalities. Surface water quality has been significantly affected by channel alteration, dams, irrigation diversions, irrigation return flow, and agricultural pollution. Crops include wheat, sugar beets, alfalfa, potatoes, and onions. Population density is greater than in neighboring, rangeland- dominated ecoregions. Crop diversity is greater, temperatures are warmer, and the mean frost-free season is longer than in the Upper Snake River Plain and the Magic Valley. Vegetation outside of agricultural areas is characterized by Wyoming big sagebrush, basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrass, basin wildrye, Thurber's needlegrass, rabbitbrush, and cheatgrass. In saline areas, shadscale, greasewood, and saltgrass occur. The region covers in Idaho and in Oregon, where the Payette, Boise, Weiser, Malheur and Owyhee rivers converge into the Snake. It includes lowland areas from Boise to Vale and contains the Deer Flat National Wildlife Refuge. =Lava Fields (12b)= The Lava Fields ecoregion contains basalt flows, cinder cones, and spatter cones rising from irregular plains, at an elevation of 3,800 to 5,500 feet (1,158 to 1,676 m). Exposed basalt or very shallow loessial soils over volcanics are characteristic. Surface water availability is extremely limited, and the region is either barren or sparsely covered by hardy shrubs and grasses, including basin sagebrush, mountain sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Thurber needlegrass, and Indian ricegrass. Livestock carrying capacity is low. The region covers in Idaho in pockets of the eastern Snake River Plain, including Craters of the Moon National Monument and parts of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. =Camas Prairie (12c)= The Camas Prairie ecoregion is a cold, wet valley containing nearly level to rolling terraces, bottomlands, basalt plains, and, on the periphery, alluvial fans. Elevation varies from 4,700 to 5,100 feet (1,443 to 1,554 m). It is flanked by the semi- arid foothills of the Snake River Plain and the Idaho Batholith, which trap mountain runoff on the prairie. Resultant wet soils and flooding occur and are local and seasonal problems. Frigid mollisols are common and are colder than the soils of the lower Treasure Valley. Wet bottomlands support rushes, sedges, meadow grasses, and willows. Alluvial fans and terraces are covered by bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, bluegrass, basin big sagebrush, and mountain sagebrush. Lava plains support alkali sagebrush, bluegrass, squirreltail, and Idaho fescue. The region covers in Idaho along the Camas River and is used for small grain and alfalfa farming, pasture, range, and wildlife habitat. =Dissected Plateaus and Teton Basin (12d)= The Dissected Plateaus and Teton Basin ecoregion is characterized by dissected plateaus, alluvial fans, low terraces, bottomlands, outwash plains, and nearly flat, poorly drained basins. Elevation varies from 4,700 to 6,300 feet (1,443 to 1,920 m). Mollisols developed in thick loess deposits or alluvium and are subject to wind erosion. Loess is far more extensive than in the Upper Snake River Plain subregion. Sprinkler-irrigated land supports potatoes, alfalfa, and pasture; however, surface irrigation is far less common than in the Upper Snake River Plain. Non-irrigated land grows small grains. Potential natural vegetation is sagebrush steppe, with mountain big sagebrush, threetip sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrass, Idaho fescue, and cheatgrass. Wet meadows occur in the poorly drained, relatively cold Teton Basin. The region covers in Idaho in the farthest eastern reaches of the Snake River Plain, approaching the Teton Mountains. It includes portions of the Caribou-Targhee National Forest. =Upper Snake River Plain (12e)= The Upper Snake River Plain ecoregion is characterized by nearly level river terraces, floodplains, and lake plains containing many canals and rivers. Elevation varies from 4,400 to 5,000 feet (1,341 to 1,524 m). The region is primarily used for irrigated cropland, pastureland, suburban and urban developments, and industrial areas, and aquatic resources have been degraded by irrigation diversions, channelization, dams, sewage treatment, nonpoint pollution, food processing, and phosphate processing. Extensive surface-irrigated small grain, sugar beet, potato, and alfalfa farming occurs. The frost-free season is shorter and crops are less varied than in agricultural areas downstream. Potential natural vegetation is sagebrush steppe, with saltbush-greasewood communities in the southwest. Big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrass, cheatgrass, rabbitbrush, squirreltail, needle-and-thread, Indian ricegrass, and fourwing saltbush are present. Riparian areas feature sedges, perennial grasses, willows, and cottonwood. The region covers in eastern Idaho, mostly along the interstate corridor from American Falls to St. Anthony. It includes the Camas National Wildlife Refuge and most of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation. =Semiarid Foothills (12f)= The Semiarid Foothills ecoregion consists of foothills, alluvial fans, hills, and valleys that separate the Snake River Plain from the Idaho Batholith ecoregion to the north. At an elevation of 2,900 to 6,500 feet (884 to 1,981 m), it is higher and more rugged than neighboring regions in the Snake River Plain. Shallow, clayey soils are common, supporting sagebrush steppe communities of bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrass, Idaho fescue, big sagebrush, bitterbrush, medusahead wildrye, and cheatgrass, with bunch grasses, sedges, rushes, and clovers in wetter areas. Land use is primarily livestock grazing and is distinct from the irrigated agriculture of the Treasure Valley. Wildfire frequency is high. The region covers in two separate areas of Idaho, one northeast of Weiser in the Weiser River drainage and one northeast of Mountain Home, including Bennett Mountain and nearby hills. =Eastern Snake River Basalt Plains (12g)= The Eastern Snake River Basalt Plains ecoregion is a large irregular plain at an elevation of 3,700 to 6,400 feet (1,128 to 1,951 m), with shallow, stony soils that are unsuitable for cultivation. Only small areas have soils deep enough to be farmed under sprinkler irrigation. Rangeland is widespread and contrasts with the cropland of other subregions in the Snake River Plain. Potential natural vegetation is mostly sagebrush and bunchgrass, with basin and Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, bitterbrush, bluegrass, and cheatgrass. Saline areas feature fourwing saltbush, shadscale, and winter fat. The region is cool enough to have some regeneration capacity and still contains native plants, unlike the Mountain Home Uplands to the west. By far the largest of the Snake River Plain subregions, it covers in southern Idaho, including part of the Craters of the Moon National Monument and Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. =Mountain Home Uplands (12h)= The Mountain Home Uplands ecoregion consists of arid, shrub- and grass-covered plains with hills and basalt-capped buttes. Elevation varies from 2,500 to 4,300 feet (762 to 1,311 m), with some buttes up to . It is mostly rangeland and is sparsely populated, unlike regions to the west and east. It is flanked by foothills to the north and south and by the Magic and Treasure Valleys to the east and west. Today, it supports cheatgrass, crested wheatgrass, medusahead wildrye, Wyoming and basin big sagebrush, alkali sagebrush, and antelope bitterbrush. Stock carrying capacity is low. Native grasses are much rarer and vegetative regeneration capacity is more limited than in the cooler Eastern Snake River Basalt Plains, which has more available moisture. The second largest of the Snake River Plain subregions, it covers in southern Idaho, along the I-84 corridor between Boise and Gooding. =Magic Valley (12i)= The Magic Valley ecoregion, named for the irrigation canals of the Magic Valley that \\"magically\\" transformed the region in the early 1900s, is an agricultural valley underlain by alluvium, loess, and basalt flows. Elevation varies from 3,200 to 4,500 feet (975 to 1,372 m). The aridic soils require irrigation to grow commercial crops. Many canals, reservoirs, and diversions supply water to the region's pastureland, cropland, and residential, commercial, and industrial developments. Small grains, alfalfa, sugar beets, potatoes, and beans are grown. Livestock and dairy farms occur; dairying is more common than in the Treasure Valley. Dams, irrigation diversions, pollution, and channel alteration have affected water quality, and over-watering from sprinkler- irrigated portions of the Eastern Snake River Basalt Plains has raised groundwater levels and created artificial wetlands. Natural vegetation is mostly sagebrush and bunchgrass, but low terraces have salt tolerant plants. Wyoming and basin big sagebrush, alkali sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber needlegrass, squirreltail, bluegrass, needle-and-thread, Indian ricegrass, and fourwing saltbush are present. Population density is greater than in the rangeland-dominated regions to the east and west. The region covers in the Twin Falls area of southern Idaho. =Unwooded Alkaline Foothills (12j)= The Unwooded Alkaline Foothills ecoregion contains rolling foothills, hills, benches, alluvial fans, and scattered badlands that are characteristically underlain by sandy, alkaline lacustrine deposits. Perennial streams are rare. At an elevation of 2,100 to 2,600 feet (671 to 1,189 m), the terrain is higher and more rugged than the neighboring Treasure Valley. The region is valuable as rangeland and wildlife habitat, and land use is generally distinct from the irrigated agriculture of the valley. However, scattered areas near rivers with enough water to leach salts from the soil support alfalfa or sugar beet farming. Natural vegetation is dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush and associated grasses, such as bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, Thurber needlegrass, and Indian ricegrass. Today, cheatgrass and crested wheatgrass are also common. Salt tolerant shrubs, including black greasewood, fourwing saltbush, inland saltgrass, shadscale, seepweed, occur on alkaline outcrops. The region covers in western Idaho and in eastern Oregon, on both sides of the Treasure Valley.

Peter Sinks is located above sea level, in the Bear River Mountains east of Logan, within the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. Due to temperature inversions that trap cold nighttime air, it routinely produces the coldest temperatures in the state. Even in the summer, the bottom of the sinkhole rarely goes four consecutive days without freezing. It is so cold near the bottom of the hole that trees are unable to grow. On 1 February 1985, a temperature of was recorded there, the lowest recorded temperature in Utah, and the second-coldest temperature ever recorded in the contiguous United States.NCDC: January 2002 City/State Extremes (Wayback Archive) Peter Sinks was discovered meteorologically by Utah State University student Zane Stephens in 1983. Stephens, along with the Utah Climate Center, placed measuring instruments in the valley in the winter of 1984. On February 1, 1985, Peter Sinks dropped to , while another nearby valley, Middle Sink, located to the north-east, dropped to . Stephens hiked into Middle Sink to record the temperature personally. He then flew into Peter Sinks in a KUTV television station helicopter with broadcasting meteorologist Mark Eubank. State climatologist Gayle Bingham also traveled to the area and confirmed the temperature. The alcohol thermometer being used was retrieved and sent to the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C. to confirm the temperature. Since 1985, Peter Sinks and Middle Sink have been studied extensively by Stephens and Tim Wright with the use of Campbell Scientific weather equipment. On January 29, 2002, the temperature dropped to at Middle Sink. Stephens and Wright's main study is the change in temperature through the inversion at these sites. These valleys act like a dam trapping cold air, with the coldest of the air settling to the bottom of the valley. Stephens and Wright have found that temperatures between the cold air \\"lake\\" and the warmer air above the valley can be different by as much as . Climate Peter Sinks, sitting at an elevation of 8,164 feet, is a natural limestone sinkhole approximately one-half mile wide in diameter and has no valley outlet (referred to as dolines geologically) to drain water or air. It is one of the coldest spots in the lower 48. During calm cloudless nights, this high elevation basin dissipates daytime heat rapidly into the atmosphere. Cool dense air can then slide downwards towards the basin floor in a process known as cold air pooling. Consequently, extremely low temperatures can occur, particularly in the wake of arctic fronts in winter. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification, it has a continental subalpine/subarctic climateBeck, H.E., Zimmermann, N. E., McVicar, T. R., Vergopolan, N., Berg, A., & Wood, E. F. , abbreviated Dfc, though the exceptional attributes of this climate preclude one of the hallmark features of the climate type, the boreal forest, which as K√∂ppen based the system around vegetation distribution indicates that Peter Sinks stretches the limits of the system.

It encompasses the highly dissected ridges, foothills, and valleys of the Klamath and Siskiyou Mountains. It corresponds to the Level III ecoregion designated by the Environmental Protection Agency and to the Klamath-Siskiyou forests ecoregion designated by the World Wide Fund for Nature. The ecoregion, also known as a geomorphic province,California State University, Northridge was unglaciated during the Pleistocene epoch, when it served as a refuge for northern plant species. Its mix of granitic, sedimentary, metamorphic, and extrusive rocks contrasts with the predominantly volcanic rocks of the Cascades ecoregion to the northeast. The mild, subhumid climate of the region is characterized by a lengthy summer drought. It supports a mosaic of both northern Californian and Pacific Northwestern conifers and hardwoods.  Ecology  The ecoregion harbors rich biodiversity, with several distinct plant communities, including temperate rain forests, moist inland forests, oak forests and savannas, high elevation forests, and alpine grasslands. Thirty conifer species inhabit the region, including seven endemic species, making the region one of the richest coniferous forest regions of the world in species diversity. The region also has several edaphic plant communities (adapted to specific soil types), notably those of the region's serpentine outcrops. Conifer species include Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. menziesii), Lawson's Cypress (also known as Port Orford Cedar, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa), Sugar Pine (Pinus lambertiana), Mountain Hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), White Fir (Abies concolor subsp. lowiana), Red Fir (A. magnifica subsp. shastensis), Weeping Spruce (Picea breweriana), Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), and Pacific Yew (Taxus brevifolia). These forests mark the northern extent of the range for California Buckeye.  Level IV ecoregions  Full map). The Oregon portion of the ecoregion has been subdivided into seven Level IV ecoregions, as described below. = Rogue/Illinois Valleys (78a) = The Rogue/Illinois Valleys ecoregion includes terraces and floodplains in the Rogue and Illinois river valleys at an elevation of 900 to 2,000 feet (274 to 610 m). Historically, the valleys supported Oregon white oak and California black oak woodland, with Pacific madrone, ponderosa pine, and grassland. Common understory plants included California fescue, snowberry, and serviceberry. Riparian areas supported willow and cottonwood. Much of the land has been developed for agricultural or residential use, and little of the original vegetation remains. Remnants of oak savanna, prairie vegetation, and seasonal ponds persist on the mesa tops of the Table Rocks north of Medford. Elsewhere, land uses include orchards, cropland, and pastureland. Climate, vegetation, and resulting land use are more similar to Northern California‚Äôs inland valleys than to the Willamette Valley ecoregion to the north. The region covers in Oregon, in three separate areas around Medford and Ashland, Grants Pass, and Cave Junction. = Oak Savanna Foothills (78b) = The Oak Savanna Foothills ecoregion consists of moderately sloping mountain foothills bordering the Rogue and Illinois river valleys and sharing their Mediterranean climate. Elevation varies from 1,400 to 4,000 feet (427 to 1,219 m). The driest area, east of Medford, is dominated by Oregon white oak and California black oak woodlands, grassland-savanna, ponderosa pine, and Coast Douglas-fir. The wetter foothills flanking the Illinois Valley support Douglas-fir, madrone, and California incense-cedar. Understory species include oceanspray, Western poison-oak, snowberry, Idaho fescue, California brome, roughstalk bluegrass, and ceanothus. The region is lower and less dissected, with more oak woodland and less closed-canopied forest than the Inland Siskiyous. It covers in Oregon. = Umpqua Interior Foothills (78c) = The Umpqua Interior Foothills ecoregion is a complex of foothills and narrow valleys containing fluvial terraces and floodplains. Elevation varies from 400 to 2,800 feet (122 to 853 m). It is drier than the foothills of the Willamette Valley, partly because the summer Pacific high pressure system arrives earlier and remains longer than in ecoregions to the north. Summers are hot and dry, and soils have a xeric moisture regime in contrast to the udic soils of the Mid-Coastal Sedimentary ecoregion to the west. The slopes are covered by Oregon white oak woodland, Douglas-fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, tanoak, and chinkapin, with an understory chaparral community that includes snowberry, salal, Oregon grape, poison oak, oceanspray, and swordfern. Many areas have been converted to pastureland, vineyards, orchards, and row crops. It covers in Oregon in the Umpqua Valley, including the city of Roseburg. Waldo rockcress is an uncommon endemic member of the serpentine soils flora of the Serpentine Siskiyous. = Serpentine Siskiyous (78d) = The Serpentine Siskiyous ecoregion consists of highly dissected mountains containing perennial, high gradient streams at an elevation of 1,500 to 4,300 feet (457 to 1,311 m). It is lithogically distinct from the rest of the Klamath Mountains ecoregion. Many plants have difficulty growing in its serpentine soils due to a shortage of calcium and high levels of magnesium, nickel, and chromium. As a result, vegetation is often sparse and composed of specialist species that have evolved to grow in the potentially toxic and nutrient-poor serpentine soils. It supports a mixed conifer forest of Jeffrey pine, tanoak, incense-cedar, Douglas-fir, and montane chaparral composed of manzanita, ceanothus, Idaho fescue, and Lemmon needlegrass. Historic gold, nickel, chromite, copper, and mercury mining have contributed to water quality problems. The region covers in Oregon, including portions of the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest and the Kalmiopsis and Wild Rogue wildernesses. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet. = Inland Siskiyous (78e) = Preston Peak, Siskiyou Wilderness The Inland Siskiyous ecoregion is higher and more mountainous than the neighboring foothill and valley ecoregions, with an elevation of 800 to 7,000 feet (244 to 2,134 m). It has a higher fire frequency, less annual precipitation, and longer summer droughts than the Coastal Siskiyous. Forest cover is a diverse and multi-layered mix of conifers, broadleaf evergreens, and deciduous trees and shrubs, featuring Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, Oregon white oak, California black oak, madrone, serviceberry, snowberry, Oregon grape, California fescue, and poison oak. The largest of the Klamath Mountains subregions mapped so far, it covers in Oregon, including public lands within the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet. = Coastal Siskiyous (78f) = The Coastal Siskiyous ecoregion consists of highly dissected mountains with a wetter and milder maritime climate than elsewhere in the Klamath Mountains ecoregion. Elevation varies from 600 to 5,300 feet (183 to 1,615 m). Productive forests composed of tanoak, Douglas-fir, bigleaf maple, California laurel, and some Port Orford cedar cover its mountainous landscape, with chinkapin, salal, rhododendron, and swordfern; tanoak is more common than elsewhere in Oregon. Broadleaf evergreens, such as tanoak and madrone, quickly colonize disturbed areas, making it difficult to regenerate conifer forest growth. Xeric soils derived from Siskiyou rock types are characteristic; udic soils which support western hemlock and Sitka spruce are present but are less common than in the wetter Coast Range ecoregion to the west. The region covers in Oregon, including portions of the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest and the Kalmiopsis and Wild Rogue Wilderness wildernesses. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet. = Klamath River Ridges (78 g) = The Klamath River Ridges is characterized by highly dissected mountains, with a dry, continental climate. Elevation varies from 3,800 to 7,500 feet (1,158 to 2,286 m). Vegetation varies with slope, aspect, and elevation. Higher altitudes and north-facing slopes have Douglas- fir and white fir; lower elevations and south-facing slopes are covered in ponderosa pine and western juniper, species that are more drought-resistant than other vegetation types found within the region. The chaparral features Oregon grape, western fescue, snowberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, and ceanothus. The region covers in Oregon near the Siskiyou Summit, including portions of the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest and the Cascade‚ÄìSiskiyou National Monument. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet.

It contains dissected lava plains, rolling hills, alluvial fans, valleys, and scattered mountain ranges in the northern part of the Great Basin. Although arid, the ecoregion is higher and cooler than the Snake River Plain to the north and has more available moisture and a cooler climate than the Central Basin and Range to the south. Its southern boundary is determined by the highest shoreline of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, which once inundated the Central Basin and Range. The western part of the region is internally drained; its eastern stream network drains to the Snake River system. The valleys support sagebrush steppe or saltbush vegetation. Mollisol soils are common, in contrast to the aridisols of the Central Basin. Juniper-dominated woodland occurs on rugged, stony uplands. The mountain ranges are covered in mountain sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Douglas-fir, subalpine forests, or aspen. Today, most of the region is used for livestock grazing. Dryland and irrigated cropland are found in some areas, but in general the soils are less suitable for agriculture than those in the Columbia Plateau and the Snake River Plain ecoregions. Most public lands in the region are managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The Northern Basin and Range ecoregion has been subdivided into fourteen Level IV ecoregions, as described below. Level IV mapping is not yet complete in California, and the information below includes only the sections in Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah. Level IV ecoregions Full map). =Dissected High Lava Plateau (80a)= The Dissected High Lava Plateau ecoregion is a broad to gently rolling basalt plateau cut by deep, sheer-walled canyons, with perennial and intermittent streams draining to the Snake River. Elevation varies from 4,000 to 7,300 feet (1,219 to 2,225 m). The region is less wooded, lower, and more arid than neighboring subregions in the Northern Basin and Range. It differs from sagebrush-dominated regions in the Central Basin and Range in having higher precipitation and colder winters. Potential natural vegetation is mostly sagebrush steppe; Wyoming big sagebrush and black sagebrush are abundant, as well as Douglas rabbitbrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Great Basin wildrye, Sandberg's bluegrass, Indian ricegrass, and cheatgrass. Juniper-pinyon woodlands grow on rocky and gravelly uplands. Understory species are denser and biological soil crusts tend to be more extensive and in better condition than at similar elevations in the Central Basin and Range. Cheatgrass has replaced depleted bunchgrasses in overgrazed areas. One of the largest Northern Basin and Range subregions, the Dissected High Lava Plateau covers in Idaho, in Oregon, in Nevada, and in Utah, including much of the Owyhee Desert. It is primarily used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet. =Semiarid Hills and Low Mountains (80b)= The Semiarid Hills and Low Mountains ecoregion is higher and more rugged than the sagebrush plains and basins of neighboring regions. It is composed of unglaciated mountain slopes, hills, and alluvial fans at an elevation of 4,600 to 9,000 feet (1,402 to 2,743 m). The region is covered by mountain big sagebrush, low sagebrush, and associated grasses and understory plants, including bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, Great Basin wildrye, Indian ricegrass, cheatgrass, Idaho fescue, needle-and-thread grass, snowberry, and serviceberry. Scattered juniper woodlands grow on shallow and rocky soils. These hills represent the northern limit for both pinyon and Utah juniper; western juniper replaces them to the west and north. Groves of aspen grow on alluvial fans and along stream networks, with some lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir. Geyer willow and Booth willow are also present in riparian areas. The region includes streams that have been designated for protection as critical or high priority habitat for Yellowstone cutthroat trout and other fish. Water quality has been lightly to moderately degraded by human activities, such as historic gold mining and livestock grazing, which is the primary land use today. The ecoregion covers in Idaho, in Nevada, and in Utah, including Shoshone and Bannock land on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and public land within the Sawtooth and Caribou- Targhee national forests. =High Elevation Forests and Shrublands (80c)= The High Elevation Forests and Shrublands ecoregion is composed of steep, rugged, unglaciated mountains with cold winters, at an elevation of 6,000 to 9,900 feet (1,829 to 3,018 m). It is characterized by a mix of conifers, mountain brush, and sagebrush grassland. North-facing slopes may support Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, subalpine conifers, aspen, and snowberry. South- facing slopes may support mountain big sagebrush, serviceberry, snowberry, Idaho fescue, chokecherry, mountain brome, bluegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass. Open grassland grows on wide ridge tops. Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir may be found in upper canyons. The region covers in southeastern Idaho and in northwestern Utah, including land within the Sawtooth and Caribou-Targhee national forests. =Pluvial Lake Basins (80d)= The Pluvial Lake Basins ecoregion contained vast lakes during the Pleistocene epoch that have now mostly disappeared. It is characterized by gently sloping, internally drained basins with lake terraces, playas, beach plains, stream terraces, intermittent lakes, fan skirts, and cool springs. Elevation varies from 4,200 to 6,200 feet (1,280 to 1,890 m). Some basin floor playas collect and evaporate water seasonally, but not as extensively as the High Desert Wetlands. Dry lake beds near the Cascade Mountains have a significant layer of volcanic ash. Greasewood, inland saltgrass, and seepweed grow in alkaline soils. Better drained, less alkaline soils are dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush and basin big sagebrush, with rubber rabbitbrush, Great Basin wildrye, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and cheatgrass. The land is used for rangeland and sprinkler-irrigated alfalfa farming. The region covers in Oregon and in Nevada. =High Desert Wetlands (80e)= The nearly level High Desert Wetlands ecoregion consists of high desert lakes and surrounding wetlands that provide critical habitat for nesting and migratory birds and associated upland birds and mammals. Elevation varies from 4,000 to 5,200 feet (1,219 to 1,646 m). The fine-textured soils are poorly drained, and basins collect water seasonally. Although water levels fluctuate from year to year, lakes and wetlands in this region hold water more consistently than on the coarser, better drained soils of the Pluvial Lake Basins. Sedges, rushes, black greasewood, tufted hairgrass, mat muhly, meadow barley, creeping wildrye, and Nevada bluegrass occur in wetter areas. Drier areas support basin big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, silver sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, and cheatgrass. The region covers in Oregon, including the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and land surrounding Malheur Lake, Paulina Marsh, Summer Lake, Lake Abert, and the Warner Lakes. It also includes in Idaho and in Nevada, on and around the Duck Valley Indian Reservation . =Owyhee Uplands and Canyons (80f)= The Owyhee Uplands and Canyons ecoregion is a sagebrush steppe containing deep river canyons, barren lava fields, badlands, and tuffaceous outcrops that are riddled by caves. Elevation varies from 2,500 to 6,600 feet (762 to 2,012 m). Although the region's climate and vegetation are similar to the Dissected High Lava Plateau, its lithology is more varied, stream density is higher, and water availability is greater. These attributes, combined with its remote location, make the region a particularly valuable refuge for wildlife. The steppe is characterized by Wyoming big sagebrush, basin big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg's bluegrass, and cheatgrass. Rocky areas support scattered western juniper. It is mostly used for rangeland and wildlife habitat, with some hay and small grain farming. Cheatgrass has replaced depleted bunchgrasses in overgrazed areas. The region covers in Oregon and in Idaho, including Lake Owyhee and the Owyhee, Malheur, and Succor drainages. =High Lava Plains (80g)= The High Lava Plains ecoregion is a vast, nearly level to undulating sagebrush steppe containing scattered volcanic cones and buttes. Elevation varies from 4,200 to 6,800 feet (1,280 to 2,073 m). The region is similar to the Dissected High Lava Plateau in its physiography, climate, and vegetation, but, unlike the plateau, it is internally drained. As a result, it lacks anadromous fish runs. It also differs from the plateau in having numerous intermittent lakes on the impermeable volcanic bedrock. Vegetation on the steppe includes Wyoming big sagebrush, low sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, Lahontan sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Idaho fescue. Silver sagebrush, creeping wildrye, and mat muhly are found in depressions. Shallow and rocky soils support scattered western juniper. The federally threatened Warner sucker fish lives in permanent, shallow, weedy lakes and spawns in Nevada's Twelvemile Creek. The Wall Canyon area supports a unique fish species, the Wall Canyon sucker. Higher elevations once supported Lahontan cutthroat trout but water availability limits their present distribution. The largest of the Northern Basin and Range subregions, the High Lava Plains covers in Oregon and in Nevada, featuring a variety of land uses, including rangeland, wildlife habitat, irrigated pastureland and cropland, historic gold and silver mines, and active opal mines and clay quarries. It contains the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge and lower elevations in the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet. =Saltbush- Dominated Valleys (80h)= The Saltbush-Dominated Valleys ecoregion, externally drained by the Snake River, is composed of gently sloping valley bottoms and alluvial fans dominated by salt-tolerant vegetation that distinguishes it from the sagebrush steppe of surrounding regions. Elevation varies from 4,500 to 6,000 feet (1,372 to 1,829 m). Light-colored soils with high salt and alkali content are common; they are dry for extended periods and may be leached of salt by irrigation water. Potential natural vegetation is mostly saltbush-greasewood, featuring Nuttall sagebrush, squirreltail, shadscale, winterfat, and greasewood. Basin sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, needlegrass, bluegrass, and Indian ricegrass are also present. The region covers in Idaho and in Utah, in the Raft River drainage. The land is used primarily for rangeland and irrigated agriculture. =Sagebrush Steppe Valleys (80i)= The Sagebrush Steppe Valleys ecoregion consists of gently sloping, unforested terraces, basin rims, valley bottoms, footslopes, bajadas, and alluvial fans, with an elevation of 4,600 to 6,500 feet (1,403 to 1,981 m). Less rugged than the surrounding hills and mountains, it is dominated by sagebrush grassland and lacks the woodlands, open conifer forests, and saltbush‚Äìgreasewood vegetation of neighboring regions. The valleys drain mostly to the Snake River and fish assemblages are unlike those of the internally drained basins to the south. Potential vegetation includes bluebunch wheatgrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, cheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass. The steppe valleys are less suitable for cropland agriculture and have less available water than many parts of the Snake River Plain, but non- irrigated wheat and barley farming is common. The region covers in southeastern Idaho and across the Utah border. =Semiarid Uplands (80j)= The disjunct Semiarid Uplands ecoregion includes scattered hills, low mountains, volcanic cones, buttes, and rocky outcrops that rise out of the drier Dissected High Lava Plateau and High Lava Plains, as well as midelevation zones in the Hart, Steens, Owyhee, Jarbidge, and Santa Rosa mountains. Elevation varies from 4,800 to 9,700 feet (1,463 to 2,957 m). Finely textured soils support big sagebrush, low sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, serviceberry, snowberry, mountain-mahogany, and associated grasses, such as Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, Nevada bluegrass, Great Basin wildrye, bottlebrush squirreltail, mountain brome, and Thurber needlegrass. Aspen and chokecherry are found in protected snow pockets, with willow and chokecherry in riparian areas. Rockier soils support juniper steppe woodlands. The density and extent of juniper varies over time and is dependent on long-term climate fluctuations, grazing pressure, and fire suppression. Juniper woodland is currently absent in the Jarbidge and Santa Rosa mountains, where mountain brush and scattered aspen groves occupy the woodland zone. Cold water fisheries occur in the moderate to high gradient perennial streams; threatened bull trout are found in the Jarbidge River watershed, and limited numbers of Lahontan cutthroat trout are found in the Santa Rosa range. Extensive gold mining operations continue, especially in the mountains near Jarbidge and Tuscacora. The region covers in Nevada, in Oregon, and in Idaho. Public lands include the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest and the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge. =Partly Forested Mountains (80k)= The Partly Forested Mountains ecoregion occupies the elevational belt above the Semiarid Uplands on the Jarbidge, Independence, Owyhee, and Steens mountains, from 6,500 to 10,900 feet (1,981 to 3,322 m). These are partially glaciated, high, rugged mountains with glacial features including moraines, cirques, and tarn (lake)s. Perennial or intermittent, high gradient, cold streams are fed by snowmelt and springs, supporting federally threatened bull trout and Lahontan cutthroat trout in Nevada. Riffle segments have cobble or boulder substrates. Annual precipitation is sufficient to support a Great Basin pine forest community of Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, ponderosa pine, and limber pine, with whitebark pine near the tree line, and aspen stands in riparian meadows, moist draws, and wet depressions. The understory features low juniper, mountain big sagebrush, mountain brush, serviceberry, snowberry, mountain-mahogany, Idaho fescue, sheep fescue, rough fescue, bottlebrush squirreltail, prairie lupine, mountain brome, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass. Small areas of tundra and alpine meadows are found at the highest elevations. On Steens Mountain, above the juniper woodland zone of the Semirarid Uplands, the landscape is almost treeless; broad areas of mountain big sagebrush alternate with scattered groves of aspen. Alpine areas on Steens Mountain were seriously eroded following intense grazing by domestic sheep in the late 19th century. The region covers in Nevada, in Oregon, and in Idaho, and contains the Jarbidge Wilderness in the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. =Salt Shrub Valleys (80l)= The Salt Shrub Valleys ecoregion is composed of arid basins formerly inundated by Pleistocene lakes. Elevation varies from 3,500 to 5,200 feet (1,067 to 1,585 m) The nearly flat to gently sloping basins and playas are poorly drained, have a high water table, and retain water seasonally. They are flanked by bajadas and alluvial fans. The region also contains wetlands, hot springs, terraces, dunes, and a few hills. Soils, climate, and vegetation are transitional to the Central Basin and Range to the south. Characteristically, the basin floors have strongly saline and very alkaline soils that support black greasewood, inland saltgrass, bud sagebrush, shadscale, alkali sacaton, rushes, basin wildrye, bottlebrush squirreltail, and cheatgrass. Alluvial fans and hills support Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, rabbitbrush, Thurber needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail. The region covers in Oregon and in Nevada, including a small part of the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge. =Barren Playas (80m)= The Barren Playas ecoregion includes the playas and sand dunes of Summer Lake, Silver Lake, and the Alvord Desert, three of the most arid areas in Oregon. Elevation varies from 4,500 to 5,000 feet (1,372 to 1,524 m), with a local relief of less than . On the playas, lake levels and salinity fluctuate seasonally and yearly. Playas are ponded during wet intervals and eroded by wind when dry. Surface material is clayey, saline, alkaline, and poorly drained. Sand dunes and mud flats occur. This region is mostly barren; vegetation, where present, is sparse and composed of very salt-tolerant plants, such as alkali sacaton and black greasewood. The region covers in Oregon. It is nonarable and is used for recreation and migratory bird habitat.

Typically, but not exclusively, it is accomplished with mechanized off-road capable transport (from bicycles to trucks) where the principal form of lodging is camping, often lasting for extended lengths of time (months to years) and spanning international boundaries. Unimog based 6x6 overlanding capable RV History Historically, \\"overlanding\\" is an Australian term to denote the droving of livestock over very long distances to open up new country or to take livestock to market far from grazing grounds. Between 1906 and 1910 Alfred Canning opened up the Canning Stock Route.Canning, Alfred Wernam (1860 - 1936) Retrieved on 26 February 2009 In Australia overlanding was inspired to a large degree by Len Beadell who, in the 1940s and 1950s, constructed many of the roads that opened up the Australian Outback. Those roads are still used today by Australian overlanders and still hold the names Len gave them; the Gunbarrel Highway, the Connie Sue Highway (named after his daughter), and the Anne Beadell Highway (named after his wife). Overlanding in its most modern form with the use of mechanized transport began in the middle of the last century with the advent of commercially available four-wheel-drive trucks (Mercedes-Benz G-Class's, Unimog, Jeeps and Land Rovers). Nonetheless, there were a few earlier pioneers travelling in remarkably unsophisticated vehicles. The Weston motorcaravan at Winterton Museum In the early 1920s, John Weston and family travelled from Britain to Greece and back in a converted US built Commerce one ton truck with a Continental N engine. At the time, the Weston family was based in Europe but returned to South Africa, their homeland, in 1924, taking the vehicle with them. In 1931, the family set out in the same truck from the south-western tip of Africa and drove to Cairo and on to Britain. Not only is this story well- documented but remarkably the vehicle is still extant. In 1975, following renovation, it featured in the International Veteran and Vintage Car Rally from Durban to Cape Town and was then donated to the Winterton Museum, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, where it can be seen today.Maximilian John Ludwick Weston 1872-1950 Pioneer Aviator and Overland Traveller In 1949, with the Land Rover brand less than a year old, Colonel Leblanc drove his brand new 80-inch Series I Land Rover from the United Kingdom to Abyssinia. There followed many more private journeys, with many groups setting out from Europe for remote African destinations. To aid in these endeavors the Automobile Association of South Africa published a guide titled Trans-African Highways, A Route Book of the Main Trunk Roads in Africa. The first edition appeared in 1949 and included sections on choice of vehicle, choice of starting time, petrol supplies, water, provisions, equipment, rules of the road, government officials and rest houses. The serious tone of this book gives some clue as to the magnitude of such a trip, and it was from these beginnings that overlanding developed in Europe and Africa. Notable early examples include Barbara Toy's solo overland journeys in a Land Rover, including one in 1951-2 from Tangier to Baghdad, and the 1955-6 Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition, which travelled overland from London to Singapore, also in Land Rovers. One of the most well documented overland journeys was by Horatio Nelson Jackson in 1903. In 1954, Helen and Frank Schreider drove and sailed the length of the Americas from Circle, Alaska on the Arctic Circle to Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego in a sea- going ex-army jeep. In 2015 the Overlanding Association was created to provide help, support and information to overlanders. To date they have lobbied the European commission and the FIA to improve the rights of Carnet users in Europe.Overlanding Association - Carnet Petition Modern overlanding Overlanding has increased in the past couple of decades, and is getting ever more popular in large part influenced by the Camel Trophy event run from 1980 to 2000 with routes crossing some intensely difficult terrain. It is now quite common for groups of overlanders to organize meetings, and an annual meeting is held every Christmas at Ushuaia. Through the use of the Internet it is much easier to find the information required for extended overland trips in foreign lands and there are several internet forums where travelers can exchange information and tips as well as coordinate planning. While some commercially built overland capable vehicles are produced,Unicat - German based manufacturer of large fully outfitted overland trucks. many overlanders consider the preparation of their vehicle a paramount part of the experience. The U.S., South Africa and Australia have significant industries based on making accessories for overland travel. =Commercial overlanding= The late 1960s saw the advent of commercial overland travel. Companies started offering overland tours to groups in large, specially equipped trucks. Mostly in Africa, these journeys could last for months, and relied heavily on the participation of the paying passengers for food preparation, food purchasing and setting up camp. The ultimate of these adventures was always the 'trans', or the complete journey from Europe to Cape Town in South Africa. Commercial overlanding has since expanded to all the continents of the world. Modes of overland travel Rail = At , the Trans-Siberian Railway is one of the longest overland journeys in existence today, taking seven days to reach Vladivostok from Moscow,The Man in Seat Sixty-One Seat61 and providing an alternative to air travel for journeys between Europe and Asia. The Indian Pacific railway, completed in 1970, links Sydney and Perth in Australia. Covering over four days, the railway includes the longest stretch of straight railway line in the world. The introduction of Japan's high speed railway T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen in 1964 changed the face of rail travel. The railway has carried more than 4 billion passengers and its new N700 series trains are capable of . France's TGV holds the record for the fastest train, with a top speed of more than , making it faster than air travel for many journeys within the country. = Road = The Silk Route (or Silk Road) historically connects the Mediterranean countries, Persia, India and China with each other.Silk Road - Britannica Online Encyclopedia Today the route refers to overland journeys between Europe and China, taking either the northern route - through Russia and Kazakhstan - or the southern route - through Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and North India - to Urumqi or Xian in China. These routes are still popular today, with companies offering tours on the southern route. Overland routes Trans Africa = Some of the longest and more traditional overland routes are in Africa. The Cairo to Cape Town and v.v. route covers more than and currently usually follows the Nile River through Egypt and Sudan, continuing to Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia along the way. In 1959 the pioneering American trailer manufacturer Wally Byam and a caravan of trailers travelled the route from Cape Town to Cairo,Wally Byam Caravan Club International via Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo), Uganda and north from Kenya. One of the longest current commercial routes is from Reykjavik, Iceland to Cape town, South Africa. From the mid-1980s, the non-operation of the Aswan to Wadi Halfa ferry between Egypt and Sudan as well instability in Sudan, northern Uganda and Ethiopia, made the journey impossible. In recent years however, the Cape to Cairo and Cairo to Cape Town route has again become possible and increasingly popular both with commercial overland trucks carrying groups of 20 or so paying passengers as well as independent travellers on motorcycles or with four-wheel-drive vehicles. The traditional Trans Africa route is from London to Nairobi, Kenya and Cape Town, South Africa.Shackell, C. & Bracht, I. Africa By Road. 2001, Bradt Publications, Chalfont St. Peter The route started in the 1970s and became popular with small companies using old Bedford four-wheel-drive trucks carrying about 24 people each, plus many independents, normally run by groups of friends in 4x4 Land Rovers heading out of London from November to March every year. The usual route was from Morocco to Algeria with a Sahara desert crossing into Niger in West Africa, continuing to Nigeria. This was followed by a month-long journey likened to Joseph Conrad‚Äôs ‚ÄúHeart of Darkness‚Äù through the forests of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo), surfacing into the relatively modern world in Kenya via Uganda. From Kenya the last leg was south through Tanzania to either Zimbabwe or South Africa. This route has changed dramatically due to border closures and political instability creating no-go zones. The route has reversed itself somewhat over the last few years, with trucks now crossing from the north to the south of Africa, closely following the west coast all the way from Morocco to Cape Town with the biggest change in the route being made possible by the opening of Angola to tourism. The journey then continues through Southern and East Africa from Cape Town to Nairobi and on to Cairo. = Other routes = In Africa, commercial overland travel began with the Trans Africa and Cape to Cairo described above. From the mid-1980s eastern and southern Africa became more sought after by tourists and Nairobi to Cape Town is now the most travelled overland route in Africa. As more tourists look for adventure trips that fit into their annual holiday, shorter sections of overland routes have become available such as two- to three-week round trip from Nairobi taking in Kenya and Uganda. Istanbul to Cairo, via Syria and Jordan, is a classic overland route. It is a route that has been travelled for centuries, particularly during the Ottoman Empire. Historically it overlapped with the Hajj, with many people covering all or part of the route as part of their pilgrimage to Mecca. Backpackers discovered it in the 1970s and 1980s, with hippies searching for spiritual peace who departed to Jerusalem from Istanbul instead of going to India via Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. After the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, onward travel from Jerusalem to Cairo became a possibility. It is now well travelled by backpackers and overland companies alike although the number of travellers journeying the route can be affected by any unrest in neighbouring countries.

He is generally considered among the best directors of former Yugoslavia and the only director from Croatia that can be counted among the Yugoslav Black Wave. Biography Papiƒá was born in Vuƒçji Do, near Nik≈°iƒá in today's Montenegro. His early feature films and documentaries were part of Croatian and Yugoslav New Cinema, and often regarded as Croatian echo of the Black Wave artistic movement that mostly took place within Serbia. Additionally, Papiƒá himself was connected to the Croatian Spring political movement during the early 1970s. He was the member of the Zagreb filmophile circle influenced by the French New Wave, so-called \\"Hitchcockians\\", along with film-makers and critics Ante Peterliƒá, Zoran Tadiƒá, Branko Ivanda, Petar Krelja and centered on film critics Vladimir Vukoviƒá and Hrvoje Lisinski. Papiƒá's two best-known early feature films, Lisice and Predstava Hamleta u Mrdu≈°i Donjoj, were often attacked from the government sources. Lisice did not get permission to represent Yugoslavia in the Cannes Film Festival, so it entered Quinzaine program in 1970. Izbavitelj was heavily criticised by Stipe ≈†uvar, who alluded that film's allegory about Fascism actually also refers to the Communism.Quoted in Predratna psihoza: slike 30-tih u Izbavitelju Krste Papiƒáa, an article by Nikica Giliƒá (in Croatian) \\"I would say that among creative forces in our /i.e. Yugoslav/ cinema we have two tendencies. One is oriented on apologetics and self-censorship; it is of course sterile.... Another orientation manifested in so-called Black Wave, indeed in showing how here we are on the dead end of world's events.... Sometimes that is reduced to a primitive pamphlet, like in films The Rat Saviour and Acting Hamlet in the Village of Mrdusa Donja, which are then regarded as works of art in our community.\\" Papiƒá's subsequent feature films were more classical in its narration, but again politically controversial in the last decade of Yugoslavia. Particularly My Uncle's Legacy, critical picture of Yugoslavia's political situation under Titoism during Informbiro period, which was nominated for Golden Globe in 1989, has been surrounded by controversy and political attacks from traditional Party circles and especially Partisan Veterans' organisations, so the production was delayed for couple of years, but achieved due to support of intellectuals, newspapers and Party fractions in the time of disolvement and fight among Party fractions in last years of the Yugoslav federation. Papiƒá was awarded with Croatia's highest Vladimir Nazor Award for live achievement in cinema in 2006, and with Grand Prix Special des Am√©riques (for exceptional contribution to the cinematographic art) in 2004. He died in Zagreb on 7 February 2013 after a battle with stomach cancer.

Subsidiaries AMREP operates its businesses through two subsidiaries, AMREP Southwest Inc. and Kable Media Services, Inc. =Land development= AMREP Southwest Inc. operates AMREP's land development division. Shortly after its incorporation, the company purchased of land just north of Albuquerque, New Mexico, dubbing the new town Rio Rancho, New Mexico. It planned to subdivide and resell it to retirees and out-of-state vacationers. Rio Rancho slowly grew to a population of 1,000 by 1970. In 1971, it purchased an additional adjacent to the original purchase. Initially, the company used an aggressive sales approach to reselling the land. They would buy potential customers dinner and show a short video entitled \\"Your Golden Future\\" displaying a picturesque retirement. However, the brunt of the sales pitch was the property's supposed value as an investment. In reality, the homes were poor investments because of the ample lots AMREP owned. This effectively created an infinite supply that would keep prices low for years. This sales approach eventually led to lawsuits and in 1977, AMREP refocused its sales efforts to appeal to local residents. Selling lower cost equivalent homes to residents in the Albuquerque area proved a more legal and lucrative proposition. AMREP utilized a new sales method to go along with the change in target demographics. By offering significant financial incentives to companies to locate there, they would create jobs in the area. The increase in jobs would naturally bring in people creating a demand for housing. These incentives include tax reductions, inexpensive real estate, and subsidies. In 1981, Intel decided to build a $50 million manufacturing plant because of the incentives AMREP offered. This brought in a significant number of jobs and therefore a significant increase in real estate demand. AMREP would use this incentive-laden method to attract more companies into Rio Rancho. =Media services= Kable Media Services, Inc. operates AMREP's media services division. It was acquired in the late 1960s as Kable News Company. The division provides fulfillment services for magazines and publishers. It also provides graphic arts and marketing services. Kable Media Services in the second largest subscription fulfillment services in the country. In 2009, Kable Media Services became known as Palm Coast Data after the two locations merged. Legal issues In 1975, government regulators brought suit against AMREP for allegedly defrauding 45,000 investors for as much as $200 million. It was claimed that AMREP promised the investors that their real estate investments would double or triple in value in just a few years despite knowing that the land had no resale market. Ultimately, four of the company's officers, President Howard Friedman, Senior Vice President for Sales David Friedman, Executive Vice President Chester Carity, and one of the directors, Henry Hoffman, were sentenced to 6 months in prison and the company was fined $45,000. Later in 1993, the Federal Trade Commission would bring civil suit against AMREP with the same charges. As a result, there was a settlement of $350,000 given to the 22,000 defrauded land buyers. AMREP stopped its interstate land sales business which brought forth these issues in 1977. It refocused its real estate division into a land development division selling low-cost housing on its lots that it would sell locally.

The magazine also strongly supported the avant-garde in art and literature, which were viewed as a participation of Romanian artist and writers to the cultural unrest of the 1920s. The magazine was a focal point of a group of young writers, journalists, artists and other intellectuals, who were carried away by the euphoria following World War I, and, after Romania had fulfilled its national aspirations, were attempting to define the ways of perfecting their new homeland. This group strongly opposed the leftist radicals, who were looking with interest at the soviet experiment, and was looking towards the west. However, they thought that new Romania, considered to be a big and strong country, had to play an important role a renewed Europe, which was also trying to find its own new stability. The link to Western Europe was conceived mainly as an integration of the Romanian cultural and artistic movements into the European ones.Ovidiu Caraiani ‚Äì National identity and political legitimacy in modern Romania Such ideas were disseminated not only by \\"Cuv√¢ntul Liber\\", but also by other magazines, such as Contimporanul, Punct, Mi≈ücarea LiterarƒÉ and, later, by Unu. However, besides publishing their ideas, the group of young enthusiasts to which Eugen Filotti belonged, attempted to organize important cultural events which would help them promote their ideas. The most representative of these event, both due to its importance and to its international attendance was the \\"First exhibition of modern art\\" in Bucharest. The exhibition was organized in the building of the \\"Romanian Fine Arts Union\\" on Strada Corabiei Nr. 6, from November 30 to December 30, 1924. The main Romanian artists participating were M.H. Maxy, Marcel Iancu, Victor Brauner, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Mili≈£a Petra≈ücu and Mattis Teutsch. Important artists from other European countries presented some of their works, among which Teresa ≈ªarnower√≥wna, Mieczys≈Çaw Szczuka (Poland), Lajos Kass√°k (Hungary), Marc Darimont, Marcel Lempereur-Haut, Jozef Peeters (Belgium), Karel Teige (Czechoslovakia), Kurt Schwitters, Hans Arp, Arthur Segal, Paul Klee, Hans Richter, Erich Buchholz, Ernst Rudolf Vogenauer (Germany) and Viking Eggeling (Suedia).Mariana Vida, Gheorghe Vida ‚Äì Mattis Teutsch and the Romanian Avant-garde The exhibition opened on a Sunday, at noon, in a pitch-dark room: > \\"There were just two candles burning on a table covered by a black canvas. > Suddenly, Eugen Filotti made his appearance next to the table, relaxed and > inspired, reciting a text presenting to the public both the new form of art > and the exposed paintings\\" Tudor Vianu at that time a young professor of aesthetics, who also attended the opening, recalls in his memoirs: > \\"The dark room, swarming with visitors, where Eugen Filotti was finishing > his introductory speech, suddenly vibrated at the loud roll of drums. The > lights went on, focusing on a jazz orchestra located behind the speaker. The > orchestra, which also included a black musician started playing, and the > visitors started roaming around at the sound of string instruments, > trombones and drums.\\" In his memoirs, Sa≈üa PanƒÉ quotes parts of Eugen Filotti's speech, which emphasized the internal cohesion and the unity of modern art and called for an intensification of this art through spiritual and intellectual activities. Eugen Filotti predicted that this type of art would be understood only when the contemporary civilization would learn to look at painting in absolute purity. His speech quoted works of Wassily Kandinsky, Maurice de Vlaminck, Pablo Picasso and Paul Klee, as well as those of Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi and other Romanian artists.Sa≈üa PanƒÉ ‚Äì NƒÉscut √Æn 02 ‚Äì Editura Minerva, Bucure»ôti, 1973 In his own articles on the exhibition, Eugen Filotti presented the event in a positive light, and highlighted the value of the work exposed by Romanian artists, stressing that they were in no way inferior to the foreign participants. He noted \\"Constructivism dominates on each wall al the exhibition hall, however without completely obliterating expressionist visions, cubist decomposures or coloristic experiments.\\"Eugen Filotti ‚Äì Expozi≈£ia Contimporanului ‚Äì Cuv√¢ntul Liber, 13 Decembrie 1924 Nr. 47 p.20Scarlat Callimachi -Expozitia \\"Contimporanului\\" (insemnƒÉri) ‚Äì Punct, 1924, dec. 6 The exhibition also turned into a clash between \\"modernists\\" and \\"traditionalists\\". The group who had organized the exhibition, including Eugen Filotti supported a modernist, rationalist, democratic trend and wanted to promote a spiritual interaction with the rest of the world. On the opposite side, the adherents of different traditionalist movements, which had also emerged after World War I, did not refrain to exacerbate nationalistic and mystical expressions in art and culture. While the nationalistic movements had not evolved into the extremism of the 1930s, and the antagonism was still kept at an intellectual level, modernists perceived them already as a potential danger. The issue was not to oppose the presence of religion in culture, but to fight against the attempts of transforming it into an instrument of nationalism and antidemocracy. While antisemitism was not yet an issue, as many of the artists and writers supporting the modernist trends were Jewish, this could have contributed to the opposition of the traditionalists. These attitudes outlined the future movements in Romanian politics and culture, and the modernists were already laying the basis of their resistance against totalitarism, regardless whether it came from the political right or left.Camil Mure≈üan ‚Äì Laicism ≈üi religiozitate √Æn cultura rom√¢nƒÉ interbelicƒÉ ‚Äì Tudor Vianu expressed the view that \\"if the program of ethnic culturalism was adopted, Romanian culture would regress to an undignified provincial level\\".Tudor Vianu ‚Äì Prima expozitie internationala Contimporanul ‚Äì Miscarea literarƒÉ, 1924 No. 4. Expanding the same idea, Eugen Filotti wrote: \\"traditionalism means nothing else than the megalomania of distress\\"Eugen Filotti ‚Äì G√¢ndul nostru ‚Äì Cuv√¢ntul liber, seria a II-a, nr. 1, p. 2-4 A short time later, he continued in the same vein: > Under the banner of orthodoxy and tradition some intellectuals promote a > static ideal, petrified in the hieratic byzantine-muscovite forms of a > primitive culture, having no evolution whatsoever and nu future.

Eugen Filotti continued his journalistic activity till 1927. However, as time went by, he became increasingly disillusioned by the cultural life in Romania. The integration of Romanian culture into a more comprehensive European culture, which many of the young intellectuals of his generation had been attempting to promote, did not occur. Instead, currents of various nationalistic tendencies had proliferated and were increasingly active in opposing European integration. Some writers and artist had left for various western countries and many more were seriously considering this alternative. Gradually detaching himself from the Romanian internal cultural life, Eugen Filotti increasingly oriented his journalistic activity towards foreign policy, which had been his main concern in the early years of his career. At the AdevƒÉrul newspaper, he was given the responsibility of writing the editorials on foreign affairs and of coordinating the related activities. Diplomatic activityPress attach√©= In 1927, Eugen Filotti decided to give up journalism and to pursue a diplomatic career. After being appointed press attach√© in Prague where he worked for over a year, in 1928 Eugen Filotti was transferred to the Romanian Mission to the League of Nations in Geneva. From 1928 to 1930 he works, next to other diplomats, among which Savel RƒÉdulescu, as aid to Nicolae Titulescu, permanent representative of Romania to the League of Nations. In 1929 Eugen Filotti married Elisabeta Ta≈ücƒÉ, daughter of professor Gheorghe Ta≈ücƒÉ, at that time rector of the Academy for High Commercial and Industrial Studies in Bucharest. = Director of the Press = Eugen Filotti as Director of the Press ‚Äì 1935 In 1930, Eugen Filotti is promoted Director of the Press and of Information in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the early 1930s Romania's foreign policy, under the leadership of Nicolae Titulescu, was pursuing a system of alliances, which would enable the smaller countries of the Balkan region to oppose any aggression. At that time, the National Socialist Party had not gained power in Germania, but, in Titulescu's political vision, such alliances had to be created in advance, so as to have time to consolidate. Titulescu hoped to create a union of all Balkanic countries. As, due to its territorial claims, Bulgaria did not adhere to such a proposal, there was still the possibility of developing an alliance of the other Balkan states: Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey. Romania was the diplomatic force pressing for an alliance. In his capacity of Director of the Press and Information, Eugen Filotti was in charge of informing the mass media and to develop a favorable public opinion in all concerned countries. Finally, after several years of negotiations and various bilateral agreements, the Balkan Pact was signed on February 9, 1934 in the great aula of the Academy of Athens by Demetrios Maximos for Greece, Nicolae Titulescu for Romania, Tevfik R√º≈üt√º Aras for Turkey and Bogoljub Jevtiƒá for Yugoslavia.Oana Panait ‚Äì Carol al II-lea, presa si propaganda ‚Äì Historia, Nr. 65, 2007 √én his capacity of director of the press, Eugen Filotti had the responsibility of verifying the activity of foreign press correspondents working in Romania. Besides many journalists, adhering to high professional standards, there were some less honest persons who tried to squeeze in. The case of Julius K√∂ver exemplifies the problems raised by incorrect reporting. K√∂ver claimed to be an economic correspondent of the Austrian daily Neue Freie Presse, presenting the required credentials. In 1933 he also registered at the Direction of the Press in Bucharest as correspondent of the American United Press International. K√∂ver also contributed to the newspapers \\"Pester Lloyd\\" ≈üi \\"Budapesti H√≠rlap\\" published in Hungary and the German language newspapers Prager Tagblatt and Die Wirtschaft published in Czechoslovakia. Julius K√∂ver's activities started raising suspicions in February 1935, when United Press released the information that Prince Nicholas of Romania was expected to return to Romania, where the Iron Guard was preparing a revolt intending to depose King Carol II and to replace him with Nicholas. Another false news sent by Julius K√∂ver to America claimed that Nicolae Titulescu, the minister of Foreign Affairs, had signed an agreement in Moscow, which granted the Soviet army the right of transit through Romania. Such information had not only the result of casting a negative image of the country but of also weakening Romania's position within the Balkan Pact. Called by Eugen Filotti to the Direction of the Press for explanations, Julius K√∂ver claimed that the news releases of the United Press Agency had been generated in Vienna and that he had nothing to do with them. Actually K√∂ver had designed an ingenious system to transmit his fallacies to various branch offices of the agency, from where they were retransmitted to the United States. He hoped that this stratagem would help him hide his identity from the Romanian authorities and, at the same time, would enable him claim that he used it to elude the censorship existing in Romania. Eugen Filotti was able to point these malversations and, at last, Julius K√∂ver was expelled from Romania.Iancu Mo≈£u ‚Äì Demnitate ardeleana si tradare d√Æmboviteana ‚Äì Foaia transilvanƒÉ, April 12, 2007 Apart from his activities in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after returning from his missions in Prague and in Geneva, Eugen Filotti renewed his contacts with the Romanian cultural elite. This time his activity was mainly related to the Romanian chapter of the International PEN locally called the \\"PEN Club\\". On April 8, 1933 a new committee of the Romanian PEN Club was elected, including Victor Eftimiu (chairman), Ion S√¢n-Giorgiu (general secretary), Eugen Filotti (treasurer), Ion Marin Sadoveanu, Lucian Blaga as well as a member of the Cluj subsidiary. At that time, the cultural life in Romania was extremely agitated. The new committee was forced to confront the international tensions related to the Interna≈£ional PEN Congress, planned in Dubrovnik on May 23, 1933. Adolf Hitler had been appointed Chancellor of Germany and the independence of the German PEN, who was also represented at the congress, was put in doubt by other member organizations. Germany was attempting to ensure international recognition of the legitimacy of the new regime, and was trying to obtain resolutions in its favor in various international organizations. Eugen Filotti's diplomatic experience was an important element in defining the position of the Romanian delegation at the Dubrovnik congress. He was able to convince Victor Eftimiu to pass a resolution of the committee, expressing its reservations towards Germany. In the following year, there were other conflicts which surfaced in the Romanian PEN, reflecting the political turmoil in Romania. On February 11, 1934 at the Extraordinary General Assembly of the Romanian PEN, Alexandru Busuioceanu, who was also Eugen Filotti's deputy at the Direc≈£ion of the Press and of Informations, brought to the attention of the attendants that \\"three members of the Romanian PEN, Nae Ionescu, Drago≈ü Protopopescu and Nichifor Crainic had been arrested, without a warrant because they had freely expressed their opinions\\" Busuioceanu, supported by Perpessicius, demanded that the leadership of the Romanian PEN intervene for their release. The three writers, known for their sympathies for the Iron Guard, had been arrested as part of the crack down following the assassination of prime minister Ion G. Duca. Victor Eftimiu, as president of the PEN indicated that he had requested information regarding how the three members of the PEN Club were treated during their arrest, but was opposed to any other actions of support by the PEN. The differences of opinion between the democratic oriented members and the right wingers sharpened. When new elections for a committee were called in 1934, two lists of candidates were submitted to the General Assembly. The first, presented by Victor Eftimiu, which also included Eugen Filotti as a candidate was politically independent, while a second list, presented by Ion Petrovici, included as candidates Ion Pillat, Tudor Vianu, Perpessicius and Lucian Blaga was leaning towards the political right. Victor Eftimiu's list received 72% of the votes while the list proposed by Ion Petrovici had only 28%. After this decision Nichifor Crainic resigned from the Romanian PEN. However the tensions, reflecting the contradictions of Romanian society in the 1930s remained.Nicolae SƒÉcƒÉli≈ü ‚Äì Dalles: destin ≈üi istorie (II) ‚Äì Tricolorul, 2008, 15 mai =Minister plenipotentiary to Turkey= √én 1935 Eugen Filotti was appointed plenipotentiary minister to Ankara. The position was important for the Nicolae Titulescu's foreign policy. The Balkan Pact had been signed just a year before and Titulescu was aware that the framework was still frail and that further steps were necessary in order to consolidate the alliance so that it could efficiently react in case of an attack on one of its members. Therefore, he tried to appoint diplomats who shared his views as ministers plenipotentiary in the signatory countries. Titulescu's dismissal coincided with the departure of two key personalities from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Mihail Arion and Savel RƒÉdulescu. The former, who held the position of secretary general of the ministry resigned, in circumstances that are not clear, his resignation bein formally accepted on August 29, 1936. The latter, who had served as undersecretary of the ministry, was not included in the new team, replaced by Victor BƒÉdulescu. On August 28, 1936 King Carol II of Romania fired Niculae Titulescu and replaced him with Victor Antonescu. The decision was greeted with disbelief. Both the Romanian and foreign new commentators expressed the opinion that Titulescu would soon reenter the Romanian politics. The French newspapers were unaninomous. The \\"Le Temps\\" of August 31, 1936 indicated that \\"Mr. Titulescu is not the kind of man to accept such matters with resignation\\" while \\"L'Intransigeant\\" stated that the Titulescu's removal from the government din could only be temporary, opinion shared by the \\"Journal des d√©bats\\" and \\"Le Figaro\\". In the United Kingdom, on September 1, 1936, \\"The Times\\" wrote that, \\"in any case, there are no reasons to assume that Titulescu's disappearance from the political scene can be anything else than a passing eclipse. Men of this calibre and with his character do not leave the political arena for a long time\\". On September 2, 1936 \\"The Daily Telegraph\\" concurred that Titulescu would soon be active again in Romanian politics. The ministries of Foreign Affairs of France, the United Kingdom and Germany also expressed the same assumptions. Many Romanian diplomats indicated their intention to resign in protest. Romanian and foreign press, reported the news and even newspapers which expressed doubts about the attitude of the diplomatic corps emphasized the intention of the government to purge high ranking diplomatic personnel especially the chiefs of mission known for their attachment to Titulescu. The government's intentions were not a secret in Bucharest. Armand CƒÉlinescu, a person who was politically well informed stated that \\"at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs there will be a significant reshuffle of the diplomatic corps\\". Despite the evidence, several representatives of the government denied such intentions and the diplomatic representatives abroad were urged to follow suit. Despite denials, the new foreign minister, Victor Antonescu proceeded to a massive change in the staff of the Romanian foreign missions, recalling many of the plenipotentiary ministers. These changes, if not initiated, were at least approved by prime minister Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu. Most of the heads of mission recalled were suspected of supporting the former minister of foreign affairs. The list of recalled ministers included: Nicolae Lahovary (Albania), Caius Brediceanu (Austria), Dimitrie I. Ghika (Belgium), Vasile Stoica (Bulgaria), Theodor Emandi (Czechoslovakia), Raoul Bossy (Finland), Constantin Langa-RƒÉ≈ücanu (Greece), Vasile Grigorcea (Hungary), Grigore Constantinescu (Iran), Ion Aurel Vassiliu (Japan), Constantin Antoniade (League of Nations), Dimitrie DrƒÉghicescu (Mexico), Constantin Vi≈üoianu (Poland), Mihail Boerescu (Switzerland), Eugen Filotti (Turkey) and Alexandru GurƒÉnescu (Yugoslavia). In order to emphasize the punitive character of the measure, their diplomatic passports were withdrawn and all their diplomatic privileges withdrawn the moment the orders for their return to Romania were issued. The reshuffling of the staff coincided with the return to political or diplomatic activities of known opponents of Titulescu, such as Anton Bibescu and Victor CƒÉdere. The magnitude of these changes indicated the intention of the new minister to replace most of the senior staff of the ministry. However, the implementation to the desired extent proved impossible to implement and part of the recalled ministers were appointed to other legations or received other positions at the headquarters of the Ministry.Potra, George G. ‚Äì Reac≈£ii necunoscute la demiterea lui Titulescu August 29, 1936: O \\"mazilire perfidƒÉ\\" ‚Äì Magazin Istoric, 1998, Nr. 6 =Minister plenipotentiary to Greece= In the fall of 1936 Eugen Filotti was appointed minister plenipoten≈£iary to Athens. Although Greece was a signatory of the Balkan Pact, the now position was in not linked to the strengthening of the alliance, which Eugen Filotti had pursued before. After Titulescu's departure, the Romanian government was less interested in this alliance, whose role was seen just as a pact of friendship between the four signatories, without implying any consequent measures.Andrei Alexandru CƒÉpu≈üan ‚Äì Diploma≈£i rom√¢ni de elitƒÉ Vol. II ‚Äì Ed. Ars Docendi, Bucure»ôti 2009, pp.155‚Äì161 Romania had other problems in Greece related to the Aromanian minority (called Vlachs by the Greek). The Aromanians, which the government of Bucharest considered to be a Romanian population, were considered second class citizens in Greece and denied the right of having an education in their native language. However, taking into account the rapprochement policies of the two countries, the Greek government accepted the establishment of schools in which the education was to be in Romanian, on condition that such schools be financed by the Romanian government. The implementation of the agreement was not without difficulties. Eugen Filotti made important efforts to strengthen the Romanian High School in Thessaloniki and to extend the network of Romanian primary schools which had been established in the villages of Epirus, Thessaly, West and Central Macedonia with high concentrations of Aromanian population. The best students of primary schools received scholarships to continue their education at the high school in Thessaloniki, which followed the curriculum established by the Ministry of National Education of Bucharest. Eugen Filotti also took care of the quality of education provided, ensuring that good material conditions would encourage well qualified teachers from Romania to compete for positions in the Romanian schools in Greece. =Minister plenipotentiary to Bulgaria= Eugen Filotti, minister plenipotentiary and the staff of the Romanian Legation in Sofia on the steps of the Romanian High School at the celebration of May 10, 1940 In the fall of 1938, Eugen Filotti was transferred from Athens to Sofia. The new assignment was different from his previous ones, as Bulgaria was not a friendly country. Defeated in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria had been forced, by the Peace Treaty of Bucharest to cede Southern Dobruja (also known as the Cadrilater) to Romania, where the Romanian administration created the counties of Durostor and Caliacra. Romanian statistics of 1930, show that the Bulgarian population in the Cadrilater was of 149,409 while the Romanians were 77,728. The Romanian population had increased significantly compared to 1910, when the Romanians in the area were only 6,359. This is due to the policy of colonization of the 1920s, when Romanians from Wallachia as well as Aromanians from Greece and other Balkan countries had been settled in the Cadrilater. If Romania had an important Bulgarian minority, concentrated mainly in Dobruja, there also was an important Romanian minority in Bulgaria. Many Romanians were living along the Bulgarian bank of the Danube. Besides there were also Aromanians, living mostly in the Bulgarian part of Macedonia. The problems of minorities were an important to the bilateral Romano-Bulgarian diplomatic relations and it was inevitable that, in his new position, Eugen Filotti would be confronted with issues related the rights of the Romanian minority in Bulgaria. As he had done in Athens, Eugen Filotti concentrated his efforts on strengthening the Romanian education network in Bulgaria, which included primary schools in the villages with Romanian population along the Danube as well as a Romanian high school in Sofia. All these schools were financially supported by the Romanian government and followed the curriculum if the Ministry of National Education in Bucharest. Although Bulgaria had territorial claims regarding not only the Cadrilater, but also the part of Macedonia which was located in Yugoslavia, the problem of rectifying the borders of Balkan countries was not yet on the agenda √Æn 1938, when Eugen Filotti arrived in Sofia. However, towards the end of 1939, the government in Sofia raised territorial claims and demanded that negotiations with Romania be started. The problem of Southern Dobruja differed from the one of other provinces which Romania had gained after World War II as it had not been decided in the Peace Treaties of Trianon, Saint-Germain-en- Laye sau Neuilly- sur-Seine. Therefore, such negotiations were not viewed as a revisionism of the peace treaties of 1919. Even in Romania, the issue of Southern Dobruja had been controversial. In 1913, King Carol I and many other politicians had disagreed with the territorial extension requested by Titu Maiorescu on a territory which did not have a Romanian population, arguing that this extension was contrary to the aspirations of creating a Romanian national state. Unlike other situations regarding border disputes, for the Cadrilater problem no international conference was organized. It was mainly negotiated by a succession of diplomatic notes and discussions, in which a compromise acceptable to both parts was reached. As Romanian minister plenipotentiary to Sofia, Eugen Filotti was directly involved in these negotiations. At the beginning, the positions of the two countries were totally contradictory. Romania wanted to change the ethnic status quo in the region and to preserve the territorial status-quo, while Bulgaria was aiming to achieve exactly the opposite. The objectives of the negotiations was not only related to the transfer of sovereignty over the Cadrilater, but to establish a \\"final and perpetual\\" border between the two countries, which also involved an exchange of population. The Romanian diplomacy insisted on solving this problem at the same time. Romanian was facing similar problems in Transilvania, where the existence of an important Hungarian minority was claimed by Hungary to justify a revision of the borders fixed by the Treaty of Trianon. Romania was afraid that the existence of a Bulgarian minority in Northern Dobruja could be used by Bulgaria for further territorial concessions. Besides, as most of the Romanian population in the Cadrilater, had been colonized after its annexation, the Romanian government felt it had a moral obligation to defend the interests of these colonists. At the beginning of the negotiations, the Romanian diplomats insisted on the mandatory emigration of all Bulgarians residing in Northern Dobruja (the counties of Constan≈£a and Tulcea) while the Romanians of Southern Dobruja would have the freedom of choosing to emigrate to Romania or to stay. As this was rejected by Bulgaria, later in the negotiations the Romanians suggested that all Bulgarians residing in Romania be obliged to emigrate and a similar emigration would be mandatory for the Romanians of Southern Dobruja, but not for those residing in other parts of Bulgaria. Partially in order not to derail the negotiations and partially giving in to Germany's pressures, Bulgaria agreed to negotiate an exchange of population. The Bulgarians first suggested that emigration should not be a mandatory requirement. When the Romanians insisted on this issue, the Bulgarians rejected the proposal of the emigration of all Bulgarians residing in Romania versus the emigration of all Romanians residing in Southern Dobruja as not being equivalent. Therefore, the Bulgarians suggested a combination of mandatory and voluntary emigration. The final agreement, reached by the Treaty of Craiova stipulated: * a mandatory population exchange between Bulgaria and Romania for the Bulgarian population of Northern Dobruja (counties of Constan≈£a and Tulcea) and the Romanian population of Southern Dobruja (the counties of Durostor and Caliacra); this phase was to be completed within three months after the exchange of the ratification documents; * an optional emigration of ethnic Bulgarians residing in other parts of Romania and of ethnic Romanians residing in other parts of Bulgaria, to be completed within one year after the exchange of the ratification documents; * the right of each government to decree the mandatory emigration of the Romanian or Bulgarian nationals if the number of persons having opted for voluntary emigration was not equivalent. Besides, various technical problems related to the population transfer had to be settled. After lengthy discussions the two parties involved agreed that the ownership of buildings located in rural areas which belonged to emigrants would be taken over by the state from which they emigrated. While an agreement on the mandatory emigration could be reached, a contradiction between the interest of the two parties prevented a consensus on the optional emigration. The Bulgarian government wanted to encourage all Bulgarians living in other parts of Romania, outside of Dobrogea, to be resettled in Bulgaria. The Romanian government preferred not to dismantle the compact vlach communities of north-western Bulgaria and therefore did not agree on a mandatory parity of the population moved from one country to the other. Each of the two parties agreed to compensate the immigrants for the losses they incurred. However it was agreed that properties located in urban areas remained the property of the emigrants and also that the emigrants would maintain ownership of all mobile assets (including live-stock). The Treaty of Craiova created a joint Bulgaro-Romanian commission having the mission of overseeing the exchange of population and of settling individual claims or disputes. The Romanian part also unsuccessfully attempted to maintain control over the Caliacra-Balcic area along the Black Sea coast, which the late Queen Mary of Romania had liked and where her heart was buried. Even as late as August 9, 1940, king Carol II of Romania was sending instructions to Eugen Filotti, urging him to insist on the matter. However the Bulgarians were intransigent on the matter, demanding the transfer of the entire Cadrilater. Therefore, after the signature of the treaty, Queen Mary's was reinhumed at the Bran Castle. Contrary to the assessment of some Bulgarian historiansDr. Blagovest Niagulov (Sofia) ‚Äì Frontiera ‚Äì un zid sau un pod ‚Äì Magazin Istoric ‚Äì 2000, Nr. 1 the Romanian position was not weakened by Germany but rather by the Soviet Union. After having occupied Bessarabia in June 1940, the USSR considered Bulgaria a more friendly country than Romania and considered that it would be in its interest to have a common border with Bulgaria. Therefore, the soviet diplomacy was encouraging the Bulgarians not to be satisfied with the Cadrilater, but to demand the transfer of its sovereignty over the entire Dobruja. Besides creating a common border between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, this also presented the potential advantage for the Soviet Union of gaining control over the Danube Delta. As the Delta was not part of the Dobruja, it would not have been occupied by Bulgaria, but the possibility of Romania maintaining sovereignty over a territory to which it could have access only through a reach of the Danube bordered by unfriendly nations, was doubtful. During an audience, king Boris III of Bulgaria informed Eugen Filotti about the soviet intentions. This induced the Romanians to accelerate the negotiations and to reach an agreement before the Soviet Union would intervene in a more aggressive way. On September 4, 1940, the Treaty of Craiova, finalizing over a year long negotiations. In accordance with the provisions of the treaty, the mandatory population exchange was completed in two phases. The main exchange took place in November‚ÄìDecember 1940; during this phase 61,500 Bulgarians from Northern Dobruja and 83,928 Romanians from the Cadrilater moved. The second phase, which was implemented in accordance with an additional agreement, necessitated the move of another 3,600 Bulgarians and 4,700 Romanians from other parts of the two countries, outside the Dobruja. Thus, the total number of emigrants was of about 65,000 Bulgarians, who resettled in mostly in the Cadrilater and of about 88,000 Romanians who resettled in Northern Dobruja. However, Eugen Filotti was not concerned any more with these aftermaths of the Treaty of Craiova. After having concluded his lead role in the negotiations with Bulgaria, Eugen Filotti was recalled to Bucharest. He was assigned a new mission which was to be even more challenging.Doru Ungureanu, Nicolae Dumitrache ‚Äì 1940.

Following diplomatic rules, after such important changes, diplomatic envoys in the two countries were usually replaced. Eugen Filotti was appointed the new Romanian minister plenipotentiary to Budapest. The problems of the Romanian population on the territory of Hungary, which included Northern Transylvania were totally different from the ones of the Romanian minorities in Greece or Bulgaria, which had been Eugen Filotti's concern in his previous assignments. Immediately after the Vienna Award, the Hungarian authorities had taken violent actions against the Romanian population. Even before Eugen Filotti's arrival in Budapest, the Government of Romania had forwarded complaints to Berlin and to Rome, following which the Roggieri-Altenburg Commission was created to investigate the accusations brought either by Romania or by Hungary and to recommend corrective actions. Starting 1941, two subcommissions were set up, the first one in Bra≈üov and the second in Cluj. The subcommissions were however taking action only in the case of complaints which had to present specific cases of oppressive measures. Therefore, the Romanian authorities were compelled to obtain not only general statements about such events, but detailed information, as precise as possible, regarding the alleged abuses of the Hungarians, in order to present their case to the commission as well fundamented as possible.Petre Out ‚Äì Comisia Roggeri-Altenburg ‚Äì Magazin Istoric ‚Äì 2001, Nr. 8 An important task of the Romanian legation in Budapest, as well as of the subordinated consulates in Cluj and Oradea was to obtain such information. As the inhabitants of the localities where abuses had taken place were prevented to go to the legation or to one of the consulates and the staff of the diplomatic units did not know where to go to find out what was really going on, this task was extremely difficult. Eugen Filotti was able to set up a system by which the required information could be collected so that he could transmit it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bucharest who, in turn, would forward the required documentation to the arbitration commission. With the help of Nicolae Colan, bishop of the orthodox diocese of Vad, Feleac and Cluj and of Juliu Hossu, bishop of the Greek Catholic Diocese of Cluj- Gherla who, during the war, was seated in Oradea, priests from villages in which Romanians constituted a majority were informing their bishops about the situation in their parishes. The dioceses would then forward the pertinent information to Eugen Filotti, at the legation in Budapest, from where it was sent through diplomatic channels to Bucharest. Another active factor in this set-up was Nicolae BƒÉlan, metropolite of Transylvania, whom Eugen Filotti met in Sibiu each time he returned to Romania, in order to coordinate the actions taken on religious and diplomatic channels. Inevitably, the Hungarian authorities became aware of these activities. If they helped provide information to the Romanians, they also induced repressive actions against the Romanian clergy. Except being subjected to repressive actions in their villages, there were frequent cases in which Romanians from Northern Transylvania were displaced for forced labour to Hungary, mostly for the maintenance of roads. They were however allowed to write letters to their relatives at home, informing them about where they were working. These informations were relayed to the Romanian legation in Budapest, and, in his capacity of plenipotentiary minister, Eugen Filotti visited these places to gain first hand information on how the Romanians were treated. There were several cases when the Hungarian guards treated Eugen Filotti offensively, disregarding his diplomatic status. Abuses committed on the territory of Hungary were beyond the authority of the Roggeri-Altenburg Commission. Therefore, on these matters Eugen Filotti forwarded protest notes directly to the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Budapest. Raoul ≈ûorban ‚Äì O misiune diplomaticƒÉ secretƒÉ The Romanian educational system had been completely dismantled by the Hungarian authorities in Northern Transylvania. The entire Romanian population was compelled to complete the curriculum in Hungarian language. Romanian school books could neither be printed in Northern Transylvania nor be imported from Romania. Again, the Romanian church was the only organization which, through the clergy, could provide education in Romanian during Sunday religious courses. The Greek-Catholic diocese had its own printing presses in Oradea and could therefore edit a significant number of books in Romanian, covering various religious subjects. Eugen Filotti had frequent contacts with the church authorities in order to assess the needs as well as the ways of supporting these activities from Romania. Starting 1943, the persecution of Jews in Hungary became harsher and after March 19, 1944, when the German army occupied Hungary and general Szt√≥jaj D√∂me was installed as head of the new Hungarian government, these persecutions were further intensified. Under the Szt√≥jaj government massive deportations of Jews towards Auschwitz and other extermination camps took place. The position of the Romanian government was the Jews in occupied Northern Transylvania were Romanian citizens and therefore were entitled to the protection of the Romanian authorities.Raoul ≈ûorban ‚Äì Despre o actiune de salvare a evreilor din \\"Transilvania de Nord\\" in timpul Holocaustului ‚Äì As head of the Romanian diplomatic mission in Hungary, Eugen Filotti ordered that Romanian passports and other travel documents be issued to Jews of Northern Transylvania.Radu Ioanid ‚Äì Evreii sub regimul AntonescuYad Vashem ‚Äì The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority This action was implemented with the help of the Romanian consuls Constantin ≈¢incu at the Budapest consulate and Mihai Marina at the Oradea consulate.Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania, Bucarest, 2004 Raoul ≈ûorban ‚Äì Invazie de stafii ‚Äì Ora adevƒÉrului The Oradea consulate also helped by illegally transporting Jews from Northern Transylvania to Romania in the consulate's automobiles. Based on information obtained from Dr. Kupfet Miksa, one of the leaders of the Jewish community in Oradea as well as on his own findings, consul Mihai Marina wrote a report documenting the deportation of Jews to German extermination camps forwarding it to Eugen Filotti. After reviewing it, Eugen Filotti chose to short circuit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bucharest, and, in order to make sure that it became known to the international community, send it directly to Vespasian Pella, the Romanian minister plenipotentiary in Bern, who presented it to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania In July 1944, Eugen Filotti came to Bucharest, in order to present to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs information regarding Northern Transylvania, necessary to prepare the Romanian claims at a future peace conference. At the same time, Eugen Filotti got actively involved with the diplomats who were preparing the coup which would take Romania out of the alliance with Germany, and make the country switch sides to join the Allies. = Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. = Eugen Filotti √Æn 1971 at his residence in Bujoreni Street of Bucure»ôti Immediately after Romania switched sided on August 23, 1944 and joined the Allies, Eugen Filotti was appointed secretary general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under foreign minister Grigore Niculescu-Buze≈üti in the government headed by general Constantin SƒÉnƒÉtescu. He kept the same position, under foreign minister Constantin Vi≈üoianu in the following government, headed by general Nicolae RƒÉdescu. His first efforts in his new position was to inform all Romanian diplomatic missions abroad about the changes following King Michael's Coup and to send the corresponding instructions on actions to be taken by these missions. Also, as soon as the military situation in Bucharest was brought under control, he took steps to bring the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Bucharest and to ensure its return to normal activity. Due to the allied bombing raids, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been evacuated to BƒÉile Herculane. In September 1944, moving the ministry back to Bucharest implied difficulties, as the German artillery on the Yugoslav bank of the Danube prevented the use of the main road along this river. At the same time the German and Hungarian army had occupied the city of Arad and were advancing upstream the Mure≈ü Valley, making the alternative route very risky. Finally, according to prevailing diplomatic conventions, an exchange of diplomats which were posted at the diplomatic missions in Berlin, Budapest and Bratislava, capitals of countries still under German control, had to be organized. The negotiations were carried out with the help of the diplomatic missions of neutral countries: Switzerland and Sweden. Though an agreement of the involved governments was reached, the exchange of diplomats did not take place, because the Hungarian and Slovak diplomats in Bucharest, refused to return to their countries. As a result, the Romanian diplomats were kept in captivity in Germany until the end of the war.

His most recent novel titled Oink, Oink, Oink: is a surreal, black comedy that plays with themes from science fiction, pop culture, consumerism, and genetic engineering. It was published by Hunter Publishers in October 2008, and reissued online as an e-book through Smashwords in May, 2011. Biography Eric Yoshiaki Dando was born in Tokyo but grew up in Melbourne. He was associated with the short lived grunge and dirty realism movements in Australian literature in the last century (1990s). He also experiments with cryptographs (cryptograms) and humorous comics, the first of which was published in Cordite although inaccurately credited to Evan Dando. Snail Eric Dando's first novel Snail attracted widespread attention as one of the very few unsolicited novels published by a major publishing company. At the time, he was the youngest Australian writer published by Penguin. The story behind its publication became a minor sensation and has been subject to rumour and speculation to the point where it has taken on mythic qualities. The general story is that Eric Dando submitted his manuscript bound in floorboards, though sometimes it has been said they were palings from a fence amongst other things. The legend continues that it remained where it was in the office of Penguin until someone tripped over it and read it. Currently, Snail is out of print, despite being voted in a 2010 Penguin Poll as one of the Top 100 books. The poll was officially conducted by Penguin via their Facebook page in which Australian fans were asked to vote for their favourite Penguin book of all time. Snail explored themes of madness, suicide, and drugs. It is a darkly humorous novel, but one which is undeniably positive and optimistic rather than glorifying the grunge genre of which it is a part. 'Printed entirely in lower case, the book seems to present a challenge to the reader - to make it through without being driven mad by the deliberate feyness of lower case.' - Tegan Bennet, 1996. 'Dando writes, 'jokes are always needed', and jokes - mostly good jokes - are his book's mainstay.' - Australian Book Review, 1996. 'Refreshingly, Dando's philosophical approach appears to derive from the Renaissance tendency to view the human soul or psyche as having an analogical relationship with the natural world...' - Philosopher Magazine, 1996. Oink, Oink, Oink: A Savage Modern Fable Oink, Oink, Oink, described by its publisher as 'a savage modern fable about science, family, television, and love gone wrong', is a satirical novel describing a young man's journey from his home in Japan to meet his estranged, mad-scientist father in Melbourne, Australia. It was first published in Australia by Hunter Publishers in October 2008. Following difficulties with the publisher, Dando negotiated release of his book and it is currently in print via Smashwords. In selecting it as one of the \\"best books of 2008\\", reviewer Laurie Steed called it 'like Orwell on acid' and many reviewers have commented on its surreal tone and humorous, yet unsettling, view of consumerism, environmental degradation, and progress left to run wild. In 2008, Oink, Oink, Oink was also featured on ABS's First Tuesday Bookclub show with many positive comments which further defined Dando's novels as having a cult following. 'Imagine Woody Allen and Chuck Palahniuk programming a festival for your brain... Part satirical horror, part spooky speculative fiction, a savagely funny critique of consumer-driven society.'‚Äî The Big Issue, Australia 'Vonnegut meets Orwell in Oink, Oink, Oink‚Ä¶a droll and unsettling nightmare of a book.'‚Äî The Age, Melbourne. 'This black little fable begins with one of the best opening sentences I've seen lately, something that could sum up an entire generation's understanding of 20th-century world history.'‚Äî Sydney Morning Herald 'Oink is futuristic, zany, black, surreal.'‚ÄîThe Sunday Age, Melbourne Bibliography Novels * snail (Penguin, 1996) * Oink, Oink, Oink: a savage modern fable (Hunter Publishers, 2008; reissued by Smashwords, 2011) External links *ABC First Tuesday Bookclub episode *Author website: ericdando.com *Cordite *Oink Oink Oink on Smashwords Category:Living people Category:20th-century Australian novelists Category:20th-century Australian male writers Category:21st-century Australian novelists Category:Australian male novelists Category:Australian male short story writers Category:Writers from Melbourne Category:1970 births Category:20th-century Australian short story writers Category:21st-century Australian short story writers Category:Grunge lit Category:Grunge lit authors Category:21st-century Australian male writers ","title":"Eric Dando"},{"id":"17965077","text":"Roll Away is the debut album by the British blues rock power trio Back Door Slam.

The main headquarters of LOBO are deep inside a cavern in the Sonoran Desert. The team has several different vehicles as transportation and back up. They often uses a minijet, a turbojet backpack with retractable wings and a large behemoth vehicle used as a mobile headquarters. Kid Acero also has a trained eagle who helps him in his adventures in the wilderness. The COBRA Organization has his main headquarters in a volcano island located somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico, but also has several minor safety homes around the world. A similar plot was later used by Mattel in 1999 when they launched a new action figure named Max Steel. Main characters Heroes * Kid Acero ‚Äì The \\"basic\\" good guy leader of the LOBO Squadron. It is widely accepted that Kid Acero is a nickname and not his real name, mostly like Kid Azteca. His real name was not revealed. He has a friendly and healthy personality, and is an expert in all kind of sports. He has a large number of gold medals and trophies due to his dedication to a healthy life and constant workout. * Invisible Man ‚Äì Good friend and partner of Kid Acero. Same as his partner, his real name remains unknown, and most characters simply calls him \\"Invisible\\". He has a clownish personality, but is also extremely greedy, and is extremely attractive to women. He is repeatedly seen flirting with several women, despite the fact he seems to have a serious relationship with his girlfriend, Mal√π, who was one of a few black characters at the time who was not heavily stereotyped. Invisible had the largest support cast of the trio, having a large family and several recurring friends (created for the comics). Among the most frequent were his nephew, the \\"Genius Child Amadeus\\" (kind of a 12 years old mad scientist); Amadeus\` grandfather (apparently, Invisible's uncle), \\"Abue\\" (Granny) Gertudis (Invisible's grandmother, and his combat trainer! Still a formidable fighter at 80 years old); plus \\"Negro\\" (Black Man) Ezequiel (a seemingly Cuban black man, judging from his stereotypical accent), and \\"Gordo\\" (Fatso) Zap√¨a√¨n (possibly based on the books editor), and Quicxic, a talking spider monkey, they found in the Chiapas jungle. * Bionic Man ‚Äì He was mostly CIPSA's response to the Six Million Dollar Man, and also have two bionic legs and bionic right arm, but not eye. As the other members of the LOBO Squadron, he is just called \\"Bi√≥nico\\", instead of his real name. He is an ex-astronaut who was reconstructed using bionic implants after an unfortunate accident while landing after a successful mission on space. Owing to his previous soldier training, he has the most serious personality among the members of LOBO, often a bit obnoxious. Villains * Doctor Drago ‚Äì The supreme leader of COBRA Organization. He is no other than Big Jim's Dr. Steel, with a different name. In the comic, he played a role quite similar as Lex Luthor does in Golden Age Superman comics, and it is supposed to be a mad scientist who has large technological resources at his disposal. However, he seemed to have a relatively friendly relationship with Invisible, as he even loaned the hero over 500,000 USD at a time. * Garfio el Temible ‚Äì A mercenary hired by Doctor Drago to help him in his quest to conquest the world, weapons specialist and bodyguard. He's a completely new character created using parts of different Big Jim toys, with a hook for a left hand. In the comics, he was quite the dumb sidekick to Doctor Drago. * Nocton ‚Äì An alien who joins forces with Doctor Dragon to conquest the world. He has light green alien skin which shows some phosphorescence, specially in the dark. It is not clear from where Nocton came up, except that he is from a distant galaxy, and he is using Doctor Drago as a tool to understand mankind in order to facilitate his conquest. * Zorak ‚Äì Exactly the same villain as in the original Big Jim toys. He is a rival of Doctor Drago, and fights Kid Acero following his own twisted purposes, but sometimes teams up with Drago, if it is convenient for his interests. Regionally, he was named \\"Zorak, the Dual Menace\\", instead of Double Trouble Zorak. * Rubicunda Von Kraupp ‚Äì Created exclusively for the comic, she was the top boss of all American Mafias, weighted about 200 kg, and had the weirdest motive of all the villains in the comic, her only goal was to marry Invisible Man! Even weirder, Doctor Drago fell in love with her at a point, and went to great lengths to win her heart. Seemingly, he did. Success *Kid Acero was sold from 1974 to 1980. After this date the name of the toy line changed to James Bond until it was retired from the market in 1986. *Comics based on the Kid Acero toyline ran for several years, first Kid Acero alone as a feature in an anthology comic book named \\"Estrellas del Deporte\\" (Sports Stars), which originally featured biographies of famous sport idols; then the Lobo Squadron was included, beginning to feature more standard superhero style stories, that ran for several issues; and lastly, each one of the trio received his own comic. Kid Acero's had a heavy bent to sci-fi action adventure, Invisible Man's was more comedic, and Bionic Man's tended to be mystery and horror inclined. Bionic Man's title was the shortest lived, Kid Acero lasted longer, but and the last to be cancelled was Invisible Man. *Kid Acero was the best selling toy for over 4 consecutive years in the Latin American Market. Kid Acero's origin Due to the popularity of several local boxing figures in Latin America's sport circuit, and the increasing reject of products considered representatives of the United States' interventionism in the region, Mattel left the marketing decisions to a Mexican licensing company named CIPSA which produced all kind of plastic products, including a large line of plastic containers similar as Tupperware's. This same company also has the local licenses for Hot Wheels and Disney. In 1974 CIPSA decided to change Big Jim's name for Kid Acero (which translates as Kid Steel), and under this name distributed and sell most of the Big Jim toy line. Most of the toys are exactly the same as in the American market. Only the text on the toy's boxes and the instruction's sheet was changed to Spanish language. Outside the box, there's no way to tell which figures are American and which ones are not, since both were produced in the same factories using the same molds, colors, materials and artwork for the packages. Even Mattel's serial numbers and copyrights were preserved in the molds. This figures were sold mostly across Latin America, but also along the United States South border. Many Big Jim vintage action figures located today in California or Texas may be Kid Acero figures. The first Kid Acero was the basic Big Jim standard figure from 1974 which came with red shorts and a dumbbell. The initial series of Kid Acero was composed entirely of different versions of Kid Acero in sport, adventure, and jungle outfits, which belongs to the '72 and 73' Big Jim action figures. The second series introduced a villain named Doctor Drago (known as Dr. Steel in US) as enemy and the exact opposite of Kid Acero. No major changes were done in the toys for a couple of years, and with only few exceptions, the entire line of Big Jim toys were reshipped as Kid Acero's. Among the most notorious exceptions, none other of Big Jim's enemies and friends but Doctor Steel and Double Trouble Zorak were sold in Latin America. Garfio and Nocton were two completely new characters created exclusively for the Mexican market not available anywhere else. Garfio is hard to find even today, especially complete with all his accessories. Two more villains were added later, but as James Bond enemies, not related to Kid Acero's storyline. The trained eagle included in the American Karzak figure was also added as Kid Acero's companion. This version of Kid was a complete reissue of Karzak with all its original accessories included, but with a Jim's head instead of Karzak's, and the name was changed to \\"Karnak\\". The eagle and its training glove were packaged with other adventure figures of Kid Acero later in the series. Karnak and his eagle were featured in one issue of the \\"Estrellas del Deporte\\" comic, helping Kid Acero return from a jungle after his plane crashes. LOBO Squadron VS COBRA Organization COBRA Organization logo From left to right: Invisible Man, Kid Acero, Bionic Man In 1979, CIPSA created a Kid Acero sub line named LOBO Squadron, which was originally inspired by Big Jim's P.A.C.K. The same wolf logo used on P.A.C.K. toys was adopted as the team's image. The LOBO Squadron was composed of three heroes, who joined forces to fight against an increasing army of evil characters who are known solely as COBRA, whose leader is no other than Kid Acero's long time adversary, Doctor Drago. The LOBO Squadron line was mostly composed of retooled toys and repaints. CIPSA took the decision to substitute the right arm of Kid Acero for the one used in the American Torpedo Fist, -a Big Jim's know action figure-, and renamed the toy as Kid Acero Brazo-Bala (Bullet-Arm). For the next 4 years, Bullet-Arm was the most wanted action figure in the Latin American market. Several other versions of Kid Acero were released along the years in the normal line, but none sold as much as the Bullet-Arm version. The real Torpedo Fist never was produced in Latin America. For some reason, instead of introducing other known Big Jim's villains or friends, CIPSA decided to create their own, but using parts of Big Jim toys. The LOBO Squad initial series introduced Garfio (The Hook), a weapons specialist armed with boomerangs and a bullwhip as associate of Doctor Drago, who has joined forces with Zorak, the Dual Menace. As a result of this new threat, Kid Acero recruits two popular superheroes named Invisible Man and Bionic Man. The LOBO Squadron plot presents all characters as skilled martial arts combatants, and for this reason, most of the figures of this sub line have minimal clothes, mostly black kung fu pants or sport pants. Some characters do not wear shoes at all. Garfio is in fact a tanned skin Torpedo Fist action figure with hook instead of left arm (but without the spring action as in the Big Jim's Pirate series). His hair was repainted black and was dressed with the same pants and boots as Kid Acero Bullet-Arm in black, but also came with The Whip's accessories and weapons. The original Whip action figure wasn't released in Mexico. Invisible Man was a clear crystal basic Big Jeff action figure with two removable heads. One head is the normal Big Jeff's with white hair, the other it is intended to be transparent, but looks more like white rubber. He came with a two pieces blue sport suit and gloves. When dressed, the normal head gives the impression he's a normal guy. When undressed, the transparent head and body gives the illusion he's invisible. Due to the high demand of Kenner's The Six Million Dollar Man action figure, CIPSA released his own version of the same TV character. Its creation was solely a local decision made after the real Six Million Dollar Man action figure, aka \\"El Hombre Nuclear\\" in Spanish, and made by Lili Ledy toy company in Mexico, was retired from the Latin American market due to licensing problems in an effort to capitalize the character's current popularity. On its initial run, Bionic Man was a stand-alone action figure with no relation at all with any other CIPSA lines of toys. One year later, a sticker was added in the front of the box with the line \\"a Kid Acero's friend!\\". Next year the box was retouched to present him as official part of LOBO. Bionic Man is a Big Jeff basic figure, but dressed in a silver jumper. He has a bionic arm, but instead of the Kung-Fu Grip which was one of the main characteristics of the Six Million Dollar Man action figures, Bionic Man had magnets on his right hand and in several accessories which represents heavy containers and pipe tubes. Using the magnets, Bionic Man carries or pushes away extremely heavy bulks. This action figure does not have a bionic eye with zoom-in features, but in the comic he has it. His most notorious characteristic is it has a translucent right arm, so you can see his internal metallic bones surrounded by cables and circuits. Several Big Jim figures who shared the same changing face feature were sold as different versions of Zorak, the Dual Menace, including the original Double Trouble and Captain Drake. In 1980, a last villain was introduced in the series. This time was an alien named Nocton, Master of Darkness (sometimes he is called Noc-Tar in the comic). This one originally was an unproduced Mattel's Space: 1999 model named \\"Zython\\". By its second season, Space 1999 suffered a drastic drop in popularity and Zhyton was dropped before being released in the American Market. He was briefly released on Europe though. It is not clear why he was added to COBRA Organization instead of other CIPSA's space related toys. His face resembles an Egyptian pharaoh more than an alien creature. He has light green skin and huge ears. Some Nocton figures had light up features, other figures glows in the dark, and at least one of them had a flying saucer, which looks more like a huge lifesaver which attaches to his hips. Collectors must keep in mind that despite the fact both figures looks almost identical at first sight, Nocton is two inches smaller than Zython. His size was reduced to match the size of all other Big Jim's action figures. All Vehicles used by LOBO Squadron are black, while all COBRA Organization's are Silver. Most of the Big Jim's originally black colored vehicles were added to the LOBO toys line. The 1979 Big Jim's Lazer-vette is probably the most notorious one. Its package was retouched to substitute Torpedo and Jim from the box' front for Kid Acero and Invisible Man, and the toy was renamed LOBO-mobile. The Devil Dune Buggy was repainted silver and released as Cobra-mobile. The Kid Acero Series was gradually retired from the Latin American market and eventually substituted by the James Bond Series. The James Bond series At some point in late 1970s, Mattel started to make presence on its own in the Latin American market instead of licensing its products, and for this reason, many licenses were canceled or reassigned. It is not clear what happened to CIPSA, but the company disappeared short after this decision was made. Most accepted version indicates it was acquired by Mattel. By 1980, Mattel took the decision to relaunch Big Jim as its own line of action figures for the region. This time, all Big Jim's Adventure, Space and Spy series were collected in a James Bond themed series. Same as with Kid Acero, Mattel simply changed the text on the toy's boxes to Spanish and sell the toys under the \\"James Bond, Agent 007\\" name instead of Big Jim. All other characteristics remained the same. Most toys included in the James Bond line were shipped exactly the same as they were on United States. Out of the box, there's no way to tell which ones are or not American since all toys were produced at the same factories. Same as it happened with LOBO, Mattel focused the entire line in a specific Big Jim model. This time was the '79 Big Jim Secret Agent which came with four exchangeable faces who was renamed \\"James Bond\\". Some time later other Spy and Space Big Jim action figures were renamed Bond too. The main villains of this series were Professor O.B.B. and Boris. This last one was renamed Boris Craneo de Acero (Boris SteelSkull). The professor is supposed to be the leader of SPECTRE, while Boris is KGB's prime director. The James Bond series lasted up to 1986, when it was officially retired from the market. = CIPSA Hot Wheels= A small handful of Hot Wheels have been found with unusual colors along with the Mattel \\"meatball\\" replaced with the CIPSA logo.

The young women were typically from poor families, and sold at a young age, under the condition that they be freed through marriage when older.Yung, Unbound Voices, 129. These arrangements were generally looked upon as charitable and a form of adoption, as the young women would be provided for better as Mui Tsai than they would if they remained with their family. According to some scholars, many of these girls ended up as either concubines or prostitutes, while others write that their status was higher than a concubine's. The traditional Chinese family needs a male offspring. Poor parents, who were not able to support many children, have sometimes killed newborn infants when they were female. In consideration of the grinding poverty it was an accepted alternative to sell unwanted girls. The absence of contracts in these arrangements meant though that Mui Tsai might be resold into prostitution.Yung, Unbound Feet, 38. The practice was also prevalent before World War II in Hong Kong, Singapore and parts of Southeast Asia. Macau In the 16th century it was a common practice in Macau, that poor families sold daughters as domestic servants for 40 years. As the Portuguese settled in Macau they began to establish brothels with Mui Tsais, but the Mandarins intervened. Hong Kong During the middle of the 19th century the British Slavery Abolition Act and the Slave Trade Act were enacted. The Hong Kong government did not impose any restriction on the transfer of girls as Mui Tsais before 1923, because this was treated as a family matter or traditional custom. Kathleen Simon, Viscountess Simon, fought for several decades to free the remaining Mui Tsai. In 1922 after press campaigns in Britain, Winston Churchill, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, pledged that the Mui Tsai system in Hong Kong would be abolished within one year. Under pressure from the British Parliament, the Hong Kong Legislative Council enacted the Female Domestic Service Bill the next year. Further importations and transfers of Mui Tsais were prohibited. The demand for registration of all Mui Tsais, however, was postponed. The new law was never seriously observed. In 1926, Britain became one of the signatories to the International Slavery Convention under the League of Nations. The Mui Tsai issue soon came under international scrutiny. Facing strong political pressure, the Hong Kong government enacted the Female Domestic Service Ordinance in 1923. All Mui Tsais had to be registered prior to 31 May 1930. Afterwards no registration and thus no sale was allowed. Inspectors were appointed to pay visits to the Mui Tsais to ensure that they were not ill-treated and had had their wages paid.Hong Kong Med J Vol. 12., pp. 464-465 The latest case was reported in 2005. Chinese parents received a financial relief for their daughter who was transferred to Hong Kong. She worked incessantly from dawn to dusk. After physical tortures she was admitted to the hospital.Hong Kong Med J Vol. 12., pp. 463-464 United States In the 19th century a large number of Chinese workers immigrated to the United States. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 prevented Chinese men of the working class from sending for wives from China nor did the law permit them to marry non-Chinese wives. Now many Chinese girls and young women immigrated with false papers showing them to be the wives or daughters of the privileged class. Most of them arrived at Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. The girls were sold for household servants. As they got older, they were frequently sold into prostitution. Mui Tsais became a target for Protestant reformers in San Francisco. The Presbyterian Mission House in San Franciscos Chinatown rescued Chinese girls and women from abusive circumstances. Despite the work of reformers in the United States, the Mui Tsai system continued into the early 20th century.

Sir John Sherbrooke led a British force from Halifax, Nova Scotia to establish New Ireland, which lasted until the end of the war, eight months later. The brief life of the colony yielded customs revenues which were subsequently used to finance a military library in Halifax and found Dalhousie College.http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id;_nbr=3132 The subsequent retirement of the British expeditionary force from its base in Castine to Nova Scotia ensured that eastern Maine would remain a part of the United States. Lingering local feelings of vulnerability, however, would help fuel the post-war movement for statehood for Maine. The withdrawal of the British after the ratification of the Treaty of Ghent represented the end of two centuries of violent contest over Maine by rival nations (initially the French and British, and then the British and Americans). Prelude: Capture of Castine On August 26, 1814, a British squadron from the Royal Navy base at Halifax moved to capture the Down East coastal town of Machias. The force consisted of five warships: HMS Dragon (74), HMS Endymion (40), (38), (18), a large tender, and ten transports carrying some 3,000 British regulars (elements of the 29th, 60th, 62nd, and 98th regiments and a company of Royal Artillery).James H. Ellis, \\"A Ruinous and Unhappy War: New England and the War of 1812\\" (2009), p. 193 The British expedition to Maine was commanded by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Major General John Sherbrooke. The expedition was under the overall command of Sir John Sherbrooke, who was then the lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia. Major General Gerard Gosselin commanded the army and Rear Admiral Edward Griffith Colpoys controlled the naval elements.Tom Seymour, Tom Seymour's Maine: A Maine Anthology (2003), pp. 10-17. The intention of the expedition was clearly to re-establish British title to Maine east of the Penobscot River, an area the British had renamed \\"New Ireland\\", and open the line of communications between Halifax and Quebec. Carving off \\"New Ireland\\" from New England had been a goal of the British government and the colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (\\"New Scotland\\") since British Brigadier General Francis McLean conquered Maine during the American Revolution.Seymour, p. 10. En route, the squadron fell in with (18), and learned that the USS Adams (28), commanded by Captain Charles Morris, was undergoing repairs at Hampden, on the Penobscot River. Sherbrooke changed his plan and headed for Castine at the mouth of the Penobscot. He rendezvoused off Matinicus Island and added (74), (38), (18), and the schooner (18) and HM Schooner (14) to his force. The complete force entered the cove at Castine on September 1. The local militia melted away at the sight and a 28-man contingent from the U.S. Army under Lieutenant Andrew Lewis of the 40th U.S. Infantry spiked their four 24-pounders, blew up their magazine and withdrew to the north trailing a pair of field pieces.Ellis, pp. 193-194. As the first order of business, Sherbrooke and Griffith issued a proclamation assuring the populace if they remained quiet, pursued their usual affairs and surrendered all weaponry, they would be protected as British subjects. Moreover, the British would pay fair prices for all goods and services provided. Next, Gosselin crossed the bay with most of the 29th to occupy Belfast and protect the left flank of the major operation to follow. Locals did not challenge the occupation, although some 1,200 militiamen gathered three miles outside Belfast to await developments.Ellis, pp. 194-195 Expedition up the Penobscot River Griffith assigned RN Captain Robert Barrie the task of going after the Adams. Barrie proceeded up the Penobscot with the Dragon, Sylph, Peruvian, the transport Harmony and a prize-tender. The ships carried an armed contingent of some 750 men drawn from the four participating regiments, the artillery company, and some Royal Marines. During the war, Barrie was one of the few British officers in America to acquire a loathsome reputation, which he was about to reinforce.Ellis, p. 197 Battle of Hampden Captain Charles Morris (pictured c. 1850) commanded the USS Adams during the battle. When Morris entered the river late in August he moved past Buckstown (now Bucksport, Maine) and anchored at the mouth of the Souadabscook Stream in Hampden on the west bank of the Penobscot some 30 miles inland. Anticipating an attack, he placed nine of the ship's guns in battery on a nearby hill and fourteen on the wharf next to his crippled ship. Morris, commanding a crew of 150, called for help from Brigadier General John Blake, commander of the Eastern Militia at Brewer. Blake responded with some 550 militiamen and formed the center of a defensive line running along a ridge facing south, or towards Castine.Ellis, pp. 196-198 Lieutenant Lewis showed up with his two dozen or so regulars and two field pieces. Adding a carronade, he went in line to the right or west and commanded the north-south road, the expected route of British attackers.Seymour, p. 10; Chapman Late on September 2, Barrie landed his force at Bald Head Cove three miles below Hampden and waited for morning. Early on September 3, in rain and fog, the British moved on Hampden, led by Lt. Colonel Henry John. Skirmishers met with resistance at Pitcher's Brook, primarily from the guns directed by Lewis, but John sent reinforcements and the British stormed across the bridge. In short order, the full force was in position to continue against the American defensive line on the hill. The sight of the oncoming disciplined Redcoats, bayonets glistening, rattled the untrained militia. The center broke and fled to the woods toward Bangor. Morris on the left and Lewis on the right found themselves in untenable positions. About to be overrun, Morris spiked his guns and ignited a train leading to the Adams. With colors flying, the ship blew up before the British could intervene. Lewis likewise spiked his guns and withdrew to the north. Morris and his navy band made it to Bangor, crossed west through rugged country to the Kennebec River, and around September 9 arrived at their base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. After two weeks, every sailor reported, not a man missing, a source of great satisfaction for Morris.Ellis, pp. 198-200; Williamson, p. 645 At this point, Barrie detailed 200 men to take control of Hampden while he and the balance of his force pursued the Americans in the direction of Bangor. Eighty prominent men of the Hampden area spent a night as prisoners. Most were paroled the next day. Sacking of Bangor and Hampden Captain Robert Barrie was a Royal Navy known for his rough treatment during the British occupation of Bangor and Hampden. His actions help foster anti-British sentiments in Eastern Maine in the years following the war. Supported by three of his ships, Barrie entered an intimidated Bangor at midday and called for unconditional submission.Ellis, p. 200 Provisions and quarters were demanded and readily turned over \\"since the commodore, who was a churlish, brutish monster\\", according to a correspondent, \\"threatened to let loose his men and burn the town if the inhabitants did not use greater exertion to feed his men.\\"Trickey, Katherine W. \\"Historical Sketches of the Town of Hampden, Maine,\\" Ellsworth, ME: Ellsworth American, (1976), p. 22 Although Barrie ordered a ban on liquor for his troops, some men managed to acquire brandy by the bucket. Accordingly, Barrie ordered an officer to destroy all liquor in the town. This set off a wave of plundering. Six stores fell to the mob and $6,000 worth of property was damaged. Many citizens fled to the woods.Ellis, p. 201 \\"We are alive this morning,\\" wrote a newspaper correspondent, \\"but such scenes I hope not to witness again. The enemy's Soldiery ... have emptied all the stores and many dwelling houses - they break windows, and crockery, and destroy every-thing they cannot move.\\"\\"Boston Gazette\\", September 15, 1814 During the night, the British burned 14 vessels across the river in Brewer. Before the raiders could ignite Bangor vessels, the town's selectmen made a deal. Fearful that the burning would lead to a conflagration, the selectmen offered Barrie a $30,000 bond and agreed to complete four ships on the stocks and deliver them to him in Castine. Barrie accepted the arrangement and carried away a packet, four schooners and a boat. Before moving back down the river on the 4th, Barrie and John paroled 191 locals considered prisoners, including General Blake. Bangor selectmen estimated that the losses and damages totalled $45,000.Ellis, p.202 The Bangor diversion did not end the difficulties for Hampden. Barrie decided to spend more time in the town. Redcoats terrorized the village, killing livestock for sport and destroying whatever met their fancy, including gardens, furniture, books and papers. Two vessels moored off the town were burned.Ellis, p. 203 The rampage prompted a town committee to appeal to Barrie to treat the place with a little humanity. His shocking reply summarized his approach. \\"Humanity! I have none for you. My business is to burn, sink, and destroy. Your town is taken by storm. By the rules of war we ought to lay your village in ashes, and put its inhabitants to the sword. But I will spare your lives, though I mean to burn your houses.\\"Abbott, John S.C. and Edward H. Elwell. \\"The History of Maine.\\" Portland, Brown Thurston, 1892, p.422. Barrie did not follow through on his threat to burn houses, but he did secure a $14,000 bond on several incomplete vessels on the stocks in town. The terms required the completed vessels be delivered to the Royal Navy in Castine by November 1. In the end, the town estimated the value of its losses to total $44,000. The British then slipped down to Frankfort and demanded considerable livestock and surrender of all arms and ammunition at that place. The locals were slow to comply and before he moved along on the 7th, Barrie promised to return and make the town pay for its delays. The captain did not make good on this threat, and except for some nuisance sniping at the British as they passed Prospect, the Battle of Hampden was at an end.Ellis, pp. 203-204 Casualties The British Army loss in the battle was 1 enlisted man killed, 1 officer and 7 enlisted men wounded and 1 enlisted man missing.Wood, p. 319 Four of the casualties were from the 29th Regiment, two from the 62nd Regiment and 4 from the 98th Regiment. The Royal Navy reported 1 sailor from HMS Dragon killed.Wood, p. 325 Two British graves in Hampden remain there today, but no details are carved on the stones. These could be the soldier and sailor killed that day. American casualties were low, but sources are conflicting. Williamson gives 1 militiaman killed and 11 wounded, with at least two civilians killed by accident.Williamson, pp. 641-657 Including the wounded, 84 Americans were taken prisoner.Stanley, p. 375 Williamson's data may reflect only the losses to the Hampden militia companies. Captain Barrie could form no estimate, but noted upwards of 30 laying wounded in the woods. Lt. Col. John states he had no correct number, but reported 30 to 40 killed, wounded or missing. Militia leaders could not confirm how many men actually reported for duty. A list for pay purposes was finally produced but is missing entire companies and states no casualties except for one \\"Tobias Oakman - killed\\" (the basis for the \\"1 killed\\" that Williamson repeated). Claims by citizens for various compensations were filed for numerous years after the battle without a final tally or surviving documentation. British evacuation of Castine After the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, the peace treaty which ended the War of 1812, British forces evacuated Castine. Sherbrooke declared \\"New Ireland\\" (Eastern Maine) a province of British North America (Canada) and left General Gosselin in Castine to govern it. For the next 8 months (from the fall of 1814 to the spring of 1815), the Penobscot River was essentially an international boundary. That Hampden and Bangor were on the wrong (American) side might have contributed to their rough treatment.Williamson, p. 650 With the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in December 1814, however, the British claim to Maine was effectively surrendered. The British evacuated Castine on April 25, 1815, and the pre-war boundary was restored. The final boundary between the inland, wooded portion of Maine and Canada would remain open to dispute until the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842. Aftermath Local memory of this humiliation contributed to subsequent anti-British feeling in Eastern Maine, which would find outlet again in the Aroostook War of 1838-1839. It would also contribute to the postwar movement for Maine's statehood since Massachusetts had failed to protect the region and to the building of a large, expensive granite fort (Fort Knox) at the mouth of the Penobscot River starting in the 1840s. General Blake and two other officers (Lt. Col. Andrew Grant of Hampden and Maj. Joshua Chamberlain of Brewer, grandfather of the later Civil War general) were court-martialed in Bangor in 1816 for their part in the defeat. Blake and Chamberlain were both exonerated, but Grant was cashiered.Williamson. p. 649 The elderly Blake was court-martialled first and cleared of charges. He then brought charges against his two subordinates, perhaps in a move to clear his name. Grant was found guilty of actions unbecoming an officer before the enemy and banned from being re-elected as a militia officer. One report claims that he ran from battle and changed out of his uniform into civilian clothes before he was eventually captured and identified. NotesReferences *Ellis, James H.

United States, 552 U.S. 38 (2007), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the federal appeals courts may not presume that a sentence falling outside the range recommended by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines is unreasonable. Applying this rule to the case at hand, it upheld a sentence of 36 months' probation imposed on a man who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute ecstasy in the face of a recommended sentence of 30 to 37 months in prison. Facts Brian Gall was a sophomore at the University of Iowa when he befriended Luke Rinderknecht, who got Gall into selling ecstasy. Over the course of seven months, Gall made over $30,000 selling the drug. Then he stopped using ecstasy, graduated from college, moved to Arizona, got a job in the construction industry, and then became a master carpenter in Colorado. He had not used any illegal drugs since graduating from college. While Gall was living in Arizona, federal agents approached him as part of an investigation into the drug conspiracy. He admitted participating in it for a brief time, and the agents moved on with their investigation. A year and a half after the agents approached Gall, Gall was indicted as part of an ongoing drug distributing ring that lasted from 1996 until 2002. By this time, Gall had been away from the drug ring for over three years. When the indictment came down, Gall returned to Iowa, surrendered to authorities, and was released on his own recognizance pending trial. While awaiting trial, Gall began his own contracting business, making profits of $2,000 per month in his first year. Gall was represented by attorney Marc Milavitz from Boulder, Colorado. Gall struck a plea bargain with the Government, stipulating that he was responsible for the equivalent under the federal sentencing guidelines of 87.5 kilograms of marijuana. (This was relevant for sentencing purposes.) The Government acknowledged that Gall had withdrawn from the conspiracy in September 2000. The probation office also concluded (again, for sentencing purposes) that Gall was never an organizer or leader in the conspiracy, that his offense did not involve the use of weapons, and that he had no significant criminal history. The probation officer's report also pointed out that Gall had always been candid with the Government, but that his information was not useful to the investigators. Ultimately the probation officer recommended a sentence of 30 to 37 months. At the sentencing hearing, several witnesses testified to Gall's good character. The defense reminded the court that two of Gall's accused codefendants had been sentenced to 30 and 35 months, respectively, and neither of them had voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy as Gall had. Although the Government's attorney urged the court to impose a sentence within the range recommended by the probation office, U.S. District Judge Robert W. Pratt ultimately imposed a sentence of 36 months' probation, explaining that it had considered the purposes of punishment and how a probation-only sentence would further those goals. The Government then appealed the sentence. The Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the sentence. As circuit precedent required at the time, the court noted that the district court had not justified the sentence adequately in light of the proportional variation from the bottom end of the Guidelines range. Because Gall's probation-only sentence was, in effect, a 100% downward variation from the Guidelines range, the court reasoned, it had to be justified by extraordinary circumstances, circumstances that were not present in Gall's case. After Claiborne v. the United States terminated with the unexpected premature death of the defendant, in that case, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Gall's case in order to clarify how the lower federal courts should handle sentences falling outside the Guidelines range. Majority opinion After United States v. Booker, , the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are merely one of seven factors federal district courts must look to when imposing sentences, and federal appellate courts must review those sentences for \\"reasonableness.\\" \\"Our explanation of 'reasonableness' review in the Booker opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.\\" At the same time, while the Guidelines are one factor among many, they remain the product of empirical study of thousands of sentencing decisions over a quarter of a century. Accordingly, while sentences that fall farther outside the Guidelines range must be justified with appropriate reference to the other factors, no \\"rigid mathematical formula\\" can dictate the precise extent of that justification. Such a formula smacks of a presumption of unreasonableness for sentences imposed outside the Guidelines range, an approach the Court rejects and that the Government had conceded was inconsistent with Booker. With respect to the sentence the district court had imposed on Gall, it is of course true that custodial sentences are qualitatively more harsh than noncustodial ones, even taking into account the restrictions on freedom that any program of probation will entail. Yet the Court concluded that it was nearly unworkable to arrive at \\"some ascertainable method of assigning percentages to various justifications\\" district courts might proffer for various sentences. More importantly, however, was that the proportionality review the Eighth Circuit had employed effectively imposed a greater standard of review on some sentences than on others. Such an approach is inconsistent with an abuse-of- discretion standard of review that the Court in Booker and again in Rita v. United States had held should apply. Turning to the particular facts of this case, the Court commented that the district judge had committed no significant procedural error. He correctly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the statutory factors, and \\"thoroughly documented his reasoning.\\" In particular, the judge did not ignore the seriousness of the offense. To be sure, he did not specifically recite the adverse health effects that ecstasy presents. Yet the prosecutor did not urge those adverse health consequences as a basis for imposing the sentence it felt was reasonable. \\"It was not incumbent upon the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative.\\" Moreover, the probation-only sentence in this case promotes respect for the law. Seven of the eight defendants in the case received prison terms. Gall did not because, as the district judge explained, \\"a sentence of imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if the law is viewed merely as a means to dispense harsh punishment without taking into account the real conduct and circumstances in sentencing.\\" Finally, Gall understandably received a more lenient sentence because he withdrew from the conspiracy while the other defendants did not. The Court also held that the sentence was substantively reasonable. Virtually no conspiracy defendants voluntarily withdraw; Gall did, and did so years before he even knew he was the target of a federal investigation. In the Court's eyes, this was a sign of genuine rehabilitation. \\"Compared to a case where the offender's rehabilitation occurred after he was charged with a crime, the District Court here had greater justification for believing Gall's turnaround was genuine, as distinct from a transparent attempt to build a mitigation case.\\" The Eighth Circuit had faulted the district court for taking into account Gall's youth at the time of the crime; the Supreme Court noted that such a consideration was permissible as part of the \\"history and characteristics of the defendant.\\" The Government had never contended that a probation-only sentence was inappropriate in a case such as Gall's; in fact, it had conceded that such a sentence might sometimes be appropriate. These differing policy choices were incompatible with an abuse-of-discretion review; hence, the Eighth Circuit's decision could not stand. Concurring opinions Justice Antonin Scalia reiterated his view that substantive reasonableness review was incompatible with the Sixth Amendment, but concurred out of concerns for stare decisis. Justice David Souter urged Congress to \\"reestablish[] a system of mandatory sentencing guidelines, but provid[e] for jury findings of all facts necessary to set the upper range of sentencing discretion.\\" Dissenting opinions Justice Clarence Thomas dissented for the same reason he did in Kimbrough v. United States. Justice Samuel Alito dissented because he believed that district courts should be permitted to give \\"some significant weight\\" to the Guidelines \\"in making a sentencing decision.\\" This belief flowed from his reading of United States v. Booker--a decision he did not participate in writing because it was issued before he joined the Court--because to fail to do so would ignore Congress's directive to not only \\"consult\\" the Guidelines but to \\"take [them] into account.\\" Appellate courts, in turn, must be able to police compliance with this directive by forcing district courts to reevaluate sentences that stray too far from the Guidelines range. \\"It is unrealistic to think that this goal can be achieved over the long term if sentencing judges need only give lip service to the Guidelines.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 552 External links * * Petitioner's merits brief * Petitioner's reply brief * Links to defense-side briefs, fd.org Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:2007 in United States case law Category:United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court ","title":"Gall v.

Cullman Center, at 40 Lincoln Center Plaza, is located in Manhattan, New York City, at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on the Upper West Side, between the Metropolitan Opera House and the Vivian Beaumont Theater. It houses one of the world's largest collections of materials relating to the performing arts.New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center, accessed September 4, 2011. It is one of the four research centers of the New York Public Library's Research library system, and it is also one of the branch libraries.  History  Founding and original configuration = Al Hirschfeld's desk and chair in the library's lobby Originally the collections that formed The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (LPA) were housed in two buildings. The Research collections on Dance, Music, and Theatre were located at the New York Public Library Main Branch, now named the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, and the circulating music collection was located in the 58th Street Library. A separate center to house performing arts was first proposed by Carleton Sprague Smith (chief of the Music Division) in a 1932 report to the library administration, \\"A Worthy Music Center for New York.\\"Beck, p. 20ff. (At the time, dance materials and sound recordings were all part of the Music Division.) There were attempts to create partnerships with Rockefeller Center (under construction at the time), the Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (to which New York University wanted to join as a partner). During the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Music Division produced a program of concerts (based on the model of the Library of Congress concerts in Coolidge Auditorium). These concerts were often held in conjunction with the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Juilliard School, and the program grew to include Lectures from New York University staff. After Lincoln Center was incorporated in 1956, an early mention of a possible \\"library and museum of the performing arts\\" appeared in June 1957.Howard Taubman, \\"Civic Pride: City Officials Should Work for Lincoln Center as a Municipal Necessity,\\" New York Times (June 2, 1957), p. 121. It was envisioned that a library-museum would serve to \\"interpret and illuminate the entire range of the performing arts.\\"Beck, p. 38. By December of that year, the library had become an accepted component of Lincoln Center planning and fundraising.\\"Committee Set Up To Seek Arts Fund,\\" New York Times (December 2, 1957), p. 29. Recalling his earlier reports, Smith produced a new report arguing for a move to Lincoln Center. Library administration officially approved of the move in June 1959.Beck, p. 39. The building housing the library's research collections and the Vivian Beaumont Theater was the third building to be opened at Lincoln Center.Milton Esterow, \\"Beaumont Theater Opens at Lincoln Center,\\" New York Times (October 13, 1965), p. 1. Original plans conceived the library as a separate building, but prohibitive costs necessitated a combination of the Library and the Theater. As built, the Theater forms the central core of the building, the 1st and 2nd floors occupying the southern and western sides, and the 3rd floor research collections providing a roof. Noted modernist architect Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) designed the interiors, and SOM consulted with Eero Saarinen and Associates (architect for the Vivian Beaumont Theater) on the exteriors.Allen Hughes, \\"Library and Museum 01 the Arts At Lincoln Center Ready Soon,\\" New York Times (October 21, 1965), p. 57. The Claire Tow Theater (belonging to Lincoln Center Theater) was built on the roof of the Library and opened in June 2012. The third floor, housing the research collections, opened to the public on July 19. The entire library was opened to the public on November 30, 1965, the 4th building to open at Lincoln Center.\\"Library-Museum of the Arts Opens at Lincoln Center,\\" New York Times (December 1, 1965), p. 55. At its opening, it was called \\"Library and Museum of the Performing Arts.\\" The Library's museum component was named the Shelby Collum Davis Museum in honor of an investment banker who contributed $1 million to Lincoln Center for museum purposes. At its opening, the Library's main lobby at the Lincoln Center Plaza entrance housed a bookstore, a film viewing area, and a listening area. The second floor included a children's performing arts collection as well as the Hecksher Oval, an enclosed space that could accommodate story-telling. Prior to the 2001 renovation, the children's collection was relocated to the Riverside Branch. The Hecksher Oval was removed as part of the renovation. The Shelby Collum Davis Museum spaces included small and separate areas in the Dance, Music, Sound archive and Theater research divisions. Bigger galleries were the Vincent Astor Gallery on the 2nd floor, and galleries on the lower level and 2nd floor. = 2001 renovation = One of the Mapleson Cylinders, among the sound archive's most treasured items From 1998 through 2001, the building was closed due to a $38 million renovation project designed by Polshek Partnership. (The renovation was unrelated to the Lincoln Center renovations which commenced shortly after 2001.) During this time, the research collections were serviced from the NYPL's Annex (at 10th avenue and 43rd street), and the circulating collections were housed at the Mid-Manhattan Library at 40th Street and Fifth Avenue. LPA reopened to the public on October 29, 2001 with its building newly named Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center after a gift from the Cullmans (Dorothy was a trustee until she died; Lewis is still a trustee).Mel Gussow, \\"Curtain Going Up at the Performing Arts Library,\\" New York Times (October 11, 2001), p. E1. During the renovation, the library was wired to enable installation of numerous computers on each floor. There are nearly 200 publicly accessible computers in the building.Personal communication from IT staff, May 12, 2011. Most are restricted to use of the library catalog and electronic databases or viewing the library's audiovisual material, but a few provide full Internet access. The renovation also created a Technology Training Room, with twelve desktop computers for users and one for a teacher, as well as a projection screen. Upon the building's original opening in 1965, each research division had a separate reading room. The renovation removed these and consolidated public areas into a single unified public reading area, with separate rooms for the Theater on Film and Tape Archive (its screening room named for Lucille Lortel) and Special Collections (its room named for Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic). Subsequently the Special Collections reading room was moved into a portion of the main reading area of the 3rd floor, while a screening room for films held by the Jerome Robbins Dance Division and the Reserve Film and Video Collection (originally part of the Donnell Media Center, but absorbed into the Collection in 2008) took its place. Meanwhile, gallery space for the museum was consolidated into two main gallery spaces with smaller areas for display of other items. The Donald and Mary Oenslager Gallery is located on the first floor, adjacent to the Lincoln Plaza entrance, while the Vincent Astor Gallery (formerly on the second floor) is now located on the lower level, adjacent to the Amsterdam Avenue entrance. A small area near the Lincoln Center Plaza entrance houses caricaturist Al Hirschfield's desk and chair. The main corridors on the first and second floors are used for smaller exhibitions. The third floor has numerous display cases highlighting rotating displays of thematic groupings of artifacts from the collections. The renovation was not without detractors. Critic Joseph Horowitz criticized the third floor in particular. Where previously each division had its own reading room, the renovation united all public reading areas into one room, resulting in less intimacy and more noise.Joseph Horowitz, \\"Quiet, Please. This Is a Library After All.\\" New York Times (January 27, 2002), p. A31. Edmund Morris characterized the Special Collections reading room as \\"a charmless space...[which] exudes a dispirited air of neglect.\\"Edmund Morris, \\"Sacking a Palace of Culture\\" New York Times (April 21, 2012), p. SR7.  Research collections  From its inception, LPA has had both a research component (funded mostly with private money) and a branch library component (funded with significant money from New York City, the remainder coming from private contributions). = Materials and formats = File cabinets contain over a million clippings at LPA Hundreds of hours of rehearsal recordings feature Arturo Toscanini In addition to published works (for example, books, periodicals, and scores), the research divisions collect an enormous amount of unique material: Archival material (material that was created by or that once belonged to an individual or organization), text manuscripts, music manuscripts, dance notation scores, typescripts, prompt books, posters, original set and costume designs, programs, and other ephemera are just some of the major categories of materials. The library's collection of sound recordings is in all formats that in themselves trace the history and development of sound recording. The library has 500,000 folders containing clippings on a variety of people and subjects pertaining to the performing arts. These clippings can sometimes provide a beginning to those at the initial stage of their research. The library also collects a variety of iconography in various forms: photographs, lithographs, engravings, drawings, and others. A recent internal report estimated that LPA holds approximately 4.5 million photographs, including the recently acquired collection of New York photographer Martha Swope, itself holding 1 million photographs. Much of this non-book material was not initially in the online catalog.A 1995 brochure indicated that 80% of the materials at LPA were not in the online catalog. Some materials are accessible through in-house card files and indexes. Policy since changed to bring as much of the material as possible into the main catalog, and by 2013, most of it was accessible in the catalog. Because of the enormous volume of material, some classes of it, such as the clipping files, has never been inventoried, although it is arranged in a retrievable manner with an alphabetical or chronological arrangement. Unlike most U.S. public libraries, the research collections stacks are located in non-public areas and are not available for browsing. Patrons must determine what they want to view, fill out call slips, and submit the slips to library staff. Library staff then retrieves the material for the patron. The holdings of LPA are divided by subject into divisions, which contain a number of special centers. = Music Division = The Music Division, as a founding division of The New York Public Library, is the oldest of all the divisions at LPA. Its origins stem from the private library of banker Joseph William Drexel. Upon his death in 1888, his valuable library of 5,542 volumes and 766 pamphlets, known as the Drexel Collection, became part of the Lenox Library. The Astor Library also had an endowment that helped with the purchase of music. In 1895, upon the Lenox Library's consolidation with the Astor Library, the Music Division became one of the first subject divisions of The New York Public Library.Williams, p. 142.Much of the content of this section is derived from the thorough history of the Music Division through 1981 in a four-part article: Philip L. Miller, Frank C. Campbell, Otto Kinkeldey, \\"How the Music Division of the New York Public Library Grew-A Memoir,\\" Notes Vol. 35, No. 3 (March 1979), pp. 537‚Äì555 (parts 1‚Äì2), Vol. 36, No. 1 (September 1979), pp. 65‚Äì77 (part 3), Vol. 38, No. 1 (September 1981), pp. 14‚Äì41 (part 4). According to The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, the library has particular strong manuscript holdings in jazz, These include 400 of Benny Goodman's arrangements, and the arrangements made by Sy Oliver for musicians including Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, and Tommy Dorsey. It holds working scores of works by Ellington, and by Charles Mingus as well as extensive microlim copies of Mingus' manuscripts.\\"Libraries and archives.\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd ed.. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed March 28, 2013, . Classical music manuscript holding include manuscripts by Bach, Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt, Glinka, Handel, Haydn, Korngold, Mozart, Paganini, Schubert, and Schumann.Rita Benton. \\"Libraries.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed March 28, 2013, =Billy Rose Theatre Division= Theatre on Film and Tape room ‚Äì dedicated to donor Lucille Lortel The Library has been collecting theatrical materials for years prior to 1931, when the executors of David Belasco's estate offered the producer's holdings on the condition that a division be created. The Theatre Collection (as it was initially known) began on September 1, 1931. The division opened at Lincoln Center as the Theatre Collection. In 1979, it was renamed the Billy Rose Theatre Division, honoring a financial gift from the lyricist/producer's foundation. It is now the largest research division at the library, with holdings primarily on the theatre, and increasing on film, with some collections on the related subjects of vaudeville, magic, puppetry, and the circus. The Theater of Film and Tape Archive is administratively within the division. The Theatre division includes the Theatre on Film and Tape Archive (TOFT) which produces video recordings of New York and regional theater productions, and provides research access at its Lucille Lortel screening room. The collection is considered one of the most comprehensive collections of videotaped theater productions in the world.[\\"After the Final Curtain, Act II,\\" New York Times (June 9, 2013).] Archives modeled on TOFT include the Museum of Performance & Design in San Francisco, the Washington Area Performing Arts Video Archive established in Washington, D.C., and the National Video Archive of Performance in London. The core of the collection consists of live recordings of Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, with some additional productions from professional regional theaters. The Archive also records interviews and dialogues with notable theater professionals. In addition to live performances, commercial recordings of theater-related films, documentaries, and television programs are also included in the collection. Currently between 50 - 60 live recordings are produced each year, covering most important productions. As of fall of 2016, the collection included 7,901 titles.2016 Annual Report =Jerome Robbins Dance Division= The Jerome Robbins Dance Division began in 1944 under the auspices of Genevieve Oswald.Clive Barnes, \\"Dance: Collection Moves to New Home,\\" New York Times (January 4, 1966), p. 21. Originally dance materials were part of the Music Division (when it was known as the \\"Dance Collection\\"), but its growth necessitated hiring a full-time staff member in 1947.Williams, p. 151. Acquisitions were augmented by gifts of papers of Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, and Hanya Holm. With the gift of a collection of Walter Toscanini in honor of his deceased wife, Cia Fornaroli (a dancer), the Dance Collection became an internationally known repository. Due to its subsequent growth and increasing importance, the collection was formally recognized as a separate division on January 1, 1964.Philip L. Miller, \\"How the Music Division Grew-A Memoir,\\" Notes vol. 35, no. 3 (March 1979), p. 549. One of the division's most significant resources is the Jerome Robbins Archive of the Recorded Moving Image. Endowed with a gift from Jerome Robbins, this archive collects and preserves moving images of dance, making them available to researchers. The Archive has received many gifts from dancers and choreographers and contains many privately made films and video.Williams, p. 151, 154. The Division's oral history program began formally in 1965. These oral histories are particularly valuable since they provide information, history and context not generally available in published sources.Williams, p. 155. = Reserve Film and Video = Screening room for the Reserve Film and Video collection; moviola and Steenbeck equipment are on the right Though not technically a part of the Research divisions, the Reserve Film and Video Collection (formerly the Donnell Media Center) is serviced from the third floor. For film and video that must be viewed onsite, there is a screening room (large enough for classes) equipped with a 16 mm projector. There are also moviolas and Steenbeck equipment, permitting close frame-by- frame examination and analysis. =Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound= The origins of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound can be traced to a gift of 500 78 rpm records by Columbia Records in 1937 to the Music Division. Successive gifts by record companies and individuals led to the formal creation of a separate division with the opening of the building at Lincoln Center in 1965. It was named in honor of a generous gift from the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization.Williams, p. 149. Radio station WQXR donated 11,000 78 rpm recordings in 1966.\\"Lincoln Center Receives 11,000 Disks From WQXR,\\" New York Times (June 9, 1966), p. 53. Carleton Sprague Smith envisioned the purpose of the sound archive as \\"stimulating interest among recording and broadcasting executives, as well as other arts institutions that had potential for playing a cooperative role.\\"David Hall, \\"The Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound, The New York Public Library at Lincoln Center,\\" in: Libraries, History, Diplomacy, and the Performing Arts: Essays in Honor of Carleton Sprague Smith, Festschrift Series no. 9 (Stuyvesant, NY: Pendragon Press, 1991), p. 43 Resources include the Rigler-Deutsch Index, which lists of library's extensive holdings of 78 rpm records.  Branch (Circulating) Collections  A portion of the circulating DVDs Circulating CDs The beginnings of the circulating music collection are due in great part to its first head librarian, Dorothy Lawton.\\"Dorothy Lawton, Librarian, 85, Dies,\\" New York Times (February 21, 1960), p. 92. Lawton took part in the establishment of the music collection at the 58th Street Library in 1920, beginning with a collection of 1,000 books and scores. In 1924, the circulating music collection was officially established as part of the 58th Street Library.Circulating Music Collection, accessed September 5, 2011. Her passion for dance enabled her to get unusual publications, so much that dance critic John Martin complimented her on the growing collection of dance books.John Martin, \\"The Dance: A Treasury: Important New Volumes Added to Growing Collection at Library,\\" New York Times (October 4, 1931), p. 116. In 1929, the 58th Street Library began a collection of recordings beginning with gifts from Victor and Columbia records, amounting to 500 records. Upon building a listening booth, Lawton reported that by 1933, the listening booth was constantly booked two weeks in advance.Compton Pakenham, \\"Review of Newly Recorded Music,\\" New York Times (April 15, 1934), p. X6. During World War II, she established a concert series for servicemen on Sundays from 3‚Äì7 PM. Servicemen could request selections of their choice and could also participate in playing chamber music with instruments that had been loaned to the Library. She established the Orchestra Collection, a set of scores and parts that could be loaned to groups for performance. Currently, the Orchestra Collection loans parts to over 2,000 works.website, accessed September 9, 2011. Upon Lawton's retirement in 1945, chief music critic of the New York Times Olin Downes complimented her on the development of the 58th Street Library, and remarked on her achievements such as attracting donors and enlisting the concern and help of professional musicians.Olin Downes, \\"Librarian Retires: A Tribute to Dorothy Lawton-Her Contribution to Our Musical Life,\\" New York Times (July 8, 1945), p. 18. (Many of the rare items that were gifts to the 58th Street Branch were subsequently moved to the Music Division.) After retiring, Lawton returned to the country of her birth, England, and help organize a newly created music collection at Central Music Library of the Buckingham Palace Road Library (today the Westminster Music Library), modeling the new library on the one she established at 58th Street.Olin Downes, \\"London Library: Music Institution Formed Along Lines of 58th Street Branch Here,\\" New York Times (August 10, 1947), p. X6.\\"London Library,\\" New York Times (November 14, 1948), p. X7. Currently, the Circulating collections loan books on music, dance, theater, film, and arts administration. They also loan scores, scripts, CDs, videotapes, DVDs, and sets of orchestral parts. Shelby Collum Davis Museum A display wall of the Shelby Collum Davis Museum The museum component of LPA takes the form of exhibitions in its two main exhibition spaces, The Donald and Mary Oenslager Gallery and the Vincent Astor Gallery, as well as a walled area in the plaza entrance, and additionally display cases distributed throughout the building. Among the purposes of the exhibitions is to show to all visitors that the millions of items belonging to the library are not for the exclusive use of scholars but for anyone who walks in the door.Eleanor Blau, \\"Performing Arts Library Celebrates,\\" New York Times (May 29, 1991), p. C14. Exhibitions highlights items from the library's collections and keep the name of the library before the public, attracting new and potential donations.Frank C. Campbell, \\"How the Music Division of the New York Public Library Grew-A Memoir, part 4,\\" Notes vol. 38, no. 1 (September 1981), p. 15. Since the late 1990s, NYPL's exhibitions program has added online exhibitions. Online exhibitions serve as an extension of physical exhibitions, adding more material or allowing a greater depth of exploration.  Public programs  Public programs are free of charge and take place in the 202-seat Bruno Walter Auditorium located on the lower level. The auditorium is used several times a week for musical performances, film screenings and lectures.About Public Programs at the Library for the Performing Arts.

Biography  Laura Gallego Garc√≠a was born in Quart de Poblet, Valencia, on the 11 of October 1977. She is a Spanish novelist of children and juvenile literature, specializing in the fantasy genre. She studied Hispanic Philology at the University of Valencia.  Professional career  At age 11, she started writing ‚ÄòZodiacc√≠a, a different world‚Äô. She spent ten years finishing it and, although it has never been published, she has a special affection for this story. Then, she was sure about being a novelist and she sent her work to several literary contests for years. At the age of 21, after finishing high school, she decided to study Hispanic Philology in the University of Valencia. She continued sending her work to publishing houses and contests but she did not publish anything until she wrote ‚ÄòFinis Mundi‚Äô, which was the first book she published. Previously, she wrote 13 books but none of them were brought to light. With ‚ÄòFinis Mundi‚Äô, the novelist won the ‚ÄòBarco de Vapor‚Äô Prize in 1999 after having participated for several years. This contest is celebrated every year by SM publishing house. After the publishing of her story 'Finis Mundi', she continued with other stories such as 'Mandr√°gora' or the tetralogy of 'Cr√≥nicas de la Torre'. However, although her fame is mainly due to her juvenile novel, she has also published stories aimed at children. In 2002, she won this contest again, this time with her novel ‚ÄòLa leyenda del rey errante‚Äô. In collaboration with SM publishing house, she has also published ‚ÄòEl coleccionista de relojes extraordinarios‚Äô, the trilogy of ‚ÄòMemorias de Idh√∫n‚Äô, ‚ÄòDonde los √°rboles cantan‚Äô, ‚ÄòDos velas para el diablo‚Äô, the saga of ‚ÄòCr√≥nicas de la Torre‚Äô and ‚ÄòLas hijas de Tara‚Äô, this last one as part of the collection ‚ÄúGran Angular‚Äù. In 2004, she started publishing her second trilogy, called ‚ÄòMemorias de Idh√∫n‚Äô (Memorias de Idh√∫n I: La Resistencia, Memorias de Idh√∫n II: Tr√≠ada, Memorias de Idh√∫n III: Pante√≥n). This was her biggest success, with more than 750 000 copies sold. She founded the university magazine ‚ÄòN√°yade‚Äô, which was distributed by the Faculty of Philology at the University of Valencia. She was the co-director from 1997 to 2010. Afterwards, she has published several independent books, most of them in the fantasy genre, as well as the second part of ‚ÄòAlas de fuego‚Äô, entitled ‚ÄòAlas negras‚Äô. She has also entered the realist literature with the serie ¬´Sara y las goleadoras¬ª, which includes titles such as: ‚ÄòCreando equipo‚Äô, ‚ÄòLas chicas somos guerreras‚Äô, ‚ÄòGoleadoras en la liga‚Äô, ‚ÄòEl f√∫tbol y el amor son incompatibles‚Äô, ‚ÄòLas Goleadoras no se rinden‚Äô and ‚ÄòEl √∫ltimo gol‚Äô. Her novel ‚ÄòDonde los √°rboles cantan‚Äô, published in October 2011, won the ‚ÄòPremio Nacional de Literatura Infantil y Juvenil‚Äô in 2012. Also, she has won the ‚ÄòCervantes Chico‚Äô Prize. That same year, she returned to children's literature with ‚ÄòMago por casualidad‚Äô. In March, 2017, she published ‚ÄòPor una rosa‚Äô, a book that contains three stories written by three different novelists: Laura Gallego, Javier Ruescas and Benito Taibo. These are three stories set in the universe of the classic tale ‚ÄòBeauty and the Beast‚Äô.  Thematic style and characteristic  She has explored many of the literary subjects: she began with historical- fantasy literature with her story ‚ÄòFinis Mundi but also science-fiction with her story ‚ÄòLas hijas de Tara‚Äô. Later, she wrote about epic fantasy. This type of literature was reflected in her story ‚ÄôMemorias de Idh√∫n‚Äô. She has also written stories for children. In her fantasy narrative, particularly with ‚ÄòMemorias de Idh√∫n‚Äô, the theme of love is just as or more important than the fantasy theme. The characters constantly express their feelings, doubts, misgivings, disappointment, etc., and are guided by them, generally more so other concepts such as honour or duty. This is what most differentiates her from novelists like Tolkien. Thus, reflection on one's own feeling occupies a lot of the space in the dialogues and the reproduction of thought.

Jerez, Zacatecas March 25, 1922- d. Mexico City May 23, 1985) was a Mexican sculptor and painter, part of the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura, bringing innovation into Mexican art in the mid 20th century. Coronel‚Äôs training was with artists of the Mexican muralism tradition, with influence from artists like Diego Rivera. This influence remained with the use of pre Hispanic themes and colors in his work. However, his artistic trajectory took him towards more use of color and more abstract forms in his work, due to influences from artists such as Rufino Tamayo. His work was exhibited and gained recognition in Mexico, the United States and Europe. Shortly before his death, he donated his considerable personal art collection to the people of Mexico, which was used to open the Museo Pedro Coronel in the city of Zacatecas. Life Pedro Coronel was born on March 25, 1922 in Jerez, Zacatecas to an upper-middle-class family. His mother played the violin and his father played the clarinet and violin. On Sundays they would get together and play folk music. The youngest of his brothers and sisters, Rafael, became a well-known painter of Moors, monks and the elderly. Pedro was a restless child, a dreamer and very rebellious. He did not like school, often skipping classes taking twelve years to finish his primary education. Instead, he preferred to go to the quarry and watch the workers carve out pieces of stone from the mountain. As a boy, he collected tops, marbles and puppets. This hobby would later evolve into a large collection of art from various parts of the world. His interest in art led him to study at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" when he was only thirteen, when the school had teachers such as Diego Rivera, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo and Francisco Z√∫√±iga. Coronel forged friendships with Rivera, Zu√±iga and Santos Balmori. He began by studying sculpture, but Santos Balmori‚Äôs influence encouraged him to paint. This led him to appreciate the uses of color. As he began his art career, he visited Paris in 1946, deciding to make it his second home in the late 1940s through 1950s, dividing years half in Paris and half in Mexico City. In the 1960s, he was a teacher at La Esmeralda, residing mostly in Mexico but traveling frequently to Europe, Asian and the United States. During this time, he also worked with Mathias Goeritz, Rufino Tamayo and Pedro Friedeberg on the Hotel Camino Real in Mexico City. Coronel has been characterized as having a strong and sometimes violent personality as well as making curt responses. However, he has also been characterized as honest and fair. He said ‚Äúhe who does not yell, he who does not tremble, had no right to live.‚Äù referring ‚Äúlife‚Äù in the sense of feeling. He said he feared death only because it would end his painting. He was briefly married to Amparo D√°vila, a Mexican writer but his long-term eighteen-year relation was with his second wife, R√©jane Lalonde. Over his life, he amassed a large collection of pre Hispanic, African, Asian, Greco-Romano and Medieval art along with graphic art, with over 1,800 pieces from various places and times including Roman, Egyptian and Chinese works as well as art and handcrafts from Africa, the Mexican colonial period and works by Goya, Picasso, Mir√≥ and Chagall. This collection was exhibited shortly before Coronel‚Äôs death and public reaction to it prompted him to donate it to the Mexican people and since 1986 it has been part of the permanent collection of a museum named after him in Zacatecas. Coronel died on May 23, 1985 in Mexico City. In 1986 his remains were moved to Zacatecas in accordance to his will, now at the Museo Pedro Coronel. Career While Coronel began his career as a sculptor, he divided his career between that and painting, with the painting becoming more important. Most of his artistic production occurred between 1949 and 1984, most of which consists of oils on canvas and masonite as well as sculptures in onyx and sandstone. In his early career he worked in Paris with Victor Brauner and sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. He had his first exhibition of paintings in 1954, which attracted the interest of art critics. From then to the end of his career he exhibited his work in Mexico, France, Italy, the United States and Brazil. His important works include Toro mugiendo a la luna (1958), La lucha (1959), Los deshabitados, los hombres huecos, El sol es una flor (1967-1968), A√±o I Luna (1969), Alfar de sue√±os, Habitantes de amaneceres, Bodas solares, Camino de soles and Po√©tica lunar. Recognitions for his work include the National Painting Prize in 1959, the Jos√© Clemente Orozco Prize (first place for painting and honorable mention in sculpture), the II Inter-American Biennial in Mexico in 1960, the Sal√≥n de la Pintura prize of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana in 1966 and the Premio Nacional de Arte in 1984. He was a founding member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. In 1971 Justino Fern√°ndez published a book about him called Pedro Coronel, pintor y escultor. The state of Zacatecas named him a favorite son (Hijo predilecto) in 1977. Since his death, his work continues to be exhibited in various venues in Mexico. In 2005, the Museo de Arte Moderno had a retrospective of his work thirty years after his death, mostly of large scale oils. In 2009, there was an exhibition of his graphic work at the state government building of Tabasco in Villahermosa. Artistry Pedro Coronel is classed as part of the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura. In the opinion of Santos Balmori, Coronel and Rufino Tamayo reinvented Mexican painting from its roots, finding a new way to connect the past with the present. Themes that appear in his work include mankind‚Äôs fears as well as anguish, pain and death. However, there are works which express love, sensuality, eroticism and life such as ‚ÄúVenus mexica‚Äù (1949), ‚Äúla ni√±a de la morena‚Äù (1940) and ‚ÄúLa dama de las frutas‚Äù (1949). He began his career as a sculptor which influenced his painting by adding volume and solidity to his images. Although his aim in his work was spontaneity and freedom of expression, in reality it follows a trajectory leaning towards abstraction. His work has been divided into stages such as naturalist, structuralist, lyrical, chromatic, and the revival of native indigenous themes. His early work is mostly figurative. This work creates juxtapositions fields, idealistic images and a convergence of reality and fantasy. His later work is when his style is more personal and set, figures giving way to forms and color. From 1953 to 1957 his work is influenced by Expressionism with some influence from Picasso with topics from everyday life such as bottles, glasses or lamps. Notable works from this period include Retrato de Mujer in 1953 and Naturaleza Muerta in 1956. A later stage shows interest in allegories with mythical personages. These paintings include El Advenimiento de Ella and La Lucha both from 1958 and Mujeres Habitadas from 1960. After this, his paintings became more colorful with lines simplifying such as in Los Fantoches Luminarios in 1962 and Rinc√≥n de Sue√±o from 1961. From 1962 to 1963 influence from Rufino Tamayo can be seen in paintings such as Interno M√°gico from 1963. From 1966 to 1975 he worked became more abstract. These years also encompass the majority of his production. This later work is characterized by taking the use of color to its limits but not overdoing it. This use of color follows that of his predecessor, Rufino Tamayo, but Coronel‚Äôs innovation is the use of intense, more pure colors, and the harmonization of background with form, unlike other painters, including his brother Rafael, where the background is subservient to the main topic. Two colors which dominate many of his works are red and yellow, which tend to reflect melancholy, passion and loneliness. While a member of the Generaci√≥n of the Ruptura, much of his work has pre Hispanic themes and colors, which were marks of the Mexican muralists. Works along these lines include La ni√±a de la morena, La serie de los ap√≥stoles and‚ÄúEl regreso de Quetzalcoatl‚Äù (The return of Quetzalcoatl), a later work which is semi abstract. His work has been described as having an element of violence similar to that of ancient Mesoamerican art. Museo Pedro Coronel Coronel‚Äôs donation of his personal art collection before his death prompted the creation of the Museo Pedro Coronel, inaugurated in 1985 by President Miguel de la Madrid in the city of Zacatecas. It is located in the former Real Colegio y Seminario de San Luis Gonzada, which was a Jesuit school founded in 1616. It later was run by the Dominicans in 1785 as the Colegio de la Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n. From the 19th century to 1962, it was a jail. In 1983 it was reconditioned for its current use as a museum. The Museo Pedro Coronel sponsors an art competition in his name called the Pedro Coronel Biennal, sponsored by the state of Zacatecas along with CONACULTA and Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes . However, despite the existence of the museum it is not easy to see the works of the painter in public. In 2010 the Miguel Alem√°n Foundation signed an agreement with the institution to preserve and promote the painter‚Äôs work. See also *Rafael Coronel, his younger brother, also a renowned painter.

Though commonly identified in manuscripts as comoedia, modern scholars often reject their status as comedy. Unlike Classical comedy, they were written in elegiac couplets. Denying their true comedic nature, Edmond Faral called them Latin fabliaux, after the later Old French fabliaux, and Ian Thomson labelled them Latin comic tales. Other scholars have invented terms like verse tales, rhymed monologues, epic comedies, and Horatian comedies to describe them.Roy (1974), 258 n. 2 The Latin \\"comedies\\", the dramatic nature of which varies greatly, may have been the direct ancestors of the fabliaux but more likely merely share similarities. Other interpretations have concluded that they are primitive romances, student juvenilia, didactic poems, or merely collections of elegies on related themes. Some elegiac comedies were adapted into vernacular language in the later Middle Ages, and retold by major vernacular writers such as Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Gower. The poem Pamphilus has Venetian and Old French versions. Style These comedies were composed in a high style, but they were typically about low or unimportant subject matter; lyric complaints only sometimes mixed with amorous content. They combined the plot and character types of the Greek \\"new comedy\\" practised by Terence and Plautus, but the greatest influence on them was Ovid. His Ars amatoria, Amores, and Heroides were highly influential. Plautus, though less widely read in the Middle Ages, was also an influence, as were the Scholastic debates concerning the nature of universals and other contemporary philosophical problems, with which the elegiac comedies often dealt, always humorously but no doubt sometimes to a serious end. The elegiac dramatists delight in \\"showing off\\" their Latin skills. Their use of rhetoric, logic, and various grammatical constructions suggest that they may have been used in the schools as exercises in poetic composition and philosophical argument. The language of their \\"fools\\" can be deliberately outlandish, and their deft use of puns is frequently sexual in nature. Parody is another typical element of elegiac humour. Persons of low rank are often placed in positions unsuited to them. Their bumbling, as when a rustic attempts to speak philosophically or the commoner pretends he is a chivalrous gentleman, is portrayed for its satiric effect. Satire is often employed in long digressions criticizing the corruption of the times, specifically targeting the selling of church offices, political corruption at court, sycophants‚Äô attempts to rise in society, and aristocrats‚Äô attempts to philosophize. In the Middle Ages, satire was usually considered a breed of comedy. Dramatic features The comedies were often about a sexual conquest, in which the lover must use his guile to overcome obstacles such as guardians, rivals, and reluctance on the part of the woman. The setting is some unspecified time contemporary with the poet, and the characters are all typical and have names descriptive of their traits and function in the story. The lack of resources on the part of the hero forces him to resort to deception and to employ intermediaries (as Ovid did in his narratives) in order to win the object of his desire. The elegiac comedies bear limited dramatic features. Thompson denies their theatricality, saying that \\"no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs.\\" A similar opinion is that the comedies are rhetorical exercises. Medieval poetic theory, however, did not regard comedy and elegy as mutually exclusive, nor identical. John of Garland wrote \\"all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true.\\" Other arguments raised against the dramatic performance of the comedies is, in general, their large number of narrative segments as opposed to dialogue. Arnulf of Orl√©ans, one of the elegiac writers, seems to have considered his work to have been made for the stage. These performances may have been narrated, mimed, or sung.

Life Wang Fan was from Lujiang Commandery (), which is located southwest of present-day Lujiang County, Anhui. He started his career in Wu as a Gentleman of Writing () during the reign of the first Wu emperor Sun Quan or second Wu emperor Sun Liang, but was dismissed from office. During the reign of the third Wu emperor Sun Xiu, Wang Fan served as a Central Regular Mounted Attendant () alongside He Shao, Xue Ying and Yu Si, and was given an additional appointment as a Chief Commandant of Escorting Cavalry (). He received much praise from his contemporaries. When the Wu government sent him as an ambassador to Wu's ally state, Shu, he was also highly regarded by the Shu government. Upon returning to Wu, he served as a military supervisor at the Wu military garrison in Xiakou (). During the reign of the fourth and last Wu emperor Sun Hao, Wang Fan became a Regular Attendant () alongside Wan Yu. Although he was initially close to Sun Hao, he gradually became alienated from the emperor as other officials slandered him in front of the emperor and as he became more outspoken against the emperor's outrageous behaviour. In 266, he offended Sun Hao and ended up losing his head. Sun Hao also exiled his family to the remote Guang Province in the south. Lu Kai, the Imperial Chancellor of Wu during Sun Hao's reign, lamented Wang Fan's unfortunate end. Wang Fan had two brothers, Wang Zhu () and Wang Yan (), who were also well-known learned men in Wu. Both of them were killed during a rebellion started by Guo Ma () in 279, which was one of the events leading to the fall of Wu in 280. Contributions to mathematics and astronomy Wang Fan was proficient in mathematics and astronomy. He calculated the distance from the Sun to the Earth, but his geometric model was not correct. In addition, he gave the numerical value of œÄ as 142 / 45 = 3.155‚Ä¶, which was not as accurate as that given by the mathematician Liu Hui, who lived around the same time as him.

The property was staked in the 1890s, and was explored briefly by Consolidated Mining and Smelting in 1927. Estella Mines Ltd. was formed by A.R. Allen in 1950, and the mill was built and commenced operation in 1951. Reserves calculated in 1951 were 47,800 tons with average width and grade 19% zinc, 5.8% lead, and 1.9 oz./ton silver. Milling was done at the rate of 150 tons/day, seven days per week, and 130 men were employed. The mill operated until February 1953, when reserves were depleted. Additional exploration was conducted from 1954 to 1957, when the company, reorganized as United Estella Mines Ltd., was forced to liquidate. Copper Soo Mining Company acquired the property in 1962 and exploration to 1963 resulted in a shipment of about 1300 tons averaging 23.1% zinc, 13.2% lead and 7 oz/ton silver. (Western Miner, Oct. 1966, p. 28-35). Exploration in 1965 and 1966 was successful in locating new ore, and a new mill was in operation in August 1966. Ore reserves at that time were 49,103 tons averaging 14.19% zinc, 7.01% lead, and 2.93 oz/ton silver, (17% mining dilution and 10% stope wall dilution included). Ore was mined by open stoping and shrinkage methods. Production to the end of 1967 totaled 51,391 tons milled averaging 7.67% zinc, 4.26% lead, 1.86 oz./ton silver, 0.02% Cadmium, and minor gold and copper. Total production was 120,704 tons of ore grading 8.97% zinc, 4.73% lead, and 1.74 oz./ton silver (Hoy, Prelim Map 38 B.C. MEMPR). The site of the mine now exists abandoned but as a popular ATV and off-road trip for sightseers due to its excellent view of the Rocky Mountain Trench - leading to the construction of a hang gliding take off point that can be seen next to the road on the way up.

The Landesflagge (civil flag), the State flag of Hamburg (Staatsflagge) and the admiralty flag (Admiralit√§tsflagge) consist of the Coat of arms of Hamburg on a red flag. Overview The civil flag shows a white castle with three towers on red background, which is used as a civil flag as a state flag for most purposes. (It was historically used as civil ensign as well.) The oldest seal with the castle is thought to date from 1241. The first flag featuring the current form was in the mid-16th century, although this was most probably a red field, a white escutcheon and red castle. After about 1623, the escutcheon began to be omitted, leaving a red castle on white or a white castle on red. It was only in 1751 that the white castle on red was decreed as the flag of Hamburg. The civil flag is free for use to everybody. The state flag of Hamburg is only used by the Senate of Hamburg as the head of state. This flag was created in 1897 on the occasion of the opening of the new town hall. The Admiralty flag of Hamburg is used only for state buildings connected to the navigation and at the jacks of boats of Hamburg's Water Constabulary, since there are no genuine warships under city command anymore. It portrays the admiralty coat of arms which have existed since 1642.Constitution of Hamburg (Article 5) Article 5 (1) The state colours are white-red. (2) The state coat-of-arms shows on a red escutcheon a white castle with three towers and a closed gate. (3) The state flag shows the white castle of the state coat-of-arms on a red field.

Birth Born at Canterbury Hospital on 2 June 1965, Mark Edward Waugh and Stephen Rodger Waugh are fraternal twins born to Rodger and Beverley Waugh. Mark arrived four minutes after Steve. Their father was a bank official and their mother was a teacher within the New South Wales Department of Education.Knight, pp. 4-5. The family settled in the western Sydney suburb of Panania.Knight, p. 6. The twins were later joined by two more brothers, Dean and Danny.Knight, pp. 9, 13. From an early age, the parents introduced their children to sport.Perry, p. 348. By the age of six, the twins were playing organised soccer, tennis and cricket. In their first cricket match, the brothers were both dismissed for ducks.Knight, p. 11. Family heritage The twins came from a sporting family. Their paternal grandfather Edward was a greyhound trainer. Raised in the northern coastal town of Bangalow, Edward earned selection for the New South Wales Country team in rugby league.Knight, p. 7. He was about to join Eastern Suburbs in the New South Wales Rugby League, but had to give up his career to nurse his wife, who was ill with polio.Knight, p. 8. Rodger was Edward's only son and was a promising tennis player. He was ranked eighth in Australia in his junior years, in an era when Australia was the dominant power. He played against the likes of Tony Roche and John Newcombe and was the state champion at under-14 level. On the maternal side, Bev was a tennis player who won the under-14 singles at the South Australian Championships. Her eldest brother Dion Bourne was an opening batsman who played for Bankstown in Sydney Grade Cricket and remains the leading runscorer in the club's history. Junior career The twins made their first representative cricket team when they were selected the Bankstown District under-10s at the age of eight. They were both sent off the field because their sleeves were of the wrong colour--Bev had knitted on the colours of the team, but everyone else was wearing plain white.Knight, p. 12. In 1976, the twins were the youngest ever to be selected in the New South Wales Primary Schools' soccer team. Playing for Panania Primary School, the twins swept their school to win the Umbro International Shield, a statewide knockout soccer competition, scoring all of their team's three goals in the final.Knight, p. 14. They were a key part of their school's consecutive state cricket championships, and were part of the school tennis team that came second in the state in their final year.Knight, p. 15. In their final year, Mark was the captain of the state primary school cricket and tennis teams, both of which won the national championships. Steve was the vice-captain of the cricket team and captained the state soccer team. The twins were instrumental in New South Wales winning the cricket carnival without a defeat, in one match combining in a partnership of 150. By this time, the increasing time demands led to conflicts between the sports, and the twins were delisted from the Bankstown Junior Soccer Association for missing a representative team. At the time, both were away playing tennis and soccer for the state age group team. Bankstown were unrepentant, so the twins registered with Auburn in soccer. The twins progressed to East Hills Boys Technology High School, which had a history of producing Australian international representatives in a number of sports. The school later educated quintuple-Olympic gold medallist Ian Thorpe.Knight, p. 17. Aged 13, the twins were invited by their uncle Bourne, then the captain of Bankstown's first grade team, to trial for the club's under-16 team for the Green Shield. They gained selection, but neither averaged more than 20 for the season. Aged fourteen, both made their senior grade cricket debut in 1979-1980, playing in the Fourth XI. The twins broke into East Hills Boys First XI in the same season,Knight, p. 18. and achieved the same level in soccer.Knight, p. 19. In 1980, the twins began playing for Auburn in the state soccer league. The twins generally played two games in a row, in their proper age group, before again with older boys. The same occurred in cricket, where they played in age group competitions in the morning before playing grade cricket in the afternoon. In 1980-81 the brothers were elevated to the Third XI mid-season. Mark's performance in the Green Shield saw him selected in Bankstown's under-21 team, still aged 15.Knight, pp. 20-21. The brothers often won formed a two-man team--in one match against Bankstown Boys High School, Mark scored a century and then the brothers took 16/85 between them.Knight, p. 21. At the end of 1980, the twins were selected in the state under-16 team for the national carnival, with Mark as vice- captain.Knight, p. 22. When Mark was 16, he grew around one foot in one year. It was a relief, because he had been diagnosed with the repetitive stress injury Osgood-Schlatter disease at 15, and told that he would not grow any further than his then height of 152 cm.Knight, p. 20. The pair changed soccer teams to play in the reserve grade for Sydney Croatia in the state league. Mark was a defender while Steve was a forward, and the pair were paid small amounts in the professional league. However, they quickly left as their cricket careers increasingly demanded more time.Knight, p. 23. The brothers were promoted to Bankstown's Second XI, before being selected for the First XI in the 1982-83 season, aged 17, both making their debut against Western Suburbs. Mark made 97 on debut, opening against a bowling attack that included Test player Greg Matthews. Steve was dropped back to the Second XI,Knight, p. 24. but Mark stayed in top division and ended the season with 427 runs at 30.50. This placed him second in his team's aggregates and he contributed 14 wickets at 10.71.Knight, p. 25. By this time, his coaches had already identified the traits by which Mark was to be characterised in his international career. The Bankstown yearbook noted that \\"accomplished . . . apart from the occasional lazy shot in no-man's land . . . A very good right- hand medium-pace bowler and one of the safest pairs of hands.\\" Steve was regarded as an aggressive player, something that characterised his early international career. The twins finished high school at the end of 1983.Knight, p. 27. In 1983-84, both were members of New South Wales Combined High Schools and the state under-19 team.Knight, p. 26. Mark was named as the player of the series in the New South Wales Schoolboys Championships, having scored 132 not out against Combined Associated Schools and then 105 not out and 4/32 against Combined Catholic Colleges. Steve made 170 against Great Public Schools. The brothers were then selected for Australia for the first time. They had been named in the national under-19 team to play a Test and ODI series against the touring Sri Lankan counterparts. The under-19 series pitted several future international players against one another.Knight, p. 29. Opening batsman Mark Taylor later went on to captain the Waugh brothers in the senior national team, while Craig McDermott was to break into international cricket less than a year later and lead the Australian pace attack for the next decade. Mark scored 123 in the Second Test at the Adelaide Oval, before Steve scored 187 in the Third Test at Melbourne as Australia won 1-0. During the season, the brothers began life after high school. Mark did not contemplate going to university and both became sports equipment salesmen.Knight, pp. 31-32. Steve had enrolled in a teaching course, but withdrew after a few lectures.Perry, p. 349. Both brothers made their maiden First XI century during the season; Mark scored 108 against Mosman, while Steve scored centuries against Sydney University and Waverley. At the start of the 1984-85 season, the brothers were included in the New South Wales state squad.Knight, p. 33.

Life He entered the order of the Friars Minor in the Roman province, receiving the habit at Cori, 1 February 1838. He completed his philosophical-theological studies at Tivoli and Lucca. In 1844 he obtained the degree of Lector (Professor) in philosophy, and in the following year, 17 May, was ordained priest. For some years he taught at Tivoli, Ferentino, Viterbo, Aracoeli in Rome; in 1854 he retired to Recco in his native province of Genoa. By order of Bernardino Trionfetti, minister- general of the Friars-Minor, Marcellino in 1856 was entrusted with the major task of writing the history of the Franciscan missions, to which the greater part of his life was devoted. He undertook journeys all over Europe, bringing home literary treasures, especially from the libraries and archives of Spain. Later on he resided mostly at Prato and at Rome, engaged in the publication of his works. From 1881 to 1889, Marcellino was definitor-general of his order, and finally in 1899 he retired to the convent of Livorno, where he peacefully died. During his long literary career Marcellino made the acquaintance of many prominent men, with whom he carried on a large correspondence, preserved in the convent of Livorno. He enjoyed also the esteem of Pope Leo XIII, to whom he dedicated some of his works. Works The total number of books and brochures published by Marcellino amounts to between seventy and eighty.

The company was founded in 1927 under the name and changed its name to Mandom Corporation in 1971. History In 1927, Shinpachiro Nishimura founded the Kintsuru Perfume Corporation. After the success with a pomade called the Tancho Stick in 1933, Kintsuru Perfume Corp. began to focus its future efforts in men's care. By 1959, the success of the Tancho Stick led the company to change its name to Tancho Corporation. Tancho's efforts with expanding outside Japan was further boosted in 1970 when the company launched a new line of men's care products, called Mandom, which took its name from a combination of the words \\"human\\" and \\"Freedom\\". An advertising campaign featuring Charles Bronson became the first of a long series of Japanese ads to feature top Hollywood stars. Within weeks of airing the commercial, Mandom become the No.1 selling male toiletry brand in Japan. Tancho then changed its name again, to Mandom Corporation, in 1971. In 1976, Mandom's success and the creation of their flagship brand, Gatsby, encouraged them to move into direct sales of their products. However, despite the success of the Gatsby brand, the move was disastrous; by 1980, the firm gave up the direct sales model and returned to wholesale distribution. Mandom went public in 1988, selling shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's over-the-counter market. In 1989, the firm introduced Lucido-l, a new cosmetic line for women. Into the early 2000s, the firm expanded its international presence by establishing the Gatsby and Lucido-l brands as its flagship global brands. Marketing Brands Flagship brands: * GATSBY: grooming products for young men. Sales of Gatsby products accounted for 59.6% of the company's revenue in 2012. * LUCIDO: grooming products for middle-aged men. * Lucido-l: beauty care products for women. * Bifesta: cosmetics brand for women. * Pixy: cosmetic brand for women. * Pucelle: fragrance and body care brand for women.

Connecting minibuses were introduced to continue the hotel transfer/pickup service. In 2002, the Government of Victoria opted to contribute $3 million to a $10 million plan to expand and improve SkyBus services, after a feasibility study into a city to airport rail link found the service would not be viable.

Life Born Marguerite Acarie, her father, Pierre Acarie, was one of the staunchest members of the Catholic League, which, after the death of King Henry III of France, opposed the succession of the Huguenot prince, Henry of Navarre, to the French throne. He was one of the 16 who organized resistance to this in Paris. After the dissolution of the League, brought about by the abjuration of Henry IV, Acarie was exiled from Paris and his wife had to remain behind to contend with creditors.

The park operated from 1923 to 1977, at which time it was closed due to lack of attendance to the park and storm damage in late 1977. Marcia Brancato Accurso's grandfather, Salvatore ‚ÄúSam‚Äù Brancato, a Sicilian immigrant and blacksmith by trade, came to the United States in 1896. After settling in Kansas City, he went into the grocery business, then began buying up real estate. He opened Fairyland Park in 1923. It would be in the family until its closing in 1977. A year after \\"Sam\\"s passing in 1976. Admission to blacks was only to private groups and employees, until 1964. After protest marches, demonstrations and arrests for blocking the entrance, was general admission not segregated. Admission cost to the park was kept low (25 cents by 1971).http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/1996/08/19/story1.html A storm in late 1977, which by some accounts was 'a wind storm', and by others 'a tornado', caused extensive damage to the park. This, combined with the nearby park Worlds of Fun caused the venerable park to shutter for good. During the 1950s and 1960s, Fairyland boasted 3 roller coasters, an 8 story Ferris wheel (which was bent in half during tornado), a swimming pool (double Olympic size)(closed in late 1950s), bumper cars, a shooting range, and even a petting zoo at one time. \\"Sam\\" loved children smiling, and bought the \\"Kiddeland\\" at 85th & Wornall, moving the rides to Fairyland. Fairyland and its owners tried a number of gimmicks throughout their later days trying to compete with the newer and shinier Worlds of Fun built in 1972. Summer Jams included REO, Dr. Hook, Blue Oyster cult, Charlie Daniels, and many others in the final summers. In 1967 arsonist failed to burn the wooden rollercoaster, The Brancato family commissioned the construction of a new roller coaster, The Wildcat, in 1967. It would not be enough. The Wildcat was the park's biggest ride, and helped the park stay competitive. Other promotions included advertising saying \\"Where \\"Fun\\" is Still Affordable\\", keeping their admission at fifty cents while Worlds of Fun was charging five dollars, in addition to parking. With attendance dwindling, the park suffered major storm damage in the winter of 1977‚Äì1978, and never reopened. Whether or not the park really was destroyed was always questioned, with some believing the park was just deciding to shut down and needing a reason. The Brancato family tried unsuccessfully to redevelop The Fairyland parcel as many things after the park closed, a swap meet and a zoo were mentioned. But in the end, the park would never again entertain guests. After the park's closure The park sat closed from 1978 and the ruins of it still stood as late as 1998. In 1989, The Wildcat roller coaster, which had stood at Fairyland abandoned for 11 years, was finally dismantled and moved piece by piece to Frontier City where it now is opened to the public. A small plaque in the waiting area indicated the history of the ride. The remaining land was finally developed in the early part of the 21st century, with the sad crumpled remains of the park finally getting hauled off in 2004. The land comprising the park, as of 2008, is still identified as 'Fairyland Park' in Google Maps. The original plot was bordered by Prospect Avenue to the west, 75th Street to the north, 77th Street to the south, and Indiana Avenue to the east. Alphapointe Association for the Blind bought a substantial portion of the property and constructed the Life Skills Campus which serves as its headquarters. The address of the headquarters is 7501 Prospect Avenue. 7.5 of the of Fairyland Park have been purchased by the city of Kansas City, to build a new police station.http://nl.newsbank.com/nl- search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&p;_theme=kc&p;_action=search&p;_maxdocs=200&p;_topdoc=1&p;_text_direct-0=119CADE6D9B09960&p;_field_direct-0=document_id&p;_perpage=10&p;_sort=YMD_date:D&s;_trackval=GooglePM The land the park stood on was eventually bisected by Bruce R.

He was the rhythm guitarist and bassist for the Christian metal band, Demon Hunter, which he co- founded with his brother, vocalist Ryan Clark. Before Demon Hunter, Clark was a former guitarist and co-founder of Training for Utopia with Rob Dennler. He appears on Zao's The Lesser Lights of Heaven DVD.  History  Before forming TFU and Demon Hunter, Clark was in a local band called Offset. Offset never recorded anything and was short lived. Clark then started Training for Utopia with Rob Dennler.Decibel Magazine Clark formed the band with the Rob Dennler (vocals), Steve Saxby (bass) and Morley Boyer (drums). Dennler left the band in 1996 and Ryan joined the band. The band released an EP, a Split EP, and two studio albums. He and his brother formed Demon Hunter in 2000 and released their debut album late the following year through Solid State Records. The group would continue to steadily gain exposure throughout the 2000s. His grandfather, an artist, helped inspire his grandsons' work in graphic design, which is their true day job. Ryan and Don founded Seattle-based Asterik Studio with their friend Demetre Arges in 2000. The design studio has created CD packaging, poster art, web design, and/or merchandise design for hundreds of artists including Liz Phair, P.O.D., and The White Stripes; however, Clark also notes that he is not a fine artist and that such work is typically outsourced. Based on their design experience, Don and Ryan authored a chapter in the book New Masters of Photoshop, Volume 2 (). In 2007, the brothers had announced that they were leaving Asterik to start Invisible Creature. Clark was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album packaging for The Folds' Secrets Keep You Sick. He lives in Seattle, Washington, with his wife and two children. On August 12, 2009 in Seattle, Washington, at El Coraz√≥n, Demon Hunter announced that Don Clark had left the band to pursue his career in graphic design and to be with his family. In an interview with Matt Johnson Clark stated that, he, Don & Ryan, and Nathan Burke formed a project called Deathbed Atheist. Clark quit the band to focus on life and work.

It is portable and works on many devices (embedded devices, handhelds, set-top boxes,...). Here the communication between server layer and desktop layer can be made in classical way via TCP/IP but depending on the configuration and target system it can be done via shared memory too. The goal of project XFast is to have a very slim and fast graphical environment that contains both within the same project: a replacement for an X-server to give access to the graphics hardware and a WindowManager-like layer that offers user interface elements for applications and desktop management. Target systems for XFast are (not only) embedded systems with low resources where it is important to have a UI available with short loading times and low memory consumption. It currently runs at Linux, Windows, PlayStation, GP2X and others. Within the XFast windowing system environment GTK and Simple DirectMedia Layer applications are supported, so there is no need to re-write them. To use them special patched GTK and SDL versions are required, the related patch and build scripts are part of the XFast package. Beside of that XFast offers an own GUI widget library that can be used to write native applications for that windowing system. XFast is free software that was licensed under the GPL. History XFast is a fork and further development of the Xynth windowing system. It was branched from the original project in order to add some far reaching modifications to the environment that are not compatible with the idea behind the original project. The goal of this fork is to have a more compatible source base for both: low level embedded systems and desktop systems with bigger hardware resources.

By and large the military forces during the period had not changed significantly from those of the 18th century, although their employment would differ significantly. Military forces during the Napoleonic Wars consisted largely of the three principal combat arms, and several combat support services, and included the infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineers, and logistics troops which were called the army train during the period. The period gave a start to what are today military staffs to help administer and organise forces in the field and in garrisons, and supervise training of conscripts and recruits. Much of the staff work was performed by staff officers and often aide-de-camps to senior officers, and included the officers of the quartermaster general. Combat arms Napoleonic armies were formed from distinct infantry, cavalry, and artillery forces, each using distinctly different arms. =Infantry= Infantry relied primarily on the musket, with the bayonet used for shock attack and defense from cavalry charges. Infantry could be described as line infantry, guards, grenadiers, light infantry or skirmishers, but the roles and arms employed often overlapped between these. ; Line infantry :Infantry of the line were so named for the dominant line combat formation used to deliver a volume of musket fire. Forming the bulk of the Napoleonic armies it was the primary offensive and defensive Arm available to the commanders during the period. Movement in line formation was very slow, and unless the battalion was superbly trained, a breakdown in cohesion was virtually assured, especially in any kind of uneven or wooded terrain. As a result, when movement over such terrain was required over a significant distance troops would move in columns and then deploy into line at their destination. :In addition, the line formation was vulnerable to cavalry charges, particularly from the flanks and rear, and these attacks usually resulted in the complete breakdown of cohesion and even destruction of the unit unless it was able to \\"form square\\". ; Grenadiers :The grenadier units had, by the time of the Napoleonic Wars, ceased using the hand-thrown grenades, and were largely known for being composed of physically big men, frequently relied upon for shock actions. They otherwise used the same arms and tactics as other infantry. ; Light infantry :The light infantry, variously known in different armies by different names, were first introduced into the regular armies during the wars of the 18th century as irregular troops, but became permanent parts of regular Napoleonic armies either as units in their own right, or as companies in the line infantry battalions. Perceiving themselves as superior troops due to being required to engage the enemy in small groups ahead of the other troops, requiring greater initiative and skill. Light infantry were also fully trained to fight in formation and so functioned as both line and light infantry when required. ; Skirmishers :Many armies contained other light troops other than the officially designated 'light infantry'. These units fought as dedicated skirmisher units ahead of the main force, such as the French Voltigeurs, German J√§ger and British Rifles. =Cavalry= The cavalry of the period had retained its role from the 18th century, although the mounted grenadiers had also abandoned their grenades, and only retaining their names. For the most part the cavalry were an offensive Arm, either used to find the enemy, or as a manoeuvre force to deliver a physical shock to the infantry, dependent mostly on their sabres and lances for causing casualties. The largest component of all armies during the period were the dragoons, but due to lack of adequate sized horses light cavalry soon became a large part of the armies. ; Heavy cavalry :Heavy cavalry were all cavalry units that mounted large horses and were used to deliver a physical shock to either enemy cavalry or infantry. They were so called from the 18th century belief that they were the deciders of the battle, always kept as a final reserve to be used to break the enemy ranks. Although many still wore the cuirass, and therefore many regiments were called cuirassiers during the previous century, and were descendants of armoured cavalry before them, many like the carabiniers did not, and were later referred by writers as \\"heavy cavalry\\" for the size of their horses. ; Dragoons :Dragoons were the less glamorous but most numerically significant part of the cavalry arm, with origins as mounted infantry. During the period dragoons were frequently used in the battle cavalry role in addition to their traditional role. They were also equipped with either carbines or the characteristically long dragoon musket. ; Light cavalry :Light cavalry were utilised for their speed and agility functioning primarily as reconnaissance and screening troops. They were also used for skirmishing, raiding and communications. Many light cavalry types evolved flamboyant uniforms, particularly the hussars, which had originated in Hungary and continued to be recruited from there by the army of Austria. By the time of the wars, units consisting of or modeled after hussars were found in all armies. Irregular Cossack cavalry were of great use to the Russian army in harassing the enemy lines of communication and conducting raids. ; Lancers :Lancer cavalry, known in many armies as uhlans, were exclusive to a few armies at the beginning of the wars but came to be used by nearly all the combatant nations as the wars progressed. They were valued for the significant advantage they had in a charge due to the long reach of the lance which allowed them gain first strike at enemy cavalry and infantry alike, though they were highly vulnerable if forced into a near stationary melee. Frequently used as an anti-cavalry force. =Artillery= Artillery of the Napoleonic Wars continued to use the cannon and howitzers of the previous century. These were smooth-bore, heavy, cast artillery pieces moved by limbers, usually at a slow pace. ; Siege artillery :Siege artillery were very heavy cannon, howitzer and mortar artillery pieces used to force surrender of fortresses during a siege. ; Field artillery :Field artillery usually employed cannon and howitzers to fire directly into visible enemy troops, firing either ball or canister ammunition measured in the weight of the cannon ball (in pounds). The heavier pieces were sometimes known as \\"position artillery\\" and were deployed in the same position for the duration of the battle due to the difficulty of moving them. ; Horse artillery :Artillery in which the crews rode rather than walked with their pieces became known as horse artillery, and was also an innovation of the previous century, but became more widespread during the Napoleonic Wars. Usually attached to the cavalry units to provide them with supporting fire from smaller cannon then their field artillery counterparts. The idea of mobile artillery later became prominent during the 20th century, as the need for mobile fire support was becoming increasingly important as armies mechanized, rendering horses obsolete. Support services Support services were all the multitude of troops that ensured the combat arms could manoeuvre and fight. ; Administrative staffs :The administrative staffs of the armies were largely responsible for the operational matters relating to the conduct of campaigns such as obtaining intelligence, transmitting orders, and ensuring the delivery of ammunition to troops. ; Quartermaster staffs :The quartermaster staffs during the period were largely responsible for ensuring the armies had adequate living quarters and provisions (water, food and clothing) for troops and animals to continue the campaign. They also often served in the intelligence gathering capacity as scouts due to their need to be located somewhat ahead of the marching troops when surveying the locations for suitable camp-sites or bivouacs. ; Engineers :Usually part of the artillery Arm, the military engineers were responsible for the building and destruction of field defences, conduct of sieges, and construction and demolition of bridges. ; Pontonniers :The pontonniers continued in their 18th century role of erecting pontoons to cross rivers where no bridge was available, or where one was destroyed by the enemy. ; Sappers :Sappers, also known as pioneers, were originally the troops that were used for digging trenches and fortifications during sieges. By the time of the Napoleonic Wars a detachment of sappers was usually serving with infantry and cavalry regiments to help with demolition of gates and fences to allow easier movement by these units. Sappers were chosen for their large size and physical strength. A distinctive piece of equipment of a sapper was the axe, usually a double-handed implement with a broad head. ; Miners :Less well known during the period, the miners had a long history, and were used to mine the tunnels during sieges in which the explosive charges were emplaced to demolish parts of the fortification's wall, creating a breach. ; The army train :The army train was the Service that ensured, with varying degree of efficiency during the period, of delivering to the troops everything they could not carry themselves. Often divided among the regimental and general trains, the French Service was considered the best in Europe during the period. ; Medical services :Although the military medical services were rudimentary during the Wars, they existed, and the experience of military doctors and surgeons during the conflicts contributed significantly to advancement of medical science later in the century. Irregular troops Although arguably the best known of the troops that did not serve as permanent parts of the Napoleonic armies were the Cossacks, almost all major armies of the period employed these, with the Spanish guerrilleros later giving their name to a new form of guerrilla warfare.

It has a pale buff or greyish- white cap, yellow pores and a stout stipe, and stains intensely blue when handled or cut. Bitter and inedible, it can cause severe vomiting and diarrhoea if eaten. Until 2014 it was placed in genus Boletus, but has since been transferred to the new genus Caloboletus based on molecular phylogenetic data. Taxonomy The fungus was first described by the pioneering South African-born mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801, who placed it in genus Boletus. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin radic- 'root', referring to its rooting stipe. The name Boletus albidus is a later synonym. In 2014, the bolete was transferred to the new genus Caloboletus by Italian mycologist Alfredo Vizzini, based on phylogenetic data. It is often known by the common name of whitish bolete. Description The cap diameter ranges from across, and is usually dirty white, greyish-white, ivory white or buff, downy at first, but often finely cracking at the centre as the cap expands. The stipe is 5-8 cm (2-3¬º in) tall by 3-4 cm (1¬º-1‚Öî in) wide, usually swollen or barrel-shaped when young, but soon becoming elongated and more or less fusiform, with a tapering base usually rooting into the substrate. The apex is typically bright lemon yellow, but fading below. There is a light straw- coloured reticulation at the upper part of the stipe, though in rare occasions this may be indistinct. The flesh is pale yellow, somewhat paler whitish to straw-coloured in the cap, instantly turning dark blue when cut. The pores are lemon yellow, small and rounded, bruising blue when touched or injured. The spore print is olivaceous walnut-brown.Bon M. (1987).The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North Western Europe. Microscopically, it has ellipsoid to fusiform spores measuring 11.5‚Äì14 √ó 4‚Äì5.5 Œºm. The hyphal structure of the cap is a trichodermium of interwoven septate hyphae, often finely incrusted. Distribution and habitat Fruiting during warm spells in the summer and early autumn, Caloboletus radicans is ecologically versatile. It forms ectomycorrhizal associations with a wide range of broad-leaved trees, including oaks (Quercus), beech (Fagus), hornbeam (Carpinus), chestnut (Castanea) and lime (Tilia). It grows on both calcareous (chalk) and acidic soils in southern England (where it is common) and across much of Europe. Edibility The mushroom is inedible due to its intense bitterness. A 2012 study on mushroom poisoning in Switzerland by Katharina M. Schenk-Jaeger and colleagues, found Caloboletus radicans to have caused severe gastrointestinal symptoms to those who had consumed it, including recurrent vomiting and bloody diarrhoea.

Stahl and starring Paul Lukas, Sidney Fox and Lewis Stone, George Meeker, and Sidney Toler. It was written by Gladys Lehman and based on Preston Sturges' 1929 hit Broadway play of the same name. Strictly Dishonorable was Sturges' second play on Broadway, and his first to be filmed. As a film made before the advent of the Production Code, the film-makers were able to preserve the cheerfully uninhibited sexual innuendo of the Sturges play in their movie version, which he is said to have endorsed.TCM Notes Plot Snubbish, quick-tempered Henry Greene (George Meeker) and his fiancee Isabelle Perry (Sidney Fox) stop into a New York speakeasy owned by Tomasso Antiovi (William Ricciardi) for a drink. They meet retired Judge Dempsey (Lewis Stone), an amiable man who befriends the Southern belle, much to Henry's dismay. Famous opera singer Tino Caraffa, a charming but notorious playboy, whose real name is Gus Di Ruvo (Paul Lukas), is there as well, and while Henry is gone to move his illegally parked car, Gus and Isabelle, an opera fan, get acquainted. When Henry returns, he's incensed to learn that the two of them have been dancing together. He wants Isabelle to leave with him, but she refuses and breaks their engagement, returning his ring. Henry tries to get the police to help him force Isabelle to leave by telling them that she has been \\"kidnapped by villains\\", but Judge Dempsey sets them straight, getting Henry arrested and taken away. Gus offers to put Isabelle up for the night, assuring her that his intentions are \\"strictly dishonorable\\". The judge warns Isabelle about Gus, but she is adamant about staying because she has fallen in love. So too has Gus: Overwhelmed by Isabelle's sweetness and innocence, he spends the night in Judge Dempsey's apartment. The next morning, Henry returns and tries to get Isabelle to come back to him. Despite appearances, she assures him that she has not lost her virtue and wants to know if he is still \\"pure\\", but he insists that it is \\"entirely different\\" for men. She reluctantly agrees to remain engaged to Henry, and he leaves to wait for her outside. Gus arrives and proposes marriage to Isabelle, but she does not believe that he loves her, and she leaves. When Gus and the judge go to get a drink, they find Isabelle there, crying. She confesses that she does love Gus, and the judge goes to tell Henry not to wait.TCM Full synopsisSteele, David Plot summary (IMDB) Cast * Paul Lukas as Count Gus Di Ruvo * Sidney Fox as Isabelle Perry * Lewis Stone as Judge Dempsey * George Meeker as Henry Greene * William Ricciardi as Tomasso Antiovi * Sidney Toler as Patrolman Mulligan * Carlo Schipa as Waiter * Samuel Bonello as Waiter * Joe Torillo as Cook * Joseph W.

Here, seasons of unfathomable extremes march beneath a mountain known as The Great One. In Denali's fierce winter, 20 hours of darkness and temperatures dipping nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit below zero are routine; in summer, 20 hours of sunlight. Grizzly bear, wolf, moose, ground squirrel and golden eagle have each found their own way to live in this sub-Arctic eco-system where life pulses in a series of harsh, dark winters, framed by the light of June and August.

Here the basic elements of the earth exist in paradoxical extremes. Namib, the hottest of lands, is obscured in mist created by the Benguela, one of the coldest of ocean currents. Fur seals and penguins divide their time between the sandy shore and the icy water of the sea, while elephant, ostrich, springbok, hyena roam the wind-swept dunes. Ingenious adaptations to this ancient desert's extreme heat allow these and other creatures to survive in an Eden called Namib. =Manu - Peru Hidden Rainforest= (Nov. 12, 1997) Along the eastern base of the Peruvian Andes is a great river named Manu, the life blood for one of the world's great secrets - the Manu Biosphere Reserve.

Locked between Tibet and India, Bhutan is the jewel of the Himalayas. To the north of the kingdom, towering virgin peaks rise to 25,000 feet. Beneath steep glacial walls, alpine highlands fall to misty forests. Mountain streams cut through gorges on their way down to warmer valleys and wide marshes in the heart of the kingdom. One distinct landscape drops to the next before finally descending to the jungles and grasslands of the southern plains. For the people who have adapted to this domain of extremes, Bhutan is a Living Eden where respect for life, in all its many incarnations, endures like the land itself. =Palau - Paradise of the Pacific= (Jul. 15, 1998) Far to the east of India and Indonesia is a place where the sea hides a treasure of living riches - a secret corner of the ocean where ancient species still thrive in dazzling abundance, wildness and wonder. It sits alone at the edge of the vast Pacific Ocean, sheltered from time and the outside world. As lush as any paradise of our imagination, it is not one emerald island but an archipelago of more than two hundred, nearly all uninhabited. Along its submerged shoulders flourish some of the richest coral reefs remaining on Earth. In the reefs' shadows, life seeks shelter from the open water. This place is call Palau, a Living Eden where all is not what it seems - a home to a world of novelties concocted by nature unconstrained. =Madagascar - A World Apart= (Nov. 4, 1998) Three hundred miles off the east coast of Africa lies an island forgotten by time.

Preserved by its isolation, this wondrous realm is a land unlike any other. =South Georgia Island - Paradise of Ice= (Jan. 20, 1999) In the South Atlantic Ocean amid huge, frozen glaciers and giant ice floes, a range of rough, ice-capped mountains rise up to form Antarctica's liveliest neighborhood: South Georgia Island. At 106 miles in length, this imposing icy island regularly endures storm winds in excess of 120 mph while nearby ocean waves swell to 50-foot heights. Home to bull elephant seals and the wandering albatross, this stark, snowy land boasts the world's largest penguin population. Frigid and windswept, it is an unlikely living Eden.

Far below, warm morning mists shroud the rainforest, concealing the exotic creatures teeming in and below the canopy. The vast jungle provides shelter for some of the rarest, strangest and most magnificent creatures on Earth. It is a Living Eden both rich and fragile - a self- contained world of surprises and transformations. =Kakadu - Australia Ancient Wilderness= (Jul. 14, 1999) Over hundred kilometres from Australia's north coast, the Yellow Waters and the South Alligator Rivers cut through an ancient limestone plateau to create Kakadu National Park.

For the Aborigines, the first humans to live here, there is no afterlife paradise is here and now in a Living Eden called Kakadu. =Canyonlands - America's Wildwest= (Nov. 17, 1999) Deep in the vast American West lies a high, lonely land called the Colorado Plateau. Lying mostly in Utah, it extends south into Arizona and east into Colorado. In the very heart of the plateau lies a geological spectacle where millions of years of exposure to weather and the chiseling force of the Colorado River has created a labyrinth of pinnacles, chasms, arches, gorges and canyons. It is not just form, but colour that creates the beauty of this rugged place. The varied mineral content of the layers of rock creates an entire palette of hues that change as the sun moves through the sky from canyon rim to canyon rim. This Living Eden is a stark and untamed wilderness, home to an incredible array of creatures that instinctively embody the spirit of the West. From the elusive mountain lion to the resourceful coyote, only the strongest survive in Canyonlands. =Kamchatka - Siberia Forbidden Wilderness= (May 10, 2000) Jutting south from the far east of Siberia lies an isolated and mountainous peninsula where volcanoes, geysers and bubbling hot springs create the smoke, steam and fire that prevail in this icy and remote place. This harsh and beautiful land is home to the densest population of grizzly bears in the world and the biggest brown bears in Eurasia. Siberian bighorn sheep, silver foxes, sables, mink and black-capped marmots have all adapted to the severe climate. Walruses, northern fur seals, sea lions dot its coastline, and bowhead whales breed in the waters just offshore. Millions of salmon swim in its streams while the world's largest eagles soar above all that make Kamchatka a living Eden. Narrated by Linda Hunt. =Thailand - Jewel of the Orient= (1999) On the shores of the Andaman Sea lies a lush tropical paradise called Thailand, a peninsular finger reaching down from the Southeast Asian mainland as if to touch the equator. Thailand's jungles are the domain of tigers. Elephants amble through the dense forest while white-handed gibbons swing from branch to branch. This is a mysterious world of flying snakes and lizards where cobra is king.

From grasslands, wetlands and lakes to forests and slopes, the crater provides habitats for Africa's creatures both great and small. This Living Eden is a glorious stage where lions, hyenas, cheetahs, jackals, vultures, servals and wildebeest act out a dramatic story of life and death that was set into motion so long ago. =Anamalai - India Elephant Mountain= (Nov. 8, 2000) As the Western Ghats fall away into the heat and haze of India's Deep South, a solitary mountain rises up from the hot, dusty plains of Tamil Nadu. Seen from a distance, the mountain's silhouette is uncannily familiar: the sweep of the trunk and characteristic bulging forehead. It is an unmistakable profile. It is called Anamali - the Elephant Mountain. Here the elephant roams free and unmolested for it is the living embodiment of Ganesh, the Remover of Obstacles. Among stands of rosewood, cardamon and bamboo are forest temples to the elephant-headed deity, perhaps the most popular in the Hindu pantheon. The late Anne Bancroft narrates as we traverse the sacred ground of this living Eden, \\"home of gods\\", \\"lords of protection\\". =Yellowstone - America Sacred Wilderness= (Jan. 31, 2001) Yellowstone is a hive of activity. Paul Schullery has been watching wildlife here for 30 years and is one of the world's leading authorities on the park. As he guides us through this fresh, sunlit environment, wolves and grizzly bears mount extraordinary chase sequences in their quest for elk, and mountain lions gambol about without worry. Dramas occur in every season, for Yellowstone isn't just the world's first National Park - it's one of the great success stories in wildlife conservation. =Costa Rica - Land of Pure Life= (May 29, 2001) The misty rain forests, rivers and beautiful white sand beaches of Costa Rica are home to one of the most diverse assemblages of life on Earth. Along the coast, giant crocodiles fight for the right to mate, while in the trees, troops of capuchin, squirrel and howler monkeys, as well as resplendent quetzals and beautiful songbirds, forage for food above the forest floor that is home to Hercules beetles, deadly army ants and poison dart frogs. On the sandy beaches hatchling sea turtles emerge by the thousands to race to the safety of the sea and, though few survive and reach open ocean, enough return to lay their eggs and complete the cycle of life unique to this Eden called Costa Rica. =Tasmania - Land of the Devils= (Jun. 12, 2001 Tasmania: Land of the Devils) Off the southeast coast of Australia is the island refuge of Tasmania. Safe from the forces that have changed much of the Australian continent, Tasmania is an Eden of magnificent forests, snow-capped mountain ranges, giant waterfalls, wild rivers and pristine coastlines. Tasmania is also the home of the largest marsupial carnivore - the Tasmanian Devil. Voracious eaters with powerful jaws, they often leave behind only the jawbone of their prey. Some of the oldest trees on earth, Huon pines over 2,000 years old, and the tallest flowering tree, the Swamp Gum, share this unique island with wallabies, bettongs, quolis, tiger snakes and ground parrots. Off the coast, giant kelp forests and sponge gardens host the prehistoric handfish, king crab, sea dragons, red velvet fish and deep sea anglerfish, many of which are found nowhere else on earth. =Glacier Bay - Alaska Wild Coast= (Nov. 20, 2001) Nestled in the heart of southeast Alaska, Glacier Bay is a wild paradise of ocean and ice. This film chronicles the lives of brown bears, bald eagles, humpback whales and other charismatic species. Nearly all life here is ultimately tied to the salmon, and the heroic migration of these fish provides the thread that weaves together the remarkable fabric of life in this story. Glacier Bay, a stunning formation of fjords, is the centre stage for this great drama. =Temple of the Tiger - India Bandhavgarh Wilderness= (May 5, 2002) Once a hunting preserve for the Indian Maharajas, Bandhavgarh National Park is one of the most important tiger habitats remaining in Asia. Within the park, an abandoned palace harbours a flourishing population of tigers, bats, cobras, and monkeys who share their domain with a solitary temple priest. The dominant male tiger that has ruled this domain for years is now being challenged by a younger, stronger male. =Patagonia: Tuxedo Junction= (Jun. 16, 2002) Observing penguins in Argentina, as the birds reacquaint themselves during the breeding season after a long separation. Included: mating rituals and nest building. Narrated by Betsy Ames. =Big Sur - California Wild Coast= (Nov. 24, 2002) It has been called the greatest meeting of land and sea in the world. The Santa Lucia Mountains rise precipitously from the Pacific Ocean just south of Monterey on the central Californian coast. A sometimes violent, yet fragile place, Big Sur challenges the senses. Here air, water, land and life combine in spectacular fashion and provide refuge for a host of creatures including condors, falcons, blue whales, great white sharks and elephant seals. Wait for the morning fog to rise and enter this vast and impenetrable Big South Country. =Arctic Oasis - Canada Southampton Island= (Dec. 21, 2003) During the Arctic spring and summer, one of Earth's most dazzling displays of rejuvenation takes place in Canada's far north. A brief season of light and plenty brings great migrations of bowhead and beluga whales, harp seals, caribou, and polar bears. It also brings an Inuit hunter whose aim is to teach his 12-year-old son the traditional survival skills of his ancient people. =The Lost World - Venezuela Ancient Tepuis= (Sep. 14, 2003) The inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's, The Lost World and home to the world's tallest waterfall, Venezuela's plateaus form a strange and isolated wilderness.

Afghanistan has over 1,400 mineral fields, containing barite, chromite, coal, copper, gold, iron ore, lead, natural gas, petroleum, precious and semi-precious stones, salt, sulfur, talc, and zinc, among many other minerals. Gemstones include high-quality emerald, lapis lazuli, red garnet and ruby. According to a joint study by The Pentagon and the United States Geological Survey, Afghanistan has an estimated value at Int$3 trillion. of untapped minerals. There are six lapis mines in Afghanistan, the largest being located in Badakhshan province. There are around 12 copper mines in the country, including the Aynak copper deposit located in Logar province. Afghanistan's significance from an energy standpoint stems from its geographical position as a transit route for oil, natural gas, and electricity exports from Central Asia to South Asia and the Arabian Sea. This potential includes the construction of the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline gas pipeline. The first Afghan oil production began in late 2012. Overview It is estimated that forty million years ago the tectonic plates of India-Europe, Asia and Africa collided in a massive upheaval. This upheaval created the region of towering mountains that now includes Afghanistan. This diverse geological foundation has resulted in a significant mineral heritage with over 1,400 mineral occurrences recorded to date, including gold, copper, lithium, uranium, iron ore, cobalt, natural gas and oil. Afghanistan's resources could make it one of the richest mining regions in the world. Afghanistan has large untapped energy and mineral resources, which have great potential to contribute to the country's economic development and growth. The major mineral resources include chromium, copper, gold, iron ore, lead and zinc, lithium, marble, precious and semiprecious stones, sulfur and talc among many other minerals. The energy resources consist of natural gas and petroleum. The government was working to introduce new mineral and hydrocarbon laws that would meet international standards of governance. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the British geological survey were doing resource estimation work in the country. Prior to that work, Afghanistan's exploration activity had been conducted by geologists from the Soviet Union who left good- quality geologic records that indicate significant mineral potential. Resource development would require improvements in the infrastructure and security in Afghanistan. The government had awarded contracts to develop the Aynak copper project and the Hajigak iron ore project; in addition, the government could offer tenders for new exploration, including exploration of copper at Balkhab, gold at Badakhshan, gemstones and lithium at nuristan, and oil and gas at sheberghan. The Ministry of Mines drew up its first business reform plan in a bid to create a more accountable and transparent mining industry. Afghanistan joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative as a candidate country. It was expected that after 5 years, the contribution of royalties from mineral production to the revenues of the government would be at least $1.2 billion per year, and that after 15 years, the contribution would increase to $3.5 billion per year.graham-harrison, 2010 Afghanistan has no local ownership requirements and its Constitution does not allow for nationalization. The 20% corporate tax rate was the lowest in the region. Afghanistan's mining industry was at a primitive artisanal stage of development; the operations were all low scale and output was supplied to local and regional markets. The government considered development of the country's mineral resources to be a priority for economic growth, including development of the industrial mineral resources (such as gravel, sand, and limestone for cement) for use by the domestic construction industry. Investment in infrastructure and transportation projects for mining was a critical aspect of developing the mining industry. The government completed Afghanistan's first railway with an investment of $170 million in 2010. The 76-kilometer (km) route link Mazar-i-Sharif to the extensive rail networks in Uzbekistan. The new route would allow Afghan exporters to transport minerals and other goods into Europe. China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) is building a railroad to transport copper ore in Afghanistan from Logar to Kabul. Owing to the lack of mineral production data reported by the miners, information about Afghanistan's mining activities was not readily available, but they appeared to be limited in scope. Production of Barite was estimated by the USGS to be about 2,000 metric tons; chromite, 6,000 tons; and natural gas liquids, 45,000 barrels. In the process of reconstruction and infrastructure development, output of construction minerals was estimated to have increased to meet the domestic requirements. Production of cement increased by 13% compared with that of 2009. Privatization of Afghanistan's state-owned companies, which controlled many of the country's mineral resources, was ongoing but not complete. Investment in the mining sector by private domestic companies and foreign investors was encouraged by the government, which had offered the first contract for development of the Aynak copper project to two Chinese companies in 2007. The government also issued the tenders for the development of the hajigak iron ore project in 2009 and tenders for oil and gas exploration in 2010. The Ministry of Mines is involved in the exploration for and development, exploitation, and processing of minerals and hydrocarbons. The Ministry is also responsible for protecting the ownership and regulating the transportation and marketing of mineral resources in accordance with the country's new laws. Regulations to clarify the country's environmental laws were scheduled for adoption in 2010. History The last mining boom in Afghanistan was over 2,000 years ago in the era of Alexander the Great, when gold, silver and precious stones were routinely mined. Geologists have known of the extent of the mineral wealth for over a century, as a result of surveys done by the British and Russians. An American company was offered a mining concession over the entire country in the 1930s but turned it down. Despite this historical knowledge, global interest was only really boosted in 2010 when the Pentagon commissioned a report from the US Geological Survey (USGS). Historical mining concentrated mostly on precious stone production, with some of the oldest known mines in the world believed to have been established in Afghanistan. Lapis lazuli was being mined in the Badakhshan province of Afghanistan as early as 8000 BC. In ancient Egypt, lapis lazuli was a favorite stone for amulets and ornaments such as scarabs and was used in Egypt's pyramids;Afghan Geological Survey (AGS) which oversees geological scientific research in Afghanistan it was also used in ancient Mesopotamia by the Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians for seals and at neolithic burials in Mehrgarh. During the height of the Indus valley civilization in about 2000 BC, the Harappan colony now known as Shortugai was established near the lapis mines. Lapis jewelry has been found at excavations of the Predynastic Egyptian site Naqada (3300‚Äì3100 BC), and powdered lapis was used as eyeshadow by Cleopatra. In ancient Mesopotamia, Lapis artifacts can be found in great abundance, with many notable examples having been excavated at the Royal Cemetery of Ur (2600-2500 BC). The mine of Aynak's copper has more than 2,000 years of history, from the coins and the tools that were found there. The gold of Zarkashan has more than 2,000 years of history in Ghazni Province. Afghanistan's ruby/spinel mines were mentioned in the Arabic writings of many early travellers, including Istakhri (951 AD), Ibn Haukal (978 AD), al-Ta'Alibi (961‚Äì1038 AD), al-Muqaddasi (ca 10th century), al-Biruni (b. 973; d. ca 1050 AD), Teifaschi (1240 AD), and Ibn Battuta (1325‚Äì1354 AD). The British Empire first initiated resource assessments in Afghanistan in the early nineteenth century as they searched through pioneering exploration and military escapades for countries to dominate as markets and trading partners.Elphinstone, 1815; Shroder, 1983 From the time of their first geological mapping and mineral resource assessments in Afghanistan,Drummond, 1841; Hutton, 1846; Greisbach, 1881, 1887 and on into the twentieth century,Hayden, 1913; Fox, 1943; Gee and Seth, 1940 the British maintained a comprehensive interest in resources of Afghanistan. This was done while also improving their military intelligence on resources and topographic detail that would be needed in the event of any unrest in the machinations of their Great Game face-off against the Russian Empire, and as long as they could maintain their British Raj (rule) of the Indian subcontinent. A number of other nationalities (German, French, Russian) also looked at geology and resources in the country from time to time but nothing much seemed to come of their explorations. Following the third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, Afghanistan won its independence from diplomatic domination by the British and it was not long after that a Soviet publication on mineral \\"riches\\" first appeared,Obruchev, 1927 published by a man who later came to be revered as an early Russian ‚Äòfather‚Äô of geologic studies. Nevertheless, in spite of early attempts by the government of Afghanistan to entice Americans to become engaged in resource discovery and extraction in the country, distance from market, economic concerns, and looming worries about World War II caused rejection of the overtures, much to the discomfiture of the government of Afghanistan. In spite of a number of discoveries by the American geologist Fox (1943) and others, post-war assessment by an American geographerMichel, 1959 concluded shortsightedly that there were no useful resources in Afghanistan about which there should be any diplomatic concern. With its attention on resources accordingly diverted elsewhere for decades to come, the US Department of State thus quite missed the resource ball when in the 1960s and 1970s, as many as ~250 Soviet geoscientists went to work mapping geology in the country while only one American geologist (John Shroder) was in the country, plus a few visiting geology attach√©s from the US Embassy and USGS seismic specialists who visited from time to time.Shroder, 1983; Shroder and Asifi, 1987; Shroder and Watrel, 1992 The resulting Soviet collaboration with the Afghanistan Geological Survey detailed a wide store of mineral resources in the country. The result of this Cold War confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan was that the neighboring USSR was able to fairly easily sidestep or ignore developing resources in Afghanistan until conditions were more to its liking as it consolidated its preeminent position in the country, ultimately leading to its invasion in 1979. With its already dominant roles in the Afghanistan Cartographic Institute, the Afghanistan Geological Survey, and many other ministries, the USSR was in a position in the early 1980s to completely take over all resource extraction in Afghanistan. Indeed, they did pump much natural gas across the northern border of the Amu Darya into the USSR where the gauges to measure delivered volumes were located, and plans were made for development of other resources.Shroder, 1983; Shroder and Assifi, 1987; Shroder and Watrel, 1992 In addition, the Aynak copper deposit near Kabul was investigated in detail and a smelter scheduled for installation in the mid 1980s. In an interesting sidelight of these times in the early 1980s, a Soviet-Afghan convoy from Aynak was assaulted by the Mujahideen and the captured documents that were sent to co-author Shroder by British sources proved that the Aynak copper lode was one of the largest in the world, as proved by a plethora of kilometer-deep boreholes that allowed the Soviets to sample the deposit extensively. The increasing resistance of the Afghan people and the Mujahideen, in the final cumulative battles of the Cold War, precluded significant further development of any resources at that time. Instead the Soviet withdrawal in defeat occurred in 1988-89. The subsequent invasion of Afghanistan by the United States and coalition troops in 2001 began a new phase in the history of Afghanistan, as many old resource projects were assessed again, and new ones were initiated.Shroder, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2009 In 2001, the September 11 attacks in New York led to the United States invasion of Afghanistan. According to Mark Lander and James Risen, in 2007 U.S government sent geologist to explore the mining potential in Afghanistan. Using old Soviet maps of mining location, America created a more precise map of mineral locations. President Trump has agreed to remain in Afghanistan to help mine for minerals because he believes it will be a \\"win-win\\" for both countries.Lander, Mark, and James Risen. ‚ÄúTrump Finds Reason for the U.S. to Remain in Afghanistan: Minerals.‚Äù The New York Times, 25 July 2017 Legal framework A new mining law was passed in 2006 and as of 2006 regulations were being developed to provide the framework for more formal exploration for and mining of minerals. The process of applying for mineral rights was also being revised as of 2006. All minerals located on or under the surface are the exclusive property of the Government, except for hydrocarbons and water, which are regulated under separate laws. The principal role of the Government with respect to minerals is to promote the efficient development of the mineral industry by the private sector. The Ministry of Mines and Industries is responsible for the administration and implementation of the Mining Law. The Law provides investment security to the holder of a mineral right. The Government cannot expropriate mineral rights without adequate compensation in accordance with international norms. The Law also gives the mineral royalty rates, which range from 5% of gross revenue for industrial minerals to up to 10% for gemstones. Other changes in Government policy in 2006 included the legalization of the gemstone trade, Government control of the gemstone industry, and encouragement of investment in mining.Kuo, Chin S. \\"The Mineral Industry of Afghanistan\\". 2006 Minerals Yearbook.

In the past, copper had been mined from Herat Province and Farah Province in the west, Kapisa Province in the east, and Kandahar Province and Zabul Province in the south. As of 2006, interest was focused on the Aynak, the Darband, and the Jawkhar prospects in southeastern Afghanistan. Copper mineralization at Aynak in Logar Province was stratabound and characterized by bornite and chalcopyrite disseminated in dolomite marble and quartz-biotite-dolomite schists of the Loy Khwar Formation. Although a resource of 240 million metric tons at a grade of 2.3% copper had been reported, a number of small ore lenses were potentially not practically and economically minable. Open pit and underground mining would be needed to exploit the main ore body, and other infrastructure problems, such as inadequate power and water, were also likely. The new (2005) Mining Law might favor the development of the deposit by using public tenders. The Government issued a public tender for the deposit in 2006, and expected the granting of concessions in February 2007. Nine mining companies from Australia, China, India, and the United States were interested in the prospect. China Metallurgical Group won the bidding for a copper mining project in Aybak, Samangan, Afghanistan. The bidding process has been criticized by rival Canadian and United States companies alleging corruption and questioning the Chinese company's commitment to the Afghan people.Richard Lardner China taps huge copper reserves in Afghanistan Oct 31, 2009 Associated Press In 2007, a 30-year lease was granted for the development of a copper mine at Mes Aynak in Logar Province to the China Metallurgical Group for $3 billion, making it the biggest foreign investment and private business venture in Afghanistan's history. It is believed to contain the second-largest reserves of copper ore in the world and the deposits are estimated to be worth up to $88 billion. It is also the site of one of Afghanistan's most important archaeological sites and, although there are desperate efforts being made to save as much as possible, the main Buddhist monastery and other remains are due to be bulldozed to make way for the mine. Several new mineral-rich sites, with estimated deposits of about $250 billion, had been found in six other provinces. Launched in 2006, a US Geological Survey (USGS), jointly conducted with the Ministry of Mines, was completed last year. The survey covers 30 percent of the country. \\"The survey provides credible information on mines in 28 different parts of Afghanistan,\\" Wahidullah Shahrani told reporters. It showed the world's largest copper deposits existed in Balkhab district of Sar- e-Pol. The copper mine was discovered near a river, an area which might hold gold reserves as well. The government launched tenders in late 2011 for the Balkhab copper deposit, which had reserves of about 45 Mt of copper. Citing the report, an Afghan government minister said two new copper mines in Logar Province and Herat Province provinces had been discovered. The value of the Logar pit, not the Ainak mine, is estimated at $43 billion. Copper and gold mines worth of $30 billion were discovered in the Zarkasho area of Ghazni and lithium pits of $20 billion in Farah and Nimroz provinces, Shahwani said. A deposit of beryllium, which is lighter than aluminum and stronger than steel used in airplanes, helicopters, ships, missiles, and space craft, has been found in the Khanashin district of southern Helmand province. The reserves are estimated at $88 billion. =Coal= Afghanistan has rich reserves of coking coal, coal is primarily located within a Jurassic belt from the northern provinces of Takhar and Badakhshan through the center of the country and towards the west in Herat, according to Afghan mines ministry. In 2014 however, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor in which Afghanistan appeared to be one of the 74 countries with noticeable incidence of child labor in the coal mining field. =Gemstones= Elbaite from Nangarhar Province Afghanistan is known to have exploited its precious and semi-precious gemstone deposits. These deposits include aquamarine, emerald and other varieties of beryl, fluorite, garnet, kunzite, ruby, sapphire, lapis lazuli, topaz, tourmaline, and varieties of quartz. Corundum deposits (sapphire and ruby) in the country are largely exhausted, and very little gem quality material is found.Graham, Jeffrey Buying Gemstones in Afghanistan Retrieved December 29, 2014 The four main gemstone-producing areas are those of Badakhshan, Jegdalek, Nuristan, and the Panjshir Valley. Artisanal mining of gemstones in the country used primitive methods. Some gemstones were exported illicitly, mostly to India (which was the world's leading import market for colored gemstones and an outlet for higher quality gems) and to the domestic neighboring Pakistan market. =Gold= As of 2006, gold was mined from the Samti placer deposit in Takhar Province in the north by groups of artisanal miners. Badakhshan Province also had occurrences of placer gold deposits. The deposits were found on the western flanks of the mountains in alluvium or alluvial fan in several river valleys, particularly in the Anjir, the Hasar, the Nooraba, and the Panj Valleys. The Samti deposit is located in the Panj River Valley and was estimated to contain between 20 and 25 metric tons of gold. The southern regions of Afghanistan is believed to contain large gold deposits, particularly the Helmand Province. There is an estimated $50 billion in gold and copper deposits in Ghazni province. The Afghan government signed a deal with Afghan Krystal natural Resources Co. (a local company) to invest up to $50 million in the Qara Zaghan Mine in northern Baghlan Province. Qara Zaghan was the country‚Äôs second gold mine, and production there was planned to begin by 2013. The mine‚Äôs gold reserves were not yet known, but the company intended to spend the next 2 years exploring the site. Investors from Indonesia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States were backing the project. The first gold mine was being developed by Westland general trading LLC of the United Arab Emirates at Nor Aaba near the border with Tajikistan in northern Takhar Province. The mine was expected to provide $4 million to $5 million per year in royalties to the government. =Iron ore= The best known and largest iron oxide deposit in Afghanistan is located at Hajigak in Bamyan Province. The deposit itself stretches over 32 km and contains 16 separate zones, up to 5 km in length, 380 m wide and extending 550 m down dip, seven of which have been studied in detail. The ore occurs in both primary and oxidized states. The primary ore accounts for 80% of the deposit and consists of magnetite, pyrite and minor chalcopyrite. The remaining 20% is oxidized and consists of three hematitic ore types. The deposit remained unmined in 2006. The presence of coking coal nearby at Shabashak in the Dar-l-Suf District and large iron ore resources made the deposit viable for future development of an Afghan steel industry. Open pit mining and blast furnace smelting operations were envisioned by an early feasibility study. The Hajigak also includes the unusual niobium, a soft metal used in the production of superconductors. =Lithium= Lithium is a vital metal that is mostly used in the manufacture of rechargeable batteries for mobile phones, laptops and electric cars. It is believed that Afghanistan has plenty of lithium. The country's lithium deposits occur in dry lake beds in the form of lithium chloride; they are located in the western Province of Herat and Nimroz and in the central east Province of Ghazni. The geologic setting is similar to those found in Bolivia and Chile. The deposits are also found in hard rock in the form of spodumene in pegmatites in the north-eastern Provinces of Badakhshan, Nangarhar, Nuristan, and Uruzgan. A pegmatite in the Hindu Kush Mountains in central Afghanistan was reported to contain 20% to 30% spodumene =Marble= Afghanistan also has considerable amount of marble in different parts of the country. There are a number of marble factories in Herat. According to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, current Afghan marble exports are estimated at $15 million per year. With improved extraction, processing, infrastructure, and investment, the industry has the potential to grow into a $450 million per year business.U.S. Embassy, Kabul, Third Afghanistan Marble Conference, May 25, 2011. =Petroleum and natural gas= Afghanistan has 3.8 billion barrels of oil between Balkh and Jawzjan Province in the north of the country. This is an enormous amount for a nation that only consumes 5,000 bbl/day.Energy Statistics; Oil; consumption; Afghanistan (historical data) The United States Geological Survey and the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industry jointly assessed the oil and natural gas resources in northern Afghanistan. The estimated mean volumes of undiscovered petroleum were 1,596 million barrels (Mbbl) of crude oil, 444 billion cubic meters of natural gas, and 562 Mbbl of natural gas liquids. Most of the undiscovered crude oil occurs in the Afghan- Tajik Basin and most of the undiscovered natural gas is located in the Amu Darya Basin. These two basins within Afghanistan encompass areas of approximately 515,000 square kilometers. In December 2011, Afghanistan signed an oil exploration contract with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for the development of three oil fields along the Amu Darya river.Afghanistan signs '$7 bn' oil deal with China Afghanistan will have its first oil refineries within the next three years, after which it will receive 70 percent of the profits from the sale of the oil and natural gas.

The Arrow Rock area was where the historic Santa Fe Trail crossed the Missouri River, and was thus a key stopping point during the settlement of the American West. The historic district was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1963. and Description and history Arrow Rock is named for a stone formation that has been a recognized landmark on the Missouri River since the 18th century, supposedly prized by local Native Americans as a source of stone for tools and weapons. A ferry was established in the area in 1815, providing westward access to settlers passing through Franklin on the eastern bank. In the 1820s this route became known as the Santa Fe Trail, and became a major route by which settlers traveled west. The town of Arrow Rock provided services to these travelers, with a tavern (the still -standing 1834 J. Huston Tavern) and a fresh-water spring among the amenities. By the mid-19th century the town had a population of 1,000. As the trail declined in importance, so did the town's population. Since 1912, Arrow Rock has transformed from a small river town into a major heritage-tourism center thanks to an active historic preservation movement. In 1963 it was recognized as a National Historic Landmark site, in 2006 the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed it as one of its \\"Dozen Distinctive Destination\\" sites, and in 2008 it was recognized as a \\"Preserve America Community.\\" For most of the 20th century, preservation and interpretation activities focused almost exclusively on the upscale white, male components, ignoring the role of the majority population. Beginning in 1996, Arrow Rock redefined has utilized public history and archaeology to emphasize new interpretive programs that Pay much more attention to the African American heritage. Preservationists and historians are eager to involve this previously marginalized descendant community.Timothy E. Baumann, \\"An Historical Perspective of Civic Engagement and Interpreting Cultural Diversity in Arrow Rock, Missouri.\\" Historical Archaeology (2011): 114-134. The historic district includes both the incorporated village of Arrow Rock, and the grounds of the adjacent state historic site, which partly overlap each other. The village includes a significant number of surviving pre-Civil War buildings, including the tavern, a courthouse, jail, and several churches.

While its appearance lends a decorative and ceremonial aspect to the set table, its presence serves both a halakhic and symbolic function. Description A challah cover on a table set for Shabbat Challah covers for sale outside a store in Jerusalem. The enscription on the top cover says \\"To honor Shabbat and Yom Tov\\". The enscription on the bottom says \\"To honor the holy Shabbat\\" Challah covers may be made from any kind of fabric or paper. They are often hand or machine-embroidered, painted, appliqued or tie-dyed. They are sometimes adorned with fringes interwoven with silver or gold thread. The challah cover must be large enough to cover two braided loaves without allowing the bread to be seen through the sides, and opaque enough so that the loaves cannot be seen through the fabric. Store-bought challah covers often bear the inscription ◊ú◊õ◊ë◊ï◊ì ◊©◊ë◊™ ◊ß◊ì◊© (\\"To honor the holy Shabbat\\") or ◊ú◊õ◊ë◊ï◊ì ◊©◊ë◊™ ◊ï◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊ò◊ï◊ë (\\"To honor Shabbat and Yom Tov\\"). Halakhic function At the beginning of a Shabbat or holiday meal, a blessing (Kiddush) must preferably be made over the wine first in order to sanctify the Shabbat.Sefer HaChinuch, Positive Mitzvah #155, This is followed by the blessing over the bread (challah), which begins the meal. However, in the hierarchy of blessings mandated by the Sages,Seder Birkat HaNehenin 10:13. the blessing over bread should precede the blessing over wine. In order to preserve the priority of the wine, and not to \\"shame\\" the bread which should be blessed first,Tur, 271, quoting the Jerusalem Talmud. the bread is ‚Äúremoved‚Äù by concealing it from view with the challah cover. In the absence of a challah cover, one may use a napkin, doily, tissues, or similar covering.Shabbat Laws: Shabbat On-the-Go SymbolismRemembrance of the manna= The placement of the challah under the challah cover and over the Shabbat tablecloth (or over a challah cutting board) also recalls the Biblical scene of the manna which the Israelites ate every day following the Exodus from Egypt. When Moses told the people about the manna, he said that it would fall for them every day of the week. However, in deference to the holiness of Shabbat, the manna would not fall on that day. Instead, two portions of manna would fall on Friday, enough for that day and for the Shabbat (Exodus 16:22-26). This is given as the reason for the use of two braided loaves at Shabbat and holiday meals, as the challot represent the double portion of manna that fell in honor of Shabbat. Each morning the Israelites found the manna in the fields, encased in two layers of dew to preserve its freshness. Rashi describes the way the manna was found: > Thus we see that the dew fell upon the ground and the manna fell upon it, > and then dew fell again upon this, and so it was as though it were carefully > packed in a chest (Rashi on Exodus 16:13, quoting Mechilta, Yoma > 75b).Silbermann Chumash. Thus, we place the challot beneath a challah cover and over a tablecloth (or challah board) to recreate the miracle of the manna at our own Shabbat tables.Tosafot, Pesachim 100b. History Old challah cover, Boryslav, Poland abt. 1930 In Talmudic times, food was served to banquet guests on three-legged trays rather tables. These trays were brought to each guest by waiters. On Shabbat, the trays would be brought out only after the Kiddush, to show that the meal was being served in honor of the Shabbat, which had just been sanctified by the recital of the Kiddush.Pesachim 100b. Today, observers set the table with the challah, but cover it until the time when it would have been carried in, in Talmudic times. This demonstrates that the meal only begins after -- and because of -- the Kiddush.Tosafot, Pesachim 100b. Covering the challah so as not to \\"shame\\" it while the wine is being blessed has been cited as an object lesson for the importance of not shaming one's fellow humans. The following story is told about Rabbi Yisroel Salanter:Shabbat Shalom: Parshat Mishpatim by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin > Rabbi Yisroel was once stranded in Kovno for Shabbat. Everyone wanted to > host him, but he chose to spend the Shabbat at the home of a baker who had > no children to feed, so he would not take away anyone's portion of food. The > baker was an observant Jew but hardly a man of intelligence. As he ushered > his esteemed guest into his house, he shouted at his wife, \\"Why are the > challahs not covered? How many times must I remind you to cover the > challahs?\\" The poor woman, recognizing her distinguished guest, hurried to > cover the challahs with tears in her eyes. When the baker asked Rabbi > Yisroel to do the honors by reciting the Kiddush, the Rabbi first asked him, > \\"Can you tell me why we cover the challahs?\\" \\"Of course,\\" replied the baker. > \\"Every child knows the answer. When there are many different foods on the > table, the first blessing is always made over the bread, after which no > other blessing need be made. On Friday night, however, the first blessing > has to be made over the wine. In order not to shame the challah, who expects > the blessing to be made over her, we must cover her over until after the > sanctification of the wine.\\" Rabbi Yisroel looked at the baker > incredulously. \\"Why do your ears not hear what your mouth is saying?\\" he > asked. \\"Do you think that our Jewish tradition does not understand that a > piece of dough has no feelings and would never become embarrassed? > Understand that our laws are trying to sensitize us to the feelings of human > beings, our friends, our neighbors, and especially our wives!\\" Matzo covers At the Passover seder, the matzos are also covered. Matzo covers differ from challah covers in that they can contain three \\"pockets\\" into which the three matzos (set out at the beginning of the Seder) are inserted. According to the Gemara, matzo is called lechem oni (poor man's bread);Pesachim 36a. the Hebrew word oni (◊¢◊ï◊†◊ô) can also be construed as \\"answers,\\" yielding, \\"bread upon which answers are spoken.\\"Beit Yosef. Thus, the matzos are uncovered during the telling of the story of the Jews' servitude in Egypt. However, when the wine cups are raised to express praise to God for the redemption, the matzos are covered so that they will not be \\"shamed\\", as one is giving preference to the wine.Gelbard, Shmuel Pinchas (2000).

Azerbaijan's importance as a world mineral producer, however, was based on its petroleum extracting industry. The country has been a significant oil producer for more than a century, but recent focus has been on developing offshore resources in the Caspian Sea. Production from the country‚Äôs Soviet-era fields are in decline, but since independence, foreign direct investment in offshore fields had revitalized the oil sector through the development of large-scale new projects and the refurbishment of older ones. In 2005, Azerbaijan had signed more than 20 major agreements to develop oilfields with approximately 30 companies from 15 countries.Richard M. Levine and Glenn J. Wallace. \\"The Mineral Industries of the Commonwealth of Independent States\\". 2005 Minerals Yearbook. U.S. Geological Survey (December 2007). This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the public domain. Oil extraction and refining accounted for more than 75% of the value of industrial production. The oil extraction and refining sectors and the metallurgy and metal fabrication sectors employed more than 60,000 people in 2005. The country was becoming a major producer of oil, producing far more than it consumed, but its natural gas production in 2005 was still significantly below its consumption. The country was increasing its steel products production at the Baku Steel company, a privately owned company that produced steel products from steel scrap. Production In 2005, production increased for practically all mineral commodities. Crude petroleum production increased by more than 43% compared with that of 2004. The country was developing its steel industry, although it is still on a small scale. Trade Fuels accounted for 76% of the value of exports in 2005. The country‚Äôs major export was crude petroleum, almost all of which was sold on world markets rather than supplied to other CIS countries. Other mineral exports included petroleum refinery products and alumina. The country imported a variety of mineral commodities, including natural gas. Mineral resources Azerbaijan‚Äôs major mineral wealth is its oil and gas reserves. Offshore hydrocarbon structures in the Caspian Sea accounted for most of the country‚Äôs oil and gas production. Azerbaijan‚Äôs proven crude oil reserves were estimated to range from 7 billion to 13 billion barrels (Gbbl) [or from about 950 million metric tons (Mt) to 1.8 billion metric tons (Gt)] based on various industry journals and Government sources. The State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) has estimated that proven reserves are 17.5 Gbbl (about 2.4 Gt) using the Soviet reserve classification system. This evaluation was not based on market economy criteria and may include resources that are not economically viable. Estimates of natural gas reserves also vary. According to the Oil & Gas Journal, Azerbaijan has proven natural gas reserves of roughly 30 trillion cubic feet (about 850 billion cubic meters, and BP p.l.c. estimates that the country has 48 trillion cubic feet (about 1.4 trillion cubic meters) of proven gas reserves. Outlook Although some effort has been made to promote balanced mineral development of all the country‚Äôs mineral resources, the country‚Äôs economic development has depended primarily on the development of its large offshore oil and gas resources. These resources are expected to be the country‚Äôs chief source of revenue for the coming decades. In 2004, Azerbaijan exported approximately of oil. Exports are expected to more than double to in 2006 and to reach as high as by 2008. Azerbaijan was a net natural gas importer in 2005. The country is expected to become a significant gas exporter following the development of the Shah Deniz natural gas deposit, which is considered to be one of the world‚Äôs largest natural gas field discoveries of the past 20 years. According to BP (the project operator), Shah Deniz has potential recoverable reserves of about 15 trillion cubic feet (about 424 billion cubic meters) of natural gas and ‚Äîabout 82 Mt] of condensate. Other industry and trade sources have estimated that the field contains as much as of gas. The field is being developed by the Shah Deniz consortium, whose members include BP, LukAgip, National Iranian Oil Company (NICO) International, SOCAR, Statoil ASA of Norway, TotalFinaElf, and T√ºrkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortaklig (TPAO) of Turkey. In the first phase of the Shah Deniz field‚Äôs development, production of natural gas for export was expected to begin in late 2006. In the second phase, according to BP, the Shah Deniz project could produce an additional per year of natural gas by as early as 2015. Although Azerbaijan lacks any infrastructure for the export of natural gas, efforts were underway to secure export routes and customers for gas deliveries beginning in 2006. The main conduit for Azerbaijan‚Äôs natural gas exports would be the South Caucasus Pipeline, also known as Baku-Tbilisi- Erzurum, which would run parallel to the Baku-T‚Äôbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline for most of its route before connecting to the Turkish gas pipeline network near the town of Horasan in Turkey. Pipeline construction began in late 2004 and was scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of 2007. The pipeline was expected to carry per year initially; this volume could be increased later to up to per year with the future addition of compression stations. With the new pipeline infrastructure in place, Shah Deniz would be capable of producing approximately per year of natural gas by 2009. Supplies of natural gas from Shah Deniz and associated gas from the Azeri Chirag Gunashli (AGC) and the Bakhar-2 projects are expected to make Azerbaijan self-sufficient in natural gas and to result in significant export revenues.

It is a venue for conferences, exhibitions, entertainment, live music and events on the Yorkshire Coast. Originally built around the source of Scarborough's spa waters, it is owned by Scarborough Borough Council and is managed by Sheffield International Venues. The Spa has a Grand Hall, which seats nearly 2,000 and hosts live entertainment including the Scarborough Spa Orchestra and the annual Scarborough Jazz Festival. The Spa Theatre, a 600-seat Victorian theatre, is home to summer season shows and Christmas pantomimes. The Spa Ocean Room is used for dances, conferences and other events, including the Scarborough Jazz Festival and Coastival. The Victorian Cliff Tramway links the Spa complex with South Cliff, 200 ft above the South Bay. History17th century= Dicky Dickinson, Governor of Scarborough Spaw In the 17th century, spa waters were discovered by Thomasin Farrer, the wife of one of Scarborough's leading citizens, John Farrer. She found natural spring water bubbling out beneath the cliff to the south of the town. The waters, which stained the rocks a russet colour, tasted slightly bitter and were said to cure minor ailments. She told her friends and neighbours about the medicinal effects and drinking the spa waters became an accepted medicine. Later, thousands of visitors flocked to benefit from their supposed medicinal qualities. The southern part of Scarborough became popular. The precursor to the present Scarborough Spa complex became a fashionable attraction. =18th century= Eighteenth century of Scarborough, showing the \\"spaws\\" in the left foreground The first Spaw House (a term used until the early 19th century) was built on or near the site in the early 1700s, and Dicky Dickinson, a great character, was appointed its governor. The house, a wooden structure where the waters were sold and dispensed, provided basic amenities to visitors eager to try their curative effects. The water was also bottled and sold further afield. By the mid-1700s, Scarborough was established as a seaside resort and a spa town, with horse racing on the beach, boating and sea-bathing. Scarborough was one of the first places to use bathing machines. In 1737, a major cliff fall obliterated the house and the wells. Within five weeks, the wells were uncovered. Then, two distinct types of water, both said to have their own particular restorative or health-giving powers, were evident. The speed at which the wells were reinstated after such a catastrophe shows their importance to the town. In 1739, a sizeable building or saloon with views over the sea was constructed, and the wells were accessed by a long flight of stairs. = 19th century= Nineteenth century strollers in front of the Spa Disasters that befell the spa in the 1800s were countered by stylish new buildings and facilities showing its importance and popularity. In 1827, the Cliff Bridge opened, improving access, and was a foretaste of ambitious plans. The Gothic Saloon designed by Henry Wyatt opened in 1839 and had a concert hall, a garden, promenade and external area for orchestral concerts. By the time it opened, the Gothic Saloon, an impressive turreted building, was too small. Joseph Paxton, the landscape gardener and architect responsible for the grounds at Chatsworth House, designed the complex that opened in 1858. It comprised a central assembly hall with adjoining galleries and outside, the sea wall was extended to encompass a double promenade and carriage road, a colonnade with shops, an open air bandstand and the prospect tower. The Spa became the most popular music hall venue outside London. In 1875, the first cliff tram in England was built to provide additional access; it remains in use today. On 8 September 1876, the Spa saloon was destroyed by fire, but no time was lost in rebuilding it and by June 1879, the new Grand Hall was open to the public, with the formal opening ceremony taking place on 2 August 1880. =20th century= The Scarborough Spa Orchestra, the last surviving professional seaside orchestra, give a concert of light music (August 2009) Visitors to the Spa can see the architecture of the 1880s and the scale and style of its Grand Hall. Additions and alterations have been made, and a major restoration programme was carried out in the early 1980s to reinstate some original features and decorative styles. The Spa includes the Spa Theatre, Grand Hall for concerts, Ocean Room, Promenade Lounge and Sun Court for open air concerts cafes and bars. From the colonnade shops to the Cliff Lift, the complex is nearly half a mile in length and can accommodate conferences of 2,000 or more delegates. Actors that have visited the Spa or have been filmed here include Helena Bonham-Carter and Rick Mayall in Dancing Queen and Ewan McGregor and Jane Horrocks were filmed in the Sun Court for Little Voice. By the 1880s, the importance of music and entertainment was beginning to surpass interest in the spa waters. Their chemical composition altered over the years, and public consumption ceased in the late 1960s. Current health and safety legislation prohibits public access to what remains of the well, which is located beneath the island, opposite the shops. Spa Bridge Spa Bridge The Spa was accessible by a walk along the South Bay seafront for visitors to Scarborough Castle, Scarborough Harbour, and other attractions near the town centre, but there was a steep descent to the seafront from St Nicholas Cliff. In 1826, the Cliff Bridge Company leased the Spa from the corporation; to maximise the number of paying customers erected, an iron footbridge to span the valley from St Nicholas Cliff to the Spa. It was 75 ft above the valley and 414 ft long and 13.5 ft wide. The bridge opened on 19 July 1827, and crowds flocked to see a mail coach and horses gallop at full speed across it. The bridge became a fashionable promenade and provided views and a link from the town centre. It proved so popular that a toll booth was put up at the St Nicholas Cliff end. Season tickets were sold giving access to the bridge and Spa for one, two or four weeks.

Today, Georgia's mineral industry produces manganese, copper and various types of quarried stone. Although the Georgian economy has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, growth in the mining and metallurgical sector has lagged behind that of the overall economy. History Metal mining in Georgia started with copper in the 6th-5th millennia B.C. Gold mining has also been conducted in Georgia since ancient times. One interpretation of the legend of the Golden Fleece supposedly held in ancient Georgia relates it to the local method of placer mining with sheep fleece to find gold. Pliny the Elder attributed the beginning of mining in western Georgia to King Saulaces of Colchis, who initiated gold and silver mining in Svaneti. Georgians in antiquity also produced iron, copper, brass, and bronze. By the seventeenth century, silver mines remained a major source of wealth for Georgia, particularly in Imereti, while copper mining flourished in Kartli in the early eighteenth century. During the Soviet period, a range of minerals was mined in Georgia, which included arsenic, barite, bentonite, coal, copper, diatomite, lead, manganese, zeolite, and zinc, among others. Most of these commodities were still being produced in 2005, although in lesser quantities. The country had been a major producer of high-grade manganese ore for about a century, although ore reserves were being depleted. Part of the manganese was used within Georgia for ferroalloy production. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the level of mineral production in Georgia declined sharply. Although production in the mineral industry was reviving in 2005, Georgia did not produce any mineral products in quantities that would be of more than regional significance.Richard M. Levine and Glenn J. Wallace. \\"The Mineral Industries of the Commonwealth of Independent States\\". 2005 Minerals Yearbook. U.S. Geological Survey (December 2007). This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the public domain. Georgia's main role in the world mineral supply was to serve as a transport route for oil and gas shipments out of the Caspian region to world markets. Three of the new large oil and gas export pipelines that had been or were being constructed in the Caspian region pass through Georgia. These three are the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan, the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum, and the Baku-Supsa (‚ÄúWestern Early Oil Route‚Äù) pipelines. No routes were planned to cross Armenia owing to Azerbaijan's troubled relationship with the country. Industry structure In 2005, Georgia had 148 enterprises that were involved in mining and quarrying out of a total of 4,632 industrial enterprises, which comprised 3.2% of the total number of industrial enterprises. Seven of these 148 enterprises were state owned and the rest were private. In 2005, the labor force involved in mining and quarrying totaled 8,600 out of a total industrial labor force of 94,300, or 8.6% of the industrial labor force. State-owned mining and quarrying enterprises employed 5,700 people and private enterprises employed 2,900 people. Mining and quarrying contributed 10.4% of the total value of industrial production in 2005. Of the total value of output for mining and quarrying, state-owned enterprises produced about one-third of the value of output, and the remaining two-thirds was produced by privately owned enterprises. Of the total value of industrial capital stock, mining and quarrying enterprises accounted for 3.4% of the value. Trade Georgia exported a large percentage of its major mineral products. These products included copper ores and concentrates, ferroalloys produced from domestically produced manganese ore, and nitrogenous fertilizers. The country also exported significant quantities of ferrous scrap and waste. Georgia's major mineral imports were oil and gas. Mineral resources Georgia has more than 300 explored mineral deposits, only about half of which have been brought into production. For the past 100 years, the manganese ore deposits near the town of Chiatura have represented a significant source of manganese ore production. Chiatura ores supplied the county's Zestafoni ferroalloys plant. The Chiatura deposit's resources were estimated to be 215 Mt of manganese ore, of which about half has been depleted. The country has 11 explored oilfields with reportedly 28 Mt of oil resources; larger oilfields are also thought to exist. Georgia reportedly has more than 400 Mt of coal resources. The Black Sea coast in Adjaria is thought to contain large gasfields with 8.5 billion cubic meters of resources already explored and potential resources estimated to be 125 billion cubic meters. The country also has resources of arsenic, barite, copper, diatomite, dimension stone, marble, and lead-zinc, as well as raw materials for producing cement. Important deposits include the Askana bentonite clay deposit in Ozurgeti, the Kisatibi diatomite deposit in the Akhaltsikhe District, the Kvaisa zinc deposit in the Java district, the Lukhumi arsenic deposit in the Ambrolauri district, and the Madneuli polymetallic (barite, copper, lead-zinc, pyrite, silver, sulfur, gold bearing quartzites) deposits in the Bolnisi region. Outlook Georgia's major revenues from minerals are expected to derive from its role as a transport route for Caspian Sea hydrocarbons. Oilfield and gasfield development could take place off the Black Sea shelf as a number of major international companies are assessing the region's production potential. Only two mining enterprises are operating in Georgia‚Äîthe Chiatura manganese enterprise and the Madneueli polymetallic mining enterprise. Both had previously lacked investment resources to introduce modern technology that would enable them to produce near their potential. In 2005, however, a joint venture of Austrian, Georgian, and Russian bidders reportedly won the privatization tender for the manganese mining enterprise for $132 million, and Stanton Equities Corporation reportedly won a privatization bid for a gold mine at Madneuli.

Kazakhstan ranks second to Russia among the countries of the CIS in its quantity of mineral production. It is endowed with large reserves of a wide range of metallic ores, industrial minerals, and fuels, and its metallurgical sector is a major producer of a large number of metals from domestic and imported raw materials. In 2005, its metal mining sector produced bauxite, chromite, copper, iron, lead, manganese, and zinc ores, and its metallurgical sector produced such metals as beryllium, bismuth, cadmium, copper, ferroalloys, lead, magnesium, rhenium, steel, titanium, and zinc. The country produced significant amounts of other nonferrous and industrial mineral products, such as alumina, arsenic, barite, gold, molybdenum, phosphate rock, and tungsten. The country was a large producer of mineral fuels, including coal, natural gas, oil, and uranium.Richard M. Levine and Glenn J. Wallace. \\"The Mineral Industries of the Commonwealth of Independent States\\". 2005 Minerals Yearbook. U.S. Geological Survey (December 2007). This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the public domain. The country's economy is heavily dependent on the production of minerals. Output from Kazakhstan's mineral and natural resources sector for 2004 accounted for 74.1% of the value of industrial production, of which 43.1% came from the oil and gas condensate extraction. In 2004, the mineral extraction sector accounted for 32% of the GDP, employed 191,000 employees, and accounted for 33.1% of capital investment and 64.5% of direct foreign investment, of which 63.5% was in the oil sector. Kazakhstan's mining industry is estimated at US$29.5 billion by 2017. Environment Kazakhstan faces a number of environmental challenges, including industrial pollution, land degradation and desertification, and contamination from its former role in nuclear weapons development and testing in the Semipalatinsk region. Significant improvements in the environmental situation of the northern Aral Sea area has been made owing to dam construction and river flow regulation. Structure Kazakhstani law holds that no sector of the economy is fully closed to investors, and, in 2005, a large number of Kazakhstan's mineral production enterprises had significant foreign ownership. In 2005, the government also maintained ownership in a number of mineral production enterprises; the percentage of ownership varied depending on the enterprise. Despite being open to foreign investment and even listed on Western stock exchanges, the ownership structure of some major mineral producing enterprises was not entirely transparent. Trade In 2005, fuel and oil products comprised 69% of the value of exports. Ferrous and nonferrous metals were other significant export products. The value of commodity exports from the mineral extraction sectors increased considerably in 2005, owing to an increase in the price of oil and other mineral commodities. Kazakhstan exports minerals to Russia, China, the United States, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, South Korea, UAE. Mineral Resources Kazakhstan's mineral resource base is characterized by a large number of oilfields and gasfields and by a large variety of mineral resources. The country ranks among the world's leading countries in its reserves of chromite, wolfram, lead, zinc, manganese, silver and uranium. It also has significant reserves of bauxite, copper, gold, iron ore, coal, natural gas and petroleum. According to data reported from Kazakhstan, the country is one of the 10 leading countries in the world for a significant number of mineral resources. Within the CIS (based on the reserve classification system that was used in the Soviet Union and then by many of its successor states), Kazakhstan ranked first in its reserves of chromite and lead, possessing 97% and 38%, respectively, of all CIS reserves. The country ranked second in manganese, nickel, oil, phosphate rock, silver, and zinc, and third in coal, gas, gold, and tin. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan has been perceived globally as a supplier of mineral commodities, which include oil, nonferrous metals, and uranium. Kazakhstan has been developing a rich mineral resource endowment. Intensive raw materials production and exports have helped the economy to overcome economic crises and ensured high rates of economic growth during the past 3 years. The economy of Kazakhstan has been growing owing to the state policy of attracting foreign investment into its extraction industries. Kazakhstan was the first CIS country assigned with investment sovereign rating, and the World Bank has listed Kazakhstan among the 20 most attractive countries for investment. As a small economy with large fuel and mineral resources, however, Kazakhstan has not been particularly attractive for investment in the manufacturing sector, which makes the country highly vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices. In view of the danger of the economy not using effectively the excess profits from the extracting sectors and foreseeing a possible negative effect from a sharp downfall of oil prices, the government established the National Fund to accumulate surplus oil revenues. The revenues in the Fund are to be used for the overall development of the national economy. The establishment of the Fund drew on the experience of the Government Pension Fund of Norway.Roman Vakulchuk and Indra Overland (2018) ‚ÄòKazakhstan: Civil Society and Natural Resource Policy in Kazakhstan‚Äô, in Indra Overland (ed.) Public Brainpower: Civil Society and Natural Resource Management, Cham: Palgrave, pp. 143‚Äì162. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320657015 =Chromium= Kazakhstan is world's second ranked chromite producer, after South Africa. Production was centered in the Aqtobe region of northwestern Kazakhstan at the Khromtau complex. Chromite production was significantly expanding with the aid of Western investment. London-based Oriel Resources Plc acquired 100% of the Voskhod chromite project in February 2005 and, based on the positive results of a feasibility study, planned to fast-track development of the Voskhod project. Discovered in 1963, the Voskhod chromite deposit lies within the Khromtau District of the Aqtobe Region. Although surrounded by a group of existing mines, it had never been worked. The ore grade reportedly averages 48% Cr2O3 with concentrate upgraded to 57% Cr2O3. Production from Voskhod was expected to be 900,000 t/yr; production would begin in 2008 and continue for 14 years. The Voskhod Mine was projected to be one of the world's leading suppliers of high-grade chromite. Oriel subsequently was awarded an extension to the Voskhod contract license area to include the Karaagash deposit which has, according to the former Soviet reserve classification system, C2 and P1 classified resources of some 7.8 Mt. Assuming positive results of a confirmatory drilling program, these resources could extend mining beyond Voskhod's projected 20-year life. =Copper= Kazakhmys plc, which was the firm that controlled most copper mining and metal production in the country, was engaged in a number of projects to ensure growth in the short term and provide for reserve replacement in the longer term. The majority of these projects was expected to begin production in the near or medium term and would include both new mine development and expansion of existing mines. The new mines included the Artemovskoye (which was part of the East Region complex), which was completed ahead of schedule and had the capacity to produce 28,000 t/yr of copper and 98,000 t/yr of zinc; the Zhaman-Aybat (which was part of the Zhezkazgan mining-metallurgical complex), which was under construction and has reserves of 75.3 Mt of ore that contains 1.069 Mt of copper; and the Aktogay (which was part of the Balkhash mining-metallurgical complex), which was being evaluated for development of an open pit to mine that was expected to produce 1.614 Gt of ore at an average grade of 0.36% copper, or 5.810 Mt of copper. Expansion of existing mines would include that of the East Saryoba underground mine (which was part of the Zhezkazgan complex), the Akbastau and the Kosmurun Mines (which were part of the East Region complex), and the Taksura open pit (which was part of the North Mine). =Lead and Zinc= Kazzinc JSC operated most of the country's lead and zinc mining and metallurgical enterprises. It also produced copper and precious metals. It employed about 22,000 people in mining, beneficiation, metallurgy, power generation, and auxiliary production. The company was established in 1997 through the merger of eastern Kazakhstan's three main nonferrous metals companies‚ÄîLeninogorsk (now Ridder) Polymetallic complex, Ust-Kamenogorsk Lead and Zinc complex, and Zyryanovsk Lead Complex. The controlling block of shares in Kazzinc was sold by the state to the private sector, with Glencore International AG of Switzerland becoming the company's main investor. In addition to Kazzinc, ZAO Yuzhpolimetal Corp. produced about 60,000 t/yr of lead metal from its Shymkent lead plant; and Kazakhmys produced more than 20,000 t/yr of zinc metal at the Balkhash zinc plant (Notarov, 2005). Kazzinc's development strategy called for it to join the ranks of the world's leading producers of lead and zinc. Almost all Kazakhstan's lead and zinc production was exported, which placed Kazakhstan already among the world's leading lead and zinc exporting countries. In 2005, Kazakhstan's lead and zinc producing enterprises were operating below capacity. The Ust-Kamenogorsk complex had the capacity to produce more than 150,000 t/yr of lead and 240,000 t/yr of zinc; the Ridder complex, 25,000 t/yr of lead and 110,000 t/yr of zinc; and the Balkhash zinc plant, 100,000 t/yr of zinc. The Shymkent lead plant was working far below capacity owing to a lack of raw material. Kazzinc mined lead-zinc ores from the Maeeyevskoye, the Ridder-Sokol‚Äônoye, and the Tishinskoye deposits, and processed lead and zinc at the Ridder and the Ust- Kamenogorsk complexes. Plans called for beginning mining in 2006 at the Shaimreden deposit in Kustanay oblast, which would enable Kazzinc to produce an additional 60,000 t/yr of zinc (Notarov, 2005). In the fourth quarter of 2004, Kazzinc began production at the new Shubinsky mining subsidiary, which would operate the Shubinsky underground mine in the vicinity of Ridder. Reserves at the Shubinskoe deposit were estimated to be 1.5 Mt of lead-zinc and copper ores. =Petroleum= Kazakhstan has the Caspian Sea region's largest recoverable crude oil reserves. In 2005, its production accounted for almost two-thirds of the approximately 2 Mbbl/d that was produced by CIS countries in the Caspian region. The country was poised to become an even more significant supplier to world oil markets in the next decade. Kazakhstan produced approximately 1.29 Mbbl/d of oil in 2005 and consumed 222,000 Mbbl/d, resulting in net exports of more than 1 Mbbl/d. The Kazakhstan Government projected increasing production levels to about 3.5 Mbbl/d by 2015, which would come mainly from production of about 1 Mbbl/d from the to-be-developed offshore Kashagan field, 700,000 Mbbl/d from the onshore Tengiz field, 600,000 Mbbl/d from the to-be-developed onshore Kurmangazy field, and 500,000 Mbbl/d from the onshore Karachaganak field. The remainder would come from the development of smaller fields. Major growth would come from an approximately 75% increase in production from the Tengiz field and by development of the Kashagan field, which would add an additional 1 Mbbl/d after 2010. =Uranium= Kazakhstan was the top country in the world in volume of uranium production. The company Kazatomprom was the fourth ranked uranium producer in the world as of 2009. Approximately one-fifth of the world's uranium reserves are located in Kazakhstan. Total resources of uranium are more than 1.5 Mt, and more than 1.1 Mt can be mined by in situ leaching. Kazakhstan has an expanding uranium mining sector, producing about 24,000 tonnes of uranium in 2016, but then reducing slightly.http://lenta.inform.kz/en/uranium-production- in-kazakhstan-to-decline-in-2017_a3003311 At the Stepnogorsk mining and chemical complex, which was Kazatomprom's main production enterprise, plans called for increasing production by expanding the volumes of uranium production in Mining Group No. 1, further developing the Vostok field, and completing development of the Zvezdnoye field. Outlook The large predicted oil resources of the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian shelf will require a significant amount of investment to develop. The required cumulative investment could be as much as $160 billion, of which about $10 billion would be for the initial stage of exploration, including field appraisal. Western companies already have invested more than $7 billion. A constraint to obtaining investment funds to develop the Caspian shelf is the lack of resolution of the territorial status of the Caspian Sea in regards to the demarcation lines and the ownership rights of the bordering states. This issue may have been partially resolved, however, with the agreement between Kazakhstan and Russia to partition the seafloor of the Caspian along the midline between the two countries. Similar agreements have been concluded between Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and between Azerbaijan and Russia. Also, in the energy sector, Kieltyka will play an increasingly important role as one of the world's main suppliers of uranium. Although Kazakhstan has adequate lead and zinc reserves to allow it to expand production through the next decade, expansion will depend on Kazakhstan's companies being able to acquire financing and the participation of foreign firms in developing large lead and zinc deposits. Moreover, Kazakhstan is facing a critical depletion of its minerals. The fields discovered by Soviet geologists have been developed too intensely in the last decades, while geological exploration has not yet covered all the promising areas. Kazakhstan is facing inability to restock the depleted reserves and the tendency is worsening. The depletion of reserves of many of main minerals greatly exceeds the speed of their growth after exploration. Reserves increase in case of some metals (iron, manganese, gold, zinc) due mainly through re-evaluation and additional exploration of the already discovered fields. However, the existing registered reserves of recently discovered copper and gold fields have low quality and cannot be considered equivalent to the depleted reserves. References .

Sunderland completed his trip after 13 months and 1 day at sea on July 15, 2009 at age 17. The record was previously held by Australian David Dicks, and was surpassed on August 27, 2009 by Michael Perham of England. Sunderland is the youngest American to complete a circumnavigation, surpassing Brian Caldwell, who finished in 1996 at age 20. However, Sunderland's record was not recognized by Guinness World Records, or by the World Sailing Speed Record Council. In 2010, one of Sunderland's younger sisters, Abby Sunderland, attempted the feat. She was forced to call off her attempt after her boat was damaged in a storm in the Indian Ocean. In 2011, Sunderland and his father Laurence participated in the 19th season of The Amazing Race. They ended up in 6th place out of 11 teams and were eliminated in Copenhagen, Denmark. Early life The oldest of Marianne and Laurence Sunderland's eight children, Sunderland's first home was a Tradewind sailboat. His family sailed in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Mexico. His shipwright father bought a Aleutian and the family made a three-year cruise of California's Channel Islands, Baja California and mainland Mexico. Voyage When Sunderland decided to attempt the circumnavigation, he purchased a Islander for $6,000, using all of his savings. With his father's assistance, he retrofitted the boat for the trip. Sunderland planned to complete his voyage in April 2009 with a maximum time of 18 months. He continued his schooling while sailing, saying, \\"I have all my books with me.

Sailing route WSSRC not ratified The World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC), the world sailing authority, complimented Sunderland on his achievement but did not ratify it and further stated that the route did not meet the requirements for a circumnavigation voyage. According to John Reed, Secretary to the WSSRC, Sunderland used an engine at various times during the attempt, stopped, had assistance and did not sail around Cape Horn. However, the American Sailing Association has ratified it, using less strict rules, just \\"circumnavigating alone\\". Honors On September 19, 2009, Sunderland was Grand Marshal of the 14th annual Route 66 Parade in Duarte, California. On December 12, he was Grand Marshal of the 2009 Marina del Rey Holiday Boat Parade in Marina del Rey, California.

Based on the novel Pollyanna (1913) by Eleanor H. Porter, the film was written and directed by David Swift. The film won Hayley Mills an Academy Juvenile Award. It was the last film of actor Adolphe Menjou. Pollyanna was Hayley Mills' first film in the series of six for Disney. Plot Pollyanna, a 12-year-old orphaned daughter of missionaries, arrives in the small town of Harrington to live with her rich and strict aunt, Polly Harrington, in the 1900s. Pollyanna is a very cheerful, talkative and radically optimistic youngster who focuses on the goodness of life and always finds something to be glad about, no matter the situation. In doing so, Pollyanna's positive outlook on everything results in her making a wide variety of friends in the community, including the hypochondriac and grouchy Mrs. Snow and the acidic recluse Mr. Pendergast. Aunt Polly's wealth controls most of the town. When the citizens want a derelict orphanage razed and rebuilt, Aunt Polly opposes the idea, arguing that her father donated the building to the town and, as such, it is an important landmark. The townspeople defy her by planning a carnival to raise funds for a new structure. Because of the control Aunt Polly asserts over every facet of the town, however, many people feel reluctant to show their support. A group of citizens led by Dr. Edmond Chilton, Aunt Polly's ex-boyfriend, tries to persuade the town's minister, Rev. Ford, to publicly declare his support for the bazaar by reminding him that \\"nobody owns a church.\\" Rev. Ford is reminded of the truth of that statement when Pollyanna delivers a note from Aunt Polly with recommendations to his sermon content. At church the following Sunday, having gained the gumption to defy Aunt Polly, Rev. Ford first reads one of the so-called \\"Glad Passages\\" of the Bible stating that a young member of the congregation pointed out how many such passages there are. He intends to read one a week from now on, and then declares his support for the bazaar and encourages all to attend. Aunt Polly becomes furious about their audacity, forbidding Pollyanna to participate. On the evening of the carnival, Pollyanna is locked in her attic bedroom by Aunt Polly, but is \\"rescued\\" by playmate and fellow orphan Jimmy Bean, who reminds her that she will lead \\"America the Beautiful\\" at the high point of the event. With Jimmy's help, she slips away and has a wonderful time at the carnival, winning a doll. Upon returning home, she avoids Aunt Polly by climbing a tree to her attic bedroom. When trying to reach her bedroom window, she drops her new doll; Pollyanna then falls off the window ledge, screaming and is knocked unconscious before being discovered by Aunt Polly and her maids. After realizing her legs are paralyzed and that she may not walk again, Pollyanna develops severe depression, jeopardizing her chance of recovery. Meanwhile, Aunt Polly feels extreme guilt when she realizes how her behavior has isolated her from the town and Pollyanna. While talking to Dr. Chilton, she admits that her niece needed love and it was something she never gave her. Dr. Chilton tells Aunt Polly that they can give Pollyanna the love together and help mend the isolation she put on the townsfolk. When the townspeople learn of Pollyanna's accident, they arrive at Aunt Polly's house with outpourings of love. Dr. Chilton carries the reluctant girl downstairs, where, one by one, the neighbors wish her health. Pollyanna's spirit gradually returns to its usual hopefulness and love of life, and she also learns that Jimmy has been adopted by Mr. Pendergast. Pollyanna is embraced by her aunt before they leave Harrington with Dr. Chilton for an operation in Baltimore, which will correct her injury.

Production notesDevelopment= The novel had been filmed before, notably with Mary Pickford in 1920 and by the late 1950s was still selling 35,000 copies a year. In June 1959 Disney announced he would make the film with Hayley Mills, Jane Wyman and Karl Malden, with David Swift to write and direct.2 PRODUCERS CITED FOR ACHIEVEMENT New York Times 6 June 1959: 13. Swift was best known at the time for his work in television. \\"It was the first time anyone would take a $2.5 million chance on me,\\" he said. \\"Trust Disney to do it.\\" =Casting= Disney cast Mills after seeing her in Tiger Bay. He watched this because he wanted to see the most recent performance by John Mills, who was going to be in Swiss Family Robinson for Disney; Hayley was also in the film, and Disney ended up offering her the lead in Pollyanna. Her accent was explained by turning Pollyanna's parents into missionaries from the British West Indies. Disney said the cast was the most important in the studio's history, including names such as Wyman, Malden, and Richard Egan.Free-Lancers Top 'Best' Disney Cast: 'Pollyanna' Players Select; 'Bay of Naples' Boasts Find Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times 16 Sep 1959: A11 \\"The cast scared me,\\" said Swift. \\"Veterans of scores of movies, some of them. I was afraid they'd say 'TV man, go home'. But they didn't. It was a happy set; everybody worked his head off for me.\\" =Script= Swift said in working on the script, in order to work against the \\"saccharine\\" nature of the material, he would spend a few hours every day first working on a horror play called The Deadly. He would then work on Pollyanna. Swift said \\"in the book Pollyanna was so filled with happiness and light that I wanted to kick her. In the old days she came on like Betty Hutton. Now she is shy. We have an adult drag advice out of her.\\"NEW POLLYANNA WILL BE SUBTLE New York Times 9 June 1959: 44. Swift also decided to remove a key plot point of the book, where Pollyanna was hit by a car and had to learn how to walk. He called this \\"too coincidental. Too pat.\\" Swift added, \\"instead of making her the 'glad girl' of the book we've simmered her cheerfulness down to merely emphasize the things- could-be-worse attitude.\\" =Shooting= Filming started in August 1959.OUT WEST WITH NEW ENGLAND'S 'POLLYANNA' New York Times 30 Aug 1959: X7. Pollyanna was filmed in Santa Rosa, California with the Mableton Mansion at 1015 McDonald Avenue in Santa Rosa serving as the exterior and grounds of Aunt Polly's house. Other California locations include Napa Valley and Petaluma. Interiors were filmed at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. Although the movie was filmed in California, in the book (written by Eleanor Porter) Harrington was set in Vermont. However, in the Disney movie, Harrington is located in Maryland as Baltimore is mentioned several times throughout the script. At the end of the film, Aunt Polly and Pollyanna take the train to Baltimore, probably headed to Johns Hopkins Hospital due to the delicacy of the operation needed. (Johns Hopkins opened in 1889 and the story takes place in the 1900s.) ReceptionBox office= In 1960, Disney reported that the film made a profit \\"but not nearly what we expected.\\"Disney Productions Says Fiscal 1960 Loss Was About $1,350,000: Deficit Is Ascribed to $5 Million Write-Down of Film Library; profitable Fiscal '61 Expected Wall Street Journal 29 Nov 1960: 7. Jerry Griswold of San Diego State University wrote in the New York Times of October 25, 1987: \\"An attempt was made to resuscitate Pollyanna in 1960 when Walt Disney released a movie based on the book. Time, Newsweek and other major reviewers agreed that such an enterprise promised to be a disaster ‚Äì a tearjerker of a story presented by the master of schmaltz; what surprised the critics (their opinions were unanimous) was that it was his best live-action film ever. But few had reckoned the curse of the book's by-then-saccharine reputation. When the movie failed to bring in half of the $6 million that was expected, Disney opined: 'I think the picture would have done better with a different title. Girls and women went to it, but men tended to stay away because it sounded sweet and sticky'\\". Awards and honors Hayley Mills won the 1960 Academy Juvenile Award for her performance, and also received a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.

In 2005, Russia ranked among the leading world producers or was a significant producer of a vast range of mineral commodities, including aluminum, arsenic, cement, copper, magnesium compounds and metals, nitrogen, palladium, silicon, nickel and vanadium.Richard M. Levine and Glenn J. Wallace. \\"The Mineral Industries of the Commonwealth of Independent States\\". 2005 Minerals Yearbook. U.S. Geological Survey (December 2007). This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the public domain. In 2005, the Russian economy benefited significantly from high oil, gas, and metal prices. Oil revenues accounted for about 14% of the GDP. Following the mineral fuel industry, the next leading branch of the mineral industry, in terms of its contribution to the national economy was the metallurgical sector, which contributed 19% of the value of industrial production, accounted for 11.1% of the value of industrial capital stock, and employed 9.3% of the industrial labor force. In 2005, a total of 1,071,000 people were employed in the mineral extraction sector and made up 1.6% of the country's labor force. Investment in mineral extraction and metallurgy accounted for about 20% of total investment in the Russian economy. Legal framework A new subsoil law was under discussion as of 2005. The previous law of 1992, as amended, does not impose any special restrictions on companies with foreign participation, with the exception of diamond and radioactive materials, but this appeared likely to change to the disadvantage of foreign companies, especially those interested in investing in large or strategic deposits, such as the Udokan copper deposit or the Sukhoi Log gold deposit. The list of federal deposits was prepared by the Federal Agency for Natural Resources in August 2008 and consists of 985 overland deposits, including 163 hydrocarbon fields. The current Russian legislation lists deposits as having federal or strategic significance if they contain reserves of uranium, diamonds, especially pure quartz raw materials, nickel, beryllium, tantalum, lithium, niobium and platinum metals. These deposits also include fields with recoverable reserves of over 70 million tons of oil, 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas, 50 tons of vein gold, 500,000 tons of copper. Production In 2005, the value of mining and quarrying production, including extraction of mineral fuels, increased by 1.3% compared with that of 2004; when mineral fuels are excluded, it fell by 3.2%. Structure Production in the mineral sector was highly concentrated as of 2005. For more than 10 minerals, the majority of production was conducted by one company. Gazprom controlled almost the entire production of natural gas in Russia, Norilsk Nickel Mining and Metallurgical Company (MMC) produced more than 90% of Russian nickel and platinum-group metals (PGM), and ALROSA Company Ltd. produced almost all the country's diamond. The Ministry of Natural Resources reported that the copper and other mineral industries also are highly concentrated, but that the situation is better for coal and alluvial gold. Despite this concentration, Russian metallurgical and mining companies were medium-sized compared with those in other countries; in the steel sector, Russian producers are generally smaller than their international counterparts. Trade The value of mineral exports to the Russian economy has been increasing in recent years; and, in 2005, the minerals sector accounted for more than 70% of the value of exports. Mineral fuels were by far the leading category of exports in terms of value. In 2005, mineral products accounted for about 12% of the total value of imports, of which metals imported from both inside and outside the CIS accounted for more than 70%. Mineral resources Approximately 20,000 Russian mineral deposits have been explored, and more than one-third of these have been mined. The Ministry of Natural Resources cited serious problems in the sector, which included the depletion of reserves and the low discovery rate of new reserves. The system of reporting reserves in the Soviet Union (and which Russia very often employed for its resource reporting) was based on establishing drilling parameters to ascertain the certainty of reserves. Unlike the method used in market economy countries, this method does not include the use of market-based economic criteria to establish the feasibility of developing these resources using current technology at prevailing market conditions. Thus, reserve data based on the Soviet method cannot be compared to market economy definitions of reserves. Furthermore, Soviet data on reserves for many mineral resources was either kept secret or was difficult to obtain, and the same holds true for Russian mineral resource data. By 2005, however, Russian companies had begun to seek exposure to Western markets and stock exchanges to raise money in larger quantities and more cheaply than in Russia. A number of state secrecy laws were repealed, which has led some Russian companies to start reporting their reserves and resources according to the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. =Metals= Aluminium RUSAL was Russia's leading domestic aluminum producing company and, along with SUAL, which was the second ranked domestic aluminum producer and the leading domestic bauxite producer, controlled all Russian aluminum, alumina, and bauxite production enterprises. Plans for RUSAL called for merging its resources with that of SUAL and with Swiss-based Glencore International AG to become the United Company RUSAL. This merger would start a new stage in the development of RUSAL and make it the global leader in aluminum production. RUSAL was investing to expand and modernize its production facilities. It was engaged in commissioning the Khakas Aluminum Smelter with a capacity of 300,000 t/yr. Plans for RUSAL also called for modernizing the Sayanogorsk aluminum smelter in 2006 to increase output of aluminum and alloys and to modernize the Nikolayev Alumina refinery in Ukraine to increase output to 1.6 Mt/yr of alumina. RUSAL also planned to continue to expand production capacity at the Achinsk alumina refinery, increasing its output to 1.1 Mt/yr of alumina. Included in the company's investment project portfolio is the Komi Aluminum project, which was initiated by SUAL. The project foresees the development, construction, and operation of a bauxite- alumina complex in the Komi Republic, using material from the Middle Timan bauxite deposit. The design capacity of the complex was 6 Mt/yr of bauxite and 1.4 Mt/yr of alumina. The completion of this project would considerably reduce the Russian aluminum industry's dependence on foreign countries for raw material supplies. Copper More than 51% of Russia's copper metal production was produced by Norilsk Nickel from ore mined by the company. The remainder came from a much smaller amount of ore mined in the Ural Mountains and a large amount of secondary material. As nickel-rich ores at Norilsk Nickel become depleted, Norilsk Nickel will switch to mining larger quantities of ores, which will be primarily copper-rich ores that have a higher copper content relative to their nickel content than the nickel-rich ores, but are lower in metal content for both metals. This change could increase copper output as Norilsk Nickel tries to maintain its level of nickel production. Norilsk Nickel's strategy up to 2010, however, appears to be to maintain its production of nickel-rich ores which may delay the significant increase in copper production. The leading copper producer in the Ural Mountain region‚Äîthe Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company (UMMC)‚Äîcontrols a large number of mining and metallurgical enterprises in the Urals. The company was planning to develop its raw material base and to increase its output of copper in concentrate to 105,000 t in 2010 from 72,000 t in 2003. Mine output in the Urals would also expand as mine development takes place at the Russian Copper Company Limited, which was the country's third ranked copper producer and which also controlled mining and metallurgical enterprises in the Ural Mountain region. Development of the large Udokan deposit in Chita oblast was still on hold. Reserves at Udokan and neighboring deposits were reported as ranging from 10 to more than 20 Mt of copper in ore at grades of between 0.7% and 4% copper. Gold Russia was having a difficult time expanding gold production because reserves at existing enterprises were being depleted and gold mining companies were experiencing greater difficulties in obtaining licenses to mine new deposits. Formerly, local Government entities could issue such licenses, but in 2005, these licenses could be obtained only through the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources based in Moscow. Placers contain 18.2% of the country's reserves but they were being significantly depleted, and most existing placer mining operations were unlikely to survive beyond 2011. However, placers still contributed nearly 50% of annual production. In 2005, no new gold deposits were put into production. More than one-half of Russia's hard rock gold resources occur in the Maiskoye, Natalkinskoe, Nezhdaninskoe, Olimpiada, and the Sukhoi Log deposits in Siberia and in the Russian Far East. More than 66% of Russian gold production comes from just six eastern regions (Amur, Irkutsk, Khabarovsk, Krasnoyarsk, Magadan, and Sakha-Yakutia). During the past 4 years, foreign companies have controlled 15% to 18% of Russian gold production, which was the largest share held for any commodity in the Russian mining industry. These foreign-held enterprises produced a total of between 30 and 36 t/yr of gold. Among Russia's leading gold producers, Bema Gold Corp., Highland Gold Mining Ltd., High River Gold Mines, Kinross Gold Corp., and Peter Hambro Mining Plc, were foreign-listed and/or foreign-controlled companies. Projects being developed by these foreign firms were expected to contribute significantly to the growth in Russian gold production in the next 5 years and could increase Russia's gold output to about 250 t/yr if they are all successfully developed. The most advanced international gold project was the Bema Gold Corp.‚Äôs development of the Kupol deposit, where production was scheduled to start in 2008. Significant byproduct gold was produced by mining operations of UMMC in the Ural Mountain region and Norilsk Nickel's operations in East Siberia on the Taimyr Peninsula (165,000 ounces in 2005). Iron and steel Russia is the world's fourth-ranked steel producer after China, Japan, and the United States. Russia shares the lead with Japan as the world's leading steel exporter. From 1998 to 2005, Russian steel production increased by more than 50%. Between 1998 and 2005, investment in the steel sector greatly increased, which improved economic indicators for steel enterprises and enabled them to improve product quality. Nevertheless, the steel sector was still in need of investment to improve its ability to compete and to expand production capacity. According to a Russian analysis, the country's steel mills can be divided into three categories based on the level of technology they employ. The mills in the first category are the country's three largest (Magnitogorsk, Severstal, and Novolipetsk), which also have the highest levels of technology. For example, this first group of mills has the lowest percentage of open-hearth production, the highest level of continuous casting, and produces the highest quality assortment of steel products. The second tier steel mills consist of the Chelyabinsk, the Nizhniy Tagil, the Kuznetsk, the Oskol, the Uralsk, and West Siberian mills. The country's leading steel holding company was Evraz (a Luxembourg-registered steel company) that had holdings that include three of the leading steel mills in Russia (Kuznetsk, Nizhniy Tagil, and West Siberian). Russia's third ranked steel producer, Severstal, was discussing a merger with Arcelor of Luxembourg, in part to thwart a hostile takeover bid for Arcelor by Mittal Steel of India, which was consolidating steel mills worldwide. Iron ore Russian steel companies relied on iron ore from domestic deposits. These deposits often were owned by more than one Russian steel company. In 2005, steel companies were acquiring iron ore producers to help make their companies more vertically integrated. Russia's iron ore mines and iron and steel works often were located far apart. Almost 60% of iron ore reserves are located in the Kursk magnetic anomaly (KMA) in European Russia and about 15% are located in the Ural Mountains region. High-grade reserves at the open pit operations in the KMA were becoming depleted, although the area hosts significant lower grade resources in the weathered zones. These zones were estimated to contain 4 Gt of reserves and up to 60 Gt of potential resources, but exploiting such low- grade ores would require expensive beneficiation technology. Iron ore output was expected to be in the range of 100 to 105 Mt/yr by 2010. A further limited increase in iron ore production was projected to the year 2020 without a significant expansion of the resource base. The resource base for iron ore was not considered very attractive for investment because of the low grade of the ores, technological problems related to mining and processing the ores, and taxation issues. The iron ore industry in Russia leapt to number one in the world by the death of Peter the Great I (1725) Nickel In Russia, which was the world's leading nickel producing country, more than 90% of nickel was produced by Norilsk Nickel, which mined deposits of mixed sulfide ores mainly near Norilsk in East Siberia, but also on the Kola Peninsula. The projected long-term ore output for Norilsk Nickel in 2005 was raised to 22 Mt/yr. The 2005 level of production was 14 Mt of ore. With metal prices and demand at very high levels, the new higher projections were in accord with Norilsk Nickel's marketing strategy. To maintain and increase output levels, Norilsk Nickel was planning to switch to mining a greater proportion of cuprous and disseminated ores rather than nickel-rich ores, which were being depleted. Norilsk Nickel also was developing new mines to replace depleted reserves of nickel-rich ore. The company's cuprous ore reserves, which are abundant, have a much lower nickel content and a somewhat lower copper content, and the disseminated ores are lower in all base-metals content than the nickel-rich ores. The nickel-rich, cuprous, and disseminated ores, however, are not greatly dissimilar in their PGM content. The Skalisty Mine, which is located on the Taimyr Peninsula, was under development as of 2005; it was expected to achieve its design capacity of 1.2 Mt/yr of nickel-rich ore in 6 to 7 years. Skalisty was scheduled to produce 310,000 t of ore in 2004. Development of the Gluboky Mine, which is located on the Taymyr Peninsula, was in the planning stage; the mine was scheduled to come onstream to mine nickel-rich ore by 2013‚Äì14. Gluboky and Skalisty would produce a combined 2 Mt/yr of nickel-rich ore. Despite its development plans, obstacles were preventing Norilsk Nickel from making major investments in developing its facilities. The investment in its nickel operations that was planned for the period up to 2010 would result in only modest increases in production, although a significant reduction in production would be averted. A large quantity of sulphide nickel has been discovered by Amur Minerals Corporation in the far east of Russia. The company's principal asset is the Kun-Manie project located in Amur Oblast, with JORC resources in excess of an 830,000 nickel equivalent tonnes and a positive independently compiled prefeasibility study. Platinum-group metals Norilsk Nickel's operations (located mainly on the Taymyr Peninsula) in East Siberia and also on the Kola Peninsula produce more than 90% of the country's PGM output. About 10 t/yr of PGM consisting almost entirely of platinum was mined from alluvial deposits throughout the country. In 2004, Russia repealed the law that kept PGM production data secret and, in 2005, repealed the law that kept PGM reserve data secret. The Government published reserve figures for its major PGM holdings at the Norilsk Nickel complex in 2005. Based on an independent audit carried out by Micon International Co. Ltd. according to the Australian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Code, Norilsk Nickel's reserves of combined proven and probable reserves of all six platinum group elements (iridium, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhodium and ruthenium) at Norilsk Nickel's holdings in East Siberia as of December 31, 2004, were reported to be 81.791 million troy ounces. Proven and probable reserves were reported to be 62.183 million troy ounces of palladium and 15.993 million troy ounces of platinum with ore grades that ranged from 5.5 grams per metric ton (g/t) to 11.1 g/t. Measured and indicated mineral resources were reported to be an additional 141 million troy ounces of palladium and 40 million troy ounces of platinum. These reserves are adequate for Norilsk Nickel to maintain current levels of palladium and platinum production for more than 20 years. Despite Norilsk Nickel's development plan to significantly increase ore extraction, the company was proceeding more slowly than its stated plans would indicate and it appeared that through 2010, Norilsk Nickel would try to keep output levels at about the 2005 level. Tin Tin production was prevalent during the Soviet period with the USSR being the fourth largest producer of tin. Ore was mined in Solnechny District of Khabarovsk Krai (Solnechny GOK), the extreme north of Yakutia (Deputatskoye Mine) and Chukotka (Iyultin Mine),Jewish Autonomous Region (Khinganskoye Mine) and in Primoroye (Iskra).Sdelano u nas (rus) During the post perestroika years tin production waned leading to bankruptcies and closures of virtually all operations.–≥–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≤–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ 23/04/2012 - –°—É–¥—å–±–∞ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–ª–æ–≤–æ–¥–æ–±—ã—á–∏ Revival began around 2012 when the Sobolinoye Deposit, (Sable Tin Deposit) was acquired by Sable Tin Resources at a State Auction.Dalnedr Sobolinoye Auction Prikaz 807 from 26.07.2012 The Far Eastern Tin company has recommissioned the Gorniy processing plant and started operations in 2016 at Festivalnoye mine.

Over 90000 tonnes of tin and 53000 tonnes of copper are expected to be extracted from the high grade property near Solnechny town in Khabarovsk Krai.Sable Tin Resources: www.tinresources.com =Industrial minerals= Diamond ALROSA accounted for 97% of Russian diamond production and about 25% of world rough diamond production in 2005. Its major mining operations were located in the Sakha Yakutia Republic but, in 2005, the company began production at the Lomonosov diamond deposit in the northern European part of the country in Arkhangelsk oblast. The company had five mining and beneficiation enterprises in Sakha Yakutia‚Äîthe Aikhal, the Anabar, the Mirnyy, the Nyuruba, and the Udachnyy. In 2005, ALROSA was able to maintain its level of mine output through its program of gradually switching to underground mining to extract low-grade diamond ore reserves. ALROSA had started underground operations at the No. 7/8 Block of the Internatsiolnal‚Äônyy underground mine and was continuing construction of underground mining at the Mir and the Udachny Mines. To maintain stable operations, ALROSA would need to increase its ore reserves by carrying out intensive prospecting for new diamond deposits. The company planned to increase its investment in exploration significantly. A new Mirny Exploration Expedition was established to concentrate on exploration. On June 28, 2005, full-scale mining was initiated at ALROSA's Lomonosov Division OAO Severalamz in the Arkhangelsk region with the commissioning of ore treatment plant No. 1 at the Lomonosov deposit. The plant was designed with the capacity to process about 1 Mt/yr of ore. Diamonds from the deposit are of gem quality, which accounted for the high appraisal value of the reserves at $12 billion. The diamond deposit's effective life was estimated to be about 50 years from the time the plant was put into operation. The OJSC Apatit enterprise, which is located on the Kola Peninsula, was the leading producer of apatite concentrate in Russia and one of the world's leading suppliers of phosphate raw material; its core activities were the mining and beneficiation of apatite and nepheline-syenite ores at 10 deposits that have estimated combined reserves of 3.5 Gt. The development plan for Apatit to 2015 assumes an optimal level of apatite concentrate production of 8.5 Mt/yr that would require levels of ore extraction of 27 to 28 Mt/yr. To maintain output, the enterprise would need to develop underground mining significantly. In 2001, the percentage of ore mined underground was 38%; by 2015, this percentage was expected to increase to 75%. Investment to renovate the beneficiation complex, reduce energy expenditures, reduce emissions harmful to the environment, and acquire new equipment to improve labor productivity was also needed. In late 2016, ALROSA announced that the Mir mine in Siberia had reached full projected capacity and was expected to produce over $400 million worth of diamonds per year.

This strategy envisions three potential scenarios: optimistic, moderate, and critical. The optimistic scenario is characterized by the growth of GDP at the rate of 4.7% to 5.2% annually, by a sevenfold increase of investment in fixed capital for this period compared with the 2000 level, and by high world prices for oil and gas. The oil prices envisioned by this strategy in 2003, even for the optimistic scenario, were about one-half of the 2005 oil prices. The moderate scenario is characterized by a GDP growth of 3.3% to 3.4% annually to 2020, an increase of investment in fixed capital by 3.6 times, and fixed prices for oil at a little more than one-half of the optimistic scenario and gas prices about 20% lower than in the optimistic scenario. The critical scenario is characterized primarily by low world oil prices. Coal The Energy Strategy for Russia for the Period up to 2020 foresees the need for coal production to increase to between 310 and 330 Mt by 2010 and to between 375 and 430 Mt by 2020 to meet expected domestic demand. Russia has 22 coal basins with 114 coal deposits that are unevenly distributed across the country. In 2005, the country had 241 operating coal mines, which included 104 underground mines and 137 open pits with a total production capacity of 315 Mt/yr. Total coal reserves registered in the State Register of Reserves were estimated to be about 200 Gt, and registered reserves in the explored categories A+B+C1 in the reserve classification system that was used in the Soviet Union and later Russia were reported as 106 Gt. These include coal reserves in operating coal mines, in mines under construction, and in areas explored in detail for new mine construction. As foreseen in the country's energy strategy program, coal production must increase by 10 to 15 Mt/yr between 2005 and 2010 and by a total of 105 Mt by the year 2020. Although the creation of additional coal production capacity through upgrading and expansion of existing mines and development of new mines was possible based on reserves, doing so would require a level of investment in the coal sector far in excess of the historic level of investment in the past 5 years and casts doubt on the feasibility of the planned expansion. At current rates of investment coal production capacity by the year 2020 would be in the neighborhood of 375 Mt/yr. This optimistic investment scenario would depend to a large extent on an increase in foreign investment, particularly from Chinese, Japanese, and South Korean companies. Natural gas The country's energy strategy predicts natural gas production to range between 635 and 665 billion cubic meters in 2010 and between 680 and 730 billion cubic meters in 2020. These gas production goals were to be achieved by development in the traditional gas-producing regions, the main one of which was West Siberia, and in the new oil- and gas-producing provinces in East Siberia, in the Russian Far East, in the European North including offshore in the Arctic Sea, and on the Yamal Peninsula. Along with the development of big fields, the strategy recommends development of small gas fields, primarily in the European part of the country in the Ural Mountains, the Volga, and the North West regions. Almost all the country's gas production was under the control of the company Gazprom. Gazprom's natural gas production forecast called for only modest production growth of about 1.3% by 2008. Growth in Russia's natural gas sector has been slowed primarily by aging fields, state regulation, Gazprom's monopolistic control over the industry, and insufficient export pipelines. Three major fields in Western Siberia‚ÄîMedvezh‚Äôye, Urengoy, and Yamburg‚Äîaccounted for more than 70% of Gazprom's total natural gas production, but these fields were in decline. Although Gazprom projected increases in its natural gas output between 2008 and 2030, most of Russia's natural gas production growth was expected to come from independent gas companies, such as Itera, Northgas, and Novatek. Reassessment of the energy strategy has been ongoing since the strategy was issued in 2003. A Gazprom subsidiary issued a report recommending a change of export strategy for the Russian gas industry. It determined that Russia should decrease exports of natural gas to European markets and concentrate instead on developing new gasfields to keep up with domestic demand, which was rising faster than was envisioned in the 2003 report and could necessitate the development of new gasfields on the Yamal Peninsula and in other places. Petroleum The Energy Strategy for Russia for the Period up to 2020 includes several scenarios that predict a range for Russian oil production of between 445 and 490 Mt/yr by 2010 and between 450 and 520 Mt/yr in 2020. Oil production and growth was to be centered in the traditional oil-producing regions, such as in West Siberia, the North Caucasus, and the Volga region and in new oil and gas Provinces in the European North (Timan-Pechora region), in eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East, and in the south in the North Caspian region. Although the base of the country's oil production for this period would remain the West Siberian oil and gas province, priority areas for new development were to be in the eastern and the southern regions of the country. New field developments were likely to produce almost all Russia's annual oil growth in the next 5 years and would likely produce more than one- half of the country's oil in 2020. In the next 5 years, new field developments at the Middle Caspian project at Kurmangazy (OAO Lukoil Oil Co.); the Komsomolskoye and the Vankorskoye projects (OAO Rosneft Oil Co.); the Prirazlomnoye project (Gazprom); the Sakhalin Island projects; the West Salymskoye project (Shell Joint Venture); and the Timan Pechora project (OAO Lukoil Oil Co. and ConocoPhillips) would help compensate for production decreases at older fields. Uranium Uranium mining in Russia was conducted entirely by the corporation JSC TVELs ore mining enterprises, and in particular by open pit mining at its subsidiary JSC Priargunsky Industrial Mining & Chemical Union and also by in situ underground leaching at its subsidiaries –°JSC Dalur in the Kurgan Oblast and JSC Khiagda in Buryatia. Annual uranium production was about 3,400 t, of which more than 90% was produced by Priargunsky. Uranium-bearing ores and solutions were processed to generate uranium concentrates, which were shipped for further reprocessing at the JSC Chepetsky Mechanical Plant. The country's annual natural uranium consumption amounted to approximately 9,000 t. According to projections, the demands for uranium by the nuclear industry in Russia will grow by 1.7 times. The ‚ÄúTVEL Uranium‚Äù program was launched by TVEL Corporation to further develop uranium production up to 2010; an increase in ore mining to 4,300 t of uranium in 2010 was envisioned. Mining was being developed at the JSC Dalur enterprise in the Kurgan Oblast, which produced about 200 t of uranium in 2005. The enterprise planned to increase production by 15% to 20% annually to produce 1,000 t by 2010. The construction of mine No. 6 at the Priargunsky deposit had been started to increase ore production. The JSC Khiagda enterprise was developing a pilot mining operation to mine the Khiagdinskoye deposit in Buryatiya using underground well leaching. Khiagda commenced commercial operations in 2005 and Khiagda planned to have the capacity to produce 1,000 t/yr of uranium by 2012. Total reserves at the JSC Khiagda site reportedly amount to 100,000 t of uranium. = Expansion Abroad = South Africa In 2013 and 2014, Vladimir Putin met with South African President Jacob Zumahttp://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/2c4145004fa507a5b204f20b5d39e4bb/Zuma-keen- on-strengthening-economic-ties-with-Russia to discuss uranium mining expansion and to sign a nuclear energy agreement between both nations. The agreement included the right to tender for the proposed construction of eight new nuclear reactors valued at over $100 billion. In 2017, Russia submitted their bid. Canada In 2009, Rosatom began buying shares in Uranium One in a bid to expand mining operations abroad. The first purchase was for 17% of shares. In 2010 the stake was increased to 51% and by 2013, to a 100% ownership. The purchase of the Canada-based mining company gave Russia ownership of a US mine in Wyoming.

Since the polymorphism was identified in the middle of the 1990s, it has been extensively investigated, e.g., in connection with neuropsychiatric disorders. A 2006 scientific article stated that \\"over 300 behavioral, psychiatric, pharmacogenetic and other medical genetics papers\\" had analyzed the polymorphism. While often discussed as an example of gene- environment interaction, this contention is contested.  Alleles  chromosome 17. The polymorphism occurs in the promoter region of the gene. Researchers commonly report it with two variations in humans: A short (\\"s\\") and a long (\\"l\\"), but it can be subdivided further. The short (s)- and long (l)- alleles have been thought to be related to stress and psychiatric disorders. In connection with the region are two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP): rs25531 and rs25532. One study published in 2000 found 14 allelic variants (14-A, 14-B, 14-C, 14-D, 15, 16-A, 16-B, 16-C, 16-D, 16-E, 16-F, 19, 20 and 22) in a group of around 200 Japanese and Europeans. The difference between 16-A and 16-D is the rs25531 SNP. It is also the difference between 14-A and 14-D. Some studies have found that long allele results in higher serotonin transporter mRNA transcription in human cell lines. The higher level may be due to the A-allele of rs25531, such that subjects with the long-rs25531(A) allelic combination (sometimes written LA) have higher levels while long-rs25531(G) carriers have levels more similar to short-allele carriers. Newer studies examining the effects of genotype may compare the LA/LA genotype against all other genotypes. The allele frequency of this polymorphism seems to vary considerably across populations, with a higher frequency of the long allele in Europe and lower frequency in Asia. It is argued that the population variation in the allele frequency is more likely due to neutral evolutionary processes than natural selection.  Neuropsychiatric disorders  In the 1990s it has been speculated that the polymorphism might be related to affective disorders, and an initial study found such a link. Comment: However, another large European study found no such link. A decade later two studies found that 5-HTT polymorphism influences depressive responses to life stress; an example of gene-environment interaction (GxE) not considered in the previous studies.http://www.esi- topics.com/nhp/2006/september-06-KennethSKendler.html However, a 2017 meta- analysis found no such association. Earlier, two 2009 meta-analyses found no overall GxE effect, while a 2011 meta-analysis, demonstrated a positive result. In turn, the 2011 meta-analysis has been criticized as being overly inclusive (e.g. including hip fractures as outcomes), for deeming a study supportive of the GxE interaction which is actually in the opposite direction, and because of substantial evidence of publication bias and data mining in the literature. This criticism points out that if the original finding were real, and not the result of publication bias, we would expect that those replication studies which are closest in design to the original are the most likely to replicate‚Äîinstead we find the opposite. This suggests that authors may be data dredging for measures and analytic strategies which yield the results they want. = Treatment response = With the results from one study the polymorphism was thought to be related to treatment response so that long- allele patients respond better to antidepressants. Another antidepressant treatment response study did, however, rather point to the rs25531 SNP, and a large study by the group of investigators found a \\"lack of association between response to an SSRI and variation at the SLC6A4 locus\\". One study could find a treatment response effect for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to drug-resistant depression with long/long homozygotes benefitting more than short-allele carriers. The researchers found a similar effect for the Val66Met polymorphism in the BDNF gene. =Amygdala = The 5-HTTLPR has been thought to predispose individuals to affective disorders such as anxiety and depression. There have been some studies that test whether this association is due to the effects of variation in 5-HTTLPR on the reactivity of the human amygdala. In order to test this, researchers gathered a group of subjects and administered a harm avoidance (HA) subset of the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire as an initial mood and personality assessment. Subjects also had their DNA isolated and analyzed in order to be genotyped. Next, the amygdala was then engaged by having the subject match fearful facial expressions during an fMRI scan (by the 3-T GE Signa scanner). The results of the study showed that there was bilateral activity in the amygdala for every subject when processing the fearful images, as expected. However, the activity in the right amygdala was much higher for subjects with the s-allele, which shows that the 5-HTTLPR has an effect on amygdala activity. It is also important to note that there did not seem to be the same effect on the left amygdala.  Insomnia  There has been speculation that the 5-HTTLPR gene is associated with insomnia and sleep quality. Primary insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders and is defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep, enough to cause distress in one's life. Serotonin (5-HT) has been associated with the regulation of sleep for a very long time now. The 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is the main regulator of serotonin and serotonergic energy and is therefore targeted by many antidepressants. There also have been several family and twin studies that suggest that insomnia is heavily genetically influenced. Many of these studies have found that there is a genetic and environment dual-factor that influences insomnia. It has been hypothesized that the short 5-HTTLPR genotype is related to poor sleep quality and, therefore, also primary insomnia. It is important to note that research studies have found that this variation does not cause insomnia, but rather may predispose an individual to experience worse quality of sleep when faced with a stressful life event. = Brummett = The effect that the 5-HTTLPR gene had on sleep quality was tested by Brummett in a study conducted at Duke University Medical Center from 2001-2004. The sleep quality of 344 participants was measured using The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The study found that caregivers with the homozygous s-allele had poorer sleep quality, which shows that the stress of caregiving combined with the allele gave way to worse sleep quality. Although the study found that the 5-HTTLPR genotype did not directly affect sleep quality, the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism's effect on sleep quality was magnified by one's environmental stress. It supports the notion that the 5-HTTLPR s-allele is what leads to hyperarousal when exposed to stress; hyperarousability is commonly associated with insomnia. = Deuschle = However, in a 2007 study conducted by a sleep laboratory in Germany, it was found that the 5-HTTLPR gene did have a strong association with both insomnia and depression both in participants with and without lifetime affective disorders. This study included 157 insomnia patients and a control group of 836 individuals that had no psychiatric disorders. The subjects were then genotyped through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The researchers found that the s-allele was greater represented in the vast majority of patients with insomnia compared to those who had no disorder. This shows that there is an association between the 5-HTTPLR genotype and primary insomnia. However, it is important to consider the fact that there was a very limited number of subjects with insomnia tested in this study.  Personality traits  Klaus-Peter Lesch, 2014: a 5-HTTLPR researcher 5-HTTLPR may be related to personality traits: Two 2004 meta- analyses found 26 research studies investigating the polymorphism in relation to anxiety-related traits. The initial and classic 1996 study found s-allele carriers to on average have slightly higher neuroticism score with the NEO PI-R personality questionnaire, and this result was replicated by the group with new data. Some other studies have, however, failed to find this association, nor with peer-rated neuroticism, and a 2006 review noted the \\"erratic success in replication\\" of the first finding. A meta-analysis published in 2004 stated that the lack of replicability was \\"largely due to small sample size and the use of different inventories\\". They found that neuroticism as measured with the NEO-family of personality inventories had quite significant association with 5-HTTLPR while the trait harm avoidance from the Temperament and Character Inventory family did not have any significant association. A similar conclusion was reached in an updated 2008 meta-analysis. However, based on over 4000 subjects, the largest study that used the NEO PI-R found no association between variants of the serotonin transporter gene (including 5-HTTLPR) and neuroticism, or its facets (Anxiety, Angry-Hostility, Depression, Self-Consciousness, Impulsiveness, and Vulnerability). In a study published in 2009, authors found that individuals homozygous for the long allele of 5-HTTLPR paid more attention on average to positive affective pictures while selectively avoiding negative affective pictures presented alongside the positive pictures compared to their heterozygous and short-allele-homozygous peers. This biased attention of positive emotional stimuli suggests they may tend to be more optimistic. Other research indicates carriers of the short 5-HTTLPR allele have difficulty disengaging attention from emotional stimuli compared to long allele homozygotes. Another study published in 2009 using an eye tracking assessment of information processing found that short 5-HTTLPR allele carriers displayed an eye gaze bias to view positive scenes and avoid negative scenes, while long allele homozygotes viewed the emotion scenes in a more even-handed fashion. This research suggests that short 5-HTTLPR allele carriers may be more sensitive to emotional information in the environment than long allele homozygotes. Another research group have given evidence for a modest association between shyness and the long form in grade school children. This is, however, just a single report and the link is not investigated as intensively as for the anxiety-related traits.  Neuroimaging  Molecular neuroimaging studies may use PET scanners such as this type for examining the effect of the 5-HTTLPR genotypes on serotonin transporter binding in the human brain. Molecular neuroimaging studies have examined the association between genotype and serotonin transporter binding with positron emission tomography (PET) and SPECT brain scanners. Such studies use a radioligand that binds-- preferably selectively--to the serotonin transporter so an image can be formed that quantifies the distribution of the serotonin transporter in the brain. One study could see no difference in serotonin transporter availability between long/long and short/short homozygotes subjects among 96 subjects scanned with SPECT using the iodine-123 Œ≤-CIT radioligand. Using the PET radioligand carbon-11-labeled McN 5652 another research team could neither find any difference in serotonin transporter binding between genotype groups. Newer studies have used the radioligand carbon-11-labeled DASB with one study finding higher serotonin transporter binding in the putamen of LA homozygotes compared to other genotypes. Another study with similar radioligand and genotype comparison found higher binding in the midbrain. Associations between the polymorphism and the grey matter in parts of the anterior cingulate brain region have also been reported based on magnetic resonance imaging brain scannings and voxel-based morphometry analysis. 5-HTTLPR short allele‚Äìdriven amygdala hyperreactivity was confirmed in a large (by MRI study standards) cohort of healthy subjects with no history of psychiatric illness or treatment. Brain blood flow measurements with positron emission tomography brain scanners can show genotype-related changes. The glucose metabolism in the brain has also been investigated with respect to the polymorphism, and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans have also been correlated to the polymorphism. Comment: Especially the amygdala brain structure has been the focus of the functional neuroimaging studies. Electrophysiology The relationship between the Event Related Potentials P3a and P3b and the genetic variants of 5-HTTLPR were investigated using an auditory oddball paradigm and revealed short allele homozygotes mimicked those of COMT met/met homozygotes with an enhancement of the frontal, but not parietal P3a and P3b. This suggests a frontal-cortical dopaminergic and serotoninergic mechanism in bottom-up attentional capture.

At that Council, monasticism had become an acknowledged part of the life of the Christian Church, and it was specially legislated for. Origins Egypt was the Motherland of Christian monasticism;Bacchus, Francis Joseph. \\"Eastern Monasticism Before Chalcedon (A.D. 451).\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 19 Jul. 2013 it sprang into existence there at the beginning of the fourth century. The first chapter in its history of monasticism is the life of St. Anthony; the start of the monastic movement may be dated either about 285, when St. Anthony, no longer content with the life of the ordinary ascetic, went into the wilderness, or about 305, when he organized a kind of monastic life for his disciples. We hear first of men and women leading the chaste or virgin life. The Apologists pointed triumphantly to such.Justin, \\"Apol.\\", I,xv; Athenagoras, \\"Legat.\\", xxxiii; Minucius Felix, \\"Octav.\\", xxxi. Voluntary poverty, in the complete renunciation of all worldly possessions, would be difficult till there were monasteries; the examples of Origen, St. Cyprian, and Pamphilus were necessary to show that a monastic life was possible. A full practice of the third Evangelical counsel of obedience could only be realized after the monastic ideal had taken root and passed beyond the purely eremitical stage. In ante-Nicene ascetics a man would lead a single life, practice long and frequent fasts, abstain from meat and wine, and support himself, if he were able, by some small handicraft, keeping of what he earned only so much as was absolutely necessary for his own sustenance, and giving the rest to the poor. If he were an educated man, he might be employed by the Church in the capacity of catechist. Very often he would don the kind of dress which marked the wearer as a philosopher of an austere school. In Egypt, at the time when St. Anthony first embraced the ascetic life, there were a number of ascetics living in huts near towns and villages. When St. Anthony died (356 or 357), two types of monasticism flourished in Egypt. There were villages or colonies of hermits ‚Äì the eremitical type; and monasteries in which a community life was led ‚Äì the cenobitic type. The hermit life The monasticism established under St Anthony's direct influence became the norm in Northern Egypt. In contrast to the fully coenobitical system, established by Pachomius in the South, it continued to be of a semi-eremetical character, the monks living commonly in separate cells or huts, and coming together only occasionally for church services; and the life they lived was not a community life according to rule. This was the form of monastic life in the deserts of Nitria and Scete, as portrayed by Palladius and Cassian. Such groups of semi- independent hermitages were later on called Lauras.Butler, Edward Cuthbert. \\"St. Anthony.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 19 Jul. 2013 A brief survey of the opening chapters of Palladius's Lausiac History will serve as a description of the former type. > Palladius was a monk from Palestine who, in 388, went to Egypt. On landing > at Alexandria he put himself in the hands of a priest named Isidore, who in > early life had been a hermit at Nitria and now apparently presided over a > hospice at Alexandria without in any way abating the austerity of his life. > By the advice of Isidore, Palladius placed himself under the direction of a > hermit named Dorotheus who lived six miles outside Alexandria, with whom he > was to pass three years learning to subdue his passions and then to return > to Isidore to receive higher spiritual knowledge. This Dorotheus spent the > whole day collecting stones to build cells for other hermits, and the whole > night weaving ropes out of palm leaves. He never lay down to sleep, though > slumber sometimes overtook him while working or eating. Palladius who seems > to have lived in his cell, ascertained from other solitaries that this had > been his custom from his youth upwards. Palladius' health broke down before > he completed his time with Dorotheus, but he spent three years in Alexandria > and its neighbourhood visiting the hermitages and becoming acquainted with > about 2000 monks. From Alexandria he went to Nitria, where there was a > monastic village containing about 5000 solitaries. There was no kind of > monastic rule. Some of the solitaries lived alone, sometimes two or more > lived together. They assembled at the church on Saturdays and Sundays. The > church was served by eight priests of whom the oldest always celebrated, > preached, and judged, the others only assisting. All worked at weaving flax. > There were bakeries where bread was made, not only for the village itself, > but for the solitaries who lived in the desert beyond. There were doctors. > Wine also was sold. Strangers were entertained in a guest-house. If able to > read, they were lent a book. They might stay as long as they liked, but > after a week they were set to some kind of work. But, though there was no > monastic rule at Nitria, there was municipal law, the outward symbol of > which was three whips suspended from three palm trees, one for monks who > might be guilty of some fault, one for thieves who might be caught prowling > about, and the third for strangers who misbehaved. Further into the desert > was a place called \\"The Cells\\", or Cellia, whither the more perfect > withdrew. This is described by the author of the \\"Historia monachorum in > Aegypto\\". Here the solitaries lived in cells so far apart that they were out > of sight and out of hearing from one another. Like those of Nitria, they met > only on Saturdays and Sundays at church,whither some of them had to travel a > distance of three or four miles. Often their death was only discovered by > their absence from church. The collective life In strong contrast with the individualism of the eremitical life was the rigid discipline which prevailed in the cenobitical monasteries founded by St. Pachomius. When, in 313, Constantine I was at war with Maxentius, Pachomius, still a heathen, was forcibly enlisted together with a number of other young men, and placed on board a ship to be carried down the Nile to Alexandria. At some town at which the ship touched, the recruits were overwhelmed with the kindness of the Christians. Pachomius at once resolved to be a Christian and carried out his resolution as soon as he was dismissed from military service. He began as an ascetic in a small village, taking up his abode in a deserted temple of Serapis and cultivating a garden on the produce of which he lived and gave alms. The fact that Pachomius made an old temple of Serapis his abode was enough for an ingenious theory that he was originally a pagan monk. This view is now quite exploded. Pachomius next embraced the eremitical life and prevailed upon an old hermit named Palemon to take him as his disciple and share his cell with him. It may be noted that this kind of discipleship, which, as we have already seen, was attempted by Palladius, was a recognized thing among the Egyptian hermits. Afterwards he left Palemon and founded his first monastery at Tabennisi near Denderah. Before he died, in 346, he had under him eight or nine large monasteries of men, and two of women. From a secular point of view, a Pachomian monastery was an industrial community in which almost every kind of trade was practised. This, of course, involved much buying and selling, so the monks had ships of their own on the Nile, which conveyed their agricultural produce and manufactured goods to the market and brought back what the monasteries required. From the spiritual point of view, the Pachomian monk was a religious living under a rule more severe, even when allowance has been made for differences of climate, than that of the Trappists. A Pachomian monastery was a collection of buildings surrounded by a wall. The monks were distributed in houses, each house containing about forty monks. Three or four houses constituted a tribe. There would be thirty to forty houses in a monastery. There was an abbot over each monastery, and provosts with subordinate officials over each house. The monks were divided into houses according to the work they were employed in: thus there would be a house for carpenters, a house for agriculturists, and so forth. But other principles of division sem to have been employed, e.g., we hear of a house for the Greeks. On Saturdays and Sundays all the monks assembled in the church for Mass; on other days the Office and other spiritual exercises were celebrated in the houses. \\"The fundamental idea of St. Pachomius' rule\\", writes Abbot Edward Joseph Aloysius Butler,Lausiac History, I, p. 236. \\"was to establish a moderate level of observance (moderate in comparison with the life led by the hermits) which might be obligatory on all; and then to leave it open to each - and to indeed encourage each - to go beyond the fixed minimum, according as he was prompted by his strength, his courage, and his zeal\\". This is strikingly illustrated in the rules concerning food. According to St. Jerome, in the preface to his translation of the \\"Rule of Pachomius\\", the tables were laid twice a day except on Wednesdays and Fridays, which, outside the seasons of Easter and Pentecost were fast days. Some only took very little at the second meal; some at one or other of the meals confined themselves to a single food; others tookjust a morsel of bread. Some abstained altogether from the community meal; for these bread, water, and salt were placed in their cell. Pachomius appointed his successor a monk named Petronius, who died within a few months, having likewise named his successor, Horsiesi. In Horsiesi's time the order was threatened with a schism. The abbot of one of the houses, instead of forwarding the produce of the work of his monks to the head house of the order, where it would be sold and the price distributed to the different houses according to their need, wished to have the disposal of it for the sole benefit of his own monastery. Horsiesi, finding himself unable to cope with the situation, appointed Theodore, a favourite disciple of Pachomius, his coadjutor. When Theodore died, in the year 368, Horsiesi was able to resume the government of the order. This threatened schism brings prominently before us a feature connected with Pachomius' foundation which is never again met with in the East, and in the West only many centuries later. \\"Like C√Æteaux in a later age\\", writes Abbot Butler, \\"it almost at once assumed the shape of a fully organized congregation or order, with a superior general and a system of visitation and general chapters - in short, all the machinery of a centralized government, such as does not appear again in the monastic world until the Cistercian and the Mendicant Orders arose in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries\\" (op. cit., I,235). Shenoute A word must be said about Shenoute (alternative: Shenouda, Schenoudi, Schnoudi, or Senuti). Shortly after the middle of the fourth century, two monks, Pigol and Pishoy, changed their eremitical monasteries into cenobitical ones. Of the latter we know scarcely anything. Shenoute, when a boy of about nine years old came under the care of his uncle Pigol. Both Pigol and Shenoute were reformers ‚Äì the Pachomian Rule was not strict enough for them. Shenoute succeeded his uncle Pigol as head of the White Monastery of Athribis, and, till his death (about 453), was not only the greatest monastic leader, but one of the most important men, in Egypt. He waged war against heretics; he took a prominent part in the rooting out of paganism; he championed the cause of the poor against the rich. He once went in person to Constantinople to complain of the tyranny of government officials. On one occasion 20,000 men, women, and children took refuge in the White Monastery during an invasion of the Blemmyes of Ethiopia, and Shenoute maintained all the fugitives for three months, providing them with food and medical aid. On another occasion he ransomed a hundred captives and sent them home with food, clothing, and money for their journey. Shenoute's importance for the history of monasticism is small, for his influence, great as it was in his own country, did not make itself felt elsewhere. There were two barriers: Upper Egypt was a difficult and dangerous country for travellers, and such as did penetrate there would not be likely to visit a monastery where hardly anything but Coptic was spoken. According to Abbot Butler, \\"Schenoudi is never named by any Greek or Latin writer\\" (op. cit., II,204). He has been rediscovered in our own time in Coptic manuscripts. Spread With the exception of a single Pachomian monastery at Canopus, near Alexandria, the cenobitic monasteries were in the South, and confined to a relatively small area. The eremitical monasteries, on the contrary, are everywhere, and especially in the North. These latter were thus far more accessible to pilgrims visiting Egypt and so became the patterns or models for the rest of the Christian world. It was the eremitical, not the cenobitical, type of monasticism which went forth from Egypt. Monasticism at a very early date spread eastwards. The solitaries had a special predilection for Scriptural sites. At every place hallowed by tradition, which Syria visited (A.D.385), she found monks. The attraction of Mount Sinai for the solitaries was irresistible, in spite of the danger of captivity or death at the hands of the Saracens. In 373 a number of solitaries inhabited this mountain, living on dates and other fruit, such bread as they had being reserved for the Sacred Mysteries. All the week they lived apart in their cells; they gathered together in the church on Saturday evening and, after spending the night in prayer, received communion on Sunday morning. Forty of them were massacred in 373, and on the same day another group of solitaries at Raithe (supposed to be Elim) were killed by a second band of barbarians. These events were described by eyewitnesses (Tillemont, \\"H.E.\\", VII, 573-80). The same kind of life was being led at Mount Sinai, and a similar experience was undergone some twenty years later when St. Nilus was there. St. Hilarion, who for a time had been a disciple of St. Anthony, propagated monasticism of the eremitical type first in the neighbourhood of his native city Gaza and then in Cyprus. His friend, St. Epiphanius, after practising the monastic life in Egypt, founded a monastery near Eleutheropolis in Palestine somewhere about 330 or perhaps a little later. In Jerusalem and its neighbourhood there were numerous monasteries at a very early date. There was the monastery on the Mount of Olives, from which Palladius went forth on his tour of the Egyptian monasteries; there were two monasteries for women in Jerusalem, built by the older and younger Melania respectively. At Bethlehem, St. Paula founded three monasteries for women and one for men about 387. There was, besides, in Bethlehem the monastery where Cassian some years before began his religious life. The Lauras, which were very numerous, formed a conspicuous feature in Palestinian monasticism. The first seems to have been founded before 334 by St. Chariton at Pharan, a few miles from Jerusalem; later on two more were founded by the same saint at Jericho and at Suca. St. Euthymius (473) founded another celebrated one in the Kidron Valley. Near Jericho was the laura ruled over by St. Gerasimus (475). Some details concerning the rules of this laura have been preserved in a very ancient Life of St. Euthymius. It consisted of a cenobium where the cenobitic life was practised by novices and others less proficient. There were also seventy cells for solitaries. Five days in the week these latter lived and worked alone in their cells. On Saturday they brought their work to the cenobium, where, after receiving Holy Communion on Sundays, they partook of some cooked food and a little wine. The rest of the week their fare was bread, dates and water. When some of them asked to be allowed to heat some water, that they might cook some food and to have a lamp to read by, they were told that if they wished to live thus they had better take up their abode in the cenobium (Acta Sanctorum., March 1, 386,87). Antioch Antioch, when John Chrysostom was a young man, was full of ascetics and the neighbouring mountains were peopled with hermits. So great was the impulse driving men to the solitary life that at one time there was an outcry, amounting almost to a persecution, among Christians as well as pagans against those who embraced it. This was the occasion of Chrysostom's treatise against the opponents of monasticism: in the first book he dwelt upon the guilt incurred by them; the second and third were addressed respectively to a pagan and a Christian father who were opposing the wish of their sons to embrace the monastic state. He yielded to his mother's wishes and lived the ascetic life at home until her death; a scene between Chrysostom and his mother is at the beginning of the \\"De Sacertio\\". Palestine and Antioch are examples of the rapid spread of monasticism outside of Egypt. There is abundant evidence of the phenomenon in all the countries between the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia; and Mesopotamia, according to St Jerome, whose testimony is amply borne out by other writers, rivalled Egypt itself in the number and holiness of its monks (Comm. in Isaiam, V,xix). Basil Basil the Great before embracing the monastic state made a careful study of monasticism in Egypt, Palestine, Coelesyria, and Mesopotamia. The result was a decided preference for the cenobitic life. He founded several monasteries in Pontus, over one of which he himself for a time presided, and very soon monasteries, modelled after his, spread over the East. His monks assembled together for \\"psalmody\\" and \\"genuflexions\\" seven times a day, in accordance with the Psalmist's \\"Septies in die laudem dixi tibi\\" (Ps. cxviii,164): at midnight (\\"Media nocte surgebam\\" - Ibid.,62), at evening, morning and midday (Ps. lv,18), at the third hour, the hour of Pentecost, and at the ninth, the sacred hour of the Passion. To complete the tale of seven, the midday prayer was divided into two parts separated by the community meal (Sermo \\"Asceticus\\", Benedictine edition, II,321). Basil's monastic ideal is set forth in a collection of his writings known as the \\"Asceticon\\", or \\"Ascetica\\", the most important of which are the \\"Regulae fusius tractatae\\", a series of answers to questions, fifty-five in number, and the \\"Regulae brevius tractatae\\", in which three hundred and thirteen questions are briefly replied to. It must not be supposed that the \\"Regulae\\" form a rule, though it would be possible to go a good way towards constituting one out of them. They are answers to questions which would naturally arise among persons already in possession of a framework of customs or traditions. Sometimes they treat of practical questions, but as often as not they deal with matters concerning the spiritual life. Basil did not draw up a rule, but gave a model or pattern; and was not the founder of a religious order. No Eastern, except Pachomius, ever was. An order, as we understand the term, is a purely Western Christian product. \\"It is not enough\\", says a writer who certainly does not underrate Basil's influence, \\"to affirm that the Basilian Order is a myth. One must go farther and give up calling the Byzantine monks Basilians. Those most concerned have never taken this title, and no Eastern writer that I know of has ever bestowed it upon them\\" (Pargoire in \\"Dict. d'Archeologie chretienne\\", s.v. \\"Basile\\"). In a word, every monastery is an order of its own. With Basil Eastern monasticism reached its final stage ‚Äì communities of monks leading the contemplative life and devoting themselves wholly to prayer and work. The cenobitical life steadily became the normal form of the religious calling, and the eremitical one the exceptional form, requiring a long previous training. We must now speak of the grounds upon which St. Basil based his decision ‚Äì a decision so momentous for the future history of monasticism ‚Äì in favour of the cenobitical life. Life with others is more expedient because, in the first place, even for the supply of their bodily needs, men depend upon one another. Further, there is the law of charity. The solitary has only himself to regard; yet, \\"charity seeks not itself\\". Again, the solitary will not equally discover his faults, there being no one to correct him with meekness and mercy. There are precepts of charity which can only be fulfilled in the cenobitical life. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are not all given to all men, but one is given to one man and another to another. We cannot be partakers in the gifts not bestowed on ourselves if we live by ourselves. The great danger to the solitary is self- complacency; he is not put to the test, so that he is unable to learn his faults or his progress. How can he learn humility when there is no one to prefer before himself? Or patience when there is no one to yield to? Whose feet shall he wash? To whom shall he be as a servant? (Reg.fus. tract., Q.vii.) This condemnation of the eremitical life is interesting because of what might almost be called its tameness. One would expect at least a lurid picture of the dangers which the solitary ran, delusions, melancholy culminating in despair, terrible moral and spiritual falls, the abandonment of the religious calling for the life of vice, and so forth. But instead of such things we have little more than what amounts to disadvantages and the risk of somewhat flat and commonplace kinds of failure, against which the common life afforded the best protection. Clearly St. Basil found little that was tragic during the two years he was investigating monasticism in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere. It might be supposed that so uncompromising a verdict against the eremitical life would stir up a fierce conflict. As a matter of fact, it did nothing of the kind. Later developments Palestine, at the end of the fourth century, began to supersede Egypt as the centre of monasticism, and in Palestine the laura and the cenobium were in perfect harmony. That of St. Gerasimus, with its cenobium already referred to, may be taken as a typical example. St. Basil's authority was equal to St. Anthony's among the leaders of Palestinian monasticism; yet they took it as a matter of course that life in the laura was the most perfect, though under ordinary circumstances it should not be entered upon before an apprenticeship had been served in a cenobium. The dweller in the laura was under an archimandrite or abbot. By the time of Chalcedon, it was agreed that monasteries were not to be erected without the leave of the bishop; monks were to receive due honour, but were not to mix themselves up with the affairs of Church or State. They were to be subject to the bishop, etc. (can.iv). Clerics and monks were not to serve in war or embrace a secular life (can.vii). Monasteries were not to be secularized (can.xxiv). Solitary spots, according to Basil, should be chosen as sites for monasteries. Nevertheless, they soon found their way into cities. According to one scholar, at least fifteen monasteries were founded at Constantinople in the time of Constantine the Great; but others affirm that the three most ancient ones only dated back to the time of Theodosius (375-95). In 518 there were at least fifty-four monasteries in Constantinople. Their names and those of their rulers are given in a petition addressed by the monks of Constantinople to Pope Hormisdas in 518.

Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama wrote \\"the 'actual hero' of the film is definitely Urmila Matondkar, who will walk away with all laurels at the end of the day. Her career-best performance, she oozes intensity, love, hate, relentlessness and obsessive behaviour with perfection. And despite the fact that her character gets nuttier as the movie tags along, it is to Urmila's credit that we are able to feel for her pathetic persona.http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/201614 Planet Bollywood wrote \\"Performances by the cast were all first rate. Fardeen does a great job in the film. He has a confident screen presence, and he is overcoming is anglicized accent well. His emotional scenes still need a little work, but otherwise he is very good here. Sonali Kulkarni also does a competent job. Geeta isn't a complex character but she is very insecure, yet understanding. Sonali does a great job in bringing her emotional issues across well on screen and makes Geeta an extremely convincing character. The star of the show is Urmila who is simply mind blowing in this film. The film is sure to get her nominated for best actress or even in some cases best villain. Not only does she look amazing, but she acts so well it will leave you speechless. If you hate everything else in the film, her performance will surely win you over! Her last two scenes in the film are simply breath taking. Ladies and gentlemen stand up and applaud this fantastic performance! Apunka Choice Wrote \\"Urmila grooves in perfectly as Riya. She convincingly portrays erratic moods of a person. He bubbly buoyancy will not go unnoticed. Particularly laudable is her depiction of two different shades of a same person. First, as vulnerable as any other girl and later a suicidal, she-of-the-killer-instinct, a la Glen Close in Hollywood hit Fatal Attraction, Urmila gives a power-packed performance.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Films scored by Sandeep Chowta Category:2001 films Category:Indian films Category:2000s Hindi- language films Category:Indian romantic thriller films Category:Hindi films remade in other languages Category:2001 directorial debut films ","title":"Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya"},{"id":"17968294","text":"The A1 is a motorway in the Netherlands.

The MIME's Department of Geology and Mines and Department of Energy are responsible for developing the country's mineral resources, providing mining assistance to the private sector, and administering mining-related regulations and inspections. The Cambodian Development Council (CDC) is the government agency that grants exploration licenses to investors. If exploration is successful, investors are required to present a master project plan to the CDC before being granted a mining license. The amount of investment approved for mining projects by the CDC totaled $181 million in 2005. Minerals in the national economy The mining and quarry sector contributed only 0.39% of Cambodia's gross domestic product in 2005. The sector employed an estimated 19,000 people and accounted for only 0.2% of the country's total employment in 2005. Production According to official statistics of the Department of Geology and Mines, the mining activities in Cambodia during the past 2 years involved the production of laterite blocks (red soil), limestone for cement manufacturing, sand and gravel, and crude stone for construction material. Other minerals, such as gemstones and gold, reportedly were mined in the central province of Kampong Cham and the northeastern provinces of Mondol Kiri and Ratanakiri. Production data for gemstones, gold, and limestone, however, were not available. Industry structure Cambodia's mineral industry is still in its infant stage, and most mining companies are small-scale quarries that produce such construction materials as limestone, sand and gravel, and other construction aggregates. Production capacity data are not available for each of these small miners. Between 1994 and 2006, the MIME granted a total of 19 mineral exploration licenses to local and foreign companies, of which 11 projects were to explore for metallic minerals; 3, for iron ore; 2, for gold; 2, for bauxite; and 1, for coal. Between 2005 and 2006, the MIME had granted mining licenses to 11 companies; five of the licenses were for gemstone (zircon) projects, five were for limestone projects, and one was for a granite project. As of 2012, the MIME reported that a total of 91 domestic and foreign companies held mining and exploration licenses in Cambodia. A total of 139 exploration projects were authorized under the licenses granted, out of which 13 had been licensed to conduct mining projectshttp://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2012/myb3-2012-cb.pdf In early 2013, Chinese engineering firm Sinomach China Perfect Machinery Industry Corp and Cambodian Petrochemical Company announced they would jointly build a $2.3 billion oil refinery in Sihanoukville, which would be the first oil refinery in the country.https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL4N0SV4F120141105 CommoditiesGold= In February 2006, 100% of Liberty Mining International PTY. Ltd., which had 100% interest in two gold projects in the Ban Lung and the Ou Ya Dav/Andoung Meas areas in Ratanakiri Province, was acquired by Great Australian Resources Ltd. (GAR). During 2006, GAR reportedly undertook and completed an aeromagnetic survey of the two project areas and carried out an extensive soil geochemical sampling program in the Ban Lung area and a diamond drilling program in the Ou Ya Dav area. =Cement= An $80 million project to build a cement plant in Kampot Province, which was proposed by Siam Cement Group of Thailand, was approved by the government in late 2005. In January 2006, construction work on the 800,000 metric-ton-per-year cement plant was begun by Thai Siam Cement Industry in the Touk Meas, Kampot Province. The cement plant, which was located 130 km south of Phnom Penh, was scheduled to begin production during the second quarter of 2007. Kampot Cement Co. Ltd. and Tahi Boon Roon Cement Co. Ltd., which were licensed to quarry limestone in the areas of Tatung and Phnom Laag, would supply limestone to the cement plant. =Natural gas and petroleum= To further understand and expand the oil resources in Block A, which is located about 130 km off the west coast of Cambodia, Chevron Overseas Petroleum (Cambodia) Ltd. (COPCL) (an affiliated company of Chevron Corporation of the United States) and the Cambodian government signed a joint study agreement (JSA) in 2006. Under the JSA, COPCL was expected to drill five offshore exploration wells in Cambodia in 2006 and an additional five wells in 2007. Block A, which covers a 6,278-square- kilometer (km2) area of the Khmer Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, was owned by COPCL (55%), Moeco Cambodia Ltd. (an affiliate company of Japan's Mitsui Oil exploration Co.) (30%), and South Korea's GS Caltex Corp. (15%). In September 2006, French Total SA (TOT) and an unidentified Chinese oil company reportedly were competing for the rights to explore for potentially rich oil and gas reserves in Block B, which covers a 6,557-km2 area offshore the southeastern coast of Cambodia. According to a Cambodia Daily report, officials from Chinese National Petroleum Offshore Oil Co. (CNOOC) met with Cambodia's prime minister in July 2006 and expressed interest in Block B. According to an official of Cambodian National Petroleum Authority's petroleum exploration department, TOT was interested in the offshore field, but negotiations were slow. Onshore oil and gas exploration began in January 2012 by a Japanese firm (JOGMEC) in the Preah Vihear provinceas part of \\"Basic Agreement for the Study and Survey Program in Block 17\\". Block 17 consists of a total area of 6,500 square kilometers of hilly forest in Kampong Thom, Preah Vihear and Siem Reap provinces.http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/business/2012-01/31/c_131384271.htm See also *Economy of Cambodia *Natural resources of Cambodia *Child labour in Cambodia References Category:Mining in Cambodia Category:Economy of Cambodia Category:Fossil fuels in Cambodia ","title":"Mineral industry of Cambodia"},{"id":"17968385","text":"Lancashire Luck is a 1937 British comedy film directed by Henry Cass.

Born in London and based in Manchester, he was known in great part for his restrained and austere Greek-inspired classicism. He also designed a few buildings ‚Äì mainly churches ‚Äì in the Gothic style. He was also known for masterplanning and designing many of the houses in the exclusive Victoria Park estate. Early life and education Not much is known about Lane's early life, but he was born and educated in London, was a Quaker and in 1817, he began studying at the famous √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and was a pupil of the French architect, Achille Lecl√®re, who made a noted restoration of the Pantheon in 1813. Work and professional life Salford Town HallAfter Paris, Lane moved to Manchester in 1821, set up practice and was appointed Land Surveyor to the Police Commissioners of Chorlton Row (as was). Much of Lane's work was civic and governmental in nature, and he was commissioned to design a town hall just off Chapel St for the Salford local government in 1825. Later, in 1830, the Chorlton Row Police Commissioners ‚Äì essentially the administrative body of the Chorlton Row township ‚Äì commissioned Lane to design them a town hall on Cavendish Street. The Chorlton Town Hall was built by David Bellhouse; Lane and Bellhouse would later work together on other projects. Indeed, Lane had a close connection with the Bellhouse family, with Lane transferring his share in the Portico Library to David Bellhouse's son, Edward Taylor Bellhouse in 1834. The old town hall is now used by Manchester Metropolitan University. Lane's notable ecclesiastical structures include the Royal Chapel of St John the Baptist, St John's, Isle of Man‚Äîbuilt after Lane's design won an architectural competition set up by the church authorities. The chapel is the national church of the Isle of Man, and functions as the seat of parliament for one day of the year; St George's Church, Chester Road (with Francis Goodwin); the Church of St Mary with St Peter, Church Street, Oldham; and appropriately, the Friends' Meeting House, Mount Street, Manchester. Lane was one of the defendant architects in the landmark case Foss v Harbottle (1843) 67 ER 189, which established the precedent that where a wrong is alleged to have been done to a company, the proper claimant is the company itself. =Manchester Architectural Society= By the 1830s, Richard Lane was undoubtedly Manchester's most prominent architect and in 1837, he was one of the founders ‚Äì and was the first president of ‚Äì the Manchester Architectural Society. This was Manchester's first architectural learned society. Students A number of distinguished students were apprenticed to the practice of Richard Lane and Peter B. Alley; the most notable and celebrated being fellow Quaker, Alfred Waterhouse, who was articled to Lane and Alley in 1845. Other distinguished students to complete articles under Richard Lane include the architect, archaeologist, and writer Richard Popplewell Pullan; and the theatre architect, amateur actor, writer, and a former vice-president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Alfred Darbyshire, who developed what was known as the 'Irving- Darbyshire Safety Theatre' with his friend, the actor Henry Irving. Later life Richard Lane died in Ascot, Berkshire on 25 May 1880, at the age of 85.

France He was born Nicolas Briot at Damblain, in Lorraine, in the Vosges department of France, a frontier town famous for its bellfounding and metalworking industries. He is one of a distinguished Huguenot family of patternmakers, diecutters and craftsmen in metal in the 16th and 17th centuries, whose members included Francois Briot, master pewterer and medallist represented in the main national collections (uncle of Nicolas), and Etienne Briot, engraver. His father, Didier, and brother, Isaac, were both notable medallists. After serving his apprenticeship, Briot travelled to Montb√©liard and Langres in 1599, where he produced his first portrait engravings. He migrated to Paris in 1605, where he was appointed engraver-general (chief engraver) at the Monnaie de Paris (Paris Mint) in 1605‚Äì6, and produced coronation medals for the young Louis XIII. He began to experiment with the mechanisation of French coin production, developing improvements in the 'balancier' presses introduced from Nuremberg in Germany for striking coins and promoting a 'mill and engines which will prevent counterfeiting' which he submitted to the Paris authorities in 1615. In that year he published 'Raisons, moyens et propositions pour faire toutes les monnaies du royaume, a l'avenir, uniformes, et pour cesser toutes fabrications, etc.' He promoted the coining press to replace the traditional hammer-striking methods of coinage production, the prototype of which is generally attributed to the engraver Antoine Brucher who had first tried it about 1553 for the coining of counters in the court of Henri III. Briot, however, was unable to convince the French government to adopt his new technology, and was accused of fraud. England and Scotland Briot fled to England in 1625, pursued by creditors, and offered his services and machinery to Charles I of England. He met with more success than in France, and in 1626 he was commissioned to make puncheons and dies for 'certain pieces of largesse of gold and silver in memory of his Majesty's coronation', producing his successful Coronation Medal, the first of the sequence of medals for Charles I, in that year. This established his reputation, when he was given 'power and authority to frame and engrave the first designs and effigies of the king's image ... to serve in coins of gold and silver'. He went on to produce a considerable number of dies and moulds for medals and coins in the following years. In 1633, he was sent to Scotland to prepare and coin the coronation pieces of Charles I, as well as the Scottish Coronation Medal (1633). His Coronation medals and the 'Dominion of the Seas' medal (1630) demonstrated his artistic skill and the technical superiority of the new coining machinery. On the death of Sir John Foulis, Master of the Mint in Scotland, Briot was appointed to the office in 1635, and superintended the Scottish coinage for several years. Briot was recalled to England by the king and was appointed chief engraver to the Royal Mint in 1633. On the outbreak of the English Civil War he followed Charles I to York and Oxford; 'he took possession of the punches, roller instruments, and coining apparatus at the Tower, by order of his Majesty, and had them removed, trussed up in saddles, at the hazard of his life, for the purpose of continuing the coining operations in the cause of the King'. He travelled to France in 1641 and 1645, sending presses to his brother Isaac, now in a senior position at the Paris Mint. He died on Christmas Eve 1646.

As a young man, he was ordained a Lutheran pastor, and travelled to Canada where he met Cecil's mother Florence Kendall who was serving in the Salvation Army. They married and began a life as missionaries in Africa, first along the east coast and later settling in South Africa. Cecil was their fourth child. He remembers drawing as a young boy, and being commended at school for his talent and creativity. He also remembers the freedom of playing in the streets and countryside, of taking a donkey to the rivers on the outskirts of Johannesburg, of fishing and exploring the old artesian wells and stone ruins of iron-age settlements. He remembers this highveld landscape as a rough place inscribed and abstracted with traces of the past. He recalls the quality of light and space and the hot African sun ‚Äì a place that was to make a powerful impression on the development of his creative style. After finishing school, Cecil worked for some months in a draughtsman's office, leaving this in 1944 to join the South African forces in Europe. He fought in Egypt and in Italy, and there again, the landscape of the desert and of the Apennines with their decimated buildings on the top of hills and the ruins of bombardment was to contribute to his developing sensitivity to light and space and place. At the end of the war, Cecil spent time in Florence, drawn to the place in a way that made it almost impossible for him to return home. Here he saw the work of Masaccio, Giotto and Donatello ‚Äì artists whose work was to become a major inspiration to him. Europe was, however, starkly contrasting to Africa. Colour and shape was different as was the experience of time and place. In Europe history is, in one sense, constantly on display; in South Africa, much is hidden beneath the surface. In Europe there is a sense of human closeness, even claustrophobia; in South Africa space is almost endless. He was fascinated by this closeness, by the rich heritage of Greek mythology and Greek and Roman architecture and art. He was nourished by the space, its harshness and its sense of wild mystery. After returning to Johannesburg, Cecil Skotnes studied at the University of the Witwatersrand completing a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in 1950. He met Thelma Carter at that time, they were married in 1951, and he returned with her to Europe where they stayed for nine months. Again, Europe was to have a profound influence on him through the experience of the Egyptian, Assyrian and pre- classical Greek art that he saw in places such as the British Museum. It was, however, the colonial collections from Africa that were to have the greater impact. Cecil may well have stayed in Europe were it not for this, but instead he was drawn back to Africa, and like his father many years before him he made South Africa his permanent home.  Artistic career  Initially Skotnes painted but was soon encouraged by a friend, the master goldsmith and art collector Egon Guenther to try woodcutting. It proved to be a perfect medium for him. His early woodcuts were of landscapes, influenced by the work of Willie Baumeister and Rudolph Sharpf, but his contrasting experiences of the European and the African landscape drove him to try to develop a genre and a style that was uniquely South African. This challenge was not only iconographical, it was formal too, and the medium of woodcutting offered Cecil the possibility of finding new form for the symbolism he increasingly began to attach to a particularly local vision. Though Cecil was later to return to painting, woodcutting and engraving has been an enduringly loved medium. In later years he used it less for land and figure-scapes than as a medium for narrative, and it was in colour woodcut that he produced ground-breaking portfolios of image and text around the themes of neglected South African histories. Cecil's early use of the medium of woodcutting soon translated into a focus on the block itself. Instead of cutting the block and then using it as a means to an end ‚Äì the print ‚Äì he began to colour and shape the blocks, using them as a surface for paint and dry pigment. He also began to work in mural, using a technique of coloured cement laid into lime plaster which he would then engrave away exposing layers of colour and incised lines. He carried out many public commissions in this medium. Along with the changes in process and technique, came a shift from an interest in the landscape and the figure within the landscape, to a concern with some of the powerful narratives of South African history. One of these was the story, still relatively unknown amongst non-Zulu speaking South Africans, of the great Zulu king Shaka who was assassinated in 1828. It had served the purposes of the apartheid government to suppress African histories, or tell them in such a way as to cast them as barbaric or savage. Skotnes' work around the story of Shaka showed, by contrast, a heroic figure, comparable to the great heroes of classical Greece and his depictions of the figure of Shaka contributed to shifting public attitudes to the role of the great nation states in pre-colonial South Africa.  Move to Cape Town  In the late 1970s Cecil moved from the highveld to Cape Town. This represented a radical shift in environment and a move to a more contemplative way of interacting with the landscape. The Cape is suffused with blues and violets, the light is softer, more influenced by rolling cloud banks that drift in from the north west, and the greys and greens of the sea. At this time he made a series of landscapes influenced by the ocean and at the same time he recalled the landscapes he had visited in earlier years. Included in these were the memories of the Brandberg, a great mountain which rises out of the Namib desert and which was the home of aboriginal hunter-gatherers who left their own paintings on its rock surfaces many thousands of years ago. In these works Cecil reaffirmed that ours is a landscape not only full of the colour and heat and light of Africa, but a landscape full of history and memory ‚Äì places most alive to the human drama they have witnessed. Through all these years Cecil Skotnes has been as well known as a teacher and mentor as he has as an artist. If one could single out the most outstanding influence his parents' lives had on him, then it is surely this: the value of one's achievements can be measured in the things that one leaves behind. For Cecil, this is to be understood not only as one's material effects‚Äîin his case a huge corpus of work which has contributed to the global imaginary, and to the way in which South Africans perceive their own creative heritage‚Äîbut also in the way in which one is able to change the lives of others for the better. For Cecil, his lifelong mission has been to nurture talent and encourage creativity, particularly in places where the apartheid government had deliberately excluded this possibility. The effect of this has been a major contribution to the diversity of South African art.  Polly Street Centre  In the mid 1950s Cecil accepted a post as the Cultural Recreation Officer at the \\"Non-Europeans Affairs Department\\" in Johannesburg. His major task in this position was to run the Polly Street Centre, which was concerned with both education and recreation for black adults and children. The centre hosted choirs and bands, there was boxing and judo and ballroom dancing. When he took this job, however, there was only one art student enrolled, yet today, as a result of his role in the Centre, Polly Street is almost only remembered as an art school. As the director of Polly Street, he travelled between the city and the townships where he facilitated many cultural activities. Much of his work happened after hours when adults were free from work to undertake leisure activities. While he carried out this work as part of his job, his own interest and ultimate aim was to develop Polly Street into a Centre where art was taken seriously and not just seen as a hobby. At the time there were no art schools to which blacks were permitted entrance and universities were not allowed to accept black students. Cecil wanted to create a place where he could train professionals and give talented young black adults a chance at a career in art. This initiative, which was to launch the careers of many black artists, was no easy endeavour. Resources were limited and classes were restricted to after working hours. Students had to make use of cheap paper and poster paints. At the same time, the authorities were hostile to individual attempts to educate blacks, though officials were reluctant to visit the place at night and so, initially at least, kept away. Cecil looked for sponsorship and found companies willing to support paper and other art materials. A local food store donated soup and this, along with the background sounds of jazz from the hall next door, began to attract increasing numbers of students to the Centre. In addition to teaching classes Cecil tried to find ways to develop a sense of professionalism amongst his prot√©g√©s, and it is here that his work as an artist and teacher/advocate of black art in South Africa came together in interesting ways. While it is true that as an artist the landscape and the figure within it has been Cecil's abiding theme, it has not been the only one to absorb his creative mind. Being raised in the home of missionaries and with an enduring love for Catholic Italy, Cecil has had a greater than average exposure to the traditions of the Church. It was to the church that Cecil first looked to expose his more talented students to the opportunities of the professional artist. The first significant commission Skotnes secured was for Sydney Kumalo (later to become a well known and highly respected artist) who, along with other Polly Street students and Cecil's help, decorated the Catholic Church of Kroonstad. Other commissions to make sculptures and stations of the cross for various churches followed, and soon a growing number of black artist were making and marketing their work. The ripple effect was profound. Skotnes arranged for more commissions and exhibitions to take place and by the 1960s many galleries were actively seeking the work of black artists. By the time the apartheid authorities effectively shut down Polly Street (such a thriving centre could not be tolerated in a \\"white\\" area), there was a prosperous community of black artists.  Later life  In his later years, Skotnes had begun to reflect more on his own origins. The journey of his father from Norway to Canada and then to Africa, the death of his uncle on the Spitzbergen, the cold dim landscape of the Arctic Circle and its contrast to the heat of the South African highveld, and the damp richness of the Cape coast. He has produced works on these themes, most notably two portraits of the dead uncle, a trapper who was found, frozen in his hut in the company of the bears, foxes and birds he had hunted. But his last works are about none of these things in particular, yet about all of them in general. In these engraved paintings can be discerned the shadows of the painted altarpieces of the Renaissance, of lost kingdoms and of ruined cities of the Mediterranean. These pictures hold the memories of the gold death masks of Mycenae, the bronze figures of Delphi, the stained pottery and the carved sticks of the early agriculturalists of eastern Africa. In their line and gestures, they lament the lives lost, the sacrifice and cruelty and the potential not realised by the miserable system of separate development that held South Africa in its grip for half a century. Above all they celebrate art as the realisation of the most valuable of human all human experiences and the one that should be most accessible to everyone ‚Äì the imagination. Cecil Skotnes's career has been a rich and rewarding one from which many have benefited ‚Äì his family, his students, young artists, his friends and those who have bought and bartered his work. His contribution has been recognised by all those who love him and his art, by universities who have conferred honorary degrees on him (UCT, Wits and Rhodes) and by the State President with the award of a gold medal for service to the country and, in particular, for his contribution to the de-racialision of South African art. Musical reflections Skotnes's artworks have inspired musical compositions by Peter Klatzow: his A Sense of Place for marimba and cello was inspired by two artworks, The Mask and Shaka's Victory Dance.

The club is one of the oldest clubs in the Maltese Islands and it was founded in 1936 and is named after the village. Xagƒßra United are currently playing in the Gozo Football League First Division. Holders of 6 First Division Titles and 8 Second Division Titles. Early History It can be said that the establishment of the Boy Scout Movement in Xaghra in 1933 was the prelude to an activity in a number of cultural fields. Among these is the founding of the Xaghra Band Club in 1934. Two years later, in 1936, Xaghra saw the birth of their first football team. The committee within the Boy Scout Movement, which was in charge of the football team, was set up in February/March 1936. The team was named Xaghra Scouts Team with the first coach being ƒ†u≈ºeppi Sultana. This was made possible by the initiative of Brother Hersey who also encouraged other Boy Scout movements in various Gozitan villages to imitate his initiative. The meeting place of the Xaghra Boy Scout Movement also served as the first football club. The famous Xaghra square also served as the first stadium which housed the training sessions of the village's football team. First Honours The first footballing success to come Xaghra's way, during that time under the name of Xaghra Blue Stars, reached its climax when the team won the \\"Captain Renton Cup\\" with which they became Gozitan champions for the season 1939-1940. The football team remained intact in the following years despite the dire times of the great war between 1939-1945. It is worth mentioning that at this time no competitive games were played between the villages. After the black clouds of the war passed, the football teams in Gozo became active again and the championships with the first competition being for the ‚ÄúGalea‚Äôs Cup‚Äù. The central committee of the football team continued with its hard work for the benefit of this popular sport in Xaghra. Meanwhile, the team changed its name to \\"Xaghra Young Stars\\" with its club following in the footsteps of the \\"Victory\\" band club in the square. =1960's= After the team had been relegated to the second division they returned to the top division. This happened after winning the second division and K/O Championships in the 1961/62 season. Another match in which the Xaghra Young Stars honored themselves as well as their village was the one played with the Floriana Football Club on Sunday, December 30, 1962. As the winners of the Gozo second division championship and Floriana championships of Malta, a friendly match was played where the team from Xaghra lost with the score of 1-0 after a stupendous display and a strong opposition against an excellent team. The 1963-1964 season saw the Xaghra Young Stars return to glory when the Gozo Championships were held for the second time in their history after a quarter of a century of competitive games in Gozo. The match was against Victoria Hotspurs and in it Xaghra won with a score of 2-1. An interesting fact was that the game was a replay after the first one was won by Victoria Hotspurs but due to the fact that there was only one linesman it was played again after a protest. Another success of the Young Stars team towards the end of their work was with winning the \\"British-American Shield\\" in the 1968-1969 season. Towards the end of the 60's, the village of Xaghra saw the establishment of another football team called \\"Xaghra Blue Stars.\\" The location of the club of this new team was where it is to this day, in Triq l-Arƒãipriet Dun ƒ†u≈ºeppi Diacono. Despite their efforts, the two Xaghra teams did not start to show much positive results so much so that in 1971, the two teams came together. A clear example of this is the current name of the Xaghra team, \\"Xaghra United F.C.\\" The club of the new team remained that of Triq l-Arƒãipriet Dun ƒ†u≈ºeppi Diacono. The Xaghra team under the new name immediately started with its successes when it was promoted to the top division. In the same season the team won the Knock-Out cup of the same division and the Good Conduct Cup. The years 1972/1973 brought with them the success of the ESSO Cup, a competition that was won only once by the Xaghra team in the last year it was played. =1970's & 1980's= The years between 1973 and 1986 were not very glorious times for the blue and black team with the majority of the seasons in the second division. In the 1986/1987 season, the team gained promotion to the first division with a young, and enthusiastic team. Under the leadership of the late Mr. Horace Mercieca this was to be the foundation of a team that brought glory back to the village. This work continued to bear fruit in the 1987/1988 season when the Xaghra United team won the Gemeharija Cup for the first time when they won against Sannat Lions with the score of 1-0 on Sunday, May 8, 1988. =Golden Season - 1988/1989= The 1988/1989 season is a season that will never be forgotten by the people of Xaghra and their athletes and will remain inscribed in golden letters in the history of the club. On June 12, 1988, the club was reopened with renovations to make it more relaxing for its players and fans. This was the beginning of a year full of work that brought success in five competitions, i.e. each competition that the Xaghri team entered. United under Horace, a team that was made up of all Xaghrin players, won the first division championship along with the Independence Cup, Rothmans Cup, Gemeharija Cup and Super Cup. Victoria Hotspurs were the biggest rivals this season due to the fact that out of four in five competitions they were the finalists for winning the titles. It was only in the Gemeharija Cup when Xaghra United defeated a different opponent, this time, the Xewkija Tigers in the final. The success of this season was marked by big celebrations after twenty-five years of waiting for the championship to be won. =1990's= After a season without honors, that of 1989/1990, the 1990/1991 season brought success back on the hill of Casal Caccia, this time with winning the Independence Cup and the Gemeharija Cup. This was to be the beginning of another very glorious year for Xaghra United, two consecutive years when the team was crowned with the title of the first division. This time under the cap of Mr. Frankie Muscat, the whole youth team from Xaghra, won the 1991 and 1992 championships together with the Independence Cup in the same year and the championship and that of the Gemeharija Cup in the 1992 and 1993 season. This was the first and only time in the club‚Äôs history that two consecutive championships were won. The people of Xaghri were in seventh heaven and were seen celebrating beautifully after winning three championships in five seasons. The work of the committee together with the coaches and players culminated four seasons later when the team had a wonderful season again in the years 1997/1998. This time under the guidance of Eucharist Mercieca, with the presence of two foreign players and some players from outside the village who were brought in to strengthen the team, the championship and GFA won again. Cup. After a hard-fought match against Nadur Youngsters which ended with the score of 3-1 and which will be remembered for the numerous presence of the Xaghrin fans, the people celebrated with great success the success of the sixth championship and the last one until today. The following season, 1998/1999, brought the success of the GFA Cup again, but since then it has been a difficult time for the Xaghra United team. After being relegated to the second division, the team won the championship again with the Knock Out in the years 2001/2002 under the leadership of Horace Mercieca. =Recent History= After four seasons in the first division where there was also an attempt to win the championship, in 2008 the team was relegated to the second division again. After full work between the committee, coaches and players, during the 2014/2015 season, Xaghra United returned to where it deserves to be. After winning the Knock Out Cup against Kerƒãem Ajax, with a decider match against ≈ªebbuƒ° Rovers, the Xaghra United Football Club closed the championship chapter when they won with a result of 3-1 and ended up winning the title and promotion for the first division. Xaghra United Football Club also won the 2018-2019 2nd Division Championship and are currently playing in the Gozitan 1st Division. During the 2019/2020 season, the team managed a six-placed final position after the League was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. =Honours= First Division: :*Champions (6): 1939-1940; 1963-1964; 1988-1989; 1991-1992; 1992-1993; 1997-1998; Second Division: :*Champions (8): 1961-1962; 1968-1969; 1971-1972; 1978-1979; 2003-2004; 2010-2011; 2015-2016; 2018-2019; G.F.A.

It was chaired by Leo Tindemans, former Prime Minister of Belgium; secretary of the Group was Sammy van Tuyll van Serooskerken. The Group consisted of 48 politicians, civil servants and experts from all member states and from all major political affiliations. The members of the Group had different backgrounds, different views on government and different views on Europe, such as how far it should be integrated and how decisions should be made. They shared one view in common: the decision about the future of the European Union cannot be taken without the involvement of the citizens of its member states. The Group stressed the need to discuss the institutional framework of the European Union with a view to the enlargement of the Union. It pointed out that if the countries of Central and Eastern Europe would join the Union, membership could eventually reach as many as thirty countries. Such an enlargement will require effective decision-making procedures, but at the same time there would be a growing risk that people will feel dissociated from decision taking in such a large organisation. Members of the Group were, amongst others: Jens-Peter Bonde, Elmar Brok, Bill Cash, Fran√ßois Froment-Meurice, √âlisabeth Guigou, Ernst Hirsch Ballin, Fientje Moerman, Richard Portes, Nicolas Schmitt, Leo Tindemans (chairman), Sammy van Tuyll van Serooskerken, (secretary of the Group), Frank Vibert. The Group wrote a report, ‚ÄúEurope: Your choice‚Äù, describing five options for tomorrow's Europe. The five scenarios range from a less integrated Europe to the equivalent of the United States of Europe. The scenarios can be briefly described as follows. * Scenario 0: The current situation, presented for comparison * Scenario 1: Several modifications to the current situation, discussed separately. * Scenario 2: The Commission is the main policy-making body in the Union, accountable to a bi-cameral Parliament. The Council assigns policy areas to the Union level and applies a subsidiarity test. * Scenario 3: The Council has the primary responsibility for taking the initiative in public policy; the Commission has an administrative task; the Parliament is bi- cameral, with one Chamber, consisting of Members of the national Parlia¬¨ments, ensuring that European measures are really necessary. *Scenario 4: The Commission becomes a \\"European government\\", accountable to a bi-cameral European Parliament; the Council is transformed into one of its Chambers, the European Senate. *Scenario 5: The Council is the decision making body; the Commission gives administrative support; the Parliament has an advisory role. It was not the aim of the Tindemans Group to specifically recommend any of these scenarios. It is up to the reader to draw his own conclusions. The report of the Tindemans Group was presented to the President of the European Commission, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Council in December 1995. It was published in English, French, German and Spanish.  References  1\\\\. Tindemans group (1995). Europe: Your Choice. Harvill Press.

Cirio, Baldassare & Serafino Verazzi, Pittori del lago Maggiore Due vite tra Verbano, Milano e America Latina Alberti Libraio - Magazzeno Storico Verbanese - La Compagnia de' Bindoni, 2006 and participated in several exhibitions in Turin and Milan. He took his inspiration from history (painting a fresco on The life of Leonardo da Vinci) and religion (The Holy Family in Egypt, the 1851 The parable of the Samaritan and the 1854 Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino presented by Bramante to Pope Julius II). His masterpiece (now at the Museum of the Risorgimento in Milan) is considered to be Episodio delle Cinque Giornate (Combattimento a Palazzo Litta) - known in English as Episode from the Five Days (Fighting at Palazzo Litta). Heavily involved in the Risorgimento, he was hunted down by the Austrian authorities in 1848 and forced to live under severe proscriptions. He left for Argentina in 1856, where he taught (the Argentine painter C√°ndido L√≥pez was his student) and painted local personalities,Portrait of CRISTINA CASTRO RAMOS MEXIA DE PE√ëA at the Museo de Arte Hispanoamericano Isaac Fern√°ndez Blanco de Buenos Aires scenes of everyday life and history paintings of political or military events. He also decorated the original Teatro Col√≥n.Storia degli Italiani nell' Argentina, by Giuseppe Parisi; Enrico Voghera, editor; Rome (1907); page 84. He returned to Italy and installed himself near Lake Maggiore, and the landscape of that area proved a new source of inspiration for paintings that he then produced with his son Serafino (1875‚Äì1945).

He also organized the first expression of consecrated life among the women of China. He was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1954. Early life Moye was born on 27 January 1730 in the village of Cutting, then located within the Bailiwick of Dieuze, within the autonomous Duchy of Lorriane, a part of the Holy Roman Empire, now in the French Department of Moselle. He was the sixth of the thirteen children of Jean Moye and Anne Catharine Demange,Maes, Camillus. \\"Ven. John Martin Moye.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 29 July 2019 part of a long-established and prosperous farming family of the region. The fervent Catholic faith of the family can be seen in the fact that, apart from Jean-Martin, a younger brother also became a priest, as well as five of his first cousins, and later two of his nephews. Moye had an uneventful childhood, growing up on his family's extensive holdings. He received his basic education from his older brother, Jean-Jacques, a seminarian, who taught him until his untimely death in 1744 at the age of 24. Moye completed his education at the College of Pont-√†-Mousson, following which he studied philosophy at the Jesuit College of Strasbourg. In the fall of 1751 he then entered the local diocesan Seminary of Saint-Simon in Metz, the same one at which his brother had studied. There one of his professors included Canon Fran√ßois Thi√©baut, a noted Biblical scholar of the era, who would later serve as the representative of the local clergy to the Estates General. Priesthood Moye was ordained a priest on 9 March 1754 by Louis-Joseph de Montmorency-Laval, the Bishop of Metz. Upon his ordination, he was granted a benefice by King Stanislas Leszczynski, the last Duke of Lorraine, of the income generated from the Chapel of St. Andrew in the cemetery of Dieuze. This income allowed him to accept the poorly paid office of Vicar for three different parishes in Metz, one of which, the Parish of the Holy Cross (), had Canon Thi√©baut as pastor. He then undertook a number of different ministries as part of his service, among them acting as confessor for the seminarians of Saint-Simon. The parish extended well beyond the city limits, and Moye undertook the spiritual care of the members of the parish living in the small and isolated hamlets in the countryside. Through this service he became aware of the need of education for the girls of the region, who lacked any access to schools. He conceived of a project to remedy this situation by placing volunteer teachers in these rural locations. The first volunteer was a working class woman, Marguerite Lecomte, whom he stationed in the hamlet of Saint- Hubert on 14 January 1762. She would remain in this post without disturbance throughout the upheavals of the French Revolution. Volunteers were quickly sent out to various other locations, going out as far as Freiburg im Breisgau, then in the Habsburg dominion. Writer Out of the desire to provide the faithful of the parish with means to deepen their spiritual lives, Moye began to publish some tracts, in collaboration with a younger colleague, the Abb√© Louis Jobal de Pagny (1737‚Äì1766). The first, in 1762, was a pamphlet entitled Du soin extr√®me qu'on doit avoir du Bapt√™me des enfants. It treated the baptism of newborn infants, especially stillborn babies. It was a development of Abr√©g√© de l‚ÄôEmbryologie sacr√©e, a work by a Sicilian moral theologian, Francesco Cangiamiglia, which had just been published in Paris, having originally been published in Sicily in 1745 with ecclesiastical approval. In 1764 they re-published an older work by the 17th-century spiritual writer, Cardinal Pierre de B√©rulle, √âl√©vation √† Dieu sur le myst√®re de l‚ÄôIncarnation (Being raised to God through the mystery of the Incarnation) with their commentaries on the text. Later, after the unexpected death of Jobal, Moye published a small pamphlet entitled Recueil de diverses pratiques de pi√©t√© (A Collection of various pious Practices). Opposition Moye's work with rural education and his writings provoked criticism from certain elements of the city. He was accused with recklessness for his sending young women to live in the isolated hamlets of the countryside. He was further accused of rigorism in his dealing with penitents, as well as making unfair criticisms of both the clergy and of midwives in his writings on Baptism. They prevailed on Bishop de Montmorency-Laval to take action against the two authors. As a result, in May 1762, the bishop ordered Moye to suspend the sending out of volunteers ‚Äì though those already in the countryside were left in their situations. He further transferred him from Metz to serve as vicar of Dieuze. As this was his native region, Moye did not consider it a punishment, but worried about the future of his volunteers, who were coming to be called the \\"poor Sisters\\". His coworkers in the project assured him that the setback was only temporary. Moye was again accused of an extreme rigidity in his dealing with the people of the parish, such as those who came to him for confession. He also opposed the traditional festivities celebrated by the peasants during the year. This time the bishop responded more severely, and, during Holy Week of 1767, the most sacred period of the Christian year, Moye was suspended from his post. Over the course of the next year and a half, until 1768, he moved from parish to parish, providing the pastors with what help he could provide. Finally he was given refuge by the Grand Prior of the Abbey of Saint-Di√©, an abbey nullius, independent of local bishops, where he was asked to help run a kind of minor seminary. Missionary During his time at the abbey, Moye had two important developments in his life, the first being making the acquaintance of a local priest, Antoine Raulin, who had worked to develop education in the region. He also came to the decision to offer his services as a missionary to Asia. That following October he enrolled in the seminary of the Foreign Missions Society of Paris, which specialized in that work. He returned to Lorraine the following spring, where he visited the volunteers, now a religious institute called the Sisters of Providence, as well as preaching parish missions throughout the region. Apparently believing that he would not return from China, where he was to be sent, he formally renounced his family inheritance. After completing the training period at the seminary, Moye was assigned to serve in the Apostolic Vicariate of Sichuan. He then put the care of the Sisters of Providence in the hands of two colleagues who were admirers of their work, one of them being Raulin. He also appointed Marie Morel as their first Mother Superior. He left France for China on 30 December 1771. He would spend ten years in the Chinese missions, not returning to Paris until 6 June 1784. Nine years of mission work, frequently interrupted by persecution and imprisonment, made him realize the necessity of Chinese help. In 1782 he founded the \\"Christian Virgins\\", religious women following the rules of the Congregation of Providence at home, devoting themselves to the care of the sick and to the Christian instruction of Chinese women and children in their own homes.  Death  Exhausted and ill, Moye returned to France in 1784. He resumed the direction of the Sisters of Divine Providence and evangelized Lorraine and Alsace by preaching missions. The French Revolution of 1791 drove him into exile, and with his Sisters he retired to Trier. After the capture of the city by the French troops, typhoid fever broke out and, helped by his Sisters, he devoted himself to hospital work. He contracted the disease and died in 1793. Moye was buried in the cemetery of the cathedral. The cemetery, however, was closed in 1808 and paved over to form the Konstantinsplatz of the city. His grave has never been identified.

Early years and family  Benyamin was born to Turkish parents in Bremen, Germany. His father went in the 1970s to Germany as a tourist taking his musical instrument saz with him. He stayed there, formed a musical group and earned his life playing music at weddings. Later, his mother followed his father in Germany. As Benyamin was three years old, the family with two boys returned home. Benyamin spent his childhood in Ak≈üehir, a town in Konya Province, where the alleged tomb of Nasreddin Hoca is located. During his primary school years, he contributed to family's budget by selling food and drinks at street. Benyamin S√∂nmez grew up in a family that performed music altogether at home. As his father played tambur and his mother sang, his elder brother Mehmet and he accompanied their parents by playing kanun and darbuka. He remembers that his childhood toys were musical instruments like kanun, oud, c√ºmb√º≈ü, electronic organ, darbuka, tambur, saz, ney as well as guitar. His father, a talented musician without any musical education, made Benyamin love music and introduced him in playing various musical instruments. As a child, he accompanied his father at his father's musical performances with his group on stage at weddings. Benyamin envied his father, and imitated him at home after their return. A member of his father's musical group became aware of his elder brother's musical talent and advised to send him to conservatory. His brother Mehmet S√∂nmez studied playing contrabass at Ankara State Conservatory. After winning an international prize, his brother went to Belgium to play with the Royal Orchestra. He is currently a member of the Turkish Presidential Symphony Orchestra. Education Benyamin was a primary school pupil as his brother Mehmet studied at the conservatory in Ankara. Mehmet listened to classical music at home when he was on vacation. Once, Benyamin was very impressed by the music of Shostakovich, which his brother listened to at home. Mehmet, noticing his brother's interest in classical music, took him to Ankara. At the age of 13, Benyamin took an admission test for the conservatory at the Hacettepe University. He failed the test and his brother was told by the jury that Benyamin was not talented for music. Returning home, Benyamin was eager to study music. He took the test again the next year, and this time he passed. He was asked what musical instrument he liked to play. He replied \\"Violoncello\\", because its name sounded nice to him, even though he had never seen an example of it. The jury looked at his fingers and approved his choice. He saw a cello for the first time in the conservatory's string instrument workshop. He says he would not have complained if he had to study viola or violin instead of cello. In his first years at the conservatory, he surprised everyone by playing works that were actually reserved for higher classes. He used to start the day by playing Dvo≈ô√°k and finish with Elgar. Benyamin was very impressed by Rostropovich. Even he admired Heinrich Schiff, Andr√© Navarra, Pierre Fournier and Pablo Casals much, he used to try imitate Rostropovich. At the age of 17, he decided to take part at a cello contest at the Bilkent University, which had more challenging requirements for musical repertoire than at the conservatory. He practiced for four months for this contest, instead of preparing for the examination that was scheduled one day before it. Benyamin failed that examination, but he won the first prize the next day at the contest in front of a jury composed of an American cellist G√ºrer Aykal and Doƒüan Cangal, who was a member of the examination commission the day before. S√∂nmez says by winning the first prize, he was able to save the honor of his cello teacher Nuray E≈üen. From then on, he practiced much more seriously. For further studies, Benyamin was recommended to Natalia Gutman by Yuri Bashmet via pianist Gulmira Tokombaeva, a teacher from Kyrgyzstan at the Ankara conservatory. Between 2003 and 2007, he studied under Natalia Gutman, first at Stuttgart Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Germany and later at Moscow Conservatory in Russia. In Moscow, he was frequently invited to her home, where he had the opportunity to meet notable writers, artists and musicians including Yuri Bashmet, Viktor Tretiakov, Vasily Lobanov, Eliso Virsaladze, Mischa Maisky, Kurt Masur. Career By the time, he was 17, having proved his superior musical skills, he came first in the national cello contest. He was given a place within BBC soloists in 2000. He won a special award at the International Young Concert Artists Contest organized in Leipzig, Germany in 2001. Benyamin Sonmez earned a special prize in the 2006 Adam International Cello Festival and Competition in New Zealand]. S√∂nmez, receiving great attention and admiration at each country he visited, had a rich repertoire from Bach to Sofia Gubaidulina. He also had master class performances with the great cellists like Rostropovich, David Geringas, Philippe Muller, Alexander Rudin, Stefan Popov, Frans Helmerson, Ruben Dobrovsky, Mikl√≥s Per√©nyi and Yo-Yo Ma. Sonmez has also studied authentic performance of the Cello Suites of Bach, together with the master of baroque cello Anner Bylsma. Of the important music festivals, he was invited to the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival and Oleg Kagan International Music Festival in Germany, the International Adam Cello Festival & Competition in New Zealand, RNCM Manchester International Cello Festival in the United Kingdom and Istanbul International Music Festival in Turkey. His last invitation was to the 80th birthday of M. Rostropovich in 2007. Sonmez, who has performed duo concerts with Oxana Yablonskaya, played his art at important musical centers such as Vienna, Paris, Amsterdam, Moscow, New York City, Washington D.C. and Istanbul. He was living in istanbul, Turkey. His repertoire included modern composers including Dmitri Shostakovich, Alfred Schnittke, Giya Kancheli, Sofia Gubaidulina, √Åstor Piazzolla and Zolt√°n Kod√°ly as well as the composers of Baroque and other eras. He played an 18th-century Matteo Goffriller cello from Venice, Italy. Death Young cellist Benyamin Sonmez died on December 1, 2011, at the age of 28, after a heart attack in Ankara. Following a funeral ceremony at the Hacettepe University Conservatory, his body was transferred to Fethiye, Muƒüla Province, where he was laid to rest.

If in any doubt as to the voltage of your Yaqin, remove the cover from the power transformer, Yaqin typically stamps the primary voltage on the top.

It may derive from the Chinese musical instrument Yazheng or may also relate to the Arabic word Yaqin meaning certainty. The 'Ya' character () means 'elegant' or 'proper'. The 'qin' character () could easily be a family name. It is also notable that the logo contains the Greek letters 'Œ®' in place of the 'Y' and 'Œò' in place of 'Q'. This has led to many confusing alternative references on the web to both 'Yaoin' and the hypercorrected 'Yaquin'. In fact, however, it is the manufacturer's family patronymic.

It prefers open riverbanks where it lives under rocks, usually less than 5 metres from the river. Its colouring allows it to blend in with river stones. Normally nocturnal, it sits and waits for its prey after dark, and can survive for short periods under the water.  Taxonomy  Dolomedes aquaticus was described in 1887 by Peter Goyen.Goyen, P. (1888). Descriptions of new species of New Zealand Araneae. Transactions of the New Zealand Institute 20: 133-139. Description Females have a total body length of 13‚Äì26 mm, males being smaller at 11‚Äì18 mm. The fourth leg is longest, about 36 mm in females and 33 mm in males. The cephalothorax is chocolate brown, with a supra-marginal band of yellow extending from the posterior slope to the anterior angle of the pars cephalica: falces, maxill√¶, labium, and sternum chocolate-brown; legs and palpi, brown; abdomen above greenish-brown with two longitudinal rows of brown-margined yellow spots, at the sides greyish, and below dusky-brown with four more or less continuous longitudinal whitish stripes converging towards the anus. At the base of the dorsal surface there is a short median spathulate band of paler hue than the rest of that surface, and on each side of this band a short grey fleck. The cephalothorax and abdomen are densely covered with grey, yellow, and brown pubescence.  Habitat/Distribution  Dolomedes aquaticus occurs on open, stony riverbeds and also rocky lake shorelines. D. aquaticus has been observed to be at its highest abundance when there was intermediate disturbance along the river banks. D. aquaticus can be found throughout the South Island of New Zealand and in the lower half of the North Island of New Zealand.It has been suggested that D. aquaticus is not present in the upper half of the North Island due to the lack of braided rivers in this region. Behaviour Dolomedes aquaticus is found on plants, stones, or pieces of wood at or near the surface of the water. It can swim and run very rapidly on the surface of the water. When teased it makes for the nearest object, down which it runs to the bottom of the water, where it remains till all danger has gone. While incubating, the female goes some distance from the water, and lives under a large stone or a piece of wood. Here she remains till the young are hatched. During incubation she shows considerable aversion to water. The cocoon is globular, and is carried under the sternum, to which it is firmly held by the palpi and strands of web from the spinners.

Bhashya are found in various fields, ranging from the Upanishads to the Sutras of Hindu schools of philosophy, from ancient medicine to music.Richa Vishwakarma and Pradip Kumar Goswami (2013), A review through Charaka Uttara-Tantra, International Quarterly Journal of Research in Ayurveda, Volume 34, Issue 1, pages 17‚Äì20Karin Preisendanz (2005), The Production of Philosophical Literature in South Asia during the Pre-Colonial Period (15th to 18th Centuries): The Case of the NyƒÅyas≈´tra Commentarial Tradition, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Volume 33, pages 55‚Äì94PV Kane (2015 Reprint), History of Sanskrit Poetics, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 29 The Indian tradition typically followed certain guidelines in preparing a Bhashya. These commentaries give meaning of words, particularly when they are about condensed aphoristic Sutras, supplementing the interpreted meaning with additional information on the subjects. A traditional Bhasya would, like modern scholarship, name the earlier texts (cite) and often include quotes from previous authors.Elisa Freschi (2012), Proposals for the Study of Quotations in Indian Philosophical Texts, Religions of South Asia, Vol 6, No 2, pages 161, also 161-189 The author of the Bhasya would also provide verification, acceptance or rejection of the text as interpreted, with reasons, and usually include a conclusion. The title of a commentary work sometimes has the title of the text commented on, with the suffix \\"-Bhashya\\".GC Pande (2011), Life and Thought of ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 93-107 Among the earliest known Bhashya are included the Maha-bhashya of Patanjali from the 2nd century BCE,A Datta (2009), Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, Volume 2, Sahitya Akademi, , page 1338 and Sabara Bhashya of the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, dated to have been likely composed between 100 BCE to 200 CE, but no later than the 5th century.Othmar G√§chter (1990), Hermeneutics and Language in Purva Mimamsa: A Study in Sabara Bhasya, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 9 An example of Buddhist literature Bhashya is Vasubandhu's Abhidharmako≈õa- BhƒÅ·π£ya.Lodr√∂ Sangpo (Translator, 2012), Abhidharmako≈õa-BhƒÅ·π£ya of Vasubandhu, Motilal Banarsidass, Etymology The term bhashya literally means \\"speaking, talking, any work in the current, vernacular speech\\". The term also refers to, states Monier-Williams, any \\"explanatory work, exposition, explanation, commentary\\" that brings to light something else.Monier Monier- Williams (2002), A Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Etymologically and Philologically Arranged to cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, page 755 A bhashyakrit is the author, and these words are related to the root bhash which means \\"speak about, describe, declare, tell\\". (Cf. the productive ending -ology in English, which derives from the Greek verb ŒªŒµŒ≥·ø∂ (leg≈ç), meaning \\"speak\\".) Discussion A typical Bhashya would be an interpretation of a Sutra or other classical work word by word. It can also consist of word by word translations and the individual viewpoint of the commentator or Bhashyakara. There are numerous Bhashyas available on various Sanskrit and non-Sanskrit works. A few examples are Brahma Sutra Bhashya by Sri MadhvacharyaReferences about Srimad Ananda Tirtha and Sri Adi Shankara,Brahma Sutra Bhashya Gita Bhashya and Sri BhashyaSribhashya by Sri Ramanuja and Mahabhashya by Pata√±jali  See also  * Works of Madhvacharya * Works of Adi Shankara * Adhyasa Bhashyam audio of Adisankaracharya (Dr.Goli)  References External links *Sri Bhashya Ramanuja *Chandogya Upanishad with Shankara Bhasya, GN Jha (Translator) Category:Literary terminology Category:Sanskrit literature ","title":"Bhashya"},{"id":"17968869","text":"Allan Kolski Horwitz (born 1952) is a South African poet who was born in Vryburg, and grew up in Cape Town.

The city of Milan played a key role in the process, most notably on the occasion of the 1848 uprising against the Austrians known as the Five Days of Milan. The museum was founded on a collection of documents on the Risorgimento, gathered for the Exhibition of Turin in 1884 and then moved to the showroom at Milan‚Äôs Public Gardens. The exhibition was later transferred to the Rocchetta rooms at the Sforza Castle, where it was officially inaugurated on 24 June 1896. In 1943, due to the war-time bombardment of the castle, the museum was temporarily moved to the estate of Casa Manzoni (home of the famed Italian poet and novelist Alessandro Manzoni). Finally in 1951 it was housed inside the Moriggia Palace, where it remains today. The museum is part of the Civic Historical Collections. Its collections include Baldassare Verazzi's Episode from the Five Days and Francesco Hayez's 1840 Portrait of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria. The permanent exhibition is displayed to follow the chronological order of events of the Risorgimento, leading the visitor through fifteen rooms, to which the new Weapons Room has been recently added. The latest refurbishment in 1998 included the redesign of the permanent exhibitions, to accentuate the highlights of the collections, particularly the relics. The museum boasts the green-and-silver velvet cloak and the valuable regal insignia of Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs coronation, the banner of the Legione Lombarda Cacciatori a Cavallo (Lombard Legion on Horseback) and the first Italian flag. The last renovation saw the redesign of the lighting and information systems, as well as improvements to the ‚ÄòRomantic Garden‚Äô behind the building. The palace The Moriggia Palace, which houses the museum, was designed in 1775 by Giuseppe Piermarini. It is located behind the vast area of Brera, and was the residence, in Napoleonic times, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and later, the Ministry of Defence. At the beginning of the 20th century, the palace passed to the De Marchi family and was then donated to the City of Milan by his wife of the famous naturalist Marco De Marchi.

These are \\"home missions\\" geared toward Catholics, distinguished from apostolic missions to make conversions among non-believers. Such missions may consist of systematic preaching and instruction, extending over a stated number of days, performed by authorized missionaries. History Until the beginning of the seventeenth century there existed no organized form of Catholic popular missionary work, as it is now understood. The preaching, for example, of the mendicant orders, was not reduced to a system until the foundation of the Congregation of Priests of the Mission by Vincent de Paul. That was in France; in Italy, a century later (1732), Alphonsus Liguori founded his congregation of Redemptorists. About one hundred years later Gaspar Bufalo (died 1837) founded in Rome the Congregation of the Most Precious Blood to devote itself exclusively to parochial mission work. The work was taken up by other orders whose primary end was different: the Jesuits, who were the foremost, the Dominicans, Franciscans, Capuchins. After the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, a new impetus was given to missionary work by the Abb√© Forbin-Janson, who, with his friend the Abb√© de Rauzan, founded the Missionaires de France, and by Charles de Mazenod, who founded the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, at Marseille, in 1815. In Germany parochial missions had been given sporadically, chiefly by the Jesuits and the Redemptorists, before 1848; after that date they became more general. The bishops everywhere encouraged and urged them. The Cardinal Archbishop of Mechlin, in 1843, maintained that the people of every parish are entitled to have the benefit of a mission. During this period the German Church had missionaries who devoted themselves entirely to popular mission work: Peter Roh, Klinkhofstr√∂m, Pottgieser. On the expulsion of the Jesuits, Redemptorists and other orders from the German Empire, in 1872, there was an interruption. In Italy systematic mission work was introduced by the Lazarists during the lifetime of their founder. With the rise of the Redemptorists, the Passionists, the Fathers of the Precious Blood, and several other congregations, the work spread over the entire peninsula. In Austria they developed during the reign of Maria Theresa, but under her successor, Emperor Joseph II, missions were to a great extent prohibited, and missionaries banished. The Redemptorists were recalled, but could labour only on condition of submitting to official scrutiny. After the Revolution of 1848 had spent itself that the Redemptorists, Jesuits, Capuchins, and Franciscans carried on the work of missions, especially in Bohemia and the Tyrol, in Westphalia, Bavaria, and W√ºrttemberg. On the expulsion of the Jesuits and Redemptorists, missions were again prohibited. Later, however, Capuchins and Franciscans took up the work, and diocesan priests also entered the field as missionaries and directors of retreats. In 1786, Clement Mary Hofbauer, second founder of the Redemptorists, with his friend Thad√§us H√ºbl, founded a house of the congregation in Warsaw, where King Stanislaus Poniatowski placed the German national church of St. Benno at their disposal. After the death of Alphonsus Liguori, his missionaries evangelized the Catholics in the Russian Provinces of Courland and Livonia, on the invitation of Monsignor Saluzzo, Apostolic Nuncio in Poland. In Belgium and in the Netherlands the missionary spirit has, with one or two slight interruptions, always been active. The Lazaristsin Great Britain as early as 1640, but penal laws made organized mission work impossible; it resumed about 1850. In Ireland, missions were recommended by national and provincial synods‚Äîe. g., by the Plenary Synod of Thurles, in 1850; by the Synods of Cashel, 1853, and of Tuam, 1854, and the Plenary Synod of Maynooth, 1875. In England they were recommended by the Provincial Council of Westminster, in 1852, and again in 1859; in Scotland by the Plenary Council of 1886. The Plenary Council of Australia, held at Sydney in 1885, and, in Canada, the Provincial Council of Quebec, in 1863, strongly urged parochial missions. In the United States there was no systematic popular missionary work until about 1860, though missions had been given earlier. The Lazarist Fathers arrived in 1816, the Redemptorists in 1832, and the Passionists in 1852; but the scarcity of priests meant that at first the ordinary spiritual wants of a scattered population took priority. In 1839 Pope Gregory XVI sent the Abb√© Forbin-Janson on a missionary tour through the United States, where, for two years, he gave missions to the people and retreats to the clergy. In the Second Provincial Council of Cincinnati (1858), the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore (1866), and the Tenth Provincial Council of Baltimore (1869), parochial missions were strongly recommended. Among the more active missionaries of this period were Fathers Smarius, Weninger, Damen, D. Young, O.P., and Hewit. \\"Diocesan apostolates\\" are groups of priests, selected from the secular clergy, trained for mission work with special reference to the conversion of non-Catholics. They are exempted from ordinary pastoral work, and held in readiness to give missions whenever needed. Under various names‚Äîas \\"Apostolic Missionary Band\\", \\"Diocesan Mission Band\\", etc. -- the system became established in the Archdioceses of New York, St. Louis, St. Paul, and San Francisco, and the Dioceses of Alton, Burlington, Oklahoma, Peoria, Pittsburg, Providence, Richmond, San Antonio, Scranton, and Wheeling.

Africa Progress Report 2015‚ÄîPower, People, Planet: Seizing Africa‚Äôs Energy and Climate Opportunities Demand for modern energy in Sub-Saharan Africa is set to surge, fuelled by economic growth, demographic change and urbanisation. As the costs of low-carbon energy fall, Africa could leapfrog into a new era of power generation. Utility reform, new technologies and new business models could be as transformative in energy as the mobile phone has been in telecommunications. The Africa Progress Report 2015 explains the bold steps that leaders globally and in Africa must take to achieve this vision. Above all, the report shows that the global climate moment is also Africa's moment to lead the world. The 2015 Africa Progress Report was launched in Cape Town, South Africa on 5 June 2015 by Executive Director Caroline Kende-Robb and Panel Members Gra√ßa Machel, Linah Mohohlo, and Michel Camdessus. Africa Progress Report 2014‚ÄîGrain, Fish, Money: Financing Africa‚Äôs Green and Blue Revolutions To sustain growth that improves the lives of all Africans, the continent needs an economic transformation that taps into Africa's other riches: its fertile land, its extensive fisheries and forests, and the energy and ingenuity of its people. To achieve such a transformation, Africa will need to overcome three major obstacles: a lack of access to formal financial services, the weakness of the continent's infrastructure and the lack of funds for public investment. The Africa Progress Report 2014 describes how African governments and their international partners can cooperate to remove those obstacles ‚Äì and enable all Africans to benefit from their continent's extraordinary wealth. The 2012 Africa Progress Report was launched in London, United Kingdom on 8 May 2014 by Kofi Annan, Tidjane Thiam, Bob Geldof, Peter Eigen and Caroline Kende-Robb. Africa Progress Report 2013 ‚Äì Equity in Extractives: Stewarding Africa‚Äôs Natural Resources for All In 2013, Africa's economies were riding the crest of a global commodity wave that had the potential to transform the continent's prospects. The 2013 Africa Progress Report explains how this unprecedented chance might lift millions out of poverty, and improve the prospects of generations to come, by strengthening fiscal policy and increasing equitable public spending on infrastructure, health, education, water and sanitation. The 2013 Africa Progress Report was launched at the World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town, South Africa on 8 June 2013 by Kofi Annan, Linah Mohohlo, and Strive Masiyiwa.[9] The report's hard-hitting findings and policy recommendations received substantial international attention.

The report explores the fundamental role jobs play in African's life-chances, and hones in on how, over the long run, issues of injustice and inequality can undermine long-term economic growth, productivity and the development of markets. The launch of the 2012 Africa Progress Report was covered by international news publications, including The Wall Street Journal,[10] The Guardian,[11] The Financial Times,[12] and the African Business Magazine ran a cover story based on the report.[13]As part of the launch, Executive Director Caroline Kende-Robb and Panel Member Olusegun Obasanjo were interviewed for the video series This Is Africa.[14] Africa Progress Report 2011 - The Transformative Power of Partnerships Africa Progress Report 2010 - From Agenda to Action: Turning Resources into Results for People Africa Progress Report 2009 - An Agenda for Progress at a Time of Global Crisis: A Call for African Leadership External links *Africa Progress Panel Website *Africa Progress Panel Facebook *Africa Progress Panel Twitter *Kofi Annan Foundation  References  Category:Foundations based in Switzerland Category:International development in Africa Category:Organizations established in 2007 ","title":"Africa Progress Panel"},{"id":"17969133","text":"Stonedogs is the first novel by New Zealand writer Craig Marriner. It was published in 2001 and has won a Montana New Zealand Book Award. The book has been described as \\"a kind of A Clockwork Orange-meets-Once Were Warriors as imagined by Irvine Welsh\\". In 2003, the film rights were sold to Australian production company Mushroom Pictures, but no film has eventuated. Stonedogs is structurally unusual; Some text takes the form of a play with stage directions, and there are sudden shifts from narrator's voice to outside observer. Pages of inner narrative are italicised. For Marriner \\"It was important to do something that would be seen as innovative in terms of structure and format, to come up with mediums which are slightly alternative to what's been done. I saw devices which hadn't been used and I couldn't see why they hadn't.\\" Stonedogs received critical acclaim, winning the Deutz Medal for Fiction in 2002 in the Montana New Zealand Book Awards. Themes and plot The novel deals with issues such as alienation, social decay, drug use and New Zealand gang culture, as well as political and environmental issues. Speaking of the novel Marriner told an interviewer \\"I've been pretty disillusioned with mainstream society for a while, I just don't see a future in it. And I've been moving in working-class circles and watching the quiet desperation everyone lives their lives through. So the novel comes from there, and questions where we're going environmentally and politically.\\" There are strong left-wing political themes expressed; Marriner has cited leftists such as Noam Chomsky, Robert Fisk and Leon Trotsky as influences.

History and profile Staffrider was first published in March 1978. Its founder was Mike Kirkwood. The magazine took its name from slang for people hanging outside or on the roof of overcrowded, racially segregated trains. It was one of the most important literary presences of the 1970s and 1980s, aiming to be popular rather than elite was consciously non-racial in the segregated apartheid era. Borrowing its name and image from township slang for black youth who rode the over-crowded African sections of the racially segregated commuter trains by hanging onto the outside or sitting on the roofs, Staffrider had two main objectives: to provide publishing opportunities for community-based organizations and young writers, graphic artists and photographers; and to oppose officially sanctioned state and establishment culture. Produced by The Durban Moment that saw Steve Biko begin the South African Students' Organisation, Staffrider had a view of literature with a small \\"l\\": its base was popular rather than elite and it sought to provide an autobiography of experience in its witness of daily black life in South Africa. The magazine's nonracial policy and choice of English as a non-ethnic mode of communication attracted a cross-section of writers, artists and other contributors to the magazine. Debates around Staffrider‚Ä≤s \\"self-editing\\" editorial policy were ongoing and the magazine eventually adopted quality control measures under the editorship of Chris van Wyk. However, the magazine's early flexibility ensured that the work of previously unpublished writers and artists appeared alongside that of many South African notables including Nadine Gordimer, Lionel Abrahams, Rose Zwi, Bridget Partridge, and Mtutuzeli Matshoba.

Andrew Buchanan of Auchentorlie ended that practice when he purchased the castle in 1812. It was leased by the graphic artist Talwin Morris in July 1893 who remodelled the interior.Gleeson White, J. W. (1897) 'Some Glasgow designers and their work: part II', The Studio, XI(54), pp.227‚Äì236 The house was sold in July 1899 to the parents of his friends Margaret and Frances Macdonald, and Morris's interiors were subsequently completely remodelled by Charles Rennie Mackintosh.See http://www.mackintosh- architecture.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/browse/display/?rs=353 The bookcase is now in the collection of the National Museum of Scotland and all of Mackintosh's work has been removed. Description A large section of boundary wall remains, approximately high, with a mixture of original and newer construction. A small conical dovecot also exists on the south wall but it is now completely ruined. Near the west end of the wall, and outside the south wall is a small landing place appearing to have been protected by a hoarding ‚Äì some corbels for which still remains. At the north-west corner of the enclosure is a dwelling house, partly old, possibly dating back to 1590, but mostly more recent. The round tower is probably from the 17th century and appears to have been a pigeon house.

Members consist of owners/managers of infrastructure from most European/EEA countries. EIM was formally established in 2002 following the liberalisation of the EU railway market to promote the interests of independent rail infrastructure managers in the EU and the EEA. EIM is a founding member of the Platform for European Rail Infrastructure Managers (PRIME), a member of the Group of Representative Bodies and a member of the Management Board of the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA). Purpose The role of EIM is to provide a single voice to represent its members vis-√†-vis the relevant European institutions and sector stakeholders. EIM also assists members in developing their businesses through the sharing of experiences and contributing to the technical and safety activities of the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA). Organisational structure Based in Brussels, EIM is registered as an international, non-profit association under Belgian law. EIM is led by a President and three Vice-Presidents, who are elected for two-year terms. The President, the Vice-Presidents and the Executive Director form the Board of Directors. The General Assembly is the highest and final governance authority of the association. It gathers normally twice a year. Members meet informally at the highest level to share experiences and discuss matters of common importance at the CEOs Club meetings which usually take place twice a year. The Executive-Director leads the Secretariat which consists of three organizational units employing an international staff of approximately ten people. Members are represented at EIM via the Policy and Management Committee (PMC) for the policy activities and via the Technical Steering Group (TSG) for technical matters. The PMC and the TSG may be assisted by internal working groups to address specific questions and to monitor special areas of interest.

Launched at the same time as the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index (DBLCI) in February 2003, the DBLCI-Mean Reversion has the same underlying assets. The listed instruments are also rolled using the same mechanism as the DBLCI, namely energy contracts are rolled monthly and the metal and grain contracts are rolled annually. This occurs between the second and sixth business day of the month. The DBLCI-MR is also quoted in both total returns and excess returns terms in US dollars as well as EUR, JPY and GBP.  Rolling Methodology  In contrast to the DBLCI, the DBLCI-MR undertakes no annual re- balancing. Instead, the individual commodity weights are reset every time any one of the commodities undergoes a ‚Äòtrigger event‚Äô. This happens when the one- year moving average of the commodity price is a whole multiple of 5% away from the five-year moving average. When this happens, the weights of all the commodities are re-balanced such that ‚Äòexpensive‚Äô commodities have their weights reduced while ‚Äòcheap‚Äô commodities have their weights increased according to a simple, pre-defined formula. The entire process is rule-based and mandatory. The fact that there exist clear pre-set ‚Äòhurdle rates‚Äô to trigger a re-weighting, minimises the number of re-weightings and thus reduces the transactions costs for replication.  Characteristics of the DBLCI-Mean Reversion  * Six commodities: WTI crude oil, heating oil, aluminium, gold, corn and wheat. The same rolling schedule as the DBLCI. * No annual rebalancing. Instead commodity weights are adjusted according to a pre-defined formula. * It is the only commodity index in the marketplace which possesses a dynamic rule-based asset allocation mechanism which attempts to underweight \\"expensive commodities and overweight \\"cheap\\" commodities. * Total and excess returns data are available from December 1, 1988.  Rationale and Index Mechanism  The DBLCI-Mean Reversion is the only index which dynamically changes its weights according to whether a commodity is considered cheap or expensive. When all the commodities are within 5% of their five-year averages, the weights will automatically revert to the weights of the base index, the DBLCI. The rationale behind the construction of the DBCLI-MR is to exploit the tendency of commodity prices to trade within wide, but, defined ranges because: * As prices of commodities rise, new production capacity is brought on line to benefit from higher prices. * More supply becomes available from alternative sources previously considered uneconomic. * In oil markets, quota systems that attempt to control supply come under strain as the rewards for cheating rise. * As prices rise, the demand for the commodity will begin to fall as it faces competition from cheaper sources. The net effect is to keep commodity prices bound around their long run average price. In essence the DBLCI-MR is a strategy to buy low and sell high. It therefore tends to take profits gradually in a bull run and re-invest those proceeds into cheaper commodities. One benefit of this approach is that the DBLCI-MR tends to extract volatility from the index since as commodity prices rally so to does volatility. evidence suggests that portfolios comprising past losers tend to outperform past winners and vice versa over time, see Hersh Shefrin, Beyond Greed and Fear, Harvard Business School, 2000. In fact this has been a recurring theme of commodity markets over the past few years. We find that it has been common for a commodity to be at the bottom of the league table in terms of total returns in one year, to be close to the top in the following year only to reverse these gains in the next 12 month period.

Life Morgan was born at Bettisfield, Hanmer, Flintshire. His father's Christian name was William. Of his mother we know nothing except that one of her kindred was Lieutenant of the Tower of London. From the fact that Morgan was known at St. Omer as John Singleton, Gillow thinks that she was one of the Singletons of Steyning Hall, near Blackpool, in Lancashire. Of his reported education at Douai College, no evidence appears; but he certainly was a scholar at St. Omer, and at the English College, Rome, Valladolid, and Madrid. For a brief period in 1609 he was a Jesuit novice, having been one of the numerous converts of Father John Bennett, S.J. Ordained priest at Salamanca, he was sent on the English mission in 1621. He seems to have gone to Wales, and in April, 1629, was in prison in Flintshire, for refusing the oath of allegiance. Later about 1632 he was condemned in the Star Chamber to have his ears nailed to the pillory for having accused certain judges of treason. Immediately afterwards he was committed to the Fleet Prison in London, where he remained until a few days before his death on 26 April. He was condemned at the Old Bailey for being a priest under the provisions of 27 Eliz., c. 2 on St. George's Day, 23 April 1642. At the same time was condemned John Francis Quashet, a Scots Minim, who subsequently died in Newgate Prison. Morgan was executed at Tyburn, London.

He was born at 180 Arabella Street, Cardiff, the son of a travelling salesman, and was the brother of Hugh Cudlipp (later Baron Cudlipp) and Reginald Cudlipp, both notable journalists. The eldest of the three, Percy was described by Douglas Jay as the most serious-minded. All three were educated at the Gladstone Primary School and Howard Gardens High School, Cardiff. Percy Cudlipp began his journalistic career as a messenger boy for the South Wales Echo, later training as a reporter, and in 1924 became a columnist for the Evening Chronicle in Manchester. In 1925 he began working as a drama critic and columnist on London's Sunday News. In 1927 he married Gwendoline James, and they had one son. Cudlipp had a sideline in writing light verse and lyrics. He became editor of the Evening Standard, then owned by Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook, in 1933, aged 27, and was at one time the youngest editor in Fleet Street. As a socialist, Cudlipp was suspicious of the Fascist movement in Germany and encouraged a campaign against them. He moved on to become editor of the Daily Herald in 1940. In 1953, Cudlipp unexpectedly resigned the editorship of the Daily Herald, an action that has been attributed to the ongoing conflicts between the paper's management and the trade union movement and the difficulty of retaining editorial control. In the following years he was a columnist for the News Chronicle. He was subsequently approached by the team, including scientist Tom Margerison, who hoped to set up the New Scientist and, despite claiming to know nothing about science, became the first editor of the new magazine, which was launched in November 1956. He was a frequent radio broadcaster, contributing to quiz shows and news programmes on the BBC World Service.

Background  The record was a double album, with four sides containing identical material presented in each of the four LP based quadraphonic sound formats: SQ, QS, CD-4 and UD-4. These had evolved as the result of four competing companies (CBS, Sansui, JVC and Nippon Columbia respectively) pursuing their own quadraphonic systems independently. This, and the incompatibility of the systems were factors in the slow uptake and eventual downfall of quadraphonic recordings. The project was put together by Mike Thorne, then editor of Studio Sound magazine. Able to persuade JVC and CBS via his own contacts, he soon found agreement from Sansui and Nippon Columbia and all four companies agreed to encode a side of the album each. Assembling material was more difficult since compilations spanning record labels were not as commonplace as they eventually became.  Tracks  The eventual album included a set of single and paired reference sounds, a surround-sound demonstration named \\"Electronic Footsy\\" (created in collaboration with engineer Tony Faulkner), a St√©phane Grappelli violin duet and two classical pieces by Mahler and Bartok, the latter being conducted by Pierre Boulez, as well as Pink Floyd's \\"Money\\" and 2 excerpts from Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. To ensure consistency in the mastering process, Thorne took possession of the actual master tapes of the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon, which caused him considerable paranoia to the extent that he hid the tapes inside his piano, reasoning that it would be unlikely for a burglar to steal such a hefty object or search inside it. Quadrafile disc labels  Reception  The album was released just as quadraphonic sound was on the wane. Only 5,000 numbered copies were pressed and are extremely rare collector's items. Some collectors have sought out this release as the only example of Mike Oldfield and Pink Floyd recordings being presented in that particular quad format.

History Formed in March 1952 as a joint venture between Caltex and Ampol, the company discovered Australia's first flowing oil in November the following year, at Rough Range on the North West Cape. The first oil discovery in Australia was made near Lakes Entrance, Victoria in 1924. The Rough Range well flowed with heavy crude oil, initially at per day from a depth of 1099 metres, but further drilling in 1954 demonstrated the discovery to be small with low flow rates and it was deemed to be not commercial. Dongara In 1964 WAPET discovered the first commercial natural gas field in the state, at Dongara in the Perth Basin. The Dongara field is now wholly owned by Arc Energy and has produced of LNG to August 2007. The Dongara discovery resulted in the construction of the first gas pipeline in Western Australia, from Dongara to Pinjarra in 1971 by a WAPET subsidiary, West Australian Natural Gas (WANG).

Despite an expectation of likely oil deposits, Barrow Island had had Government bans on drilling and exploration due to the 1952 atomic bomb testing on the nearby Montebello Islands. The bans were lifted in 1953 and WAPET was granted exploration permits. The drill hole \\"Barrow-1\\" flowed with heavy crude and proved to be a significant discovery. After $100 million had been spent on further exploration and development, the find led to commercial production in 1967. In 1966 it was estimated to have recoverable reserves of and after production started in April 1967, estimated reserves were increased to .

As a result of the success at Barrow Island and other finds, extensive off-shore exploration in the Carnarvon Basin was undertaken by Australian and American oil companies during the late 1960s and 1970s. WAPET discovered a significant gas deposit at West Tryal Rocks, north west of Barrow Island in 1973, and in 1980 the Gorgon gas deposit.

Whitley Hall (now demolished) was the seat of the Beaumont family. A part of the former estate is now in use as a Scout camp-site. History In around 1200 the lord of Pontefract castle, Roger de Laci presented William Bellomonte, ancestor of the Beaumonts of Whitley, 24 bovates of land in Huddersfield, half meadow and half wood and four marks rent on the mill in the same place. Although there were probably houses built on the site in the interim, the first documented Hall was built by Sir Richard Beaumont in the early 17th century. The house was then rebuilt in the 18th century in an imposing Georgian style using local millstone grit. The gardens were landscaped by Capability Brown. By the early part of the 20th century the house stood empty and the fittings were sold in 1917. The estate was then bought in 1924 by Charles Sutcliffe an industrialist. Unfortunately this was not enough to save the house and estate and it continued to deteriorate until it was sold in 1950 and split up, the major part to an opencast mining company and the house was demolished. Scouting Charles Sutcliffe first allowed Scouts to use the kitchen gardens to camp in 1928 or 1929 and after the 1950 break-up of the estate an area of land south of the hall passed into the hands of the Huddersfield Scout districts. It is now run by volunteers reporting to Huddersfield South-East district.

He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929. Life The greater part of his life was probably passed in his native village, where, being practically illiterate, he supported his wife and eight children by manual labour. He was brought up an Anglican, but became a Catholic convert. On the very day of his first Communion, however, he was arrested for changing his religion and committed to Winchester jail. Here his good behaviour meant he was frequently allowed out on parole, and was even trusted with the keys of the prison. This leniency enabled him to introduce priests to administer the sacraments to Catholic prisoners. He then acted as escort first to Father Thomas Stanney, and later to his successor at Winchester, Father Roger Dicconson, conducting them to the different villages to minister to Catholics. Finally seized with Father Dicconson, Milner was with him placed under close confinement in Winchester jail pending the approaching sessions. The judge urged Milner to attend even once the Protestant church and thus escape the gallows. He refused and began to prepare for death. Every effort was made to persuade him to change his purpose and renounce the Catholic faith. When he was approaching the gallows with Father Dicconson, his children were led to him in the hope that he might even then relent. He was unshaken in his resolution, and gave his children his last blessing.

It is managed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and is operated by various companies that contract to provide the service. \\"Shared ride\\" means that multiple passengers may ride together in the same vehicle. Region covered A MetroAccess Paratransit Vehicle The service provides daily trips throughout the Transit Zone in the Washington Metropolitan region. The Transit Zone consists of the District of Columbia, the Maryland counties of Montgomery County and Prince George's County, the Virginia counties of Arlington County and Fairfax County, and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church. Rides are offered in the same service areas and during the same hours of operation as Metrorail and Metrobus. The service is provided by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, and is the region's complementary paratransit service offered in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).http://www.wmata.com/accessibility/metroaccess_service/customer_guide.cfm#what MetroAccess began operation in May 1994, and since then, annual ridership has grown from 200,000 to over 2.4 million passengers. MetroAccess operates 365 days a year, providing door-to-door, shared rides reserved from one to seven days in advance. Its fares are two times the fastest comparable fixed-route fare, with a maximum fare of $6.50. Customers are required to pay the fare to the driver in cash prior to boarding the vehicle or by using Metro's EZ-Pay Program, the trip origin and destination must be within 3/4 mile of fixed- route service (a bus stop or rail station). MetroAccess service hours and locations coincide with those of Metro's bus and rail services, with the exception of express routes such as those serving Dulles International Airport. Eligibility for paratransit service is defined in the ADA as being based on an individual's \\"inability to use public transit\\" due to a disability, and in some cases, this inability is a result of either accessible services not being offered at the desired time of travel or the absence of an accessible pathway to a nearby bus stop or rail station. Eligibility determinations are made by MetroAccess' Office of Eligibility. Metro has worked to encourage and facilitate the use of fixed-route transit by its customers with disabilities. For MetroAccess customers who have an occasional or conditional ability to use existing fixed-route public transit, Metro offers its fixed-route services free of charge. This incentive decreases demand for the more costly paratransit service by shifting disabled customers to existing bus and rail service according to customer choice and ability. Those who do not have an inability to use public transit but who do have a qualifying disability may be eligible for Metro's reduced (half) fare Disability ID card. MetroAccess service is provided by a primary contractor- broker with multiple subcontractors and taxicab providers. It is now the fourth largest paratransit service in the United States with a fleet of over 650 vehicles and well over 1,000 employees. In November 2016, MetroAccess replaced its photo ID access card with a personalized SmarTrip card, allowing MetroAccess users to ride buses for free, and use the faregates on Metrorail to take rides at no charge instead of entering via the emergency gate.

In past centuries many Caspian seals come to the islands' shores, hence the name of the group. The islands have been declared an Important Bird Area and a National Protected Zone (State Reservation). There are large concentrations of seagulls and wetland birds, like coots, wild ducks, swans, egrets, and waders in the archipelago during their nesting period.

History Asif Nagar was once a fortified town from Goshamahal to Golkonda Fort. At the beginning of Asaf Jahi rule, Mir Qamar-ud-din Khan Siddiqi (1671 ‚Äì 1748) captured Golconda in 1724 from the Moghuls, and camped at a fort here, though his capital was at Aurangabad. Later it was renamed as Asif Nagar. He established the Hyderabad State and ruled it from 1724 to 1748. He is also known by his titles Chin Kilich Khan (awarded by Aurangzeb in 1690‚Äì91), Nizam-ul-Mulk (awarded by Farrukhsiyar in 1713) and Asaf Jah (awarded by Muhammad Shah in 1725). After the Nizam captured Golconda in 1724 from the Moghuls, he camped near the fort in a village. Later it was renamed Asifnagar. A few structures consisting of Rajasthani-Mewar- style architecture, with jharokas, arches and stone nets have been found, indicating its historic connection with other kingdoms during the time of Nizams.

It is located on the eastern bank of the Scioto River just north of Chillicothe in Ross County, Ohio, about a mile east of the Mound City Group and Shriver Circle on a terrace of the Scioto River. The site is a detached portion of the Hopewell Culture National Historic Park, along with the Mound City Group, Hopewell Mound Group, Seip Earthworks, Spruce Hill Earthworks and the High Bank Works. The site is open to the public. Survey historySquier and Davis: 1846= Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis visited the site in 1846. They would discuss their findings from surveying Hopeton in their 1848 book, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. They describe the site as consisting of main works with a set of smaller works to the right of the main. There is a rectangle shaped work \\"with an attached circle, the latter extending into the former, instead of being connected with it in the usual manner.\\" The circle is located \\"somewhat to the right of a line drawn through the centre of the rectangle, parallel to its longest sides.\\" The rectangle site was surveyed at by in size. The attached circle was noted at in diameter. 19th-century plan of the Works from Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley The site was reported as having 12 gateways, averaging in width. The \\"line\\" going from the circle to the rectangle was long. The east side of the earthworks were reported as having two more circles. One was measured at and the other at in diameter. Another small circle is located just north of the site, also noted at in diameter. The walls are loam. They were reported as being high and at the base. Unlike many other earthworks, there is no ditch on either side of the walls. Squier and Davis were impressed by the size of the walls, stating that \\"they resemble the heavy grading of a railway, and are broad enough, on the top, to admit the passage of a coach.\\" The circle walls are shorter than the rectangle walls, and Squier and Davis believed this to be due to farming. They noted that the clay used to build the circle was different colors than the earth the earthworks were built upon. Squier and Davis surveyed that parallel walls traveled from the northwestern corner of the rectangle to the river it the southwest. They did not believe that these walls were directly connected to the main works of the site. They walls were marked as being long and apart. They end at \\"the edge of the terrace,\\" where the \\"river once had its course.\\" Both are described as being straight in design. They noted that excavations throughout the area, one is a large hole, others were random removals of soil, but not enough removed to have created the earthworks. No large mounds were found at the time of excavation, but two small oval shaped elevations were discovered. There were also two small mounds in the rectangle. After their survey, Squier and Davis concluded that the site was used as a fortification.

Itinerant communities in Afghanistan, whether Inku-speaking or not, are locally known as \\"Jats\\" (not to be confused with the Jats of India and Pakistan), a term which is not a self-designation of the groups but rather a collective, often pejorative name given by outsiders. It is presumably for this reason that the language is called Jakati in the Ethnologue encyclopedia. Each of the four groups speaks a variety with slight differences compared to the others. According to their local tradition, their ancestors migrated in the 19th century from the Dera Ismail Khan and Dera Ghazi Khan areas of eastern Balochistan (present-day Pakistan). Such an origin suggests that Inku may be related to the Saraiki language spoken there, though nothing is conclusively known. The total population of the four Inku-speaking groups was estimated to be 7,000 as of the end of the 1970s. There is no reliable information about their present state, though it is unlikely that many have survived the recent upheavals in the country, and Ethnologue states, though without citing a source, that Inku's last speakers \\"probably survived into the 1990s\\".

The specific epithet robbinsii is named in honor of James Watson Robbins, the pioneer student of the genus. It is found in deep to shallow, quiet, often muddy waters of lakes, ponds, and rivers. Description The rootstock of Potamogeton robbinsii lacks tubers. The stems root from the lower nodes, and sterile stems are either simple or widely branching and are feather-like, covered with sheathing whitish stipules. The sterile stems measure long. Flowering stems grow up to tall. Leaves on the sterile stems are linear, stiff, and grow opposite on the stem, measuring long. Leaves are densely crowded on sterile stems, are auricled at their base, and have a minutely serrated margin. The tip of the fibrous pale stipule is as long or longer than its sheath. Leaves born on flowering stems are remote and reduced, with stipules with shorter tips. The branching inflorescence bears one to twenty-six straight peduncles with stiff and interrupted spikes that grow long. The plant fruits rarely, with flattened fruit that measures long and wide. The fruit has a prominent keel with an approximately central beak long. It flowers from August to September. The plant may form dense colonies that carpet the muddy substrates of riverbottoms and lakebeds. It rarely flowers, but when it does it is very easy to identify, as it is the only Potamogeton species that has branching inflorescences.

He acceded to this position upon the deaths of his predecessors Regillus and Lucius Julius Vehilius Gratus Julianus, by appointment of emperor Commodus. His name suggests that his family received Roman citizenship from Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. When the behavior of Commodus turned increasingly erratic during the early 190s, Laetus is thought to have been implicated in the conspiracy that led to the emperor's murder on December 31, 192. The plot was a calculated attempt to advance the city prefect Publius Helvius Pertinax to the throne, but the assassination inadvertently initiated a period of civil war known as the Year of the Five Emperors, during which the Roman Empire witnessed five different claimants to the imperial power. The year opened with the brief reigns of Pertinax and Didius Julianus, before erupting to a full- scale war between the generals Pescennius Niger, Clodius Albinus and Septimius Severus. Although Laetus himself had been responsible for the accession of Pertinax, his claim to the imperial purple was opposed by the majority of the Praetorian Guard, forcing Pertinax to secure their support with an excessive promise of money. When he managed to pay only half of the promised sum however, he was deserted by Laetus and killed by rogue Praetorians. In one of the most infamous episodes in Roman history,Birley, p. 95 the guard then proceeded to sell the Empire by auction to Didius Julianus. In response, the armies of Pescennius Niger, Clodius Albinus and Septimius Severus rose in revolt, and marched on Rome. When his demise appeared imminent, Didius Julianus ordered the execution of Laetus and the conspirators against Commodus, on suspicion that they would side with Severus.

It is made up of a few protected areas which used to constitute a single virgin forest originally. Niepo≈Çomice Forest occupies an area between Vistula and Raba rivers. The main complex covers about . It is situated between the towns of Niepo≈Çomice, Baczk√≥w, Krzy≈ºanowice and Mikluszowice. The name Niepo≈Çomice derives from the Old Polish language word niepo≈Çomny which meant \\"impassable\\", or \\"impossible to destroy\\" or conquer. Description The forest consists of six nature reserves with the total area of 94.43 hectares. The biggest reserve called Gibiel (29.79 ha), covers the area with the most diverse flora and fauna, featuring 175 species of birds as well as European bison, deer, wild boar, wolves, lynx, and wild cats. Puszcza Niepo≈Çomicka. Charakterystyka obszaru at Polska.pl The next reserve called Lip√≥wka (25.73 ha) features 200-year-old nature monuments mainly lime trees, oaks and hornbeams. Slightly smaller D≈Çugosz Kr√≥lewski Reserve, with an area of 24.14 ha (not far from the village of Stanis≈Çawice) was established for the protection of a rare flowering fern named Osmunda regalis (). Reserve called Dƒôbina (12.66 ha) is set up for the preservation of ancient oak trees. Ko≈Ço Reserve, with a smaller area of 3.49 ha consists of age-old lime trees and hornbeams. The reserve called Wi≈õlisko Kobyle (6.67 ha) is devoted to water plants. In the heart of Niepo≈Çomice Forest is the most protected area inhabited by the Polish wisent (≈ªubr), the heaviest surviving land animal in Europe. History Because of its close proximity to Krak√≥w, then the capital of Poland, Niepo≈Çomice Forest was the most popular hunting ground for the Polish royalty beginning in the 13th century. In its vicinity, King Casimir III the Great built the Royal hunting Castle, later rebuilt by Sigismund I the Old and fitted with the Queen Bona Sforza's gardens. The first official mention of the Niepo≈Çomice Forest comes from a document written in 1242, calling it \\"K≈Çaj\\". In 1393, the forest is mentioned as Niepo≈Çomice Woods (Las Niepo≈Çomicki), and in 1441 ‚Äì for the first time, it was written about under its current name. Throughout its entire history, the forest was owned by the state ‚Äì by the Polish kings between 13th and 18th centuries until the military partitions of Poland, and after liberation, by the sovereign state of Poland.J.Paprota, Puszcza Niepo≈Çomicka (The Niepo≈Çomice Forest). History. Aurochs attacked by wolves, painting by H. Harder The early road leading through the forest was called the Royal Road (see also: the Royal Road of Krak√≥w terminating at the Wawel Castle in the heart of the city). It was traveled by prominent Polish kings hunting for bear, the aurochs (extinct since 1627, pictured), wisent, and other big game. The forest was a source of major wood construction material. It was looked after by foresters and Masters of the Royal Hunt. During the military partitions of Poland, from 1795 on, the Austro-Hungarian Empire (controlling the province for well over a century) destroyed most of the old-growth forest and replanted that area with fast growing pine trees meant for commerce. Even more thorough destruction of what remained of Niepo≈Çomice Forest came about during the Nazi German occupation of Poland between 1939‚Äì1945. The trees were cut indiscriminately and shipped to military bases and battle fronts across Europe. War crimes were being committed in the area by the Nazis, with Poles and Jews from the neighbouring towns of Bochnia and Niepo≈Çomice murdered deep in the woods. There are numerous mass graves in the forest including those of Polish soldiers from 156 Infantry Regiment of Army Krak√≥w, killed on September 9, 1939, as well as those of local partisans who died before the end of World War II. Among the 40 hostages executed there on December 11, 1942 was the heroic President of Krak√≥w, Dr Stanis≈Çaw Klimecki. At present, the forest is maintained according to modern forestry practices. Really old trees are generally rare. The program of reconstruction began in postwar Poland around the mid 20th century, including the reinstatement of native plants in drawn-out areas.  Tourism  The forest is transversed by several walking trails including a 7 km bicycle trail and the newly open 4 km long educational trail complete with informational placards about the local flora and fauna. Among the trails which lead deep into the forest, there is the 14 km long Niepo≈Çomice ‚Äì Poszyna (green) trail called the Royal Road, and the two trails each 12 km long, Grodkowice ‚Äì B≈Çoto ‚Äì Sitowiec, and the Pod≈Çƒô≈ºe ‚Äì Przybor√≥w ‚Äì Sitowiec (blue) trail leading to mass graves of Poles and Jews from World War II.

Over the course of the band's history, they have had numerous line-up changes, with none of the founding members in the band's current line up and eight previous members since 1994. CareerEarly career (1994‚Äì2000)= Originally formed in 1994 as an all- instrumental, power metal outfit, Italy's DGM featured guitarist Diego Reali, keyboardist Maurizio Pariotti and drummer Gianfranco Tassella. In 1995 Luciano Regoli, formerly of Raccomandata Ricevuta Ritorno, soon joined as lead singer. Their first official release was in 1996, the self-produced mini CD Random Access Zone. In 1997 the band produced their first full-length album 'Change Direction' the album was well received in Italy, Germany, Finland, and Denmark, which prompted them to start an Italian tour which resulted in a gain in popularity. With the new drummer Fabio Costantino (ex-Carnal Raptor), DGM entered the studio for their second album: Wings of Time (top album on the Italian magazines Metal Shock, Flash and Metal Hammer). In Japan the CD sold over 4,000 copies in the first 10 days. The band was also contacted by Burrn! for an exclusive interview that enlarged DGM's reputation in the worldwide musical scene. =Rise in Popularity with Titta Tani (2000‚Äì2007)= Before their third studio album release, Titta Tani joined the band, becoming the new DGM singer. Dreamland was subsequently released in December 2001. In springtime 2001, Andrea Arcangeli (Airlines Of Terror, Solisia, Concept, ex- River of Change) became the new DGM bass player just before the Italian dates for Dreamland promotion. In 2002, the band was signed by Italian independent label Scarlet Records. Hidden Place was released in May 2003 with a new progressive sound from the new keyboard player Fabio Sanges (Abstracta). The fourth album received excellent reviews on many magazines and web magazines from all over the world. Following the release DGM played at the Gods of Metal in 2003. Misplaced was released in February 2004. The album was produced by Giuseppe Orlando's Outer Sound studios. Like Hidden Place, Misplaced has been received well by both the magazines and the audience, and several live dates followed the release. In 2005, Simone Mularoni replaced Diego Reali. Mularoni had previous experience as a sound engineer and producer at the Fear Studios. After his addition, DGM also teamed up with keyboard player Emanuele Casali after the departure of Fabio Sanges. Mularoni and Casali gave the new songs a renewed process of recording and the result of Simone's experience is included in Different Shapes, which was released in 2007. On the live front, DGM played for the second time at the Gods of Metal (2007) together with Heaven&Hell;, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Dark Tranquility among others, Lagoa Burning Festival (2007), Prog-Power Europe (2007) as a confirmation of the high quality of Different Shapes. =Mark Basile era (2007‚Äìpresent)= In February 2007, DGM announced that Mark Basile was the new singer of the band. He was chosen among several auditions throughout Italy, Europe and America after Titta Tani left the band. In early 2009, DGM released their first album with Mark Basile and the seventh album of their career: Frame. Although well received, several reviews marked it as a slight step back compared to Different Shapes. It was another four years before DGM released another studio album, the longest gap in their career. In April 2010, DGM performed a show in Rome to celebrate the band's 15 year anniversary. This was recorded and released in September in the same year as the 2-disc CD/DVD, Synthesis. The DVD disc contained the complete live show including backstage access and a 'Making of' film of the album 'Frame'. The CD is a 'best of' collection, containing songs from throughout the band's career re-recorded and re-arranged with the current line-up. The CD also contained two new songs \\"Just like Before\\" and \\"The Only One\\". On 28 March 2013, DGM released their eighth album, Momentum. Their second with Basile and also the first album since 2004's Misplaced to feature an unchanged line-up from their previous studio release. The album featured guest vocals on the track \\"Reason\\" from Russell Allen of Symphony X and guest guitars on the track \\"Chaos\\" from J√∏rn Viggo Lofstad of Pagan's Mind. On 26 August 2016, DGM released their ninth studio album, The Passage. Guitarist and producer Simone Mularoni said; \\"This album can easily be seen as our most ambitious work to date\\".

The A2 motorway is a motorway in the Netherlands. It is one of the busiest highways in the Netherlands. The road connects the city of Amsterdam, near the Amstel interchange with the Belgian border, near Maastricht (NL) and Li√®ge (B), and the Belgian A25 road. The route of the A2 motorway is shared with two major European routes. Between its start, at Amstel Interchange, near Amsterdam, and the Interchange Oudenrijn, near Utrecht, European route E35 follows the A2 motorway. From the Oudenrijn Interchange towards the Belgian border just south of Maastricht, European route E25 follows the route of the A2. Local and express lanes on A2 have different speed limits. The speed limit on express lanes is 120 km/h (75 mph) and locals is 100 km/h (63 mph).  Route description  Road N2 = In the past, the motorway A2 was interrupted at one location, near Maastricht. This section was referred to as N2, to make a distinction between the motorway (A2) and the non-motorway (N2).  The N2 through Maastricht  Until recently, the motorway A2 was interrupted between the interchanges Kruisdonk and Europaplein through Maastricht. This road section was built as a highway (N2) with several at-grade intersections with traffic lights. In December 2016 the Koning Willem-Alexandertunnel was opened to traffic, a 4-lane tunnel built in two layers, which put an end to this situation.  The N2 around Eindhoven  The beltway around the city of Eindhoven, the so-called Randweg between the interchanges Ekkersweijer and Leenderheide, uses a system of local-express lanes. The inner two lanes do not have any exits, so it is exclusively for express traffic passing the city of Eindhoven; it is considered a motorway (A2) with a maximum speed of . The outer two lanes are used by vehicles to and from Eindhoven and the neighbouring towns. It does not meet the Dutch standards of a motorway (steeper grades near intersections and smaller bend radiuses), and has a maximum speed of . These outer lanes have road number N2, to distinguish the local lanes from the express lanes.A2: vernieuwing randweg Eindhoven, Rijkswaterstaat (in Dutch)  History  Other reconstruction projects = The A2 motorway was subject to multiple reconstruction projects. Next to the project around Eindhoven, as described above, the A2 was being rebuilt at the following locations:  Amsterdam - Utrecht  Between interchanges Holendrecht and Oudenrijn, the road has been widened from six (2x3) to ten (2x5) lanes. It has enough space to expand the road to fourteen (2x7) lanes. Near the city of Utrecht, a system of local- express lanes has been applied, with the inner three lanes serving express traffic, and the outer two lanes serving local traffic. Unlike the situation near Eindhoven, the motorway status is maintained for local lanes, which means that all ten lanes will keep the name A2.A2: verbreding knooppunt Holendrecht ‚Äì aansluiting Maarssen, Rijkswaterstaat (in Dutch)A2: verbreding Maarssen tot knooppunt Oudenrijn, Rijkswaterstaat (in Dutch)  Utrecht - 's-Hertogenbosch  Between interchanges Oudenrijn and Everdingen, the A2 was expanded to 2x4 lanes. Between interchanges Everdingen and Deil, the road is widened from four (2x2) to eight lanes (2x4); the section between interchanges Deil and Empel was expanded from four to six lanes.A2: verbreding Everdingen - Deil, Rijkswaterstaat (in Dutch)  's-Hertogenbosch beltway  The A2 around the city of 's-Hertogenbosch was rebuilt similarly to the future situation near Utrecht. However, there are only just four express lanes, instead of the six near Utrecht, so the road has 4x2 lanes.A2: Rondweg 's-Hertogenbosch, Rijkswaterstaat (in Dutch)  's-Hertogenbosch - Eindhoven  Since both the 's-Hertogenbosch and Eindhoven beltways were finished in 2009, a new bottleneck appeared between both cities. The motorway has only 2x2 lanes while both beltways are having twice the capacity.

Built in 1828, it is one of the best-preserved surviving bridges built for the westward expansion of the National Road from Wheeling, West Virginia to Columbus, Ohio. S bridges derive their name from the sharply curving approaches to the span. The bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964. The bridge is closed to traffic, and may be seen from Blend Road on the north and Rhinehart Road on the south. Description and history The S Bridge is located about four miles east of Old Washington, just north of the current alignments of Interstate 70 and County Road 690. The latter provides access to the roads leading to the bridge, Blend Road and Rhinehart Road. The road alignment it follows is historically that of the National Road, and later United States Route 40. The bridge is approximately long, including approach elements. The main span is a segmented stone arch, whose crown is typically above the streambed. The bridge is built out of randomly laid ashlar stone, which rises to low parapets giving a roadway width of . There are large stone buttresses reinforcing each end of the arched section. The bridge's characteristic S shape is derived from the sharply curving approaches on either side of the main span. The National Road was a project authorized by the United States Congress when it created the state of Ohio, in order to provide a reliable transport route across the Appalachian Mountains. The road was completed to Wheeling in 1818, and Congress authorized an extension to Columbus in 1825. This bridge was built as part of that expansion project, and was the major route by which Ohio and the Old Northwest were settled. This is one of four surviving S bridges built in Ohio for the National Road.

History The feast, celebrated in Spain in the 16th century, was later introduced to Italy by Saint Gaspar del Bufalo. \\"Lives of the Saints,\\" by Omer Englebert, New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 1994, p. 254, (casebound) For many dioceses there were two days to which the Office of the Precious Blood was assigned, the office being in both cases the same. The reason was this: the office was at first granted to the Fathers of the Most Precious Blood only. Later, as one of the offices of the Fridays of Lent, it was assigned to the Friday after the fourth Sunday in Lent in some dioceses, including, by decision of the Fourth Provincial Council of Baltimore (1840), those in the United States. M√ºller, Ulrich. \\"Feast of the Most Precious Blood.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 21 December 2019] When Pope Pius IX went into exile at Gaeta in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (1849), he had as his companion Father Giovanni Merlini, third superior general of the Fathers of the Most Precious Blood. After they had arrived at Gaeta, Don Merlini suggested that the pope make a vow to extend the feast of the Precious Blood to the entire Church, if he would again recover possession of the Papal States. The Pope took the matter under consideration, but a few days later, on 30 June 1849, the day the French army conquered Rome and the insurgents of the Roman Republic capitulated, he sent his domestic prelate Joseph Stella to Father Merlini with the message: \\"The pope does not deem it expedient to bind himself by a vow; instead His Holiness is pleased to extend the feast immediately to all Christendom.\\" On 10 August of the same year, he officially included the feast of the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on the first Sunday in July, the first Sunday after 30 June, the anniversary of the liberation of the city of Rome from the insurgents.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 128\\"The Saint Andrew Daily Missal, with Vespers for Sundays and Feasts,\\" by Dom Gaspar LeFebvre, O.S.B., Saint Paul, MN: The E. M. Lohmann Co., 1952, p. 1409 In reducing the number of feasts fixed for Sundays, Pope Pius X assigned the date of 1 July to this feast. In 1933, Pope Pius XI raised the feast to the rank of Double of the 1st Class to mark the 1,900th anniversary of Jesus's death. In Pope John XXIII's 1960 revision of the General Roman Calendar, the feast was classified as of the first class (see General Roman Calendar of 1960). The feast was removed from the General Roman Calendar in 1969, \\"because the Most Precious Blood of Christ the Redeemer is already venerated in the solemnities of the Passion, of Corpus Christi, of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and in the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. But the Mass of the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ is placed among the votive Masses\\". Significance In Catholic belief, the Blood of Christ is precious because it is Christ's own great ransom paid for the redemption of mankind. In this belief, as there was to be no remission of sin without the shedding of blood, the \\"Incarnate Word\\" not only offered his life for the salvation of the world, but he offered to give up his life by a bloody death, and to hang bloodless, soulless and dead upon the Cross for the salvation of humanity. Jesus is said to have given his life - his blood - for the sake of all humanity, atoning for every form of human sin.\\"Lives of the Saints, For Every Day of the Year,\\" edited by Rev. Hugo Hoever, S.O.Cist., Ph.D., New York: Catholic Book Publishing Co., 1955, p. 251 The Precious Blood is a call to repentance and reparation.\\"Lives of the Saints, For Every Day of the Year,\\" p. 252 Prayer \\"O God, Who by the Precious Blood of Thine Only Begotten Son hast redeemed the whole world, preserve in us the work of Thy mercy, so that, ever honoring the mystery of our salvation, we may merit to obtain its fruits.

A Philadelphia icon, he gained local fame hosting live dances in the area, leading to his own independent radio show, on which he broke many acts in the 1960s, including the Four Seasons and the Isley Brothers. Blavat was born in South Philadelphia to a Jewish father and Italian mother. Career In 1953, Blavat debuted on the original Bandstand on WFIL-TV with Bob Horn and Lee Stewart. In 1956, he managed a national tour for Danny and the Juniors, and he worked as Don Rickles' valet in 1958‚Äì59. He got his start in radio in 1960. By 1963, his show was syndicated in Camden, Atlantic City, Trenton, Pottstown, Wilmington and Allentown. He said he refused to follow a playlist, \\"playing music from the heart, not a research chart.\\" During the 1960s, Blavat was a partner in the Lost Nite and Crimson record labels, along with Jared Weinstein and Collectables Records' founder Jerry Greene. Together, the three also owned Record Museum, a now-defunct chain of record stores based in Philadelphia. From 1965‚Äì1967, Blavat produced and hosted a weekly television show in Philadelphia called The Discophonic Scene, a dance show for \\"all my yon [sic] teens\\" along the lines of American Bandstand (which also began in Philadelphia a decade earlier), referring to himself as \\"the Geator with the Heater\\" and \\"the big boss with the hot sauce.\\" He also guest-starred on television shows including The Mod Squad, The Monkees, The Tonight Show, and The Joey Bishop Show. He has also appeared in the movies Desperately Seeking Susan, Baby It's You, and Cookie. In 1972, Blavat purchased a nightclub in Margate, New Jersey, and named it \\"Memories\\". Alleged Mafia connections In 1981, Blavat was having dinner at a South Philly restaurant with Greek mob boss Chelsais \\"Steve\\" Bouras and several other guests when Bouras was shot dead in a contract killing. In the early 1990s, an investigation by the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation into organized crime's influence in the liquor business made public Blavat's association with the Bruno-Scarfo crime family. During the investigation, Thomas A. DelGiorno, a former Scarfo family capo, testified that Blavat had regularly paid a \\"street tax\\" to the crime family, had purchased a $40,000 yacht for crime boss Nicodemo Scarfo and was one of several individuals who purchased a condominium in Florida for Scarfo. In exchange, the criminal organization secured employment for Blavat throughout the state and also kept union organizers out of Blavat's nightclub. Del Giorno also testified that Blavat regularly served as a driver for crime boss Angelo Bruno. Blavat pled the fifth and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Recent activity In 1993, Blavat was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Alliance's Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was included in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as part of a permanent exhibit in its Museum of Radio and Records. In 2002, he was inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia's \\"Hall of Fame\\". On January 15, 2020, Blavat celebrated his 60th consecutive year on radio. Blavat continues to broadcast on local radio seven days a week and perform at several record hops and events a week in greater Philadelphia, New Jersey, and Delaware. He has been producing oldies concerts at the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia every year since January 2002. He was a regular columnist for the Atlantic City Weekly for over 20 years and now writes his column, \\"Geator Gab,\\" exclusively for the New Jersey Free Press. He has been a member of the New York Friars' Club since 2010 and has been the emcee of Time Life's annual Malt Shop Memories Cruise since 2011. His night club, Memories, where he continues to perform during the summer, has been operating steadily in Margate, New Jersey, since 1972. As of 2020, Blavat is a DJ for oldies radio station WVLT (FM) 92.1 in the South Jersey area, for the University of Pennsylvania's public radio station WXPN in Philadelphia, for radio stations WTKU-FM and WOND in Atlantic City, WBCB (AM) in Bucks County and Trenton, and WISL (AM) in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In 2020, Jerry expanded his radio network to his first internet radio station, Tyme 102.9 WTYM-DB in Lutz, Florida. On July 23, 2011, Blavat's autobiography, You Only Rock Once: My Life In Music, was published by Running Press.

He is the Arnold Wolfers Professor Emeritus of Political Science and Management at Yale University, where he has been teaching for over fifty years. LaPalombara has twice chaired the political science department at Yale and has also served as the director of the Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Prior to joining Yale in 1964, LaPalombara spent three years (1947-1950) at Oregon State University and an additional eleven years (1953-1964) at Michigan State University. At the latter institution he also chaired (1957-1962) the political science department. For his research, writing and teaching about Italy, LaPalombara was named a knight and then a knight-commander in that country's Order of Merit society. He has been a Vice-President of the American Political Science Association; the President of the Conference Group for the Study of Italian Politics and Society; and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a member of the New York Council on Foreign Policy.  Early Life and Education  The son of Italian immigrants, LaPalombara grew up on the mean streets of Chicago's Near West Side. Like most of his age peers, he dropped out of high school at age sixteen, following which he worked in a variety of industrial plants. He learned in those plants a large range of specialized industrial occupations, including the treatment of steels as high temperatures. LaPalombara, a high-school dropout, spent the years of World War II at specialized jobs in defense industries. A special wartime-related admissions program of the University of Illinois permitted him to enroll in and eventually to graduate (with highest honors) from that institution. In addition to his academic honors (e.g., Phi Kappa Phi, Phi Beta Kappa, Bronze Tablet), LaPalombara was also president of the Student Senate and of his Senior Class. Following a short teaching stint (1947-1950) at Oregon State University, LaPalombara enrolled at Princeton University, the institution from which (1954) he was awarded the Ph.D. degree.  Career  LaPalombara's professional career encompasses teaching and research, extensive consulting, and experience in entrepreneurship as well as in diplomacy. His teaching in the United States has included visiting-professorships at the University of California (Berkeley) and Columbia University. In Italy he has been a visiting-professor at the universities of Florence and Catania, as well as the John Cabot University at Rome, and that same city's Free University (LUISS). Most recently, LaPalombara also taught at the University of Bergamo. LaPalombara's earliest consulting involved governmental agencies such as the Foreign Service Institute, the Agency for International Development and the Central Intelligence Agency. Earlier in his career, he was a consultant to the Ford and the Rockefeller foundations, the Social Science Research Council, and other major American foundations. He later shifted his consulting to the private industrial sphere, beginning with a stint as a senior advisor to the National Industrial Conference Board of New York. There then followed consultancies with U.S. corporations like IBM, Exxon-Mobil, E.R. Grace, Union Carbide, Praxair, General Electric and many others. In Italy his corporate clients have included ENI (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi), Telecom Italia, FIAT and SIAD (Bergamo). Consultancies led him eventually to become a founder and first president of a New York consultancy, Multinational Strategies, Incorporated. In diplomacy he did a short stint (1980-1981) as First Secretary in charge of the cultural section of the U.S. Embassy, at Rome, Italy. LaPalombara poses with his wife as well as with Maxwell Rabb, Ambassador of the United States to Italy, at the US Embassy in Rome in 1981. LaPalombara served at the US Embassy in Rome for a year as the First Secretary for Cultural Affairs. At Yale, in the early 1970s, LaPalombara joined with other faculty who favored the creation of the Yale School of Management (SOM). He taught in SOM for five years at that time, and again just before he formally retired in the year 2001. Since that time, and in every academic year that followed, he has taught for advanced undergraduate students a seminar on the overseas investments of global firms.  Scholarship  LaPalombara has been a leading figure in the sphere of political science denominated \\"comparative politics.\\" He was for many years a member of the SSRC's well-regarded Committee on Comparative Politics. The Committee functioned as one aspect of a so-called behavioral revolution which pointed in a more empirical direction the comparative study of political systems. Along that same vein, LaPalombara also published (1974) a heralded textbook, Politics Within Nations a tome that sought to light the way to a more realistic study of the politics of many countries. His research has been characterized by extensive writing on the topic of interest-group theory, and its application to political phenomenon both in the United States and abroad. LaPalombara in 1950 published both a monograph and an article in the American Political Science Review on the interest-group-centered study of political dynamics. He published, in English and in Rivista Italiana di Politiche Pubbliche, another article on this subject in 2017.  Research  LaPalombara has conducted extensive research inside the United States, as well as internationally in countries such as Italy and Vietnam. His research and writing on Italy has won him many awards; further, the publication of Democracy Italian Style (Yale University Press, 1987) won him plaudits from writers like Gore Vidal and Umberto Eco. For Prentice-Hall, LaPalombara once edited a series of short books, depicting what was new and important in comparative politics. Widely recognized and admired scholars wrote for this series. The latter included Karl Friedrich, Henry Ehrman, Jean Blondel, James Scott, Philip Shively, Robert Putnam as well as others. It helped that this was also a time when the Yale political science department numbered several brilliant scholars of worldwide renown. Along with his consultancies came another intellectual gear shift in LaPalombara's research and teaching. His attention turned to the important role played by multinational corporations, or global firms‚Äîboth in the international economy and in the evolutionary prospects of LDCs, or less developed countries. LaPalombara coauthored several books with Stephen Blank which were then issued by the National Industrial Conference Board. All of them address problems, at home and abroad, created by foreign direct investments made by American and foreign international firms. The field has exploded since a time when LaPalombara was among its pioneers. LaPalombara's scholarship is in part reflected in the many books he has written or co-edited. They join the several hundred journal articles and book chapters he has published, to establish him as a significant scholar in his field (see list below). Another aspect of his commitment to scholarly writing is LaPalombara's current membership on the editorial boards of the Yale Review and of the Journal of International Business Education. Indeed, he serves as the U.S. editor of the latter journal. He is also a founding member of the Italian Social Science Council. In this regard, and along with several other Italian and American scholars, the CSS Committee arguably served to introduce in Italy advanced research methods in all of the social sciences. Indeed, before the CNN and the U.S.-Italian effort that it involved, there did not exist post-graduate training in the social sciences.  Journalism  In addition to his experience as a teacher, an academic researcher, or an industrial consultant, LaPalombara has sought to use journalism to further the systematic empirical study of the political process. He has therefore published hundreds of articles for Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica, Il Messaggero and many other Italian newspapers and magazines. For many years he was both the U.S. editor and then editor-in-chief of Italy Italy, a periodical designed to show that Italy is much more than a beautiful country of pasta, pizza, perfumes and high fashion. For many years, LaPalombara, as editor, published introductions to numbers of this magazine. As a consultant for several financial groups, LaPalombara also provided a running analysis of what might be transpiring, politically, in Italy.

Daughter of an engineer and a journalist, she married the British poet Hugo Williams in 1965, with whom she has a daughter, Murphy Williams, also a writer and journalist. Bohemian London At the end of the 1960s she contributed to International Times, a hippy magazine, carrying out interviews with Jean-Luc Godard, Philippe Garrel, Len Lye etc. In the early 1970s she spent time as a tightrope walker (see her book The Tightrope Walker), performing, for example, with COUM Transmissions (pre-Throbbing Gristle), and spending a season with J√©r√¥me Savary's Grand Magic Circus in Paris in 1974, acting in Copi's play Goodbye Mister Freud. She played the character of Chaos, singing Piaf's \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\", in Derek Jarman's Jubilee. She also took part in Alternative Miss World, organised by the artist Andrew Logan. Hermine wrote three plays; Lou Andr√©as Salom√© (starring Richard O'Brien and Jenny Runacre), He Who Is Your Lord Is Your Child Too (starring Anne Bean) and The Knives Beside the Plates (with the Neo-Naturist Cabaret), between 1978 and 1980. From October 1980 until 1981, she performed musical interludes at The Comic Strip, a pioneering caf√©-theatre in Soho with comedians such as Rik Mayall and Jennifer Saunders. In addition she performed and organised various evening shows of performance art. She acted in John Maybury's Court of Miracles in 1982 and Hilda Was a Goodlooker by Anna Thew (London Film-Makers Co-Operative) in 1986. Chanteuse In 1974, while employed as a tightrope walker by The Moodies, she sang for the first time in public, singing \\"I Won't Make It Without You\\" by Nick Lowe. With Moodier, successor group to The Moodies, she performed a version of Roy Orbison's \\"Blue Angel\\" produced by Max Paddison in the style of a Marlene Dietrich song. In 1976 she played two concerts with the group The Subterraneans, composed of Nick Kent and The Damned without their singer Dave Vanian, and also recorded with both Nick Kent and Peter Perrett; the resulting single was being released. David Cunningham from The Flying Lizards noticed Hermine and helped recorded her single \\"Torture\\", originally planned for Virgin Records but which was eventually released on her own label Salom√© Records, with a later remastered release on Human Records. She then released a second single with Human. In April 1982 the Belgian record label Crammed Discs released an album containing six songs by Hermine, The World On My Plates, well known for the cover photograph by Richard Rayner-Canham where Hermine loads 7\\" singles into a dishwasher while wearing a ball gown. She toured in 1982 and 1983. The follow-up album Lonely At The Top was released in July 1984 on her own label (Salom√©). Swiss session recordings for another album, along with a couple of re-recordings, were eventually released on Who'll Come Walking in 2008. Her two albums were both re-released in digitally remastered CD editions in 2006 by Les Temps Modernes (LTM). Although having recorded very little since 1984, viewers of the TV series French & Saunders and Absolutely Fabulous have been able to see her as well as hear her French- accented voice in numerous musical pastiches (she sings a French version of the theme tune at the end of the episode \\"Paris\\" in 2001.) She sang in May 2008 during a cycle rally that took place between Sacy-le-Petit and Verderonne in l'Oise, France, and on 11 and 12 June at Andrew Logan's Summer Sale at the GlassHouse in London. Lady of the Manor Hermine is president of the non- profit organisation Ateliers d‚Äôartistes de Sacy, based in the Ch√¢teau de Sacy (a country house that she inherited in 1994 from her grandparents Hermine and Armand Dupuis, after having bought out the shares of her brothers and sisters, cousins and aunt), in Sacy-le-Petit, l'Oise. The organisation organises artists' residences by British and French artists and hosts exhibitions. She is also secretary of the Blondin Memorial Trust, dedicated to the memory of the tightrope walker Charles Blondin.

On 28 September 2010, Mbarushimana was indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague for crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2009. He was arrested in France in October 2010 and extradited to the ICC on 25 January 2011. However, he was released on 23 December 2011 as the ICC found there was insufficient evidence for prosecuting him. Alleged participation in the Rwandan Genocide Mbarushimana is alleged to have directed and participated in the murder of 32 people in 1994 -- including U.N. employees he was given the responsibility to protect. He was dismissed from the U.N. in 2001 but in 2004 he won a lawsuit seeking compensation for his dismissal. Mbarushimana joined the UN in 1992 and remained a staff member until 2001 serving in Angola and Kosovo. At the time of the Genocide, Mbarushimana was left in charge of providing supplies and support to the UN national staff who had been left behind following the UN's evacuation of international civilian staff. A strange designation as the years prior to the Genocide, Callixte Mbarushimana is known to have participated in anti-Tutsi rallies. Additionally, evidence collected by the ICTR team preparing the draft indictment against him indicated that before the war he trained a personal militia. Mbarushimana is alleged not only to have handed over UN vehicles and supplies to Rwandan militias (e.g. the Interahamwe) or the military, but he is also accused of being directly involved in killing and ordering the killing of people during the genocide. Amongst the U.N. employees Mbarushimana is alleged to have murdered was Florence Ngirumpatse, the director of personnel at the U.N. development office in Kigali. When war crimes investigator Tony Grieg researched the Mbarushimana case, he interviewed at least 20 people who witnessed the murders and confirmed that Mbarushimana was directly involved. However, Mbarushimana was never indicted for these crimes, possibly because he was not considered to be one of the main organisers of the killings. Indicted by the International Criminal Court On 11 October 2010, Mbarushimana was arrested in France under a sealed warrant from the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the Kivus (Democratic Republic of the Congo).\\"New suspect in the ICC's custody: Callixte Mbarushimana arrives at the ICC detention centre\\" Press Release ICC, 25 Jan 2011 The warrant concerns widespread attacks allegedly committed by troops of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), against civilians in North and South Kivu in 2009. The Court's judges state that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mbarushimana, as Executive Secretary of the FDLR, bears criminal responsibility for these attacks, including murder, torture, rape, persecution and inhumane acts. The warrant alleges that Mbarushimana was part of a plan to create a humanitarian catastrophe to extract concessions of political power for the FDLR. On 25 January 2011, Mbarushimana was extradited to the International Criminal Court for prosecution at The Hague. Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo issued a statement in which he recalled that Mbarushimana's FDLR triggered the Congo wars and that girls and women have borne the brunt of ruthless sexual violence for almost a generation. He stated that, due to the ICC, \\"rape can no longer be used as a weapon of war\\". =Released= On 16 December 2011 the First Preliminary Chamber of the ICC, by a two-to-one majority, dismissed the charges against Mbarushimana, on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence for assuming that he has contributed to the war crimes in North and South Kivu. The Prosecutor's appeal against an immediate release was rejected on 23 December, and Mbarushimana was released the same day. On 30 May 2012 the ICC's Appeal Chamber also dismissed the Prosecutor's appeal against the decision not to prosecute him.

Pre-independence The KNDP was formed in 1955 by John Ngu Foncha. The party initially sought a close relationship with the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon of Cameroun and in the early days contained a number of UPC members who had fled persecution in the French zone. However whilst Foncha supported autonomy for the South this was rejected by the UPC who wanted full reunification.Julius Atemkeng Amin, The Peace Corps in Cameroon, Kent State University Press, 1992. The KNDP ended their relationship with the UPC in 1957 and the Francophone party were banned in the British territory. The party also split from the Kamerun National Congress (of which Foncha had previously been a member) and the two parties became bitter rivals over the KNC's support for incorporation into Nigeria. The KNDP's stance proved the most popular and they won the legislative elections in 1959, forcing the KNU into opposition.Christof Heyns, Human Rights Law in Africa: 1996 , p. 137 As the governing party they supported a united independent Cameroon but one organised along federal lines and this was endorsed by a referendum in 1961. As a result E. M. L. Endeley's Cameroon People's National Convention (CPNC), which supported the Nigeria, emerged as the main source of opposition to KNDP hegemony, with attempts by the KNDP to absorb the party floundering due to personality clashes.H. Pick & B. Bloom, 'Cameroon', C. Legum, Africa Handbook, Penguin, 1969. Post-independence and merger Following independence, democracy largely receded in Cameroon as the KNDP in what became known as West Cameroon and the Cameroon Union (UC) in East Cameroon established their respective hegemonies.Edith Brown Weiss & Harold Karan Jacobson, Engaging Countries: Strengthening Compliance with International Environmental Accords, MIT Press, 1998, p. 442 However whilst Ahmadou Ahidjo and the UC enjoyed full control in the East, the KNDP initially did not enjoy the same levels of endorsement, their 78% of the vote in 1964 parliamentary elections some way behind the 98% won by the UC. Foncha was forced to relinquish his position as Prime Minister of West Cameroon in 1965 when he was elected Vice-President to Ahidjo on a joint ticket as the Constitution of Cameroon stated that both offices could not be held simultaneously. As a consequence Augustine Ngom Jua was chosen as the new Prime Minister, although not before a round of bitter in-fighting which saw Solomon Tandeng Muna, who had been an important figure in the foundation of the KNDP, split away to form his own Cameroon United Congress (CUC). Initially this put the KNDP in a weaker position, particularly with regards to the UC which was the only effective party in the East. However before long KNDP dominance became as complete when both the CPNC and the CUC were absorbed by the KNDP. Finally the two dominant parties merged into one, the Cameroonian National Union, in 1966 and almost immediately this group became the sole party in a unitary state. Attempted revival In 1990 Victorin Hameni Bieleu mooted the possibility of re-establishing the KNDP and contacted Foncha with a view to securing his support. However this did not prove forthcoming and so the plans were shelved in favour of Bieleu forming his own party the Union of Democratic Forces of Cameroon.Biography OF Dr. Victorin HAMENI BIELEU, National Chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces of Cameroon (UFDC) References Category:Political parties established in 1955 Category:Defunct political parties in Cameroon Category:British Cameroons Category:1955 establishments in British Cameroons ","title":"Kamerun National Democratic Party"},{"id":"17970217","text":"The Battle of Liaoluo Bay () took place in 1633 off the coast of Fujian, China; involving the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Chinese Ming dynasty's navies. The battle was fought at the crescent-shaped Liaoluo Bay that forms the southern coast of the island of Kinmen. A Dutch fleet under Admiral Hans Putmans was attempting to control shipping in the Taiwan Strait, while the southern Fujian sea traffic and trade was protected by a fleet under Brigadier General Zheng Zhilong. This was the largest naval encounter between Chinese and European forces before the Opium Wars two hundred years later.  Background  The Ming dynasty of the 17th century had relaxed its age old practice of banning maritime trade, allowing the Chinese coast to bustle with commercial activity. The Ming navy, however, had been poorly maintained and ineffectual, such that pirates had practically controlled this trade. The pirate leader Zheng Zhilong in particular dominated the Fujian coast, his ships decked with European cannons and mercenaries from Japan to Africa. The Ming court, in its decline, recruited Zheng Zhilong in 1628 rather than to try and destroy him. Although the more piratical elements of his fleet deserted him after he surrendered to the Ming, Zheng's new status as a Ming admiral allowed him to go after his former lieutenants. He was aided in this anti- pirate campaign by the Dutch under the governor of Formosa (Taiwan), Hans Putmans. The Dutch had been trying to gain permission to trade freely in China, without much success. In 1622 they established a position on the Pescadores, but were militarily defeated by the Ming in a war lasting from 1623 to 1624, and this forced the Dutch to withdraw from the Pescadores and establish themselves on Taiwan instead. Zheng Zhilong had promised to lobby on behalf of the Dutch if they in turn helped defeat his former subordinate Li Kuiqi (ÊùéÈ≠ÅÂ•á); however, when this was accomplished in February 1630, Putmans received no guarantees about trade. Unbeknownst to Putmans, Zheng Zhilong had not been able to fulfill his promise because he then served a new Governor of Fujian, , who was hostile to the Dutch. Putmans believed that Zheng Zhilong had turned back on his promises, and decided that the Chinese bureaucracy would respond better to violence since he saw that pirates like Zheng Zhilong were recruited into officialdom. As Zheng Zhilong was preparing to attack the pirates and Li Guozhu (ÊùéÂúãÂä©), Putmans attacked Zheng's base in Amoy by surprise on 7 July 1633. Dutch surprise attack Zheng Zhilong had adapted European technology throughout his maritime career, decking his ships with European cannons and mercenaries, and in 1633 he had built a new fleet according to European designs: whereas most Chinese junks held at most eight smaller cannons, Zheng's new ships had two reinforced gundecks that could hold up to thirty-six large guns, shooting out of Western-inspired gunports. According to a Dutch account, these ‚Äúlarge, beautiful war junks were equipped with large cannons, some of them having more than our own warships.‚Äù Putmans would later write about these ships in admiration: \\"Never before in this land so far as anyone can remember, has anyone seen a fleet like this, with such beautiful, huge, well-armed junks.\\" However, the new fleet was not given a chance to prove its worth, for it offered no resistance against the Dutch as they sailed around Gulang Island into the harbour of Amoy, thinking they were friendly. The Dutch fired at the Chinese fleet without warning. The ships had not been crewed yet and were filled with workers, who jumped ship. As soon as it was apparent that the Chinese would offer no retaliation, Putmans ordered his men to burn the ships to save powder. Three large junks escaped being burned or hacked to pieces and the Dutch suffered only one casualty ‚Äî a sailor who had died setting a fire. Following the destruction of Zheng Zhilong's fleet, the Dutch roamed the seas with impunity, pillaging villages and capturing vessels. The pirates Liu Xiang and Li Guozhu joined Putmans, and for a time it seemed the Dutch were becoming the head of a new pirate coalition that operated off the coast of China, with at least 41 pirate junks and 450 Chinese soldiers. Putmans hoped these piratical activities would force China to agree to his demands for free trade; but they had the opposite effect, Putmans's actions had united the political enemies Zheng Zhilong and Zou Weilian together. Planning a counterattack, Zheng rebuilt his fleet as Zou gathered commanders from all over the Fujian coast. Zheng also recruited locals willing to join by rewarding each volunteer with two pieces of silver. If the battle lasted longer than expected, the reward would be increased to five. Zheng put the locals on 100 small fire boats, manned by 16 people each. If a boat set fire to one Dutch ship, they would be rewarded with 200 pieces of silver. If they presented a Dutch head, they would be rewarded with 50. Zheng Zhilong bade his time building his fleet even as the Dutch gathered strength from the pirates joining them, and he forestalled the Dutch by impersonating Chinese officials offering fake promises of free trade. In this way he also learned of the Dutch plans from their replies. His stalling bore fruit, as the typhoon season brought gales that hit the Dutch fleet, incapacitating four of its ships. In October 1633, now ready to strike, Zheng Zhilong sent a derogatory message to Putmans: \\"How can a dog be suffered to lay his head on the pillow of the emperor's resting place?\\" and brought his fleet to the Dutch anchorage at Liaoluo Bay. Chinese counterattack The Dutch East India Company's fleet consisted of the ships Broeckerhaven, Slooterdijck, Wieringen, Perdam, Zeeburg, Koudekerke, Zalm and Bleiswijk. These were all yachts, with the exception of Slooterdijck, a prefab boat, shipped from Enkhuizen and assembled in the Indies. The Dutch had anchored at Liaoluo Bay off Kinmen Island with these eight vessels and fifty junks belonging to their Chinese pirate allies flying the VOC flag. Zheng, on the other hand, had around 150 junks consisting of imperial ships, merchant ships, and his own personal vessels. Fifty of these were large junks. The decisive encounter occurred on October 22 when Zheng's fleet met the Dutch ships and fifty ships from Chinese pirate allies. Zheng ordered his fleet to ignore the latter and focus on attacking the Dutch fleet. Knowing that the Chinese ships could not match the Dutch ships in a firefight, Zheng Zhilong instead resolved to use fireships. In order to fool the Dutch to expect otherwise, Zheng chose to use large warjunks as the fireships, decking them with cannon and soldiers (who were equipped with bamboo tubes and were to jump overboard just before crashing the ship into the enemy fleet). The Dutch did not expect the large warjunks to come straight at them, hence they did not even have time to raise their anchors. Ming fireships set fire to the Broeckerhaven. Slooterdijck was hooked on by four Chinese warships. After repulsing two boarding attempts, the Dutch boat was defeated and captured. Some sources state that Wieringen was sunk by cannon from Ming warships, but in fact she survived and foundered in 1636 off Malacca.RGP- GS166, 1979. Dutch-Asiatic Shipping in the 17th and 18th centuries, Volume II, Outward-bound voyages from the Netherlands to Asia and the Cape (1595-1794). - Den Haag: Martinus Nijhoff, 1979, 765 pp Hans Putmans fled with the Perdam, Zeeburg, Wieringen and Bleiswijk to . His pirate allies, most of which had fled at the beginning of the battle, were then defeated in turn. The Koudekerke was surrounded, boarded, and sunk; the Zalm was sent to her relief but got surrounded also. They were both initially assumed lost by Putmans but later it was discovered that the Zalm had been able to withdraw to Cochinchina. Dutch vessels were able to outsail the pursuing Chinese ships by sailing close to the wind, since European rigging at the time were more complex than Chinese ones and performed better in that situation. Aftermath Ming officials hailed the victory as a \\"miracle at sea\\", as Zou Weilian observed that people had felt \\"ever since the red barbarians arrived... this kind of victory had been extremely rare\\". The victory at Liaoluo Bay had reestablished the prestige and authority of China in the Taiwan Strait, as Hans Putmans ceased his piratical activities on the Chinese coast. Putmans's superiors in Batavia especially ordered him to stay away from China and \\"out of harm's way so [Dutch ships] won't be exposed to the kind of fury and resolution the Chinese displayed at Liaoluo Bay.\\" However, Putmans felt that his plan had not came to naught, since the Dutch \\"showed what damage and disruption we can cause them, and it appears that even though they held the field, destroyed two of our yachts, and drove us from their coast, they still came seeking peace with us, and have granted us better trade than ever.\\" Zheng Zhilong also prospered. He had earned Zou Weilian's respect through this battle. Zou recommended Zheng for promotion in a memorial to the throne but Zheng, in his newfound fame as someone who could keep the Dutch under control, used his influence to remove Zou from power. Now that Zheng had removed political opposition, he was free to grant the Dutch trading privileges, which was what both Zheng and Putmans wanted originally. Since Zheng defeated the Dutch using conventional means and made peace with them afterwards, he did not rebuild the European-styled ships that he lost in 1633. The pirate Liu Xiang attempted to renew the piratical alliance with the Dutch in 1634, but Putmans replied that the current situation suited the Dutch well and refused. Liu Xiang's pirate gang was eventually eliminated in the 1640s by Zheng Zhilong, who came to hold uncontested hegemony over the overseas Chinese trade. He had become one of the richest men in China, with his annual income estimated at three to four times that of the whole Dutch East India Company.

It includes warnings against materialism on the centenary of the apparitions at Lourdes. It was given at Rome, from St. Peter's Basilica, on the feast of the Visitation of the Most Holy Virgin, July 2, 1957, the nineteenth year of his pontificate. The encyclical recalls pleasant memories of the pilgrimage to Lourdes which Pope Pius XII undertook as papal delegate at the Eucharistic and Marian Celebrations in 1937. The Pope reminds the faithful of France that every Christian land is a Marian land and that \\"there is not one nation redeemed in the blood of Christ which does not glory in proclaiming Mary its Mother and Patroness\\".Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 5 He then recalls the history of Marian veneration, the history of Lourdes and the contributions of the Popes to her veneration in Lourdes. The Popes and Lourdes The first part of the encyclical reviews the contributions of the papacy to the veneration in Lourdes. =Pius IX and Leo XIII= The encyclical recalls that in 1892 Leo XIII granted the proper Office and Mass of the feast \\"In apparitione Beatae Mariae Virginis Immaculatae\\", which his successor was to extend to the universal Church a short time later. He installed and blessed a reproduction of the Grotto of Massabielle in the Vatican gardens, and prayed: :In her power may the Virgin Mother, who once cooperated through her love with the birth of the faithful into the Church, now be the means and guardian of our salvation; may she return the tranquillity of peace to troubled souls; may she hasten the return of Jesus Christ in private and public life.Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 19-21 And on 3 July 1876 Pius IX crowned the statue of our Lady of the Rosary at the Rosary Basilica in Lourdes. =Saint Pius X= The encyclical states that fifty years after the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, Saint Pius X wrote in Ad diem illum that his predecessor Pius IX, \\"had hardly defined it to be of Catholic faith that Mary was from her very origin exempt from sin, when the Virgin herself began performing miracles at Lourdes.\\"Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 21 Pius X created the episcopal see of Lourdes, and authorized the introduction of the cause of beatification of Bernadette. He emphasized the wonderful harmony at Lourdes between Eucharistic worship and Marian prayer.Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 22 Pope Pius XII concludes: \\"It could not have been otherwise. Everything about Mary directs us to her Son, our only Savior, in anticipation of whose merits she was immaculate and full of grace. Everything about Mary raises us to the praise of the adorable Trinity.\\"Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 23 The encyclical adds that Saint Pius X viewed the shrine of Lourdes as surpassing in glory all others in the Catholic world.Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 24 =Benedict XV and Pius XI= The encyclical states that Benedict XV added new indulgences but was unable to do much more because of the First World War. Pius XI, who had been to Lourdes himself as a pilgrim, continued the work of Benedict XV. He canonized Bernadette, Sister Marie Bernard. And he described Lourdes as \\"now justly considered one of the principal Marian shrines in the world\\".Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 28 Pius XII recalls his own previous encyclical,Fulgens corona in which he wrote about Lourdes; :The Blessed Virgin Mary herself wanted to confirm by some special sign the definition which the Vicar on earth of her Divine Son had pronounced amidst the vigorous approbation of the whole Church.Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 29 The challenge of materialism The second part of the encyclical deals with conversion, specifically a Marian conversion of heart and society. The Virgin invites to the conversion of hearts and the hope of forgiveness.Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 38 Individual conversion is not enough. The Pope appeals for Christian renewal of society in answer to Mary's appeal.Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 43 =Definition= The root of the evil according to Pius XII, is a terrible temptation to materialism. This is not confined to materialistic (Marxist) philosophy. It exists also as \\"a love of money which creates ever greater havoc, as modern enterprises expand, which unfortunately determines many of the decisions which weigh heavy on the life of the people. It finds expression in the cult of the body, in excessive desire for comforts, a flight from all the austerities of life, an unrestrained search for pleasure, a concept of life which regulates everything exclusively in terms of material prosperity and earthly satisfactions.\\"Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 46, 47 The encyclical teaches that the school of Mary provides many practical answers. =School of Mary= In the school of Mary one can learn to live not only to give Christ to the world, but also to await with faith the hour of Jesus, and to remain with Mary at the foot of the cross. Wherever providence has placed a person, there is always more to be done for God's cause. The encyclical states that priests should with supernatural confidence show the narrow road which leads to life. The consecrated and religious fight under Mary's banner against inordinate lust for freedom, riches, and pleasures. In response to the Immaculate, they will fight with the weapons of prayer and penance and gain triumphs of charity. Christian families must remain faithful to their vital mission in society, and consecrate themselves in the current jubilee year to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. For married couples this consecration will be a valuable aid in their conjugal duties of chastity and faithfulness and keep pure the atmosphere in which children grow up. Families inspired by devotion to Mary are living centers of social rebirth and apostolic influence.Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 54 Professional and civic affairs offer a vast field of Marian action. Gathered at the Virgin's feet, and open to her teachings, self- examination will uproot any false judgments and selfish impulses. Christians of every class and every nation will try to be of one mind in truth and charity, and to banish misunderstanding and suspicion. The quest for social and political peace among men is, above all, a moral problem, because no reform can bear fruit, no agreement be lasting without a conversion and cleansing of heart. In the jubilee year the Virgin of Lourdes reminds all men of this truth.Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 55 =The poor and suffering= Pius XII teaches that Mary looks upon some of her children with a special affection, the lowly, the poor, and the afflicted whom Jesus loved so much. :Go to her, you who are crushed by material misery, defenseless against the hardships of life and the indifference of men. Go to her, you who are assailed by sorrows and moral trials. Go to her, beloved invalids and infirm, you who are sincerely welcomed and honored at Lourdes as the suffering members of our Lord. Go to her and receive peace of heart, strength for your daily duties, joy for the sacrifice you offer.Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 57 The Pontiff states that the Immaculate Virgin knows the secret ways by which grace operates in souls. She also knows the great price which God attaches to sufferings, united to those of the Savior. These sufferings can greatly contribute. The encyclical closes with a quote of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux: :Amid dangers, difficulties, and doubts, think of Mary, invoke Mary's aid. ...If you follow her, you will not stray; if you entreat her, you will not lose hope; if you reflect upon her, you will not err; if she supports you, you will not fall; if she protects you, you will not fear; if she leads you, you will not grow weary; if she is propitious, you will reach your goal...Second Homily on the Missus est: PL CLXXXIIILe p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 70-71 Pope Pius XII declares himself fully convinced that Mary will hear all prayers. In this his last Marian encyclical, he imparts to the faithful, the shrine of Lourdes and its pilgrims, \\"the most bounteous outpouring of grace with all Our heart, and with Our constant and paternal best wishes, the Apostolic Benediction.\\"Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, 72 73 See also *Marian papal encyclicals and Apostolic Letters References * Pope Pius XII, Mariological encyclicals and bulls **Encyclical Fulgens corona on the Vatican website ** Encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam on the Vatican website **Encyclical Deiparae Virginis Mariae on the Vatican Website ** Encyclical Ingruentium malorum on the Vatican website ** Encyclical Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes on the Vatican website ** Encyclical Mystici Corporis Christi on the Vatican website ** Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus on the Vatican Website * Acta Apostolicae Sedis.

In its most popular form, it states the following: : Let X be a paracompact space and Y a Banach space. :Let F\\\\colon X\\\\to Y be a lower hemicontinuous multivalued map with nonempty convex closed values. :Then there exists a continuous selection f\\\\colon X \\\\to Y of F. : Conversely, if any lower semicontinuous multimap from topological space X to a Banach space, with nonempty convex closed values, admits a continuous selection, then X is paracompact. This provides another characterization for paracompactness.  Examples  159x159px = A function that satisfies all requirements = The function: F(x)= [1-x/2, ~1-x/4] , shown by the grey area in the figure at the right, is a multi-valued function from the real interval [0,1] to itself. It satisfies all Michael's conditions, and indeed it has a continuous selection, for example: f(x)= 1-x/2 or f(x)= 1-3x/8 . = A function that does not satisfy lower hemicontinuity = The function F(x)= \\\\begin{cases} 3/4 & 0 \\\\le x < 0.5  \\\\left[0,1\\\\right] & x = 0.5  1/4 & 0.5 < x \\\\le 1 \\\\end{cases} is a multi-valued function from the real interval [0,1] to itself. It has nonempty convex closed values. However, it is not lower hemicontinuous at 0.5. Indeed, Michael's theorem does not apply and the function does not have a continuous selection: any selection at 0.5 is necessarily discontinuous.  Applications  Michael selection theorem can be applied to show that the differential inclusion :\\\\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\\\\in F(t,x(t)), \\\\quad x(t_0)=x_0 has a C1 solution when F is lower semi-continuous and F(t, x) is a nonempty closed and convex set for all (t, x). When F is single valued, this is the classic Peano existence theorem.  Generalizations  A theorem due to Deutsch and Kenderov generalizes Michel selection theorem to an equivalence relating approximate selections to almost lower hemicontinuity, where F is said to be almost lower hemicontinuous if at each x \\\\in X, all neighborhoods V of 0 there exists a neighborhood U of x such that \\\\cap_{u\\\\in U} \\\\\\\\{F(u)+V\\\\\\\\} e \\\\emptyset. Precisely, Deutsch‚ÄìKenderov theorem states that if X is paracompact, Y a normed vector space and F (x) is nonempty convex for each x \\\\in X, then F is almost lower hemicontinuous if and only if F has continuous approximate selections, that is, for each neighborhood V of 0 in Y there is a continuous function f \\\\colon X \\\\mapsto Y such that for each x \\\\in X, f (x) \\\\in F (X) + V. In a note Xu proved that Deutsch‚ÄìKenderov theorem is also valid if Y is a locally convex topological vector space.

In it, Kidd discusses the basis for society as an evolving phenomenon, with reference to past societies, the important developments of his own period of thriving capitalist industry, and possible future developments. The book is important in that it summarises the thinking of Herbert Spencer as well as others like Karl Marx at the end of the nineteenth century when many people were trying to make sense of Darwin's evolutionary ideas, and social Darwinism was a hot topic. Kidd finds flaws in the ideas of both Spencer and Marx. With no knowledge of World War I that was to come in 1914, or the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, Kidd explained the flaw in Marx's thinking, and predicted that capitalist industries would not ultimately fall into the hands of the workers as Marx was claiming was inevitable, and that any communist society must ultimately fail. Herbert Spencer, whose writings were very influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century, thought that man's nature was evolving towards a state of perfection such that he would naturally live in harmony with society, but Kidd explained how this was incompatible with the neo- Darwinian theory that was being accepted as a result of August Weismann's doctrine of germ-line transmission without modification. Kidd's major claim is that religion makes sense when seen as what he calls a 'supra-rational sanction' for our behaviour, which acts in the interest of survival of the group, and the yet-to-be-born members of the group, and is necessarily in conflict with our basic human instincts which act in favour of the individual in his lifetime. Thus, while not believing in any supernatural being, Kidd proposed that religion, a feature of so many past and present societies, was probably essential to the evolutionary survival of a society.  Chapters  1 The Outlook \\"To the thoughtful mind the outlook at the close of the nineteenth century is profoundly interesting. .. a definite stage in the evolution of society is drawing to a close ... Yet one of the most curious features of the time is the almost complete absence of any clear indication from those who speak in the name of science and authority as to the direction in which the path of future progress lies\\". 2 Conditions of Human Progress \\"It is now coming to be recognised as a necessarily inherent part of the doctrine of evolution, that if the continual selection which is always going on amongst the higher forms of life were to be suspended, these forms would not only possess no tendency to make progress forwards, but must actually go backwards\\". 3 There is no Rational Sanction for the Conditions of Progress \\"As man can only reach his highest development and employ his powers to the full extent in society, it follows that in the evolution we witness him undergoing throughout history, his development as an individual is necessarily of less importance than his development as a social creature.\\" \\"Do any of us deny ourselves a single scuttle of coals so as to make our coalfields last for one more generation?\\" 4 The Central Feature of Human History \\"If we could conceive a visitor from another planet coming amongst us ...

It is widely distributed in lakes and rivers in the northern hemisphere, but is sensitive to poor water quality. Description Long-stalked pondweed has tall stems to 3 m growing from stout, rusty-spotted perennial rhizomes. The stems often change direction between each node, giving a characteristic zig-zagging pattern. The transparent pale to deep green leaves are typically between 60 and 150 mm long but occasionally reach 250 mm and are 14‚Äì40 mm wide. The stipules are persistent, open, whitish and translucent, with prominent veins when dry. Floating leaves and turions are absent. The inflorescences are produced quite early for a pondweed, in May‚ÄìJune, and have 15-20 inconspicuous greenish flowers and held on robust peduncles 80‚Äì200 mm long. The fruits are large for a pondweed, 4.5-5.5 x 2.5-3.6 mm. Long-stalked pondweed Potamogeton praelongus growing in deep, very clear water in a lake in North Wales. Hybrids with several other species, P. alpinus (P. √ó griffithii A. Benn.), P. crispus (P. √ó undulatus Wolgf.), P. lucens (P. √ó jutlandicus Zalewska-Ga≈Ç.), P. natans (P. √ó vepsicus A.A. Bobrov & Chemeris) and P. perfoliatus (P. √ó cognatus Asch. & Graebn.) have been described, but all are rare. Chromosome counts show that, like most other broad-leaved pondweeds, P. praelongus is tetraploid, with 2n=52 chromosomes. Long-stalked pondweed is relatively easy to identify. It could be confused with narrow-leaved forms of Potamogeton perfoliatus, but the persistent stipules, leaves only partially clasping the stem, larger fruits and (usually) zigzag pattern of the stem are distinctive. Hybrids may be more difficult to identify but usually show various features of the other parent. Taxonomy Long-stalked pondweed was first described in 1805 by the German taxonomist Franz von Wulfen. The specific epithet means 'very long'. It is not a particularly variable species and consequently there are few synonyms. Potamogeton praelongus sits within series Potamogeton, which includes other broad-leaved species such as P. alpinus and P. perfoliatus. Distribution Potamogeton praelongus has a Holarctic distribution, occurring in northern Europe (Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, France, Poland, Russia, the Baltic States), Greenland, Asia (Siberia, China, Korea, Japan), North America (northern USA, Canada). There are outlying populations in the Caucasus, Pyrenees and western USA. Ecological Requirements and ConservationEcological Requirements= P. praelongus requires clear, deep water with at least some basic influence, and rarely grows in water less than 1 m deep. In Britain is usually found in lakes with limestone, marl or basalt geology, and it is absent from acidic lakes such as are common in Wales. It also occurs in slow-flowing rivers and disused canals. Long-stalked pondweed tends to be a rather rare plant within its range; for example, in a study of more than 3,500 British lakes, it occurred in only 88, most of which had low-moderate alkalinity and were dominated by isoetids. The seeds require a cold period to encourage germination. =Conservation and threats= Long- stalked pondweed is relatively sensitive to eutrophication and declines or local extinctions of this species have been associated with increased nutrent levels. In Loch Leven (Scotland), P. praelongus was lost due to eutrophication during the mid 20th century, but has recently reappeared following improvements to water quality. Globally, P. praelongus is listed as Least Concern. However, it has undergone a marked decline in parts of its range, especially Europe. In the British Red List for Vascular Plants it is listed as Near Threatened due in particular to a marked decline in southern Britain, likely linked to eutrophication; assessments in England and Wales have recently categorised it as Endangered and Critically Endangered respectively. In Spain, Germany and the Czech Republic P. praelongus is Critically Endangered: the Czechs have an active conservation plan in place to propagate it and introduce it to new locations. It is also listed as Endangered in Switzerland, several US states and some French d√©partements, Vulnerable in the Netherlands, and Extinct in Flanders. Long-stalked pondweed is one of the so- called Magnopotamion group of pondweeds. These are a characteristic floristic component of the protected Habitats Directive habitat Type 'Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion'. However, in Britain at least, P. praelongus is now predominantly found in oligotrophic to mesotrophic waters. Cultivation P. praelongus is not in general cultivation, though it is an attractive plant. Unlike many other pondweeds it remains wintergreen. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Its preference for relatively deep water and intolerance of turbid conditions may make it unsuitable for many garden ponds. If possible it should be grown in water at least 70 cm deep on a sandy, peaty or silty substrate. Good water quality is needed to reduce the risk of turbid water or growth of blanket weed. Seed can be encouraged to germinate by immersing dried seed in water for at least a month, exposing them to a cold period, or by scarifying them.

Following his regular military service he became the second Commandant of the Observer Corps and commanded the corps through its adoption by RAF Fighter Command, the crucial operations during the Battle of Britain and the change to the Royal Observer Corps. Military careerRoyal Navy= Warrington-Morris joined the Royal Navy at the age of 15 in 1899 as a midshipman. He was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 18 December 1902 then to lieutenant in December 1904. In 1912 he was recorded as being a lieutenant commander studying at the Royal Navy Torpedo School . Following his training, Warrington-Morris was posted as Torpedo Officer to , the RN Flagship East Indies Station with the rank of acting commander. In 1916 he transferred to the Royal Naval Air Service and was promoted commander on 30 June 1917 as a Senior Wireless Officer. =Royal Flying Corps= In 1918 Warrington-Morris was posted to the Royal Flying Corps as Staff Officer i/c 1st Class Equipment ‚Äì Wireless Telegraphy and promoted to acting lieutenant colonel just before the Royal Flying Corps was amalgamated with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the new Royal Air Force (RAF) in April of that year. His commission as a lieutenant colonel was made permanent and gazetted on 22 August 1919 when he was appointed Deputy Director of Flying Instrumentation. =Royal Air Force= When RAF rank structure was reorganised in late 1919 Warrington-Morris became a wing commander and his name was removed from the Royal Navy list. He was appointed Commandant, RAF Electrical and Wireless School on 1 August 1921 and was promoted to group captain in January 1922. On 1 January 1925 Warrington- Morris was promoted to air commodore and appointed Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) at RAF HQ Iraq Command. In March 1927 he became the RAF's representative to the Ordnance Committee at Woolwich but, by September 1928, he was declared as a supernumerary air commodore at the RAF Central Depot. Between 1928 and 1934 he was Commandant RAF Signals Branch until retirement as a regular officer. Royal Observer Corps In 1934, on leaving the RAF, Warrington-Morris was employed as the Deputy Commandant of the Observer Corps under Air Commodore Edward Masterman at RAF Uxbridge. Between 1935 and 1936 he was appointed Commandant of Southern Area of the Observer Corps during the massive and crucial expansion and development of the corps during the inter war years. When Air Commodore Masterman stood down as commandant in April 1936, Warrington-Morris replaced him and took control of the Observer Corps during the important period immediately prior to the Second World War. He oversaw the move of HQ Observer Corps to RAF Bentley Priory and the corps' adoption by RAF Fighter Command. He also controlled the corps during the memorable events of the Battle of Britain and was still at the helm when the Observer Corps was granted the title 'Royal' prefix to become the Royal Observer Corps and became a uniformed branch of the RAF. He was Mentioned in Despatches in July 1940. Later appointments On leaving the Royal Observer Corps in June 1942, Warrington-Morris was recommissioned as an air commodore in Class CC and served in the Admin and Special Duties Branch of the RAF. From 26 December 1942 until 8 November 1944 he was Deputy Director of the Air Training Corps by then holding a reserve nominal rank of wing commander. Sporting achievements Warrington-Morris played international rugby union for England in 1909 at the age of 25 and later represented the RAF playing hockey in 1919. He was still playing rugby for RAF Flowerdown, of which he was at the time Station Commander, in 1922 at the age of 39. Warrington-Morris was a founder member of the RAF Rugby Union, which was formed at a meeting on 15 January 1920. He became the sole selector and Honorary Treasurer and was to hold the financial appointment, or others on the Committee, until his death 42 years later, making him the longest-serving member of the Union. Warrington- Morris was the Treasurer from the 1919‚Äì20 year until 1924‚Äì25, then again from 1933‚Äì1934 until 1956‚Äì57, and finally from 1958‚Äì1959 until 1961‚Äì62. He was also the chairman in 1923‚Äì1924 and 1924‚Äì25, then from 1927‚Äì1928 until 1932‚Äì33. During this time he rose in rank from wing commander to air commodore; \\"an extremely faithful servant of the RAFRU by anyone's standards\\". On the day of his death, against doctors' orders, Warrington-Morris went to Twickenham and watched the RAF achieve a 19‚Äì14 victory over the army in a game of rugby. He collapsed and died on the way home from the match. To mark his service, the RAFRU Committee named a new Inter-Station Shield competition trophy in his honour (The Warrington Morris Shield), and it is still played for to this day.

Together with Erwin B√ºnning and Colin Pittendrigh, he is considered to be a co-founder of the field of chronobiology. Aschoff's work in the field of chronobiology introduced the idea that shifting one's light-dark cycle can result in harmful effects, such as correlations with mental illness. Life Aschoff was born in Freiburg Im Breisgau as the fifth child of the pathologist Ludwig Aschoff (known for discovering the Aschoff-Tawara or atrioventricular node) and his wife Clara. He grew up in the liberal but morally strict world of Prussian academia. After the Abitur at a humanistic high school he ‚Äì according to his own statement \\"lacking a specific interest\\" ‚Äì studied medicine at the University of Bonn, where he joined the Burschenschaft Alemannia Bonn. Aschoff‚Äôs scientific career began in 1938, when he moved to the University of G√∂ttingen to study thermoregulation physiology with Hermann Rein. In 1944, he received the venia legendi. He then became a professor at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1949. In 1952, his mentor, Hermann Rein, was appointed director of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg. Rein brought Aschoff to the Institute as a collaborator to study circadian rhythms in humans, birds, and mice. Aschoff then moved to the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Andechs to work with Gustav Kramer, who showed time- compensated sun-compass navigation in birds, and Erich von Holst, who studied physiological oscillators. From 1967 to 1979, he was a director at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology and an extraordinary professor in Munich. Aschoff was a scientific member and a member of the Kollegiums of the Max Planck Institute for Behavior Physiology, as well as senator of the Max Planck Society from 1972 to 1976. Aschoff was known as an excellent lecturer with a booming voice, and he took a special interest in creating a scientific community and encouraging young scientists. After his retirement in 1983 and return to Freiburg, Aschoff continued his scientific work in the form of further publications. Only the death of his wife Hilde broke his unusual vitality. J√ºrgen Aschoff died 10 months after his wife in 1998, after a short illness at the age of 85 years. Work Aschoff provided a strong foundation for the field of chronobiology through his research on circadian rhythms and entrainment in many different organisms such as rats, mice, birds, macaques, monkeys, and humans. His early research focused on understanding the properties of circadian rhythms and how these rhythms can change in response to stimuli. His later work was more applicable to pathologies, such as psychiatric disorders and dangers of shift work schedules, which can result from manipulating specific Zeitgebers. Aschoff's work in the field of chronobiology introduced the idea that shifting one's light-dark cycle can result in harmful effects, such as correlations with mental illness. =Early work= Aschoff began his research on the physiology of thermoregulation by self-experimentation. He discovered that there was a 24-hour rhythm of variation in body temperature. After these experiments, he began investigating the basic mechanisms of circadian rhythm. In the 1950s, he met and began to collaborate with Erwin B√ºnning and Colin Pittendrigh. Aschoff began further experimentation studying the circadian rhythms of birds and mice under constant conditions. His results led to the conclusion that circadian oscillations of biological processes were innate and did not require prior exposure to a 24-hour day to be expressed. Aschoff also applied these methods to experiments with human circadian rhythms by building an underground \\"bunker\\" to isolate human subjects from any external environmental cues. Subjects placed in this bunker were allowed to turn lights on or off according to their own internal rhythms. After over twenty years of tracking sleep-wake cycles, body temperature, urine output, and other physiological and behavioral outputs, Aschoff and his collaborator R√ºtger Wever concluded that humans have endogenous circadian oscillators. This discovery has become the foundation for our understanding of many medical problems such as aging, sleep disorders, and jet lag. In 1960, Aschoff coined the term Zeitgeber (from German for \\"time giver\\" or \\"synchronizer\\") to refer to external, environmental cues that synchronize an endogenous oscillator to the environmental cycle. To investigate the properties of natural endogenous oscillators, Aschoff exposed organisms to constant conditions without Zeitgeber cues (either constant light or constant darkness). The observations from this paper were formulated into the fundamental rules of biological clocks. =Aschoff's Rule= From the experiments communicated in 1960, Aschoff noted that under constant light conditions, the activity phase shortens in nocturnal organisms and lengthens in diurnal organisms. These trends were termed alpha compression and alpha expansion, respectively. In tribute to his mentor, Pittendrigh called this observation \\"Aschoff's Rule\\" in a 1960 publication, and the designation remains today. Aschoff's rule is related to the model of parametric entrainment, which assumes continuous phase changes. Aschoff and Pittendrigh approached the field with different models of how oscillators entrain, which resulted in different predictive models.Daan, Serge. \\"Colin Pittendrigh, J√ºrgen Aschoff, and the Natural Entrainment of Circadian Systems.\\" The Colin S. Pittendrigh Lecture, May 9, 1998, accessed April 20, 2011. Aschoff's parametric model states that entrainment occurs through gradual changes in the clock that adapt to a new light-dark cycle. Although this is no longer recognized as the correct model in the field, Serge Daan suggested in 1998 that Aschoff made qualitative contributions that provide valuable alternatives to inconsistencies in the current field. =Later work= Much of Aschoff's later work involved tests on human subjects. He found that the absence of a light-dark cycle does not prevent humans from entrainment. Rather, knowing the time of day from social cues, such as regular meal times, is sufficient for entrainment. Aschoff also found that different circadian outputs such as body temperature and locomotor activity can be either internally synchronized or desynchronized depending on the strength of the Zeitgeber. In constant darkness, rectal temperature and sleep onset and duration became desynchronized in some subjects, and the rectal temperature at the time of sleep onset was correlated to the duration of the bout of sleep. He hypothesized that internal desynchronization, the phase differences resulting from period differences between two circadian output processes, could be related to many psychiatric disorders. Some of Aschoff's later work also integrated his initial interest in thermoregulation with his work on circadian rhythm. He found a circadian rhythm in thermal conductance, a measurement of heat transfer from the body. Minimal conductance in mammals and birds oscillates with circadian phase, with a wide range of conductance values. This allows animals to release heat during their activity period, when they have higher basal metabolism, as well as conserve heat during their rest period, when they have lower basal metabolism. In birds, the circadian rhythm in conductance results mostly from circadian rates of evaporative heat loss. In mammals, the conductance oscillates with circadian rhythms in the body's heat resistance and blood flow rate. Following up on his temperature studies, he found that a mammalian species can entrain to a temperature cycle, but that temperature is a weak Zeitgeber compared to a light-dark cycle. Aschoff described masking signals as inputs that circumvent the pacemaker but nevertheless lead to modulation of a circadian behavior that is also controlled by the pacemaker.Aschoff J: Masking of circadian rhythms by zeitgebers as opposed to entrainment. In: Trends in Chronobiology, ed. Hekkens W, Th JM, Jerkhof GA and Rhietveld WJ, Pergamon Press, Oxford and New York, pp. 149‚Äì161, 1988 Parametric entrainment is entrainment that does not result from an instant change in phase, as governed by a Phase Response Curve, as in the case of masking signals. The term Aschoff used for this phenomenon is ‚Äúarousal‚Äù due to non-photic zeitgebers. Data from experimental assays show a relationship between masking effects and phase, leading to a ‚Äúdemasking‚Äù effect whereby animals arrhythmic in constant conditions have free-running periods in high frequency light-dark cycles. Aschoff concluded that the oscillator or circadian clock ‚Äúintegrates‚Äù over the intensity of light to which it has been exposed, and then responds with a change in the period of activity, as seen in greenfinches, chaffinches, hamsters, and siskins. Aschoff concluded, however, that non-parametric effects, as opposed to parametric effects, are the principal source of entrainment. =Aschoff‚ÄìWever Model= 1) An increase in the duration of sunset advances the phase of an organism for nocturnal and diurnal animals. 2) An increase in strength of the zeitgeber should increase as sunset duration increases. =Influence on other researchers= Aschoff has published articles with both Pittendrigh and Serge Daan, the latter also a pivotal researcher in chronobiology. In his recent work, Daan has attempted to reconcile the idea of parametric entrainment to light proposed by Aschoff with the non-parametric model of entrainment proposed by Pittendrigh, and results from a 2008 paper from Daan's lab lend further evidence to Aschoff's model of parametric entrainment. Although Aschoff‚Äôs collaboration with Gustav Kramer was never fully realized due to the latter‚Äôs sudden death, Aschoff continued to use birds as model organisms and work with ornithologists. Aschoff's Rule (prize) At a dinner held in Aschoff's honor at the 1991 Gordon Conference on Chronobiology, Professor Till Roenneberg initiated the annual giving of the Aschoff's Rule prize to scientists who have advanced the field of chronobiology by presenting a plaque with a ruler on it to Professor Maroli K.

The project also includes a domestic gas component. Construction was completed in 2017. Location 'Greater Gorgon' refers to a grouping of several gas fields, including Gorgon, Chandon, Geryon, Orthrus, Maenad, Eurytion, Urania, Chrysaor, Dionysus, Jansz/Io, and West Tryal Rocks, situated in the Barrow sub-basin of the Carnarvon Basin. The Gorgon field is centered about off the north-west coast of Western Australia, where the water depth is approximately . Other fields in the group lie to the north, such as Jansz-Io, which covers an area of , in a water depth of . Barrow Island lies off the Pilbara coast, north-north-east of Onslow and west of Karratha. The largest of a group of islands which include the Montebello and Lowendal Islands, it is long and wide, covering . History More than 200 exploration wells had been drilled in the Barrow sub-basin by the end of 2001, including West Tryal Rocks in 1972, and Spar in 1976 - both discovered by West Australian Petroleum (WAPET) which had been a pioneering company in the development of the Western Australian petroleum industry. WAPET was the operator on behalf of various joint ventures comprising Chevron, Texaco, Shell and Ampolex (the exploration division of Ampol). Chevron and Texaco merged in 2001, Mobil took over Ampolex, and later merged with Exxon to form ExxonMobil. In 2000, Chevron became the operator of all WAPET's petroleum assets. WAPET discovered Gorgon in 1981 with the drilling of the Gorgon 1 well. Later discoveries included Chrysaor (1994) and Dionysus (1996). The Jansz-Io gas accumulation, discovered in January 2000, contains an estimated 566 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves. The project received preliminary environmental approvals from the West Australian government in September 2007 and from the Federal Minister for the Environment in the following month after receiving approval in principle from the Western Australian Government to make restricted use of Barrow Island in September 2003 . The project developers then submitted revised plans to cover an expansion in the size of the project. Final environmental approval was received from the state government on 11 August 2009. On 26 August 2009, the Federal Environment Minister announced that the expanded project on Barrow Island had been given conditional environmental approval. During the 2007 Australian federal election campaign, the Australian Labor Party announced that a future Labor government would set aside 25% of future Petroleum Resource Rent Tax from the Gorgon project to establish a Western Australian Infrastructure Fund. Although no timescale was officially given, two election cycles later in 2013 the promise had yet to be honoured. PPRT contributions are often delayed depending on tax deductions that companies are eligible for, and the then-labour Julie Gillard government proposed that it would be revisited once revenue began flowing from the project. However, senior lecturer of Monash University and expert on taxation law and natural resource policy Diane Kraal estimated in 2017 that under the current fiscal system, the Gorgon Gas project had yet to contribute to the PPRT system, and would not until around 2030 .  Gas fields  The Gorgon and Jansz-Io gas fields are from the coast of mainland Australia. In 2006 Chevron, the project leads, were working with an estimated resource base of 40 trillion cubic feet. Later estimates from have placed the volume of natural gas at , that may have a lifespan of 60 years . According the Chevron, the Janz-Lo field is 9,100 - 10,350 ft beneath the seabed, while the Gorgon gas field is 11,350 - 13,600 ft beneath the seabed. Though this is due to the Gorgon gas field being closer to land than the Janz-Lo field were the land curves upwards to form Barrow Island, both fields are approximately 14,615 ft beneath sea level . Developers The project was developed by the Gorgon Joint Venture, which , consisted of Australian subsidiaries of three global energy companies: *Chevron Australia & Texaco Australia (both subsidiaries of Chevron) (47.3% share and project operator) *Shell Development Australia (a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell) (25%) *Mobil Australia Resources (a subsidiary of ExxonMobil) (25%) *Osaka Gas (1.25%) *Tokyo Gas (1%) *Chubu Electric Power, now JERA (0.417%)  Scope  The scope of the project includes: * 300 ha of land has been acquired on Barrow Island * 3x5.2 MTPA LNG Trains * 15.6 million metric tonnes of LNG per year * 300 terajoules per day domestic gas plant * Ground breaking occurred on 1 December 2009 * LNG for commercial use first left Barrow Island in 2016.

'' * , production was slated to end between 2054‚Äì2074 Using initially 18 wells, according to the Environment Impact Statement of 2009, gas was to be delivered via subsea gathering systems and pipelines to the north-west coast of Barrow Island, then via an underground pipeline system to gas treatment and liquefaction facilities on the island's south-east coast. The plant was intended to consist of 3 liquefied natural gas (LNG) trains, each capable of producing a nominal capacity of 5.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). Carbon dioxide (CO2), which comprises around 15% of the raw gas stream from the Gorgon field, will be stripped out then injected into formations 2 kilometers below the island, with 3.4 to 4 million tonnes of planned to be stored each year.Projects: Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project , Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. Further details: Case study - Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project , The Global Status of CCS: 2011, Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. Inclusion of the carbon capture project was required by Australian environmental regulators. However, in December 2017 it was announced that technical problems mean that will not be stored until late 2018 or early 2019, two years after the plant began operation. This will result in 5.5-7.8 million tonnes of being released. Carbon dioxide injection started in August 2019, with full injection rates anticipated by first quarter 2020 (This has not been independently verified as of September 2020). https://australia.chevron.com/our-businesses/gorgon-project According to the 2009 Environment Impact Statement, LNG and condensate, initially stored in onshore tanks, was to be offloaded from a jetty onto LNG carriers and oil tankers, for delivery to overseas customers. Natural gas for domestic use will be transported by a 70 km subsea pipeline to the mainland, for transmission to local customers. On the total investment of the Gorgon LNG project, media articles have reported analyst forecasts of estimated costs ranging from A$11 billion (in 2003), A$16 billion (2007), and A$50bn in March 2009 to A$43bn in Sept 2009 and A$53 in 2015.  Economic Benefits  Economic modelling carried out in 2008 as part of the environmental impact assessment process, forecast the following macroeconomic impacts (based on a 30-year period): *6000 jobs in Western Australia at the peak of the construction phase *more than 350 direct and indirect jobs sustaining throughout the life of the project *an increase in national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of A$64.3 billion (in net present value terms) *A$33 billion of expenditure on locally purchased goods and services *additional government revenue of about A$40 billion (in 2009 dollars) Gas salesLNG export agreements= LNG sales agreements were reached between the joint venturers and customers in China, India, Japan and South Korea. Chevron Australia has executed Sale and Purchase Agreements (SPAs) with Osaka Gas (1.375Mtpa for 25 years and 1.25 percent equity in the Gorgon Project), Tokyo Gas (1.1Mtpa for 25 years and 1 percent equity), Chubu Electric Power, now JERA (1.44Mtpa for 25 years and 0.417 percent equity in the Gorgon Project), GS Caltex of South Korea (0.25 Mtpa for 20 years from Gorgon), Nippon Oil Corporation, now JXTG (0.3 Mtpa for 15 years) and Kyushu Electric (0.3 Mtpa for 15 years). Chevron Australia also had a Heads of Agreement with Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) (1.5Mtpa for 15 years), however it is reported that this was not completed; Shell has entered into long-term LNG sale and purchase agreements with PetroChina International Company Limited and BP Singapore Pte. Limited and also has secured capacity at LNG receiving terminals including the terminals at Energia Costa Azul LNG in Baja California, Mexico and Hazira in Gujarat, India. An Australian subsidiary of ExxonMobil has signed long-term sales and purchase agreements with Petronet LNG Limited of India and PetroChina International Company Limited for the supply of LNG from the Gorgon Project. The agreement with Petronet LNG is for the supply of approximately 1.5 Mtpa of LNG over a 20-year term while the agreement with PetroChina is for the supply of approximately 2.25 Mtpa over a 20-year term. Together, these two sales and purchase agreements commit the ExxonMobil subsidiary's share of LNG from the 15 Mtpa Gorgon LNG Project. =Domestic gas= Under the provisions of the Barrow Island Act (2003), the joint venturers are required to reserve 2000 petajoules of gas for delivery into the domestic market. The Gorgon Joint Venture announced plans to establish a domestic gas project, including plans for progressive expansion to enable delivery of 300 terajoules of gas per day into the domestic transmission system. Chevron have indicated that deliveries of Gorgon domestic gas will commence around the time of start-up of the third LNG train. Criticisms The proposed project attracted criticism from conservation groups in relation to the potential impact upon Barrow Island's ecology. The island is a Class A nature reserve, and home to the flatback turtle (classified as a vulnerable species) and numerous other animals not found on the Australian mainland. Other concerns are related to the adequacy of quarantine procedures on Barrow Island to protect against introduced species, and risks associated with geological sequestration of CO2.

This being has been created by purposive human action but exists by processes of growth. There are sources who cite some creations of genetic engineering as examples of biofacts.  History of the Concept  Biofact was introduced as early as 2001 by the German philosopher Nicole C. KarafyllisNicole C. Karafyllis: Biologisch, nat√ºrlich, nachhaltig. Philosophische Aspekte des Naturzugangs im 21. Jahrhundert. Tuebingen: A. Francke Publisher; chap. 6 although her book Biofakte published in 2003 is commonly used as reference for the introduction of the term.Nicole C. Karafyllis (Hg.), Biofakte. Versuch √ºber den Menschen zwischen Artefakt und Lebewesen, Mentis: Paderborn 2003. According to Karafyllis, the word biofact first appeared in a German article (entitled 'Biofakt und Artefakt') in 1943, written by the Austrian protozoologist Bruno M. Klein.Bruno Maria Klein: Artefakt und Biofakt, in: Mikrokosmos 1943/44 Addressing both microscopy and philosophy, Klein named a biofact something that is a visible dead product emerging from a living being while this being is still alive (e.g. a shell). However, Klein's distinction operated with the difference biotic/abiotic and dead/alive, not with nature/technology and growth/man-made. For her part, Karafyllis described biofact as a hermeneutic concept that allows the comparison between nature and technology in the domain of the living. Particularly  Philosophy of the Concept  With the term biofact, Karafyllis wants to emphasize that living entities can be highly artificial due to methods deriving from agriculture, gardening (e.g. breeding) or biotechnology (e.g. genetic engineering, cloning). Biofacts show signatures of culture and technique. Primarily, the concept aims to argue against the common philosophical tradition to summarize all kinds of living beings under the category nature. The concept biofact questions if the phenomenon of growth is and was a secure candidate for differentiating between nature and technology. For the philosophy of technology the questions arise if a) biotechnology and agriculture should not be an integral part of reflexion, thereby adding new insights to the common focus on the machine and the artifact, and if b) established concepts of technique and technology which stress artificiality should not be modified. Karafyllis regards the inclusion of biofacts into a theory of techniques as a chance, to reformulate classic concepts of design and construction for defining the making of artifacts. In her view, biofacts depend on the method of provocation.Karafyllis, N. C.: Provokation als Methode der biotechnischen Evolution, in: Volker Gerhardt, Klaus Lucas and G√ºnter Stock (Eds.): Evolution. Theorie, Formen und Konsequenzen eines Paradigmas in Natur, Technik und Kultur. Berlin: Akademie Verlag 2011 For the philosophy of nature, biofacts highlight a need to clarify if nature is self-explanatory in every case. Biophilosophy is challenged to newly reflect upon the categories organism and living being.Marianne Schark: Lebewesen versus Dinge, De Gruyter 2005. In the philosophy of science, approaches are challenged which only focus on the category thing (or epistemic thing) without historizing the technicality, mediality and materiality of its emerging as a living object. For the sociology of science the biofact concept is fruitful to discuss the exclusiveness of scientific knowledge (the role of the expert) while making scientific objects which are released into the lifeworld or public sphere. Particularly because the biofact concept deals with the phenomenon of growth and the establishing of a self, it is also influential in the philosophical disciplines phenomenology, anthropology and ontology. It was J√ºrgen Habermas who recently stressed the anthropological consequences if mankind gives up the differentiation of \\"coming into being\\" and \\"making\\".J√ºrgen Habermas: Die Zukunft der menschlichen Natur, Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 2001. Artifacts are artificial, i.e. man-made objects. Contrary to biofacts, they cannot be found in nature. Therefore, biofacts demarcate an ontological intersection. They are partially man-made, but growing. Like artifacts, they have been made for a certain utility. Biofacts can be seen as biotic artifacts which show their character as hybrids in multifold perspectives. The term is also enabling philosophers to criticize some concepts in technoscience, where the union of scientific knowledge about nature and the technical creation of technonature is seen as progress in the political sense.Cf. Bruno Latour: Politics of Natur. How to bring the Sciences into Democracy, Harvard University Press 2004. The term has also been adopted in the new BioArt, not rarely without using its critical impacts. As Karafyllis complemented the growth and reproduction of organisms with technical entities, she established a typology of different kinds of organisms according to their uses and these are: * Natural life form * Unaltered biofacts * Reshaped biofacts * Genetically reproduced biofacts * Genetically modified biofacts.

It has hosted weekly track leagues throughout the summer and many national events and championships such as the British National Derny Championships. 459 metres in length, it has been described as one of the country's best asphalt track surfaces, although until 1955 when it was resurfaced, it was a loose red shale which meant riders often slid sideways in the bankings. The velodrome was closed in 2002 due to subsidence, as the track was built on the location of some old chalk pits. Reading Borough Council had the dips filled and the track surface refurbished for the start of the 2003 season.

In March 2015 British Cycling issued a statement indicating that they had assessed the track as being unfit for racing, and that they would not sanction competition at the velodrome for the foreseeable future, although it could still be used for training purposes. However the track was approved for racing one month later after repairs and other changes to fencing were made.

Archaeology: down to earth (4th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. Biofacts are passively consumed or handled by humans; as opposed to artifacts, which are purposefully manipulated. Biofacts reveal how people respond to their surroundings. A common type of biofact is a plant seed. Plant remains, often referred to as macrobotanicals, provide a variety of information ranging from diet to medicine to textile production.Artifacts&Features; . (n.d.). Learning Center of the American Southwest. Pollen preserved on archaeological sites informs researchers about the ancient environment, and the foods processed and/or grown by prehistoric people. Pollen, when examined over time, also informs on environmental and dietary changes. A seed can be linked to the species of plant that produced it; if massive numbers of seeds of a cultivated species are found at a site, it may be inferred that the species may have been grown for food or other products that are useful to humans, such as clothing, bedding or building materials. Another type of biofact is wood. Wood is made up cellulose, carbohydrates, and lignin.Wagner, G. A. (1998).

It can be dated using carbon-14, and through other methods, information such as local environment and human adaptation can be revealed from the charcoal. To help determine the date during which a site was occupied, dendrochronological analysis can be used on wood samples. Wood that has been altered by humans is properly an artifact, not a biofact.

His work focuses on the concept of the garden as a symbol of utopia and the relationship between man and nature. Drawing upon an extensive knowledge of plants both Eastern and Western, real and mythical, Fay creates his own calligraphic floating forest of reeds, branches and surreal species. He is most well known for his sculpture and large scale installations and he currently teaches sculpture at William Paterson University in Wayne, New Jersey. Early life and education Ming Fay was born in Shanghai in 1943 and late moved to Hong Kong in 1952, soon after the rise of communism in mainland China. His mother was an artist, and his father worked in the then-burgeoning Hong Kong movie industry as an art director. Both were students of Shanghai- based sculptor Zhang Chongren, who had studied Western sculpture in Europe. Ming came to the United States in 1961 to study at the Columbus College of Art and Design and later at the Kansas City Institute of Art. Subsequently, Fay earned a graduate degree in sculpture at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1975. Artistic career Ming Fay has exhibited internationally in numerous solo exhibitions, and his work has frequented important group shows throughout the world. He was also a founding member of an art collective called, Epoxy Art Group in the 1980s, which included other Chinese American artists.

Just three days after the strike, lawmakers voted against the new law. Poland is one of the few countries in the world to outlaw abortion after decades of liberal legislation (during Communist rule). Polish women often seek abortion in neighboring countries due to the strict restraints in their own country. Poland has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, along with a group of other traditionally Catholic countries of the region (Malta, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Vatican, Monaco and Andorra).https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2018-05-24/these- countries-in-europe-have-the-strictest-abortion-lawsNote: Abortion in Ireland was legalized in 2018 through the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  Legal status  In Poland, abortion is banned except in the following three circumstances. # When the woman's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy, # When the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act, or # When there is a high probability of a severe and irreversible fetal impairment Unlike in other countries where abortion is banned, women in Poland are not subject to a penalty for illegal termination of pregnancy. Consent of a physician is required for circumstances (1) and (3) above, while abortions in view of circumstance (2) above must be certified by prosecutor. Parental consent is always required if the woman seeking abortion is a minor. In addition, persuading a woman to carry out illegal termination of her pregnancy is a criminal act. History Until 1932, abortion was banned in Poland without exceptions. In that year, the new Penal Code legalised abortion only when there were medical reasons and, for the first time in Europe, when the pregnancy resulted from a criminal act. Except during the German occupation during the Second World War, this law was in effect from 1932 to 1956. In Nazi Germany, which included territories of Poland 1939-1945, the penalties for abortion were increased, especially for providing an abortion to an \\"Aryan\\" woman. Abortion was permitted if the fetus was deformed or disabled. In 1956 the Sejm legalised abortion in cases where the woman was experiencing \\"difficult living conditions\\". The interpretation of the change in the law varied from a restrictive interpretation, in the late 1950s, to one in where abortion was allowed on request, in the 1960s and 1970s. It was not uncommon that women from countries where abortions were restricted, such as Sweden, travelled to Poland to carry out abortions which were accessible and affordable there. The procedural requirements needed for obtaining a legal abortion were changed several times over the years, in 1956, 1959, 1969, 1981 and 1990. The most important change was that of 1990, after the end of Communist rule, when Ordinance of 30 April 1990 made access to abortion more difficult. A major change came in 1993, when the law was further tightened, removing entirely the \\"difficult living conditions\\" as a ground for abortions. As such, abortions could be legally obtained only in cases of serious threat to the life or health of the pregnant woman, as attested by two physicians, cases of rape or incest confirmed by a prosecutor, and cases in which prenatal tests, confirmed by two physicians, demonstrated that the foetus was seriously and irreversibly damaged. This law remains in place today.https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/poland.doc. =Modern debate= Poland is a country strongly influenced by Roman Catholicism, and religion often influences politics and social views. Abortion is a controversial topic in Polish politics. The question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment was one of the reasons for the split in the Law and Justice (PiS) party and the creation of Prawica Rzeczypospolitej, led by Marek Jurek. Law and Justice, abbreviated to PiS, is a national-conservative, and Christian democratic political party in Poland. With 235 seats in the Sejm and 48 in the Senate, it is currently the largest party in the Polish parliament. In June 2011, Polish pro-life NGOs collected over 500,000 signatures for a proposed bill to ban abortion in Poland altogether. The bill, while rejected by a majority of the MPs, got enough support to be sent to a Sejm committee in order to be subject to further amendments. The move was criticised by two right-wing opposition parties, Law and Justice and Poland Comes First, which expressed their support for the bill. The left-wing Democratic Left Alliance pursues a pro-choice policy and was against the bill. The ruling Civic Platform, while considering itself in favour of the current legislation on abortion in Poland, was divided on the matter; more than 60 of the party's MPs voted in favour of the bill.  Proposed abortion ban  In September 2015, a civil initiative to introduce a complete ban on abortion was rejected in the Sejm. 178 of MPs backed the measure, while 206 voted against. In April 2016, Polish organizations proposed amended legislation to ban abortion in all cases except to save the woman's life. The bill included penalties to abortion providers with up to five years of imprisonment. The bill passed and was debated in Sejm, beginning 22 September 2016. The Sejm voted with majority in favour of continuing work on the bill. A competing bill, proposing liberalisation of abortion laws and also supported by a civil initiative that succeeded in gathering the required number of signatures, was rejected outright in the same session of Sejm. If the law had passed, Poland's abortion restrictions would have mirrored those of Malta and the Vatican, the two countries in Europe with the strongest restrictions on abortion. = Black Protest = thumb On 22 September 2016, on the day when the bill to ban abortion was debated in Sejm, the Razem party organized a demonstration called \\"Czarny Protest\\" (\\"Black Protest\\"), initiated by party member Ma≈Çgorzata Adamczyk. This was part of a larger campaign, in which people published selfies in black clothing in social media, tagged #czarnyprotest (#blackprotest). In the subsequent days, similar protests were being organized in other Polish cities, such as Wroc≈Çaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Krak√≥w. Thousands of people took part in the protests in various parts of Poland. On 1 October 2016, a large protest also took place near the Sejm building, organized by Barbara Nowacka of Inicjatywa Polska, who had collected signatures under a citizens' bill to liberalize the Polish abortion law. On 3 October 2016, thousands of Polish women went on strike to oppose the proposed legislation for a total ban on abortion, called \\"Czarny Poniedzia≈Çek\\" (\\"Black Monday\\"), originally proposed in a Facebook post by Polish actress Krystyna Janda. The women modeled their strike on the successful strike for women's rights in Iceland in 1975, refusing to attend school, work, or participate in domestic chores. The pro abortion protesters marched in Warsaw, Gda≈Ñsk, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Wroc≈Çaw, and Krak√≥w, and demonstrators across Europe marched in solidarity. Approximately 98,000 protestors showed up to decry the new bill. Supporters of the new legislation held counterprotests and Catholic Masses to express alignment with the abortion ban. By 5 October 2016, politicians were distancing themselves from the proposed legislation. On 6 October, lawmakers voted the bill down with plans to present a counterproposal from the government. In 2016, Foreign Policy magazine included Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-BƒÖk of the Razem party and Barbara Nowacka of Inicjatywa Polska, on its annual list of the 100 most influential global thinkers for their role in organizing protests against a total ban on abortion in Poland. In 2018, Forbes magazine included Marcelina Zawisza on its annual European Forbes 30 Under 30 list in the \\"Law & Policy\\" category for her role as a co-founder of Razem and one of the organizers of \\"black protest\\". This protest inspired a similar event in Ireland, Strike 4 Repeal, to repeal the Ireland's Eight Amendment which bans abortion in nearly all cases. What was especially powerful about the Black Protest was the fact that there were events organized in smaller locations, too. The protests took place in the following Polish cities: Be≈Çchat√≥w, Bƒôdzin, Bia≈Ça Podlaska, Bia≈Çystok, Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, Bi≈Çgoraj, Bydgoszcz, Bytom, Che≈Çm, Chojnice, Chrzan√≥w, Ciechan√≥w, Cieszyn, Czƒôstochowa, Dzier≈ºoni√≥w, Dzierzgo≈Ñ, ElblƒÖg, E≈Çk, Gda≈Ñsk, Gdynia, Gliwice, G≈Çog√≥w, Gniezno, Goleni√≥w, Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski, GrudziƒÖdz, Gryfice, Inowroc≈Çaw, Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j, Jawor, Jelenia G√≥ra, Kalisz, Katowice, Kƒôdzierzyn-Ko≈∫le, Kielce, Kluczbork, K≈Çodzko, Konin, Ko≈Çobrzeg, Kostrzyn nad OdrƒÖ, Koszalin, Krak√≥w, Krosno, Kwidzyn, Legionowo, Legnica, Lƒôbork, Leszno, Lidzbark Welski, Lubin, Lublin, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Malbork, Mielec, Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki Mogilno, MrƒÖgowo, Namys≈Ç√≥w, Nowy SƒÖcz, Oborniki ≈ölƒÖskie, Olecko, Olsztyn, Opole, Ostro≈Çƒôka, Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski, Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski, Ostrzesz√≥w, O≈õwiƒôcim, Ozork√≥w, Pabianice, Piaseczno, Pi≈Ça, Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski, P≈Çock, Pozna≈Ñ, Przemy≈õl, Radom, Radomsko, Rybnik, Rzesz√≥w, Sanok, Siedlce, Siemiatycze, Sieradz, Skierniewice, S≈Çubice, S≈Çupsk, Sochaczew, Sokolniki, Sosnowiec, Starachowice, Starogard Gda≈Ñsk, Stargard Szczeci≈Ñski, Strzelce Kraje≈Ñskie, Suwa≈Çki, Szczecin, ≈öroda Wielkopolska, ≈öwidnica, ≈öwinouj≈õcie, Tarn√≥w, Tomasz√≥w, Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki, Toru≈Ñ, Wadowice, Wa≈Çbrzych, Warszawa, Wejherowo, Wƒôgr√≥w, W≈Çoc≈Çawek, Wroc≈Çaw, Wrze≈õnia, Zakopane, Zag≈Çƒôbie, Zawiercie, Zgorzelec, Zielona G√≥ra, ≈ªyrard√≥w, Additionally, the Polish Black Protests sparked protests in the following cities internationally: Australia (Canberra), Austria (Vienna), Belgium (Brussels), Bosna and Herzegovina (Sarajevo), China (Shanghai), Croatia (Zagreb), Czechia (Prague), Denmark (Copenhagen), Finland (Helsinki, Turku), France (Lyon, Paris, Strasbourg), Greece, Spain (Barcelona, Madrid, Tarifa), the Netherlands, Ireland (Dublin, Limerick), Iceland, Canada (Toronto, Ontario, Vancouver, BC ), Lithuania (Vilnius), Luxembourg, Malta (Valletta), Germany (Berlin, D√ºsseldorf), Norway (Bergen, Oslo, Stavanger), Portugal (Porto), Romania (Bucharest), Slovakia (Bratislava), Slovenia, Switzerland (Zurich), Sweden (Malm√∂, Stockholm), USA (New York, Washington, DC), Hungary (Budapest), Great Britain (Bristol, Edinburgh, London, Newcastle, University of Sheffield), Italy (Bologne) The protest activities included not only demonstrating in the streets but also (depending on the location) high school students strikes, men's support events, queer community solidarity events, sending letters, changing profile pictures in the social media, fundraising events, entrepreneurs support, doctoral students‚Äô strike, prenatal testing, collective meditation, a running race, etc. Symbols of the protest included umbrellas and coat hangers. Specific weather conditions on 3 October 2016 contributed to establishing a symbol of the latest women's protests in Poland. It was raining during that day but still, thousands of people attended events, bringing their umbrellas to demonstrations to protect themselves from the rain. It also had its symbolic dimension - crowds visually changed into a sea of umbrellas which embodied the purpose of the Black Protest - protecting women from proposed legislation that would restrict their reproductive rights. Coat hangers were brought to the demonstrations as a symbol of the simplest and most primitive ‚Äúinstrument‚Äù that could be used for conducting abortion. Earlier in 2016 (in April), coat hangers were also sent by citizens to the contemporary Prime MInister of Poland, Beata Szyd≈Ço, as a protest against her support for the abortion ban. However, though social media has empowered Polish women, for some it has led to being ostracized by family members or colleagues, and has even cost them their careers. Among the most mediatized instances was that of Ewa Wnorowska's, an educator in Zabrze who has dedicated her life to helping students at a school for children with disabilities. On the day of the first Black Protest, as the movement in support of women's rights in Poland became known, she took a photograph with eleven other colleagues, all wearing black, to show solidarity with the cause. Unbeknownst to her at the time of posting, the photograph gained national traction; it was being splashed over Polish newspapers, social media, and debated far and wide. One of her male colleagues reposted the image with inflammatory comments, and lodged a formal complaint in front of the Disciplinary Board of Education against her. Since then, Human Rights Watch published a 75-page report in February 2019 titled ‚Äú‚ÄòThe Breath of the Government on My Back‚Äô: Attacks on Women's Rights in Poland,‚Äù which has found that government agencies have dragged employees who support women's rights protests or collaborate with women's rights groups before disciplinary hearings and threatened their jobs. As the report demonstrates, these are not singular cases. A climate of fear is on the rise in Poland, where cases like Wnorowska's are being used to show ordinary people that speaking out against the government has consequences. Although the strikes did not result in a complete reversal of anti-abortion laws in Poland, it brought the conversation of women's reproductive rights to national attention. Thousands of women wore black in solidarity with the cause. Moreover, the protest succeeded in deterring the government from passing a proposed law that would restrict all abortions. Public opinion In the latest poll on abortion by the CBOS Public Opinion Research Center, 65% of Poles viewed abortion as immoral and unacceptable and only 27% viewed it as acceptable, a drop of 4% compared to an older poll from 2009. In a CBOS poll from February 2014, more than half of the participants (55%) opposed the right to abortion on request. Furthermore, 71% of the participants believed abortion on request was inappropriate. At the same time, over one-third (37%) thought that abortion should be permitted. Surveys indicate a conservative turn in the 1990s. Although the supporters of legal abortion prevailed, the difference continuously narrowed. In 2006, when the discussion about introducing a constitutional ban on abortion was publicly conducted, the opponents of legal abortion were for the first time more numerous than supporters of abortion rights. At present the proportions have returned to 2007 levels, when both groups were about equal in size. Most Poles accept abortion in cases when it is legal under current law. The support for abortion rights when mother's life is in danger is almost universal (87%). Over three-quarters of respondents think that it should be available for women whose pregnancy threatens their health (78%), or was caused by rape or incest (78%). Three-fifths (60%) support the right to abortion if it is known that the child would be handicapped. The support for legal abortion in cases when it is currently banned is much lower. About a quarter think that it should be legal if the woman is in a difficult material (26%) or personal (23%) situation. Almost one in five respondents (18%) think abortion should be legal if a woman does not want to have a child.http://www.cbos.pl/PL/publikacje/public_opinion/2010/07_2010.pdf A poll from 2013 showed that 49% of Poles support current legislation on abortion, 34% think it should be liberalised and 9% think it should be more restrictive. A CBOS poll from 2013 found that 75% of Poles think abortion is \\"always wrong and can never be justified\\". Only 7% thought there was \\"nothing wrong with it and could always be justified\\". In a Pew Research poll from 2017, 8% of Polish respondents believed abortion should be legal in all cases and 33% that it should be legal in most cases. On the other hand, 38% believed that it should be illegal in most cases and 13% that it should be illegal in all cases.http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/09154356/Central-and-Eastern-Europe- Topline_FINAL-FOR-PUBLICATION.pdf Statistics In Poland, the vast majority of abortions takes place illegally, as obtaining a legal abortion is very difficult, both due to the restrictive legal grounds and because of many doctors refusing to perform lawful abortions due to being conscientious objectors.https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/10/06/world/europe/ap-eu- poland-abortion.html?_r=0 Estimates of illegal abortions per year put the numbers between 10,000 and 150,000, compared to only 1,000‚Äì2,000 legal abortions. A more recent study even estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Polish women terminate their pregnancies each year, with 10 to 15% of them estimated to seek their abortion abroad. For those women going abroad, Germany, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic are among the more popular destinations for abortions, with the UK, Austria, and Ukraine other countries women travel to for abortions.

The Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League (known as Castle Lager Premier Soccer League) is the top professional division in Zimbabwe. There are 16 teams in the division with FC Platinum from Zvishavane being the defending champions (2018 season). Dynamos F.C has the most league wins followed by their arch rivals Highlanders FC whom they play against in the Zimbabwe Derby. There are two main cup competitions played in Zimbabwe, both are knockout tournaments, the first is the Mbada Diamonds Cup with Highlanders FC being crowned champions of the 2013 edition and the Banc ABC Super 8 which was won by Shabanie Mine in 2013 as well. Of late the Football administrators have partnered with a local company to launch another cup game - Chibuku Super Cup. The CBZ FA Cup was first created as the Southern Rhodesia Castle Cup in 1962. The other major cup is the Zimbabwean Independence Trophy created as a clubs competition in 1983. Zimbabwe has eight main stadiums where football is played, the largest being the multi-use National Sports Stadium. Notable Zimbabwean footballers are Benjamin \\"Benjani\\" Mwaruwari, who plays for Blackburn Rovers F.C. as a striker, having taken over the captaincy from Peter Ndlovu. Ndlovu is also a notable Zimbabwean footballer having spent twelve seasons playing for top English football clubs. Another well known Zimbabwean footballer is Bruce Grobbelaar, a goalkeeper, who played for the national team, but most notably for Liverpool F.C. from 1980 to 1994. Rugby union Rugby union is a significant sport in Zimbabwe, dating back to the late 19th century. The Zimbabwe national rugby union team has been at the Rugby World Cup twice. The country has also produced a number of significant rugby players, although there has been a tendency for many of them to play in South Africa. Olympics and other games Zimbabwe has won eight Olympic medals, one (team medal) in field hockey at the (boycotted) 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, and the other seven by swimmer Kirsty Coventry, three at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and four at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Coventry won two gold medals, four silver, and one bronze. Zimbabwe also did well in the Commonwealth Games and All-Africa Games in swimming, with Coventry winning 11 gold medals in the different competitions. The country hosted the 1995 All-Africa Games. In golf ‚Äì in 1995 ‚Äì Zimbabwe reached the final of the Dunhill Cup, where they narrowly lost to Scotland. In snowboarding - Zimbabwe have a single pro snowboarder by the name of Michael Lewer. Born in Bulawayo, he moved to Scotland, where he began his snowboarding career. After 8 years in Scotland, he moved to Alberta, Canada in 2012. Michael's main riding spots are Lake Louise and Sunshine, but his favourite is Norquay!1995 Dunhill Cup Tennis Zimbabwe has also competed at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis, most notably with the Black Family, which comprises Wayne Black, Byron Black, and Cara Black. Zimbabwe's tennis players have also competed in most of the Olympic Games since independence in 1980. Polocrosse Polocrosse has been played in Zimbabwe (at the time Rhodesia) since 1948. In 1997, Zimbabwe became the World Champions when they went unbeaten against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa in Pietermaritzburg. Zimbabwe came fourth out of eight countries at the inaugural World Cup in 2003. Zimbabwe also won the Polocrosse Africa Cup in 2004. There are currently an estimated 156 playing members from 10 clubs. At the sports playing peak in 1996, there were 420 players. The decrease in Polocrosse players is due primarily to the Zimbabwean diaspora, and on-going economic and political crisis in the country. Polocrosse is often played by people from a rural background, and due to the land reforms in Zimbabwe, many of these people have left the country.

His work is frequently associated with the post-Spanish Civil War literary group. Bouso√±o was a recipient of both the National Prize for Spanish Literature and the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature. Biography Bouso√±o was born in Boal, Asturias in 1923. When he was two years old, his family moved to Oviedo, where he completed the first two years of a Philosophy and Arts degree. He moved to Madrid when he was 19, graduating from the Central University (now known as Complutense) with the Extraordinary Prize in 1946; he completed his master's degree there in 1949, being the first to write a master's thesis about a living writer, Vicente Aleixandre. By 1950, his work La poes√≠a de Vicente Aleixandre (The poetry of Vicente Aleixandre) became widely recognised, and today it remains one of the best and deepest works about Vicente Aleixandre's poetry. From 1946-48, Bouso√±o traveled in Mexico and the United States, teaching literature at Wellesley College in Massachusetts before returning to Spain. On 24 October 2015, Bouso√±o died at the age of 92.Muere Carlos Bouso√±o, que supo aunar la excelencia en la investigaci√≥n y en la poes√≠a  Poetry  Bouso√±o published his first book of poetry, Subida al amor, in 1945.  Academic career  His passion for poetry, along with his intelligence and curiosity, helped him make early inroads within the world of literary theory. In 1952, he published Teor√≠a de la expresi√≥n po√©tica (Theory of poetic expression), in which he analyzes the secrets of the poetic mystery. He became a renowned interpreter of Spanish literature and an influential literary critic. Bouso√±o taught Spanish literature at several American universities, including Wellesley, Smith, Vanderbilt, Middlebury, and New York University. He then became lecturer of Stylistics at the Complutense University of Madrid, where he remains a Professor Emeritus. Among his students of poetry who credit his teachings as influential to their careers is the Puerto Rican poet Giannina Braschi, author of \\"Yo-Yo Boing!\\" and \\"United States of Banana\\". In his book √âpocas literarias y evoluci√≥n (Literary times and evolution), Bouso√±o analyzes the history of literary ages and their corresponding movements and evolution. He has also studied the evolution of metaphoric expression, from classical examples like \\"your hand is like the snow\\", to more complex surrealistic metaphors, for example: \\"swords like lips\\" (in reference to one Aleixandre's most famous books, Espadas como labios (Swords like lips). In 1979, Bouso√±o became a member of the Royal Spanish Academy. He remained occupant of the Academy chair 'M' until his death in 2015. Recognition Ren√© Wellek said that Bouso√±o was his preferred theorist in all of Europe. Spanish author and critic Luis Antonio de Villena called Bouso√±o \\"one of the most outstanding poets of the postwar generations\\" and \\"an outstanding poetry theorist, upholding the most profound sense of irrationalism and surrealism, that is, that the magic of the irrational can be understood\\". German-born poet Scharlie Meeuws wrote an 'Elegy on the Death of Carlos Bouso√±o'.

It is also referred to by locals as \\"Poort\\". Eersterust is situated west of Mamelodi. Origins The area was created by the government of the apartheid era, which allocated and relocated people of the Coloured race group to this area. It was laid out in 1962 on the farm Vlakfontein. The name of Eersterust is clouded in mystery. Some say it is named after the mail-coach route that went to Lydenburg during the gold rush‚Äîthis being the first stop‚Äîwhile others speculate that it might have been the first township for coloured people established in the area. Overview Eersterust is seen as the gateway to the industrial areas of Pretoria, like Silverton and Waltloo. Most of the residents work in these areas, not far from home. The township has an estimated 85,000 residents. This community has evolved to develop its own cultural history including unique traditions and a way of life, based on friendliness and hospitality. Restaurants offer a unique local flavour with a variety of choices available, from traditional tastes to the spicy and adventurous. The main language is Afrikaans but many others are spoken. Eersterust is a very religious community, and there are numerous places of worship throughout the area. The first Catholic church which dates back to the early 1950s is located here. 60% of residents are Christian, while 30% belong to other religions, including Islam. Neighborhoods Eersterust has six independent extensions which offer nearby schooling and transport routes. Many people have also gathered to fight crime by starting neighborhood night watch groups to assist the police in protecting their homes and streets. Local residents cleverly know their respective areas of Eersterust and its popular streets, namely Hans Coverdale Road West, Hans Coverdale Road East and Hans Coverdale Road North, these streets all begin with the name Hans Coverdale, and being long distanced allowing locals to enjoy easy navigation around the area. The naming of these respective areas are listed by its different extensions, namely ext.2, ext.3, ext.4, ext.5 and ext.6, each one of them playing a huge role in the township of Eersterust. Newspapers and the media, however, refer to the parts of the township as North, East and West.

The township was develop for Coloureds to stay there, but the plots were mainly bought by Black People (Van der Walt, 1966). The details of the initial developments are not known. According to Van der Walt (1966) the living conditions was bad during the 1930s, there was no sanitation, illnesses were common and a lot of children died then. At that time Eersterust was no more than just a squatters settlement: the house were mainly made of sink and mud and a lot more of those structure were built on the same premises. Crime skyrocketed then. A portion of the farm (Derdepoort no.469) in Pretoria was proclaimed a Coloured area in 1958. The area was once again divided into plots after the previous owners were expropriated from the area. After the non-coloureds were relocated to another area the houses were destroyed and new ones were built. The first housing scheme consisting of 200 houses was completed during February 1962 and consisted of six economical residences. At that point in time 5 were made to move Coloureds that were staying somewhere else in Pretoria, such as Lady Selborne, Eastwood, Claremont, Booysens and the so-called Kaapse Lokasie, into Eersterust. In 1979 there was a total of 17,000 people living in Eersterust. Further development took place, and a total of 1207 sub-economical houses, 956 economical houses, and more or less 86 private houses were built in Eersterust. =The name Eersterust= The existence of the name is not precisely known, but according to Van der Wald (1966) there are three possibilities: 1\\\\. The then-owner that was involved in dividing the farm into plots, his daughter said that her father was an idealist and with the development of the township wanted to create the first resting in Transvaal for descendants of slaves. 2\\\\. Amongst the residence of Eersterust is said that the township was the first resting outside of Pretoria where the postman at the end of the previous century could rest after his trip between Lydenburg and Pretoria hence the name Eerste Rust. (The name is in Afrikaans.) 3\\\\. Some of the residence said that the Republican forces that came with the British during the three years of War out of Pretoria stopped at Eersterust, rested before they continued their struggle. =Housing in Eersterust= There are three types of accommodation units found in Eersterust, sub-economical units, economical units and private units. There are three sub-economical units that consist of two-, three- and four-room houses. The two- and three-room sub- economical houses are linked together and have a combination sitting room / dining room / kitchen, no ceiling, built in electricity points, warm water inside the house, a bathroom, a toilet inside the house and were built on small stands.

It is a community located near Norvelt, Pennsylvania. History In 1881, the United Coal & Coke Company, organized by a group of Greensburg businessmen, opened the United Mine and Coke Works in Mount Pleasant Township. Served by the Sewickley Branch of the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad. The United Mine had a shaft entry and employed nearly 200 men and boys. The company constructed houses for its workers and operated a company store. By 1886 United Coke Works contained 300 bee-hive coke ovens. That year, 1886 miners at United Mine produced more than of coal and its coke workers produced nearly of coke. F.M. Reynolds, who served as the initial head of United Coal & Coke Company, was succeeded by William C. Reynolds. By the end of the 1880s, the H. C. Frick Coke Company had acquired a two-thirds interest in United Coal & Coke Company. H. C. Frick assumed complete control of the United Mine property in 1895. Five years later the H.C. Frick Coke Company produced of coal and of coke at the United Mine & Coke Works. Frick had expanded the United Coke Works to 350 coke ovens, employing 341 men and boys in the mine and coke yard. The company appointed R. E. Laughrey as superintendent at United Mine. By 1910, however, H. C. Frick Coke Company was operating United Mine & Coke Works in conjunction with the nearby Calumet Mine & Coke Works. Robert Ramsay, a long-time superintendent and engineer at Frick's renowned Shaft Mines near Mount Pleasant, was brought in to manage the United Mine & Coke Works and the Calumet Mine & Coke Works. By this time the population of United had grown to 840 persons. Through the 1910s United Mine produced annually as much as of coal and of coke. In 1919 the United Mine produced of coal, and shipped of coal. The United Coke Works produced of coke, with 157 coke ovens in operation. The mine and coke works operated 271 days in 1919, with 315 employees. There were five non-fatal accidents in 1919. In 1920 the United Mine produced of coal, and shipped of coal. The United Coke Works produced of coke, with 174 coke ovens in operation. The mine and coke works operated 273 days, with 290 employees. There was one fatal accident and one non-fatal accident in 1920. Production diminished in the early 1920s, dropping to less than of coal a year. By 1926, however the United Mine was reaching its greatest output, producing more than of coal, most of which was being shipped to other coking plants. As with most of the H. C. Frick mines, coal at United was still extracted largely by hand. The H. C. Frick Coke Company closed and abandoned the United Mine and Coke Works in 1930. The United Mine's tipple was dismantled in 1931. United Mine produced only about of coal and employed 108 miners in its last year of operation. There were 350 bee-hive coke ovens still standing at the United Coke Works when the United Mine closed.United Mine & Coke Works, United, Mt.

He was Archduke and Prince of Austria, Prince of Hungary, Bohemia and Tuscany. After renouncing those titles, he was known as Johann (John) Orth. He disappeared while sailing with his wife in July 1890 and is believed to have died when his ship encountered a storm near Cape Horn. Salvator was declared dead in absentia in February 1911. Early life Johann Salvator was born in Florence, the youngest son of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his second wife, Princess Maria Antonia of the Two Sicilies. He was baptized in Florence's Battistero di San Giovanni as Giovanni Nepomuceno Maria Annunziata Giuseppe Giovanni Batista Ferdinando Baldassare Luigi Gonzaga Pietro Alessandrino Zanobi Antonino. He pursued a career in the Austrian Army and was a good friend of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, with both sharing liberal opinions. After Bulgaria was granted autonomy by the Ottoman Empire, Johann Salvator was an unsuccessful candidate for the throne. Prince Alexander of Battenberg would be elected Prince of Bulgaria in 1879. During the Austro- Hungarian occupation of the Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, he was put in command of a division of the occupying army and won numerous honours. On 16 October 1889, he resigned his army commission and renounced his title and the privileges he enjoyed as a member of the Austrian Imperial Family. After renouncing his titles he assumed the name \\"Johann (or John) Orth\\", the surname Orth derived from the name of a castle he had owned, Schloss Orth. Disappearance In 1889, Johann Salvator married Ludmilla (\\"Milli\\") Stubel, an opera dancer in London. Shortly after his marriage, he purchased a ship named the Santa Margareta, on which he and his wife sailed for South America. In February 1890 he set off from Montevideo, Uruguay, heading for Valpara√≠so in Chile. He was last seen on 12 July in Cape Tres Puntas, Argentina. It is believed that his ship was lost during a storm off the coast of Cape Horn. He was officially declared dead on 2 February 1911 in Vienna. In the years following Salvator's disappearance, numerous sightings of him were reported. Rumors persisted that he and his wife sailed to South America and assumed new identities. Several men also came forward claiming to be the \\"missing Duke\\". One of the more publicised claims came in May 1945 when a German born lithographer living in Kristiansand, Norway named Alexander Hugo K√∏hler made a deathbed confession claiming that he was Johann Salvator. K√∏hler claimed that, as Johann Orth, he \\"bought\\" the identity of Alexander Hugo K√∏hler and assumed his life. K√∏hler claimed that the real Alexander Hugo K√∏hler posed as Salvator and it was he who died at sea. Films about the Johann Orth mystery * Das Geheimnis der Santa Margherita (dir.
