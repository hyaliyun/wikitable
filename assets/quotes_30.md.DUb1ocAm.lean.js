It was proved in 2003 by Irving Kaplansky.. Statement of the theorem Kaplansky's theorem states that a prime p congruent to 1 modulo 16 is representable by both or none of x2 + 32y2 and x2 + 64y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 9 modulo 16 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. This is remarkable since the primes represented by each of these forms individually are not describable by congruence conditions.. Proof Kaplansky's proof uses the facts that 2 is a 4th power modulo p if and only if p is representable by x2 + 64y2, and that −4 is an 8th power modulo p if and only if p is representable by x2 + 32y2. Examples *The prime p = 17 is congruent to 1 modulo 16 and is representable by neither x2 + 32y2 nor x2 + 64y2. *The prime p=113 is congruent to 1 modulo 16 and is representable by both x2 + 32y2 and x2+64y2 (since 113 = 92 + 32×12 and 113 = 72 + 64×12). *The prime p = 41 is congruent to 9 modulo 16 and is representable by x2 + 32y2 (since 41 = 32 + 32×12), but not by x2 + 64y2. *The prime p = 73 is congruent to 9 modulo 16 and is representable by x2 + 64y2 (since 73 = 32 + 64×12), but not by x2 + 32y2. Similar results Five results similar to Kaplansky's theorem are known:. *A prime p congruent to 1 modulo 20 is representable by both or none of x2 + 20y2 and x2 + 100y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 9 modulo 20 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. *A prime p congruent to 1, 16 or 22 modulo 39 is representable by both or none of x2 + xy + 10y2 and x2 + xy + 127y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 4, 10 or 25 modulo 39 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. *A prime p congruent to 1, 16, 26, 31 or 36 modulo 55 is representable by both or none of x2 + xy + 14y2 and x2 + xy + 69y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 4, 9, 14, 34 or 49 modulo 55 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. *A prime p congruent to 1, 65 or 81 modulo 112 is representable by both or none of x2 + 14y2 and x2 + 448y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 9, 25 or 57 modulo 112 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. *A prime p congruent to 1 or 169 modulo 240 is representable by both or none of x2 + 150y2 and x2 + 960y2, whereas a prime p congruent to 49 or 121 modulo 240 is representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms.

The genus Anchiornis contains only the type species Anchiornis huxleyi, named for its similarity to modern birds. Anchiornis fossils have been only found in the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning, China, in rocks dated to the Late Jurassic, about 160 million years ago. Anchiornis is known from hundreds of specimens, and given the exquisite preservation of some of these fossils, it became the first Mesozoic dinosaur species for which almost the entire life appearance could be determined, and an important source of information on the early evolution of birds. Anchiornis huxleyi translates to \\"Huxley's near-bird\\" in Greek.  Description  Size compared with a human Anchiornis huxleyi was a small, bipedal theropod dinosaur with a triangular skull bearing several details in common with dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and primitive avialans. Like other early paravians, Anchiornis was small, about the size of a crow. It had long, wing-bearing arms, long legs, and a long tail. Like all paravians, it was covered in feathers, though it also had scales on certain parts of the body. The wings, legs, and tail supported long but relatively narrow vaned feathers. Two types of simpler, downy (plumaceous) feathers covered the rest of the body, as in Sinornithosaurus: down feathers made up of filaments attached at their bases, and more complex down feathers with barbs attached along a central quill. Long, simple feathers covered almost the entire head and neck, torso, upper legs, and the first half of the tail. The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers (rectrices). Long feathers on the head (crown) may have formed a crest. While the first specimen of Anchiornis preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body, many more well-preserved fossils have since been found. Studies of Anchiornis specimens using laser fluorescence have revealed not only more details of the feathers, but also of the skin and muscle tissue. Taken together, this evidence has given scientists a nearly complete picture of Anchiornis anatomy. Additional studies indicate that Anchiornis had body plumage that consisted of short quills with long and independent, flexible barbs. These barbs stuck out from the quills at low angles on two opposing blades. This also gave each feather an overall forked shape and resulted in the theropod possessing a softer textured and \\"shaggier\\" appearing plumage than is seen in modern birds. 'Shaggy' contour feathers probably influenced thermoregulatory and water repellence abilities, and, in combination with open-vaned wing feathers, would have decreased aerodynamic efficiency. Its size was originally estimated at and , but some specimens show that is could in fact have grown somewhat larger, up to and . Anchiornis had a wing span of up to . = Wings = Fossil wing including the skin outline (white areas) and remains of the feathers (dark areas) Like other early paravians, Anchiornis had large wings made up of pennaceous feathers attached to the arm and hand. The wing of Anchiornis was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers. The primary feathers in Anchiornis were about as long as the secondaries, and formed a rounded wing. The wing feathers had curved but symmetrical central quills, with small and thin relative size, and rounded tips, all indicating poor aerodynamic ability. In the related dinosaurs Microraptor and Archaeopteryx, the longest wing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing, making the wings appear relatively long and pointed. However, in Anchiornis, the longest wing feathers were those nearest the wrist, making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded, less flight-adapted profile. Like other maniraptorans, Anchiornis had a propatagium, a flap of skin connecting the wrist to the shoulder and rounding out the front edge of the wing. In Anchiornis, this part of the wing was covered in covert feathers which smoothed the wing and covered the gaps between the larger primary and secondary feathers. However, unlike modern birds, the covert feathers of Anchiornis were not arranged in tracts or rows. The arrangement of the covert feathers was also more primitive in Anchiornis than in birds and more advanced paravians. In modern birds, the coverts usually cover only the upper portion of the wing, with most of the wing surface made up of uncovered flight feathers. In some Anchiornis fossils, on the other hand, several layers of covert feathers seem to extend down to cover most of the wing's surface, so that the wing is essentially made of multiple layers of feathers, rather than a layer of broad feathers with only their bases hidden by layers of coverts. This multi-layered wing arrangement might have helped strengthen the wing, considering that the primary and secondary feathers themselves were narrow and weak. The wing included three clawed fingers; however, unlike in some more primitive theropods, the longest two fingers were not separate, but were bound together by the skin and other tissue forming the wing, so Anchiornis was functionally two-fingered. These bound fingers were incorporated into a post-patagium, or flap of skin and other tissues that helped support the bases of the main wing feathers. Like the toes, the skin around the bottom of the fingers was covered in tiny, rounded scales. Unlike the toes, the flesh around the underside of the finger bones was twice as thick as the bones themselves and lacked distinct pads; instead, the fingers were straight and smooth without any major creases at the joints. Scales and skin around the fingers is very rarely preserved in fossils of early pennaraptorans, the only notable exceptions being Anchiornis and Caudipteryx, which had similar thick, scaly fingers associated with its wings. = Legs = Skeletal restoration by Scott Hartman, 2017 In addition to the front wings, Anchiornis had long, vaned feathers on the hind legs. This has led many scientists to call Anchiornis a four-winged dinosaur, along with similar animals like Microraptor and Sapeornis. However, the feathers on the hind legs in Anchiornis did not have the shape or arrangement expected from flight feathers, and it is likely that their primary role was in display rather than flight. Anchiornis had very long legs, which is usually an indication that an animal is a strong runner. However, the extensive leg feathers indicate that this may be a vestigial trait, as running animals tend to have reduced, not increased, hair or feathers on their legs. Like most paravians, Anchiornis had four toes on the foot, with the third and fourth toes the longest. The first toe, or hallux, was not reversed as in perching species. The hindwings of Anchiornis were also shorter than those of Microraptor, and were made up of 12 to 13 flight feathers anchored to the tibia (lower leg) and 10 to 11 to the tarsus (upper foot). Also unlike Microraptor, the hindwing feathers were longest closer to the body, with the foot feathers being short and directed downward, almost perpendicular to the foot bones. Unlike many other paravians, the feet of Anchiornis (except for the claws) were completely covered in feathers, though these were much shorter than the ones making up the hindwing. Some specimens have preserved scales on the toes, tarsus, and even lower leg (tibia), suggesting that scales existed beneath the feathers. The underside of the toes were formed into fleshy pads with distinct creases at the joints. The foot pads were covered in small, pebble-like scales. Scales were also present on the top of the feet but these are very hard to see in all known fossils. = Color = Artist's impression, illustrating feather arrangement and life coloration of the Beijing specimen In 2010, a team of scientists examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well-preserved Anchiornis specimen in the Beijing Museum of Natural History to survey the distribution of melanosomes, the pigment cells that give feathers their color. By studying the types of melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds, the scientists were able to map the specific colors and patterning present on this Anchiornis when it was alive. Though this technique had been used and described for isolated bird feathers and portions of other dinosaurs (such as the tail of Sinosauropteryx), Anchiornis became the first Mesozoic dinosaur for which almost the entire life coloration was known (note that the tail of this specimen was not preserved). The study found that most of the body feathers of this Anchiornis specimen were gray and black. The crown feathers were mainly rufous with a gray base and front, and the face had rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers. The forewing and hindwing feathers were white with black tips. The coverts (shorter feathers covering the bases of the long wing feathers) were gray, contrasting the mainly white main wings. The larger coverts of the wing were also white with gray or black tips, forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing. These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing (primary feather coverts) but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing (secondary coverts). The shanks of the legs were gray other than the long hindwing feathers, and the feet and toes were black. In 2015, a second Anchiornis fossil at the Yizhou Fossil & Geology Park was subjected to a similar study that included a survey of melanosome shapes across all the feathers. In contrast to the 2010 study, only gray-black type melanosomes were found. Even when the crown feathers were examined, none of the rounder, rufous-type melanosomes were seen. The scientists who conducted this second study suggested several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the different preservation of melanosomes or different investigative techniques might have influenced the results of the original study. Second, because the Beijing Museum specimen was smaller, it is possible that the rufous color was replaced as these animals aged. Third, it is possible that there were regional differences or even different species of Anchiornis which had different color patterns in their plumage.  Discovery and history  The Beijing specimen which had its colouration examined in 2010 The first known fossil of Anchiornis (its type specimen) was dug up in the Yaolugou area of Jianchang County, Liaoning, China. These rocks have been difficult to date, but most studies have concluded that they belong to the Tiaojishan Formation of rocks dated to the late Jurassic period (Oxfordian age), 160.89 to 160.25 million years old. studied and described by paleontologist Xu Xing and colleagues in a paper accepted to the Chinese Science Bulletin in 2009. The specimen is currently in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology with the catalogue number IVPP V14378. It is an articulated skeleton missing the skull, part of the tail, and the right forelimb. The name Anchiornis huxleyi was chosen by Xu and colleagues in honor of Thomas Henry Huxley, an early proponent of biological evolution, and one of the first to propose a close evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs. The generic name Anchiornis comes from combining the Ancient Greek words for \\"nearby\\" and \\"bird\\", because it was interpreted as important in filling a gap in the transition between the body plans of birds and dinosaurs. A second specimen came to light around the same time, and was given to a team of scientists from Shenyang Normal University by a local farmer when they were excavating at the Yaolugou dig site. According to the farmer, this second specimen had been found nearby in the area of Daxishan, also from Tiaojishan Formation rocks of about the same age as the first Anchiornis. Two scientists visited the site in order to compare the new fossil with the rock types found there, and were able to confirm that the new specimen probably did come from the area the farmer described. They were able to dig up several fish fossils and a third Anchiornis fossil. The farmer's fossil underwent study which was published on September 24, 2009, in the journal Nature. It was assigned the catalogue number in the Liaoning Paleontological Museum. It is larger and much more complete than the first specimen, and preserved long wing feathers on the hands, arms, legs and feet, showing that it was a four-winged dinosaur similar to Microraptor. Life restoration by M. Martyniuk, 2010, based on the color pattern of the Beijing specimen. While only a few specimens have been described in detail, many more have been identified and are held in both private collections and museums. One of these, a nearly complete skeleton missing the tail, also preserving extensive feather remains, was reported in 2010. This fossil also showed evidence that Anchiornis had a feathered crest on its head, and was used to determine the animal's life coloration. It is housed in the Beijing Museum of Natural History with the specimen number BMNHC PH828. Another specimen from the same fossil quarry as the type specimen was found by a local fossil dealer and sold to the Yizhou Fossil & Geology Park and catalogued there as YTGP-T5199. This fossil, a nearly complete skeleton, was prepared and studied by scientists at the Geology Park and identified as an Anchiornis. It was then used for a scanning electron microscope study of Anchiornis feather microstructure. The study also examined the well-preserved melanosomes of the feathers to determine their color. The scientists involved in the study found that the coloration found for this specimen was different than the color reported for BMNHC PH828, and they noted that the BMNHC specimen may not in fact be Anchiornis, as it was described before similar species from the same formation had been discovered. The Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature in Pingyi County, China, for example, was reported to hold 255 specimens of Anchiornis in its collections in 2010. Among their collection is a very well preserved fossil with visible color patterns, catalogued as STM 0-214. While this specimen has yet to be fully described, it was photographed for a 2011 article in National Geographic and was used in a study of Anchiornis covert feathers and wing anatomy the following year.  Classification  When it was first discovered, the scientists who studied Anchiornis conducted a phylogenetic analysis and concluded that it was an early member of the group Avialae, along with Archaeopteryx. Members of Avialae, called avialans, are all more closely related to modern birds than they are to dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs, though the earliest and most primitive members of all three groups are extremely similar to each other, which makes it difficult to sort out exactly which of these three main paravian branches they belong to. The second specimen of Anchiornis was more complete than the first, and preserved several features which led Hu Dongyu and his colleagues to reclassify Anchiornis as a troodontid. Several more studies using similar analyses have also found Anchiornis to be a troodontid, though there have been exceptions. One study found Anchiornis to be a member of Archaeopterygidae, and it along with Archaeopteryx were considered more primitive than dromeosaurids, troodontids, or avialans. In 2015, Sankar Chatterjee placed Anchiornis along with Microraptor and other four-winged paravians in a group he called \\"Tetrapterygidae\\", just outside the Avialae, though this was not supported with a phylogenetic analysis.Chatterjee, S. (2015). The Rise of Birds: 225 million Years of Evolution. (2nd edition). Johns Hopkins University Press. More comprehensive studies suggested that Anchiornis may have been an avialan after all, though new finds and updated versions of the same study later reversed this finding, concluding that Anchiornis was most likely a basal member of the clade Paraves, just outside the clade that includes dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and avialans. In a 2017 re-evaluation of the Haarlem Archaeopteryx specimen, Anchiornis was found to be in a group with other genera, like Eosinopteryx, Xiaotingia, and was placed in the family Anchiornithidae along with other relatives.  Paleobiology  Photograph of specimen and diagram showing plumage Anchiornis is notable for its proportionally long forelimbs, which measured 80% of the total length of the hindlimbs. This is similar to the condition in early avians such as Archaeopteryx, and the authors pointed out that long forelimbs are necessary for flight. Anchiornis also had a more avian wrist than other non-avialan theropods. The authors initially speculated that it would have been possible for Anchiornis to fly or glide. However, further finds showed that the wings of Anchiornis, while well-developed, were short when compared to later species like Microraptor, with relatively short primary feathers that had rounded, symmetrical tips, unlike the pointed, aerodynamically proportioned feathers of Microraptor. A 2016 study of potential flight performance in early paravians concluded that while juvenile Anchiornis specimens may have been able to use their wings to assist running up an incline, and could possibly have achieved flapping flight if a very high-angle flapping wing stroke was used, the larger adult specimens would not have gained any aerodynamic benefit from their wings—they were simply too heavy compared to their total wing area. The same study found that flapping the wings while running would have resulted in a small (10%) increase to its running speed. Similarly, use of the wings during leaping would have resulted in a 15 to 20% increase in height and distance. Notably, Anchiornis seems to have lacked a breastbone (sternum), which may have been made of cartilage rather than bone, as in more primitive theropods. Fossil exhibited in Japan Anchiornis has hindleg proportions more like those of more primitive theropod dinosaurs than avialans, with long legs indicating a fast-running lifestyle. However, while long legs normally indicate a fast runner, the legs and even feet and toes of Anchiornis were covered in feathers, including long feathers on the legs, similar to those in the hindwings of Microraptor. Long leg feathers on the lower legs may have slowed the running speed of Anchiornis. In modern birds, especially those that live on the ground, the lower legs tend to show reduction or even loss of feathers. The hind wings of Anchiornis were smaller and made of more curved, symmetrical feathers than those of Microraptor, suggesting that they were used mainly for display rather than flight. However, they might still have granted the animal some kind of aerodynamic advantage, even if their primary purpose was for display or some other function. The skeletal structure of Anchiornis is similar to Eosinopteryx, which appears to have been a capable runner due to its uncurved rear claws and absence of flight feathers on its tail or lower legs. Anchiornis shared a similar body plan and the same ecosystem as Eosinopteryx, suggesting different niches and a complex picture for the origin of flight. Like many modern birds, Anchiornis exhibited a complex pattern of coloration with different colors in speckled patterns across the body and wings, or \\"within- and among-feather plumage coloration.\\" In modern birds, such color patterning is used in communication and display, either to members of the same species (e.g. for mating or territorial threat display) or to threaten and warn off competing or predatory species. = Feeding = A 2018 study reported gastric pellets in association with Anchiornis specimens; some of the Anchiornis were even preserved with pellets still inside their bodies. Anchiornis is the earliest theropod known to have produced pellets. The pellets contained lizard bones and ptycholepid fish scales.

Thirteen 25-minute episodes were produced in Sweden, although the language, and cast, is English. Lon Chaney Jr. was the host, introducing each episode from his 'home' at 13 Demon Street. Condemned for some shockingly atrocious crime, Chaney's purpose in relating the series' stories was to convince viewers that the crimes presented in them were worse than his, thus freeing him from his purgatory. This was hard for audiences to judge, however, because Chaney's original crime was never specified. The series was originated by Curt Siodmak, who also wrote some of the scripts and directed several episodes. He had previously written Chaney's 1941 film The Wolf Man. Three episodes of the series were edited together to make a theatrical feature called The Devil's Messenger in 1961, in which Chaney's character was reconfigured as Satan himself. Chaney filmed new wraparound segments as Satan in Hell to link the chosen episodes, which were \\"The Photograph\\", \\"The Girl in the Glacier\\" and \\"Condemned in Crystal\\". Several of the show's stories were derivative in nature. \\"The Black Hand\\", for example, was modelled on The Hands of Orlac, while \\"The Photograph\\" is an updated version of the M R James story \\"The Mezzotint\\". Availability on home video The series is available on grey market home video. In addition, two episodes - 'The Vine of Death' and 'The Black Hand' - were included as bonus features on the Image DVD release of the 1958 Hal Roach/ Boris Karloff series The Veil. Odeon's UK release of the same series featured four - the Image episodes, plus 'The Photograph' and 'Fever'. Although numerous dealers offer the series on DVD or VHS, every existing set is missing most of the Lon Chaney footage, removed by some unknown individual for unknown reasons. Episodes were intended to open and close in Lon Chaney's character's dilapidated home, where he would act as host and comment on each individual story. However, most episodes have obvious jump cuts, almost completely eliminating Lon Chaney's presence.

Biography  Simeon was born on the Isle of Wight in 1815. He was the eldest son of Sir Richard Simeon, 2nd Baronet and his wife Louisa Edith Barrington, the oldest daughter of Sir Fitzwilliam Barrington, 10th Baronet. He received his education at Christ Church, Oxford, from where he graduated with a BA in 1837. His first marriage was on 26 Nov 1840 to Jane Maria Baker, daughter of Sir Frederick Francis Baker, 2nd Baronet. Sir John Simeon, 4th Baronet and Sir Edmund Charles Simeon, 5th Baronet were sons from this marriage. His wife died in 1860, and he remarried in the following year to the Honourable Catherine Dorothea Colville, a sister of Charles Colville, 1st Viscount Colville of Culross. = Career = He initially pursued a naval career before being returned for the Isle of Wight in 1847 as a Liberal Member of Parliament. On 27 March 1848, he became a member of the Canterbury Association and immediately joined the management committee. The object was to create an Anglican settlement in New Zealand, which happened with the Canterbury region, with Christchurch as its capital. Together with Lord Lyttelton, Lord Richard Cavendish and Edward Gibbon Wakefield, he guaranteed £15,000 to the Canterbury Association in April 1850, which saved it from financial collapse. In 1851 he converted to Catholicism, and resigned his seat in Parliament through appointment as Steward of the Manor of Northstead on 5 May 1851, \\"out of a delicate instinct of honour towards those who had elected him while he was a member of the Anglican Church — believing that he had no right to suppose them to be indifferent to the change he had made.\\"\\"The Last Days of Sir John Simeon\\", The Month: A Magazine and Review new series, vol. II (XIII), July to December 1870, pp. 481-484. He resigned from the Canterbury Association shortly afterwards on 15 May 1851. He was elected again for the same constituency in 1865, for a time serving as the only Roman Catholic Member of Parliament from an English constituency. His last political act, on 8 April 1870, was to speak in Parliament against a measure proposed by Charles Newdigate Newdegate for the state inspection of convents, despite being seriously ill at the time. Bursting a blood-vessel in his throat, he set off on a journey to Switzerland to recover his health but died en route while in Freiburg, aged 55. = Legacy = Simeon Street in Ryde, Isle of Wight, is named after him, as well as the Simeon Arms Public House in the same street. Simeon Quay in Lyttelton, New Zealand is named for the Simeon family. Simeon Street in the Christchurch suburb of Spreydon is named for his brother Charles.

Arguments both in favor of and in opposition to same-sex marriage are often made on religious grounds and/or formulated in terms of religious doctrine. Although many of the world's religions are opposed to same-sex marriage, the number of religious denominations that are conducting same-sex marriages have been increasing in recent times. Religious views on same-sex marriage are closely related to religious views on homosexuality. Religious supportBuddhism= Due to the ambivalent language about homosexuality in Buddhist teachings, there has been no official stance put forth regarding the issue of marriage between members of the same gender. There is no official Buddhist position on the issue of same-sex marriage.Religious Groups' Official Positions on Same-Sex Marriage, The PEW Forum on Religious Issues and Public Life, April 1, 2008 (Revised May 20, 2008). On October 11, 1995, some religious leaders gave testimony to the Commission on Sexual Orientation and the Law in support of same-gender marriages. Robert Aitken, co-founder and teacher of the Honolulu Diamond Sangha, a Zen Buddhist society established in 1959, with centers in Manoa and Palolo, gave written testimony on the subject of same-sex marriage. Aitken explains that by applying the Four Noble Abodes (loving kindness, compassion, joy in the attainment of others, and equanimity) to the issue of same-sex marriage, he finds compassion for and with the gay or lesbian couple who wish to confirm their love in a legal marriage. Aitken cites a precept about sex which Zen Buddhists inherit from earlier classical Buddhists teachings. It is one of the sixteen precepts accepted by all Zen Buddhist monks, nuns and seriously committed lay people. He understands this to mean that self-centred sexual conduct is inappropriate, and he vows to avoid it. He believes that self-centred sex is exploitive sex, non-consensual sex, sex that harms others. It is unwholesome and destructive in a heterosexual as well as in a homosexual context. He goes on to explain that The Legislative Reference Bureau compiled a formidable list of rights that are extended to married couples in Hawai'i, but which are denied to couples who are gay and lesbian. He argues that gay and lesbian unions would be \\"settled even more\\" if they were acknowledged with basic married rights. Aitken says, \\"A long-standing injustice would be corrected, and the entire gay and lesbian community would feel more accepted. This would stabilize a significant segment of our society, and we would all of us be better able to acknowledge our diversity. I urge you to advise the Legislature and the people of Hawai'i that legalizing gay and lesbian marriages will be humane and in keeping with perennial principles of decency and mutual encouragement.\\"Ramsey, T. (January 6, 1996). \\"A Zen Buddhist perspective on same-gender marriage.\\" =Christianity= Support and affirmation of marriage rights for same-sex couples generally comes from certain Christian denominations that are considered theologically liberal. Some examples of religious organizations voicing their support for same-sex marriage include Metropolitan Community Church, the United Church of Christ, the United Church of Canada, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Episcopal Church of the United States, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Evangelical Lutheran Church In America,the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Norway, the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, the United Protestant Church of France, the United Protestant Church in Belgium, the Icelandic Church, the Swiss Reformed Church, the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau, the Evangelical Church of Hesse Electorate-Waldeck, the Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia, the Evangelical Church in the Rhineland, the Protestant Church in Baden, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany, the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldenburg, the Evangelical Church of the Palatinate, the Church of Lippe, the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Quakers, the liberal Old Catholic Church and the Unitarian Universalists church which supports the rights of gays and lesbians to marry both in the church and through the state. There are also progressive congregations and organizations within mainline Christian denominations, that have not yet officially voiced official support for same-sex marriage, but have spoken out themselves in support of same-sex marriage rights in the church and through the state. Some biblical scholars who hold to a more theologically liberal Christian view of same-sex marriage, such as representatives of the Metropolitan Community Church, make the claim that the word \\"homosexual\\" as found in many modern versions of the Bible is an interpolation and is not found in the original biblical texts. This argument from scripture holds that since the original authors of the Bible never mention 'homosexuals' or committed Christian homosexual couples, there cannot exist a biblical prohibition of marriage rights for them. According to the MCC, biblical texts interpreted by some as references to homosexuality refer only to specific sex acts and idolatrous worship which lack relevance to contemporary same-sex relationships. Christians who support religious and legal recognition of same-sex marriage may base their belief in same-sex marriage on the view that marriage, as an institution, and the structure of the family is a biblical moral imperative that should be honored by all couples, heterosexual and homosexual alike. Supporting same-sex marriage reflects their Christ-like commitment to the equality and dignity of all people. According to a theologian from the United Church of Canada, \\"human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God.\\" John Boswell claims the 4th century Christian martyrs Saint Sergius and Saint Bacchus were united in the rite of adelphopoesis, or brother-making, which he calls an early form of religious same-sex marriage.The Marriage of Likeness: Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe (New York: Villard, 1994), Some same-sex married couples have challenged religious organizations that exclude them from access to public facilities maintained by those organizations, such as schools, health care centers, social service agencies, summer camps, homeless shelters, nursing homes, orphanages, retreat houses, community centers, and athletic programs. Opponents of same-sex marriages have expressed concerns that this limits their religious freedoms. For example, conservatives worry that a Christian college would risk its tax-exempt status by refusing to admit a legally married gay couple to married-student housing. Some legal analysts suggest that failure to reflect gay rights within their organizations may cost some religious groups their tax-exempt status. Religious arguments for and against marriage rights for same-sex couples are not always evenly divided among theologically conservative religious groups and liberal groups. While self-identified theological liberal organizations such as the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), support same-sex marriage, other more conservative and or orthodox organizations including some Mennonite churches, the Church of the Brethren, the Old Catholic Church, and the Church of Sweden also support marriage rights for gay and lesbian persons.King, Michael A. Fractured Dance: Gadamer and a Mennonite Conflict over Homosexuality. C. Henry Smith Series, no. 3. Foreword by Herbert Simons. Telford, Pa.: Pandora Press, 2001. Episcopal Church of the United States The Episcopal Church (as of 2015: 7,115 open parishes and missions; 2,009,084 active baptized members) at their 2009 General Convention declared that: \\"bishops, particularly those in dioceses within civil jurisdictions where same-gender marriage, civil unions, or domestic partnerships are legal, may provide generous pastoral response to meet the needs of members of this Church.\\" On July 9, 2012, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution that was to be voted on later to approve an official liturgy for blessing same-sex unions. This liturgy, called \\"The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant,\\" would enable priests to bestow the church's blessing on same-sex couples; priests could refuse to perform marriages, and bishops could prohibit same-sex marriage in their diocese. Denial would come without penalty, but the priest or diocese would have to direct same-sex couples they decline to another church or priest willing to perform the ceremony. The resolution was confirmed on July 9, 2015 (three years later) on a 129 for and 26 against (with 5 abstaining) vote. Metropolitan Community Church The Metropolitan Community Church (43,000 members) sees its mission being social as well as spiritual by standing up for the rights of minorities, particularly those of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. MCC has been a leading force in the development of Queer theology.Edward R. Gray, Gay religion By Scott Thumma, Alta Mira Press, 2005 As such, the MCC is notable for publicly supporting same-sex marriage as early as the 1960s. Notably in 1970 Troy Perry, the church's founder, filed the first lawsuit in the U.S. seeking legal recognition for same-sex marriages. Perry lost that lawsuit but launched the debate over same-sex marriage in the U.S. Today, MCC congregations around the world perform more than 6000 same-sex marriage ceremonies annually. Presbyterian Church USA The Presbyterian Church USA General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission ruled in 2006 that same-sex ceremonies are not forbidden, as long as they are not considered to be the same as marriage services. Debate on the issue within the church evolved over the years. In 2000, the General Assembly had approved language for the church constitution that stated church teachings were that people were \\"to live either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity in singleness.,\\" and barred church officers and property from being used for blessing or approval upon any other form of fidelity relationship, but ratification for this language was never obtained by the presbyteries. By 2014, the General Assembly passed an Authoritative Interpretation permitting pastors to sign marriage licences for same-gender couples where permitted by civil law in the states where their church was found, which took immediate effect. On March 17, 2015, ratification by a majority of presbyteries was reached on a constitutional amendment passed by that same 2014 General Assembly, which broadened the definition of marriage in the Directory for Worship from only being between \\"a man and a woman,\\" to \\"two people, traditionally a man and a woman,\\" thus giving official sanction to, while not making it mandatory for, any congregation's pastor to preside over and bless marriage ceremonies for same-gender couples. United Church of Christ The United Church of Christ's General Synod (998,906 members) passed a resolution affirming \\"equal marriage rights for all people regardless of gender\\" in 2005. The church allows but does not require pastors to perform same-sex weddings. United Church of Canada The United Church of Canada (600,000 members) was active in the campaign that led to legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Canada. The United Church now allows individual congregations to decide whether or not to perform these marriages. Likewise, in the Protestant Church of the Netherlands, where same-sex marriages have been legal since 2001, individual congregations decide if they will perform them. Some Christians support religious and legal recognition of same-sex marriages based on a moral commitment to equality, or a belief that \\"human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God\\", as affirmed by the United Church of Canada's 37th General Council. Liberal Catholic theologians Even within the Roman Catholic Church, there can be found a few a groups who support for same-sex marriage. For example, while the Vatican and most of the Roman Catholic hierarchy oppose same sex marriages, there are a few Catholic theologians who support gay marriages. Critical biblical scholarship According to Daniel A. Helminiak,Helminiak, Daniel A. (2000). What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality: Millennium Edition. New Mexico: Alamo Square Press, pages 131-132. the Bible may be interpreted literally or within historical-cultural context. Under a literalist reading, the Bible can be read as condemning homosexuality (and, by extension, gay marriage).Helminiak, Daniel A. (2000). What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality: Millennium Edition. New Mexico: Alamo Square Press, chapter nine: Summary and conclusion, page 131 Read in cultural context, the Bible \\"was not addressing our current questions about sexual ethics and does not condemn gay sex [or gay marriage]s as we understand it today.\\" Helminiak argues that Biblical passages said to be against homosexuality (and same-sex marriages) do not actually say anything against gay and lesbian sexual relationships or identity. \\"The sin of Sodom was inhospitality, not homosexuality. Jude condemns sex with angels, not sex between two men. Not a single Bible text indisputably refers to lesbian sex. [...] there follows no valid conclusion whatsoever about homosexuality. Biblical figures [...] may well have been involved in homogenital relationships, seen as part of God's plan. And Jesus himself said nothing at all about homosexuality, not even when face to face with a man in a gay relationship.\\" It has been argued that the Bible was written for a world unlike our own,Bailey, D.S. (1975). Homosexuality and the Western Christian Culture. Anchor Books: Hamdon, CT.Bratcher, Dennis (2006). \\"Community and Testimony: Cultural Influence in Biblical Studies\\" in The Voice: Biblical and Theological Resource for Growing Christians. and that Monogamy, for example, only became the norm in the Christian world in the last 150 years or so.Lim, Israel C.S. (July, 1998): \\"The History of Monogamy\\" in Patriarchy Website. Lisa Miller also argues for a move beyond literalism. However, Miller argues that the Bible supports the idea of monogamous relationships, including gay marriage.Miller, Lisa. \\"Our Mutual Joy: Opponents of gay marriage often cite Scripture. But what the Bible teaches about love argues for the other side\\" in NEWSWEEK. From the magazine issue dated Dec 15, 2008. Robin Kar argues that same-sex marriage is partly the result of certain religious and spiritual developments within Judeo-Christian society, which led to love-based marriages in the West. Hence, there are now religious reasons for Christians to support \\"transformative\\" marriage for all people and to dispense with the assumption that same-sex marriage reflects encroaching secularism. =Unitarian Universalists and Unitarians= A rally at the Unitarian Church in Summit in New Jersey advocating same-sex marriage for same-sex couples in the state. The blue banner reads \\"Say 'I Do' to Marriage Equality\\". At the 1996 United States Unitarian Universalist General Assembly, delegates voted overwhelmingly that they would perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, and the church has been performing weddings with and without state sanction ever since. Likewise Canadian Unitarian Universalist congregations perform same-sex marriages and the Canadian Unitarian Council their national organization supports this work through its Lay Chaplaincy program. Also the British Unitarian church is at the forefront of the campaign for same-sex marriage. =Hindus= There are both conservative and liberal views about homosexuality and same-sex marriages in Hinduism, similar to many other religions. A liberal view is presented by Mathematician Shakuntala Devi, in her 1977 book, The World of Homosexuals, in which she interviewed Srinivasa Raghavachariar, head priest of the Srirangam temple. He said that same-sex lovers must have been cross-sex lovers in a former life. The sex may change but the soul retains its attachments, hence the love impels these souls towards one another.\\"It started in 1977 with the publication of a book by a woman who is better known as a mathematician. Shakuntala Devi's The World of Homosexuals can be said to have inaugurated social-reformist homophilic Indian writing in English. She concluded her book by calling for not only the decriminalisation of homosexuality in India, but also its 'full and complete acceptance' by the heterosexual population so that the Indian homosexual may lead a dignified and secure life.\\" Arvind Narrain and Gautam Bhan (eds). (2005) Because I Have a Voice: Queer Politics in India. New Delhi: Yoda Press. Devi, Shakuntala (1977). The World of Homosexuals, Delhi: Vikas, (p. 155). In 2002, the academic Ruth Vanita interviewed a Shaiva priest who performed the marriage of two women; having studied Hindu scriptures, he had concluded, \\"Marriage is a union of spirits, and the spirit is not male or female\\" (p. 147).Vanita, Ruth (2006). Love’s Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West As Amara Das Wilhelm, a Krishna devotee and founder of GALVA, notes in his book, Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex, \\"several Gaudiya Vaishnava authorities emphasize that since everyone passes through various forms, genders and species in a series of lives, we should not judge each other by the material body but view everyone equally on a spiritual plane, and be compassionate as God is.\\"Das Wilhelm, Amara (2004). Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex - Understanding Homosexuality, Transgender Identity and Intersex Conditions Through Hinduism. According to Ruth Vanita, \\"Indian newspapers, over the last 25 years, have reported several same-sex weddings and same-sex joint suicides, mostly by Hindu female couples in small towns, unconnected to any gay movement. Several weddings took place by Hindu rites, with some family support, while the suicides resulted from families forcibly separating lovers.\\" According to Vanita, the phenomena of increased visibility of same-sex weddings \\"...suggest the wide range of Hindu attitudes to homosexuality today. The millennia-long debate in Hindu society, somewhat suppressed in the colonial period, has revived. In 2004, Hinduism Today reporter Rajiv Malik asked several Hindu swamis (teachers) their opinion of same-sex marriage. The swamis expressed a range of opinions, positive and negative. They felt free to differ with each other; this is evidence of the liveliness of the debate, made possible by the fact that Hinduism has no one hierarchy or leader. As Mahant Ram Puri remarked, \\"We do not have a rule book in Hinduism. We have a hundred million authorities.\\"Vanita, Ruth (2008). \\"Homosexuality and Hinduism.\\" GALVA - The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association, Inc. =Islam= Same sex marriage is not permissible in Islamic teachings. In Albania, Tunisia, and Turkey, there have been discussions about legalizing same-sex marriage. but without success (one reason was that the huge majority of the people in those countries and also almost all political parties are against same sex marriage). In France there was an Islamic same- sex marriage on February 18, 2012. In Paris in November 2012 a room in a Buddhist prayer hall was used by gay Muslims and called a \\"gay-friendly mosque\\",Gay-friendly 'mosque' opens in Paris retrieved 12 February 2013 and a French Islamic website is supporting religious same-sex marriage. A majority of American Muslims (51 percent) support same-sex marriage as of 2017, according to a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute in their \\"2017 American Values Atlas.\\" The first American Muslim in the United States Congress, Keith Ellison (D-MN) said in 2010 that all discrimination against LGBT people is wrong.Bradlee Dean: Keith Ellison is advancing Sharia law through ‘homosexual agenda’ retrieved 15 January 2013 He further expressed support for gay marriage stating:Keith Ellison: Minnesota Anti-Gay Marriage Amendment Will Fail retrieved 16 January 2013 > \\"I believe that the right to marry someone who you please is so fundamental > it should not be subject to popular approval any more than we should vote on > whether blacks should be allowed to sit in the front of the bus.\\" =Judaism= Members of Conservative Judaism and Reform JudaismUnion of American Hebrew Congregations, Civil Marriage for Gay and Lesbian Jewish Couples (adopted by the General Assembly 1997) (visited January 20, 2008). support marriages for same-sex couples. The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation leaves the choice to individual rabbis. =Native American religion= Native American religions traditionally accepted same-sex marriage. This often came in the form of a Two-Spirit identity in which the Indigenous peoples of the Americas would fulfill one of many mixed gender roles.The 'two-spirit' people of indigenous North Americans retrieved 24 September 2012 =Neopaganism= Neopagans are generally welcoming of LGBT people, and some strands celebrate gay relationships. Support is highest in Neo-Druidism, Wicca and Asatru.Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice, Thea Sabin - 2006Women's spirituality, women's lives - Page 127, Judith Ochshorn, Ellen Cole - 1995 Some Wiccan groups perform handfastings and betrothals. =Views regarding Church-State separation= Many supporters of same sex marriages argueGlassman, Anthony. (July 15, 2005). \\"Pro-Gay Marriage Amendment Focuses on Religious Freedom\\" in The Gay People's Chronicle.David Dix (April, 2004). \\"Freedom of religion and gay marriage\\" in Southside Pride: Phillips/Powderhorn/Nokomis/Riverside. that, by defining the institution of marriage as between one man and one woman, the state automatically tramples upon the constitutional rights to freedom of religion. They argue that just because a majority of religious organizations may believe that gay marriages should not be granted by the state does not make it the state's obligation to observe their opinions on this matter.Cline, A. \\"Arguments Against Gay Marriage: Marriage is a Sacred Religious Sacrament Gay Marriage Would Be a Sacrilege and Thus Must Be Banned?\\" The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is part of the United States Bill of Rights, expressly forbids laws being made \\"respecting an establishment of religion\\" and that prohibit the free exercise of religion. Thus, according to this argument, the state has no authority to define marriage as between one man and woman because there are various religions which hold that gay marriage is morally equivalent to heterosexual marriage. Americans United for Separation of Church and State prominently expresses concern that heterosexual-only marriage laws impose a specific religious doctrine as state policy. According to them, \\"a marriage amendment in the Constitution [raises] important church-state and religious liberty concerns.\\"Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Marriage & Family Life. Frequently Asked Questions. Accessed December 30, 2008. Religious opposition The vast majority of Christian groups have been vocal and politically active in opposing same-sex marriage laws in the United States.See e.g., Southern Baptist Convention, On Same-Sex Marriage (adopted 2003) (visited January 20, 2008)\\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\\", churchofjesuschrist.org. Same-sex marriage opponents sometimes claim that extending marriage rights to same-sex couples could undercut the conventional purpose of marriage.See e.g., Southern Baptist Convention, On Same-Sex Marriage (adopted 2003) http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=1128 (visited January 20, 2008). Roman Catholic advocates of monogamous heterosexual marriages contend that same-sex relationships cannot be considered marriages because marriage, by definition, necessarily involves the uniting of two members of the opposite sex. Other religious arguments for an opposite-sex definition of marriage hold that same-sex relationships should not be recognized as marriages because same-gender sexual activity is contrary to God's will, is immoral, and subverts God's creative intent for human sexuality. Christian opposition to same-sex marriage also comes from the belief that same-sex marriage normalizes homosexual behavior and would encourage it, instead of encouraging resistance to same-sex attraction. =Christianity= Christian denominations and groups that have been vocal and or active in their opposition to same-sex marriages include the: Assemblies of God (66.4 million members), Church of God in Christ (over 8 million members),Church Of God In Christ,( the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, the Conservative Mennonite Conference, the Convocation of Anglicans in North America, the Hutterite Brethren, the Brethren in Christ, the Mennonite Church USA, the Catholic Church (1.2 Billion members), the Russian Orthodox Church (150 million members), the Seventh-day Adventist Church (17 million members), the Southern Baptist Convention (15.7 million members), and the United Pentecostal Church International (2 million members). In 2009, a group of Christian leaders from various denominations issued the Manhattan Declaration, an \\"influential statement that united evangelicals and Catholic leaders in fighting abortion and gay marriage\\"; as of November 2010, the Declaration had been signed by over 475,000 individuals. On August 29, 2017, the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the \\"Nashville Statement\\". The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief. Among other things, it states, \\"We deny that God has designed marriage to be a homosexual, polygamous, or polyamorous relationship.\\" Catholic Church opposition The Catholic Church argues from a theological perspective against recognizing same-sex unions. According to Catholic moral doctrine, acts of sexual intimacy are only proper between a man and a woman within wedlock. Secular government recognition of any other union within the definition of \\"marriage\\" would therefore reflect a belief in the moral equivalence of acts between a husband and wife and acts between two men or two women; this belief is contrary to Catholic doctrinal teaching. Catholic opponents also argue that inclusion of same-sex unions within the definition of marriage would also evidence rejection of the idea that, in general, it is best that children be raised by their biological mother and father, and that it is the community's interest in ensuring the well-being of children is the sole basis for the government's licensee and involvement in marriage.The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Considerations Regarding Proposals to Give Legal Recognition to Unions between Homosexual Persons (2003) (visited January 20, 2008) (statement by Vatican department charged with promoting and safeguarding the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world). Pope John Paul II, then head of the Roman Catholic church, criticized same-sex marriage when it was introduced in the Netherlands in 2001. His successor Pope Benedict XVI maintained opposition to the institution, considering it amongst \\"the most insidious and dangerous threats to the common good today\\". Eastern Orthodox Christianity The Greek Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox and Russian Orthodox Churches, and the rest of the Orthodox Churches all share the same view. They all view same-sex marriage as a sin. They do not accept/support homosexual relationships or marriages, and believe it is immoral and inappropriate. This statement from the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America further explains: \\"The position of the Orthodox Church toward homosexual acts has been expressed by synodicals, canons and patristic pronouncements from the very first centuries of Orthodox ecclesiastical life. In them, the Orthodox Church condemns unreservedly all expressions of personal sexual experience which prove contrary to the definite and unalterable function ascribed to sex by God's ordinance and expressed in man's experience as a law of nature. The Orthodox Church believes that homosexual behavior is a sin.\\" ] =Views in Scripture= Within the Christian tradition, religious objections to same-sex marriages are often based upon the Bible. Some religious arguments against same-sex marriage are based upon Old Testament biblical passages such as Genesis 19:4-11, Leviticus 18:22, and Leviticus 20:13, while others are based upon New Testament biblical passages such as Romans 1, I Corinthians 6:8-10, and Jude 1:7. Conservative Christians note that the book of Leviticus contains a prohibition against male-male sexuality. While the Biblical passages mentioned above do not define the institution of marriage, Genesis 2:22-24 reads as follows: \\"Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, 'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man.' For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.\\" This passage is quoted by Jesus in the New Testament Gospel of Matthew. Evangelical opposition According to Reverend Rick Warren, a pastor of the conservative Evangelical Christian Saddleback megachurch, homosexuals are people who \\"think they are smarter than God\\" and who choose \\"to disobey God's sexual instructions.\\" From Warren's point of view, marriage is an ordinance from God that unites a man and a woman. James Dobson, in Marriage Under Fire and elsewhere, argues that legalization for or passive tolerance of same-sex marriages would widen the definition of families. The ex-gay movement takes the view that I Corinthians 6:9-11 offers Christian believers freedom from the sin of homosexual behavior. Evangelical author and counselor Joe Dallas notes that the Biblical passages relating to homosexual behavior uniformly prohibit that behavior. Other Churches The Orthodox Church in America is also opposed to same-sex marriage, as is the Unification Church.Unification Church pres sees smaller mass weddings , The Monitor (Uganda), 2008-12-30, \\"Moon said the church does not give its wedding blessing to same sex couples.\\" The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (15 million members) believes that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that children are entitled to be raised by a mother and a father who honor their marital vows with complete fidelity.The Family: A Proclamation to the World They believe marriage is not primarily a contract between individuals to ratify their affections and provide for mutual obligations, but is an important part of rearing children. They teach that same-sex marriage undermines the purpose of marriage. Jehovah's Witnesses (8.2 million members) believes God condemns sexual activity that is not between a husband and his wife. They teach that while the bible condemns homosexual acts, it does not condone hatred of homosexuals or homophobia.http://hwww.jw.org/en/bible- teachings/questions/bible-about-homosexuality/ The United Methodist Church does not permit same-sex marriage or the ordination of LGBT people. On February 26, 2019, conference delegates voted against a proposal (449-374) that would have begun allowing churches to set their own LGBT policies at a local level. Instead, the previous day, a majority of delegates indicated that they would support a stricter approach to the existing policies, including encouraging dissenters to leave the church. =Orthodox Judaism= Judaism, like Christianity, reflects differing views between conservative and liberal adherents. Orthodox Judaism maintains the traditional Jewish bans on both sexual acts and marriage amongst members of the same sex. The Orthodox Union in the United States supported a federal Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages.Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, Orthodox Response to Same-Sex Marriage, NY Jewish Week (Mar. 26, 2004), (visited January 20, 2008); Rabbinical Council of America, Joining with Three Other Orthodox Organizations, RCA Opposes Redefinition of Marriage in New York State (June 21, 2007) http://www.rabbis.org/news/index.cfm?type=policies (visited January 20, 2008). However, it is important to note that recent research by Chana Etengoff & Colette Daiute suggest that positive reconciliations between sexual minority individuals and Orthodox Jewish family members is possible (a process referred to as theistic mediation),Etengoff, C. & Daiute, C. (2014). Family Members’ Uses of Religion in Post–Coming-Out Conflicts With Their Gay Relative. Psychology of Religion and Spirituality. 6(1), 33-43. doi: 10.1037/a0035198 both with and without clinical support.Etengoff, C. & Daiute, C., (2015). Clinicians’ perspectives of religious families’ and gay men’s negotiation of sexual orientation disclosure and prejudice, Journal of Homosexuality, 62(3), 394-426. doi: 10.1080/00918369.2014.977115 =Theravada Buddhists= Thai Theravada Buddhists (over 150 million members), being the more conservative wing of Buddhism are less supportive of gay rights and marriages. Human rights issues have received poor attention in Theravada countries, as the culture is rooted in the belief in the Law of Karma, which is more popular among Thai Buddhists than philosophical and advanced scriptural studies in Buddhism. Many monasteries and monks advocate their lay followers to see the world through the lens of karma, i.e., every person is born to pay back their sins. According to their explanations, all homosexuals and sexual deviants were once offenders of the Third Precept (prohibiting sexual misconduct) - at least in their past lives, and they must pay off their past sins in their present life. Therefore, they deserve all that society gives to them. This belief system creates strong conservative values in Theravada Buddhist culture. For these reasons, it is unlikely that Buddhists will easily approve a law to allow gay marriage. Gay and lesbian activists in Thailand will probably not be as successful as their fellows in European countries or Canada.Mettanando Bhikkhu (July 13, 2005). Religion and Same-Sex Marriage. The Buddhist Channel: Bringing Buddha Dharma Home - Issues. The Bangkok Post It is important to note, however, that Theravada Buddhists outside of the South-East Asian Area, are generally more supportive, or neutral, to same-sex marriage, and LGBT rights as a whole. =Islam= Freedom of religion  One source of controversy is how same-sex marriage affects freedom of religion. There is concern that religious communities might not be legally able to decide what type of marriages to solemnize. Some same- sex married couples have challenged religious organizations that exclude them from access to public facilities maintained by those organizations, such as schools, health care centers, social service agencies, summer camps, homeless shelters, nursing homes, orphanages, retreat houses, community centers, and athletic programs. Opponents of same-sex marriage have expressed concerns that this limits their religious freedoms. For example, conservatives worry that a Christian college would risk its tax-exempt status by refusing to admit a legally married gay couple to married-student housing. Some legal analysts suggest that failure to reflect gay rights within their organizations may cost some religious groups their tax-exempt status. In addition, religious opponents of same-sex marriage express concern about several specific instances in which they contend that religious freedoms have been abridged due to legal recognition of same-sex unions, including (a) an incident in Canada (which is subject to a different set of laws concerning same-sex marriage than the United States), in which the Knights of Columbus were sued for declining to allow a same-sex wedding reception on their property; (b) removal of real property tax exemption from a New Jersey Christian organization that did not allow a civil union ceremony to be performed on their property; (c) requirements that judges and justices of the peace perform same-sex wedding ceremonies; and (d) the forced closing of Catholic adoption agencies which refused to place children in the homes of married same-sex partners. There is also a concern that religious people might be marginalized for their beliefs about marriage. Opponents point to the way Carrie Prejean was treated during the Miss USA 2009 controversy. There are also concerns about violence and intimidation against religious people. After a vote to make same-sex marriage illegal in California, same-sex marriage supporters published names of donors to the bill and classified them based on religion and many religious symbols were targeted. Elder Dallin H. Oaks of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, likened the attacks against religious people to voter intimidation against black people during the American civil rights movement. Some governments have made special provisions for religious protections within the texts of same-sex marriage laws. Americans United for Separation of Church and State argue that by defining marriage as an opposite-sex institution, the state infringes upon the constitutional right to freedom of religion. In this view, religious groups that do wish to celebrate same-sex marriages are discriminated against when government policies do not permit their religious groups to celebrate marriages as they see fit.

At the time the vast majority of primary schools were National schools, which had religious patrons. Support for such a school came from Jack Lynch, then head of Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and some members of Fine Gael. However the then-minister for education, Richard Burke was not sympathetic. During the years 1975-78, the project members were involved in extensive correspondence with the Department of Education and other bodies in order to prove the need for the school. The school opened in 1978 with 90 pupils, largely due to the support of the then newly elected Fianna Fáil government, with Florence Armstrong as the principle. Opposition came from a group calling itself Council for Social Concern and some but some also came from obstructing of planning permission according to Michael Johnston, who was chairman of the project.Educate Together now country's fastest growing educational movement, Irish Independent, 17 September 2008, retrieved 9 February 2009 The school operated from various temporary premises until a dedicated school building was opened in 1983.

The schemes use radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology and a national database to trace animals from birth to either slaughter or live export.  History  NAIT was introduced by the National Animal Identification and Tracing Act 2012 which replaced the Animal Identification Act 1993. NAIT can refer to the Act, the company of the same name created by the Act, the schemes for cattle and deer or identification devices and identifiers issued under the schemes. On 1 July 2013 the NAIT company merged with Animal Health Board to become OSPRI New Zealand. The investigation into the 2017 Mycoplasma bovis outbreak indicated that farmers were not being fully compliant, e.g. with the \\"cash sale\\" of bobby calves, although there has only been one conviction under the act (resulting in a $150 fine) A 2018 law change \\"under urgency\\" gave the ministry extra powers to enforce the act. Opposition Federated Farmers, a farmers membership organisation, oppose the NAIT system saying that it will impose extra costs on farmers and will not result in any benefits. Farmers also fear that the NAIT scheme will be used to impose a greenhouse gas emissions tax under an emissions trading scheme. A Federated Farmers survey found that 2% supported NAIT and 80% opposed it. A NAIT working group claimed that there would be on-farm benefits.

The term \\"listed building\\", in the United Kingdom, refers to a building or structure designated as being of special architectural, historical, or cultural significance. Details of all the listed buildings are contained in the National Heritage List for England. They are categorised in three grades: Grade I consists of buildings of outstanding architectural or historical interest, Grade II* includes significant buildings of more than local interest and Grade II consists of buildings of special architectural or historical interest. Buildings in England are listed by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on recommendations provided by English Heritage, which also determines the grading. Some listed buildings are looked after by the National Trust or English Heritage while others are in private ownership or administered by trusts. There are over 5000 listed structures in Lancashire. Although most structures on the lists are buildings, other structures such as bridges, monuments, sculptures, war memorials, milestones and mileposts or telephone kiosks may be listed. In Lancashire 70 structures are classified as Grade I (buildings of outstanding architectural or historic interest) and 256 are classified as Grade II* (particularly significant buildings of more than local interest).

Massachusetts, ancestor of 'Quaker Joe' Leavitt, pacifist settler of Turner, Maine Private Joseph Leavitt (1757–1839) was an early settler of Maine, who moved to what was then the frontier of Massachusetts after serving three months in the Continental Army at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, and then declaring that he was unable to bear arms in conflict. The conscientious objector declared that he would move to Maine and survey lands for grants to former soldiers. On account of his pacifist sentiments, 'Quaker Joe,' as he became known for the rest of his life, was awarded with a house lot next to the new Turner meetinghouse when it was eventually built.  Early life in Massachusetts Joseph Leavitt was born in 1757 in Pembroke, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, the son of Jacob Leavitt and his wife Sylvia (Bonney) Leavitt. The family originated at Hingham, some 17 miles away, in the seventeenth century when English settler deacon John Leavitt removed there from Boston.Joseph Leavitt was descended from Israel Leavitt, English emigrant John Leavitt's son by his wife Sarah Gilman, daughter of Edward Gilman Sr., first of Hingham, and later of Exeter, New Hampshire. Israel Leavitt's wife, great-great-grandmother of settler Joseph Leavitt of Maine was Lydia Jackson of Plymouth, Massachusetts. Joseph Leavitt, great-great-grandson of patriarch John, was the son of a modest farmer in Pembroke. At the outbreak of hostilities in the American Revolutionary War in 1775, Joseph Leavitt enlisted as Private in the Continental Army for an initial three-month period of service. Leavitt was involved in some of the earliest skirmishes of the War, when he helped fight British forces during the Siege of Boston in 1775. At the conclusion of his service in the earliest phase of the Revolutionary War, Leavitt declared himself unable to fight any longer. \\"Some must stay at home and raise bread,\\" Leavitt was recorded as saying. While others did the fighting, Leavitt said he would instead \\"raise bread for them.\\"  A new life in the woods Shortly afterwards, Leavitt decamped for the new township of Sylvester in what was still the state of Massachusetts.Sylvester Town had been granted by the State of Massachusetts in 1765 to the heirs of Capt. Joseph Sylvester and his Company rendered in the Battle of Quebec in 1690, and in lieu of a previous land grant in New Hampshire. The township of Sylvester subsequently changed its name to Turner to honor Rev. Charles Turner, the town's first minister, who came from Scituate, Massachusetts. By 1780 the township had a population of 132. He accompanied the surveyors paid by the government to lay out new townships along the Androscoggin River. As an assistant to the surveyors, Leavitt noted the topography, and told the surveyors that after returning to his Massachusetts home, he would be back to settle permanently at the place that later became the new township of Turner. The surveyors, noting Leavitt's pacifist tendencies, told him half-jokingly, \\"Well, Joe, you will like to go to meeting, so we will give you a lot next to the meeting-house lot.\\" The next year, the young surveyors' assistant Leavitt returned alone from Massachusetts to the place he had chosen. Leavitt carried his scant provisions with him on his back. The closest non-Native inhabitant was 20 miles distant. Leavitt's relations with the native Algonquian tribe were apparently warm. That spring and summer Leavitt wielded an axe to cut a clearing, on which he built a blockhouse, the first house in the new township of Turner. In the fall Leavitt returned to Pembroke, the home of most settlers of Turner. The following year, and after the heavy Maine winter, Leavitt returned to his blockhouse in the wilderness and planted a crop. Shortly afterwards he journeyed by foot to New Gloucester, Maine, where he purchased 19 apple tree seedlings. Carrying them on his shoulders, Leavitt returned to his outpost in the Maine woods, where he planted his orchard. Later that same year Leavitt left his meager belongings in the care of Algonquins and returned again to Pembroke, where he married Anna Stevens. On the return trip to his new lands, Leavitt's new wife Anna rode behind him on his horse, with her belongings and portmanteaux stuffed into saddlebags on accompanying pack horses, a journey that took several weeks through the Province of Massachusetts, as Maine was then known.  Later years and Maine legacy Leavitt and his wife continued to live in Turner, as the new town became known.Joseph Leavitt's descendants have continued to reside in Turner since its founding. Today's Leavitt Area High School in Turner derives its name from the family. Eventually the former soldier and pacifist opened a public house, and he was chosen to represent the town in local and state councils. Leavitt's first wife Anna (Stevens) bore eight children, the oldest of whom was the first male child born in the new township of Turner. Leavitt subsequently married twice; to Hannah Chandler, with whom he had another two children; and as his third wife Elsea Caswell, with whom he had no children. Leavitt farm, Turner, ca. 1900 Ultimately Joseph Leavitt's father Jacob departed Pembroke, Massachusetts, and joined his son at his new Maine lodgings. Father Jacob died in 1814 at age 82; his wife Sylvia (Bonney) LeavittSylvia Bonney was born in Pembroke, Massachusetts, in 1733, the daughter of Ichabod Bonney and Elizabeth (Howland) Bonney. died in 1810. Frontiersman and former pacifist Joseph Leavitt, known by the cognomen 'Quaker Joe' Leavitt was a Congregationalist, and not a Quaker, but his pacifist sentiments gave rise to the nickname. for the rest of his life, died at age 83 in 1839. He is buried in Turner's Upper Street Cemetery, near his original house lot. Noted on his gravestone is his service, albeit brief, as a private in the American Revolutionary cause. Lying nearby is his father Jacob, whose own service as a Minuteman in the Continental Army is noted on his tombstone.  See also  *John Leavitt *Elisha Leavitt *L.

It is the story of a tough drill sergeant and his raw recruits, and was photographed by Zhang Yimou. Today, the film stands somewhat in the shadows to Chen Kaige's better-known works, including his directorial debut Yellow Earth and the Palme d'Or winning Farewell, My Concubine.  Background  The Big Parade is often seen as an exploration of the relationship of collectivism versus individualism.Zhou Xuelin (2007). Young Rebels in Contemporary Chinese Cinema. Hong Kong University Press, p. 73. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2009-01-02. At the time, however, some western critics, including the New York Times, took the film at face value, seeing it as propagandist and describing it as a \\"boot camp\\" film. The New York Times, in particular, derided the film as a \\"Recruiting Poster for Collective Action.\\" If critics felt that this was merely China's newest propaganda film, this was due in part to the heavy hand of the Chinese Film Bureau. Originally, Chen had not shot an actual parade to conclude his film, only obscure silhouettes of soldiers against a sunset, an artistic decision that shocked \\"both army and censors.\\" Even forcing the director to insert more traditional imagery, censors nevertheless withdrew the film from the 1987 Cannes Film Festival without explanation. Despite its apparent support of collectivism, some scholars have noted a more ambiguous subtext to the film, suggesting that the film's imagery is less simplistic than such early reviews suggested. As one scholar writes, Chen explores the relationship between the collective and the individual, but wants to leave the relationship ambiguous. Another Chinese film scholar, Zhang Yingjin, also sees a subtext of criticism of the Chinese notion of its own nationhood, even as the film's rhetoric veers towards the propagandist.Zhang Yingjin (1997), \\"From 'Minority Film' to 'Minority Discourse': Questions of Nationhood and Ethnicity in Chinese Cinema\\" in Transnational Chinese Cinemas: Identity, Nationhood, Gender. University of Hawaii Press, p. 94. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2009-01-02.  Cinematography  One aspect of the film that is not in dispute, however, is Zhang Yimou's photography. The New York Times wrote upon the film's American screening in 1988 that it was \\"[Zhang's] photography that lifts The Big Parade out of the rudely fashioned trench of its story.\\" Zhang would go on to become a major film director himself, directing his debut, Red Sorghum, in 1987.

Its score and book are closely adapted from the music and screenplay of the 1970 musical film Scrooge starring Albert Finney and Charles Dickens' 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. Bricusse was nominated for an Academy Award for the song score he wrote for the film, and most of those songs were carried over to the musical. Synopsis Act One = The musical opens with the company singing a Christmas carol medley as the city of London begins to reminisce over the coming of Christmas (\\"Sing A Christmas Carol\\"). Meanwhile, Scrooge and his clerk Bob Cratchit are visited by Scrooge's nephew Harry, who in contrast to his uncle, is excited for Christmas and deplores how he is making Cratchit still work at 7pm on Christmas Eve. Scrooge asks him to leave. After work, Bob Cratchit, his disabled son Tiny Tim and his daughter Kathy go Christmas shopping on the streets of London (\\"Christmas Children\\"). Later, Scrooge walks around London, demanding the money that is owed to him by the businesspeople of London, and we learn of Scrooge's negative reputation throughout the people of London, especially soup caterer Tom Jenkins, who leads the angry crowd in despise of Scrooge (\\"Father Christmas\\"/\\"I Hate People\\"). Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Jacob Marley, his business partner who has been dead for the past seven years, who tells Scrooge to (\\"Make The Most Of This World\\") or else the afterlife will be bad for him. He informs Scrooge that he is to be visited by three spirits at 1am, 2am and 3am respectively. Marley also explains the significance of a chain he is wearing - the chain has been built up of sins in life. As Marley leaves, Scrooge is angry at the thought that he is in the wrong for hating Christmas (\\"It's Not My Fault\\"). He is visited by the first spirit - the Ghost of Christmas Past - who takes Scrooge back to when he was a small boy who preferred not to take part in Christmas activities and carols (\\"Sing a Christmas Carol (Reprise)\\"). The child Ebenezer is visited by his sister Jenny, who takes Ebenezer, who is reluctant to go home to his father due to a troubled relationship, back home. Scrooge is confused as to why the visions are not communicating with him, to which the ghost replies that these are shadows of the things that have been. Scrooge is then taken forward to his teenage years, to a party held by his then boss, Mr. Fezziwig (\\"December the 25th\\"). Scrooge reminisces of his relationship with Fezziwig's daughter, Isabel (\\"Happiness\\"), but we learn that she eventually leaves Scrooge as she feels their love has been negated by his desire for wealth. Scrooge and Young Ebenezer reflect on the situation (\\"You...You\\"). The Ghost of Christmas Past reveals to Scrooge that she is the ghost of his sister Jenny, who died young. She tells a heartbroken Scrooge to (\\"Love While You Can\\") before leaving him in a state of anguish (\\"It's Not My Fault (Reprise)\\"). As the bell tolls 2, Scrooge is visited by the next ghost, the Ghost of Christmas Present. He tells Scrooge that he is part of a group of brothers who, each year, send one down to Earth to spread the joy of Christmas - and this year is his turn. He is appalled by Scrooge and teaches him to find the joy in living (\\"I Like Life\\"). = Act Two = Scrooge is taken by the Ghost of Christmas Present to Bob Cratchit and his family, who are preparing for Christmas (\\"Good Times\\") and listening to Tiny Tim sing (\\"The Beautiful Day\\"), while Scrooge wonders if the ill Tiny Tim will survive. Scrooge is then taken to his son Harry's Christmas party, where he learns that a tradition at the party has become to drink to the health of Scrooge, as well as playing a singing game called (\\"The Minister's Cat\\"). Because the song was often sung at Fezziwig's parties, Scrooge is again reminded of his failed relationship with Isabel (\\"Happiness (Reprise)\\"). As the Ghost of Christmas Present leaves, Scrooge wonders if he can truly find (\\"A Better Life\\") to live. Finally, Scrooge is visited by the mute Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who silently communicates via pointing in the direction he wants Scrooge to travel. First, they visit Tom Jenkins and a chorus of people who owed Scrooge money, who are all singing about an unusually generous thing that Scrooge has done that has made them all thankful to him. Unbeknown to Scrooge, they are actually celebrating his death, yet Scrooge is oblivious (\\"Thank You Very Much\\"). The uplifted Scrooge is now taken to the Cratchit household, which is sitting in silence, with the absence of Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim. The ghost takes Scrooge to a graveyard, where Bob is mourning the death of Tiny Tim and reciting the song he sung the Christmas before (\\"The Beautiful Day (Reprise)\\"). It is then revealed that Scrooge is buried in the same graveyard, and Scrooge realises his own imminent demise with shock. He is visited again by Jacob Marley, who reveals that Scrooge has gone to Hell, and Lucifier has appointed Scrooge as his personal assistant, before revealing Scrooge's chain, that was so big that it was not immediately ready for his arrival to Hell. Scrooge is mortified as he is dragged away by demons. To his shock, Scrooge wakes up in his bedroom on Christmas Day - still alive and not in Hell. He is grateful and vows to change his ways in the time he has left (\\"I'll Begin Again\\"). He begins going around London, forgiving people of their debts and giving out Christmas presents while dressed up as Father Christmas. Everyone in London who was previously against Scrooge is now massively grateful to him for changing his ways (\\"Finale\\"). Scrooge reinstates his vow to celebrate Christmas and be kind to people (\\"I'll Begin Again (Reprise)\\") before a reprise of Thank You Very Much is sung during the bows (\\"Curtain Call\\"/\\"Thank You Very Much (Reprise)\\"). Productions UK and Ireland productions = Original Producer, Graham Mulvein and Leslie Bricusse spent several months with the director Bob Tomson adapting the screenplay for the stage. Mulvein recommended appointing Musical Supervisor, Stuart Pedlar, designer, Paul Farnsworth, and Lighting Designer, Hugh Vanstone, to the team and established a Victorian theatre style for all the locations, illusions and characters. Initially the ghost illusions were entrusted to Paul Daniels, but he was replaced after the first production with Paul Kieve. The original production starred Anthony Newley as Scrooge and opened on 9 November 1992 at the Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham. The cast also included Stratford Johns, Tom Watt and Jon Pertwee. The production later transferred to the West End, Tomson having been replaced by director/choreographer, Tudor Davies, starring Newley, at the Dominion Theatre from 12 November 1996 to 1 February 1997. Bill Kenwright produced a remount of the original production which toured the UK and Ireland for the Christmas seasons between 2003 and 2013 starring Tommy Steele in the title role (with the exceptions of Shane Richie in the 2005 and 2007 tours and Michael Barrymore in the 2006 tour. The show was on hiatus for the 2008 Christmas season). The production transferred into the West End starring Steele for the 2005 (while Richie toured an identical production) and 2012 Christmas seasons at the London Palladium, making Steele the record- holder for the most performances headlined at the Palladium. A brand new production will be presented at the Curve Theatre in Leicester from 18 November 2017 to 14 January 2018, directed by Curve artistic director Nikolai Foster for the musical's 25th anniversary. It will also be produced by Michael Harrison and David Ian and is expected to tour the UK in the Christmas 2018 season.  Radio production  On 21 January 1995, BBC Radio 2 broadcast the complete musical live from the Palace Theatre in Manchester. The production was directed by Tudor Davies, with Anthony Newley as \\"Scrooge\\", Stratford Johns as \\"Ghost of Christmas Present\\", Barry Howard as \\"Jacob Marley\\", Felicity Soper as \\"Ghost of Christmas Past\\", Paul Robinson as \\"Tom Jenkins\\" and David Howe as \\"Bob Cratchit\\".https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/863de24420514c77828da9a69845cbd2 = Australian production = After premiering in Birmingham, Producer, Graham Mulvein co-produced the original UK production in Australia, with Producer, David Mariner, featuring Keith Michell, Max Gillies, Tony Taylor and William Zappa, ran from November 1993 to January 1994 at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne.https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/20791 = U.S. productions = The American premiere opened on 26 October 2004 at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre in Chicago.

Fleming originated the production at Spring Lake and has staged the production at the Premier Theatre Co since its founding in 1987. Another production of the show has been performed since 1982 by The Players Of Utica, located in Utica, New York. Director Peter Loftus has been the only director for the show during the entire run, which celebrated its 30th year in 2012. The production has become an annual community event during the holidays, in terms of both audiences and casts. The 2012 cast was one of the largest of its 30-year run, with over 250 members. The show regularly does a community performance for local schools and senior programs. Turnout for this annual performance has exceeded 1,500 students from area schools. = Japanese production = In 1994, Mulvein co-produced the Japanese premiere with Himawari Theatre Group of Japan.

Its aim is to advance the science and application of space safety. IAASS was legally established on April 16, 2004 in the Netherlands. It became a member of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) in October 2004. The IAASS is based on the intellectual interaction of individual members who together shape the technical vision of the association, and make the association services available to stakeholders (on a non-profit basis). In June 2006, former US Senator John Glenn and first American to orbit became an Honorary Member. In June 2010, IAASS was granted the Observer status at the United Nations COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space). The association counts more than 200 professional members from 25 countries, 55% of the members are from industry, while the remaining 45% come from space agencies, governmental institutions and academia. A 2005 report by the Space and Advanced Communications Research Institute (SACRI) of George Washington University, titled Space Safety Report: Vulnerabilities and Risk Reduction In U.S. Human Space Flight Programs suggested that the newly formed IAASS might help improve the safety of the International Space Station (ISS). It also recommended NASA work with the IAASS to develop safety standards and advancement of space debris minimization and control. The first IAASS conference was held in Nice, France in October 2005. The European Space Agency sponsored the second IAASS Conference \\"Space Safety in a Global World\\" in May 2007 in Chicago. The third conference was held 21–23 October 2008 in Rome, Italy. The fourth conference was held 19–21 May in Huntsville, USA. The fifth conference was held 17–19 October 2011 in Versailles, France, and the 6th conference 21–23 May 2013 in Montreal, Canada. Space Safety Space safety is defined as freedom from man-made or natural harmful conditions. Harmful conditions are defined as those conditions that can cause death, injury, illness, damage to or loss of systems, facilities, equipment or property, or damage to the environment. This definition of space safety includes human on board, personnel directly involved in system integration and operation, personnel not directly involved but co-located, as well as general public. For unmanned systems such as robotic satellites, damages due to non-malicious external causes that translates into degradation or loss of mission objectives is also included in the definition of safety. For example, unwanted collision of a satellite with another satellite, or with a space debris. Fig.1 shows the various fields of space safety, their national, international or global scope of interest, and the principal means for achieving safety (by design, or operations), although a mixture would be generally used. What Space Safety involves Although safety refers to threats that are non-voluntary in nature (design errors, malfunctions, human errors, etc.), security refers to threats which are voluntary (i.e. of aggressive nature such as use of anti-satellite weapons). In some languages a single term is used for both, which may sometimes be confusing. Absolute freedom from harmful conditions is impossible to achieve. To be absolutely safe a system, product, device, material or environment should never cause or have the potential to cause an accident. In the realization and operation of systems the term safety is generally used to mean acceptable risk level, not absolute safety. Acceptable risk level is not the same as personal acceptance of risk, but it refers to risk acceptability by stakeholders’ community or by society in a broad sense. Acceptable risk levels vary from system to system, and evolve with time due to socio-economic changes and technological advancement. Implementing proven best-practices at status- of-art is a prerequisite for achieving an acceptable risk level, or in other words to make a system safe. Best-practices are traditionally established by government regulations and norms, and/or by industrial standards. Without such reference the term safety, or acceptable risk, becomes meaningless. In other words, compliance with regulations, norms and standards represents the safety yardstick of a system. Journal of Space Safety Engineering The Journal of Space Safety Engineering (JSSE) is a quarterly publication of the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS). JSSE serves applied scientists, engineers, policy makers and safety advocates with a platform to develop, promote and coordinate the science, technology and practice of space safety. The journal has a distinguished Editorial Board with extensive qualifications, ensuring that the journal maintains high scientific and technical standards and has a broad international coverage. Space Safety Magazine The Space Safety Magazine (SSM) is a quarterly print magazine and a daily news website, jointly published by the International Association for Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS) and the International Space Safety Foundation (ISSF). Space Safety Magazine is focused on safety related issues affecting space as well as safety on Earth from space events and objects.

Born in Kansas City, Gargotta joined the criminal organization of boss John Lazia as a young man. Gargotta and his close associate, Charles Binaggio built a gambling ring that grossed as much as $34,500,000 a year on dice and card games, numbers racket, and bookmaking. Gargotta was arrested more than 40 times over a 30-year period for murder, illegal gambling, liquor law violations, carrying a concealed weapon, robbery, auto theft, extortion, attempted burglary, and vagrancy. However, due to Gargotta's political influence, all of these charges were eventually dropped. In 1933, Lazia's control over organized crime in Kansas City was challenged by Joe Lusco and Ferris Anthon, two other Kansas City mobsters. Lazia tasked Gargotta and several other mob associates to kill Anthon. On August 12, 1933, the gunmen shot Anthon as he was entering his apartment building in Kansas City. However, county sheriff Tom Bash and a deputy came upon the scene, and opened fire. Two of Lazia's men were killed and one escaped. During the firefight, Gargotta leaped from the car, emptied a Colt .45 automatic at Bash, and then surrendered, yelling, \\"Don't shoot me – Don’t shoot me!\\" In 1935, Gargotta was indicted for the 1933 attempted murder of Bash. However, Gargotta had strong allies in the law enforcement and legal community. The court granted 29 continuances before the case finally came to trial. Kansas City police officers switched the evidence tags on several guns recovered at the scene so as to shed doubt on the question of who held the murder weapon. Testimony of sheriff Bash and a ballistics expert placed the murder weapon securely in Gargotta's hands, but the jury had been bribed. Gargotta was acquitted of the homicide charge and convicted of the illegal possession of a gun, sentenced to a minimum term, and released promptly. Eventually, over the protest of the police department, the Governor of Missouri pardoned Gargotta. The police officer who changed the evidence tags was eventually convicted of perjury and sent to jail. On April 5, 1950, Binaggio and Gargotta drove to the Jackson County, Missouri Democratic Club in Kansas City to meet a trusted associate. A taxi driver later discovered the bodies in the club, each with four bullet wounds to the head. Gargotta was sprawled on the floor near the door, under a large portrait of then-president Harry S. Truman. In February 1950, Gargotta had testified before a federal grand jury in Kansas City about his criminal activities. Underworld outrage over Gargotta's testimony may have led to his assassination. Another theory is that the Mafia Commission in New York ordered Binaggio's murder because he had failed to keep promises to the Commission. The two murders were never solved. However, the high-profile murders of Gargotta and Binaggio, along with their subversion of the criminal justice system, created public pressure on President Harry Truman to support a congressional investigation into organized crime. This resulted in the famous Kefauver Commission hearings in the U.S. Senate, named after Senator Estes Kefauver. During these hearings, Kefauver made the following observation: > If ever a human being deserved the title of \\"Mad Dog\\" it was Gargotta.

Witnesses said over 200 Palestinians were praying inside at that time. At least 16 people, including six children were killed, and more than 60 wounded.Israeli troops enter Gaza Strip BBC News. 2009-01-03 The mosque, located in the town of Beit Lahiya in the Gaza Strip, is named after a founder of Hamas \\"Ibrahim al-Makadmeh\\" who was killed by the Israelis in 2004. Israel has accused Hamas of using mosques to hide weapons and ammunition. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit published videos showing secondary explosions that occurred after they had targeted mosques with missiles, alleging these were caused by the weapons and ammunition hidden inside of them. In July 2009, the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a report stating that, \\"the IDF inquiry revealed that the mosque was not attacked at all.\\" The report also stated that \\"the individuals reported as killed in this incident were in fact killed in other incidents not involving the mosque. Further, the supposed 'civilians' who were casualties of the attack were in fact Hamas operatives killed while fighting against the IDF.\\" It was also noted that IDF rules of engagement \\"expressly forbid attacks directed against sacred places, unless they are used for military purposes.\\" The report of the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (aka Goldstone report) stated that the Israelis intentionally bombed the al-Maqadmah mosque on the outskirts of Jabilyah when between 200 and 300 men and women attended for their evening prayer, with fifteen people dying. Goldstone has said, \\"Assuming that weapons were stored in the mosque, it would not be a war crime to bomb it at night... It would be a war crime to bomb it during the day when 350 people are praying\\". Judge Goldstone has referred to the incident as a case where there is no other possible interpretation for what could have occurred other than a deliberate targeting of civilians. The report concluded that the al-Maqadma mosque was hit during evening prayers by an Israeli missile, killing at least 15 people and injuring 40 others. The report noted that there was no evidence that the mosque has been used to store weapons or that it was being used by Palestinian militants at the time. The report further described response of the Israeli Government, alleging that the mosque was not attacked at all, as \\"unsatisfactory and demonstrably false\\". Researcher of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA) colonel (res.) Halevi asserted that in the course of the inquiry the commission did not consider other possibilities, such as a drone strike aimed at a group of militants nearby that could be supported by the fact that the blast hit just outside the mosque. He also stated that \\"[a]n examination of freely accessible Palestinian sources shows that the casualties in this incident were terrorist operatives\\", specifically naming 7 out of the 15 dead.Analysis: Blocking the truth behind the Gaza war , JPost, September 22, 2009Blocking the Truth of the Gaza War, JCPA, September 18, 2009. Accessed 2009-09-23. Archived 2009-09-26. According to witness statements, between 200 and 300 people were worshipping in the mosque when the attack took place. First hand investigation by Judge Goldstone's team revealed evidence of significant shrapnel damage within the mosque. The report also says that the mosque had unexpectedly combined its sunset and evening prayers on the day of the incident, and it is possible that this detail was not known to the IDF at the moment of the strike, added Halevi. According to a 2010 report by the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, following investigations carried out by Israel into allegations of misconduct and violations of the Law of Armed Conflict by the Israel Defense Forces, \\"an IDF officer was severely reprimanded and two other officers were sanctioned for failing to exercise appropriate judgment during an incident that resulted in civilian casualties in the Al-Maqadmah mosque\\".

In Tamil poetics, thinnais (Tamil: திணை tiṇai \\"genre\\", \\"type\\") is a type of poetical mode or theme. A thinai consists of a complete poetical landscape - a definite time, place, season in which the poem is set - and background elements characteristic of that landscape - including flora and fauna, inhabitants, deities and social organisation. These collectively provide imagery for extended poetic metaphors (\\"ullurai\\", literally \\"inner meaning\\"), which set the mood of the poem. Classical authors recognised two broad categories of thinais. Akam thinais (literally, \\"the inner genre\\") consisted of modes used in love poetry, associated with specific aspects of a relationship or specific stages in the development of a relationship. Puram thinais (literally, \\"the outer genre\\") consisted of modes that corresponded closely to the akam modes, but were used in heroic, philosophical and moral poetry, to describe the stages of a battle or particular patterns of thought. Later commentators added further categories, such as akappuram, which consisted of modes that mixed elements of akam and puram poetry, and purappuram, which consisted of modes used for peripheral puram themes. The five tinais were kurinji (hilly/mountain region), palai ( parched/dry lands), mullai (pastoral tract), marutam (wet/ agricultural lands) and neital (coastal area).

The system uses Radiofrequency Identification Devices (RFID) applied as ear tags to identify and track livestock, each assigned an individual and unique electronic and physical printed tag numbers. There is an associated central electronic database which is used to record each animal’s residency and keep track of the other animals it has interacted with. The system improves food safety, acts as a market export assurance program which improves Australia's access to foreign export markets, and assists with disease control, tracing and management. Farmers must register their property with their local jurisdictional government if they hold one or more heads of livestock. Livestock includes cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, camels, deer, alpacas, llamas, horses and poultry; although State and Territory definitions of \\"livestock\\" may differ. NLIS does not confirm ownership of livestock.

De la Concha was born in Seville and came to the New World in 1568. He was an active painter from 1575 to 1612 and his work is preserved in several Mexican cathedrals, including the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral.  Artwork  In 1587 the Sevillian artist Andrés de la Concha, who also created retablos for the grand Oaxacan missions of Yanhuitlan, Coixtlahuaca and Teposcolula, entered into a contract with the town of Tamazulapan to fabricate and decorate a main retablo for the new church, at the then princely sum of 2000 pesos. Little now survives of the 16th-century altarpiece. As at Yanhuitlan and Coixtlahuaca, the original retablo was later enlarged and reframed, at Tamazulapan in a rich baroque style replete with intricately carved spiral columns and decorative shell niches containing many new paintings and sculptures. This splendid gilded retablo, which rises in four main tiers and spans seven vertical divisions (calles) in a dynamic, screen-like format, has been fully restored and reassembled to once again dominate the east end of the church.  The Paintings  Although the later addition and misplacement of the artworks has made the original iconography and artistic attribution uncertain, it is believed that four of the ten original paintings contracted for by De la Concha still remain in the present retablo, together with one or two early statues of the Apostles. The four large canvases attributed to De la Concha are located in the outer calles of the retablo and comprise: 1) The Adoration of the Magi; 2) The Adoration of the Shepherds - the juxtaposition of these two themes or scenes was especially favored in the Americas; 3) The Annunciation; and 4) The Presentation at the Temple, or Circumcision. This last work repeats a theme seen in Andrés de la Concha's work at Yanhuitlan and bears some similarity to the composition and palette used at nearby Coixtlahuaca - a style that might be described as Italian Mannerism with a mellow Andalusian flavor.http://www.west.net/~rperry/Oaxaca/tam.htm References Category:16th-century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters Category:17th-century Spanish painters ","title":"Andrés de la Concha"},{"id":"20941993","text":"Christer Flodin (born September 1, 1948 in Stockholm) is a Swedish television actor, best known for his appearances in crime drama series.

The Company employed over 4,000 in Northern Ontario, starting in 1924 as a pulp mill at Fort William, Ontario (now Thunder Bay, Ontario Canada). Great Lakes had a highly developed social network within the company, including a children's Christmas party held at a local arena, and an annual picnic held at a local park, as well as many sports teams and other social groups. The company's working environment was enhanced by cultural diversity. For example under the Government of Canada's immigration policy, the \\"Close Relatives Scheme\\" resulted in over 400 Ukrainian refugees being employed as workers after World War II. Great Lakes fell victim to trends in the pulp and paper industry in Northern Ontario over the past 15–20 years. Factors in the decline of Great Lakes and the pulp and paper industry in general included trends in advertising, electronic data transmission and storage and the Internet, all of which continue to have adverse effects on traditional print media. Newspaper, magazine and catalog publishing customers increasingly use other forms of media and advertising and electronic data transmission and storage, including television and the Internet, instead of paper products. North American newsprint demand has been in decline for several (annual declines of 5.6% in 2005, 6.1% in 2006, 10.3% in 2007, 11.2% in 2008 and 25.3% in 2009). Forecasts indicate that these declines in newsprint demand could continue for several years. As well, negative impacts on the survival of the Company included increases in global newsprint capacity, particularly in China and Europe, which resulted in lower prices, volumes or both for the Canadian industry's exported products. The relationship between industry supply and demand for forest products, rather than changes in the cost of raw materials, determines the industry’s ability to increase prices. Consequently, the industry has been unable to pass along increases in operating costs to its customers. The major factors contributing to the ultimate merger and demise of the Company are: • Energy prices, particularly for electricity, natural gas and fuel oil, which have been volatile in recent years. • Wood fiber costs—wood fiber is the principal raw material used in the business. The primary source for wood fiber is timber. Environmental litigation and regulatory developments have caused significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in Canada. The Province of Ontario has been reluctant to approve new cutting rights pursuant to the Company’s forest licenses and forest management agreements. Legislation and litigation advanced by Aboriginal groups and litigation concerning the use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest biodiversity and the response to and prevention of catastrophic wildfires have also affected timber supplies. Control of the Great Lakes Paper, a long-standing publicly owned company changed over the years and in 1974 was acquired by Canadian Pacific Limited (\\"CP\\"). CP changed the Company's name to Great Lakes Forest Products. It was later amalgamated with Canadian International Paper Company becoming Canadian Pacific Forest Products and later spun off as Avenor. In 1998 the Company was acquired by Bowater becoming Bowater Forest Products. In 2007 Bowater and Abitibi- Consolidated merged forming AbitibiBowater. In 2009 the newsprint portion of the Thunder Bay plant was idled indefinitely leaving only one line of the kraft mill operating and forcing the layoffs of several hundred employees. On April 16, 2009, Bowater filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and underwent a restructuring. In February 2010, the largest remaining paper machine (#5) was restarted. In addition, the company renegotiated labor agreements; resized the workforce; rolled out a wage reduction across the woodlands operations; and renegotiated its power agreement. The combined changes resulted in a cash cost savings at the mill of over $150 per ton and AbitibiBowater believes Thunder Bay is now one of the lowest cash cost mills in the industry. AbitibiBowater emerged from creditor protection in 2010, and traded as an over-the-counter stock. It changed its name to Resolute Forest Products in late 2011 and now trades on the NYSE and the TSX.

The operation involved the Sheriff's Office in Iredell County, North Carolina, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). Detective Sergeant Robert Fromme made repeated observations of a group of men purchasing large quantities of cigarettes, often with $20,000 - $30,000 in cash. The joint counterterrorism operation ended the fundraising operation, resulting in the arrest, trial, and conviction of the cell members. The operation led to the creation of the North Carolina Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF).  Hezbollah operations  Hezbollah cell leader Mohamad Youssef Hammoud was denied a travel visa by the US embassy in Syria, after which he traveled to Venezuela.Cigarette smuggling case offers inside look at Hezbollah's presence in America - US News and World Report After purchasing a forged travel visa, arrived in New York City in 1992.https://www.fbi.gov/publications/leb/2007/dec2007/december2007leb.htm#page20 By 1995, Hammoud set up operations in Charlotte, North Carolina, working at a local pizza restaurant. At least two additional members of the Hezbollah Charlotte cell entered the United States with false travel visas from Venezuela purchased for $200, and three had travel visas issued in Cyprus. Half the cell members were born in Lebanon, and the other half were US-born, of Lebanese descent.BBC News  AMERICAS  Hezbollah suspects arrested Early in the spring of 1995, Detective Robert Fromme, working a second job at the tobacco wholesaler JR Discount (in Statesville, North Carolina) observed the cell purchasing massive quantities of cigarettes, paying for them in cash. The cash was usually carried in large grocery bags, containing as much as $20,000 to $30,000 at a time.  Surveillance  Detective Fromme continued to monitor the purchases for several months, and determined cell members were transporting the cigarette cartons across state lines, in violation of federal laws. Each of the four men Fromme was watching purchased 299 cartons of cigarettes, the legal limit permitted without filing legal paperwork. Cigarettes were moved from North Carolina to Tennessee and Virginia. Fromme notified John Lorick, of the Charlotte ATF. ATF officials informed Fromme that cigarette trafficking was likely an attempt to sell the merchandise for as much as twice the price in states such as Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania - which had considerably higher taxes on tobacco. North Carolina's tax on cigarettes was five cents, whereas it was seventy-five cents in Michigan at the time.http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa468.pdf The Hezbollah cell was selling the cigarettes through \\"front store\\" operations, and to local convenience stores in Dearborn, Michigan, with a price difference between North Carolina and Michigan ranging from $8.00 - $10.00 per carton. Each 680-mile cigarette smuggling trip to Michigan carried between 800 and 1,500 cartons of cigarettes, worth between $3,000 and $10,000. Some cell members fraudulently secured a $1.6 million loan from the federal government's Small Business Administration, which funded the opening of a gas station. The Iredell County Sheriff's Office signed a memorandum of understanding with the Charlotte ATF, permitting the formal collaboration between the two agencies. As a result, Detective Fromme was officially reassigned to the ATF. Additional federal agencies were assigned to the case, including the Diplomatic Security Service, and Immigration and Naturalization Service. The FBI, which had already been wiretapping communications of two of the cell members, apparently without the knowledge of local law enforcement, also participated in the joint operations. In all, sixteen law enforcement and intelligence services from state, local, and federal agencies contributed to the operation, including the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Surveillance was run from an empty storefront across from the JR Discount wholesaler building. The cell was secretly followed by a team of five vehicles, which took turns driving behind the cigarette smugglers. \\"As an extra precaution, the agents sometimes changed clothes and switched license plates during pit stops.\\"  Raid  The assembled joint task force penetrated the Hezbollah cell, developing more than ten informants from within the group, as well as from a pool of witnesses. Informants were gleaned from cell staff members, including drivers, smugglers, and even spouses. Simultaneous raids in North Carolina and Michigan at 6:00 a.m. on July 20, 2000 captured many cell members and accomplices. A total of 18 arrest warrants were executed.CNN Transcript - Breaking News: Federal and State Authorities in North Carolina Announce 'Operation Smokescreen' - July 21, 2000 The arrest of Said Muhammad Harb provided invaluable insights into the structure of the Hezbollah cell, its members, and operations.

The students from Woodside run a competition to name the new school and design the logo which was won by a student named Joey. The school was seen to be state of the art at the time with nearly every classroom having digital interactive whiteboards, PCs with internet connections and Wi-Fi across the building - enabling teachers to use registers that would update attendance records immediately. This was at a time when other schools in the borough were still trialing a small number of interactive whiteboards. The sports hall / gym on the first floor had sprung floorboards. It had lifts and a spiral ramp instead of stairs. On 1 January 2018 the school was relaunched as Royal Docks Academy, part of the BMAT multi academy trust.

EtymologyHistory The Catholic Church plays a conspicuous role in the day-to-day life of the fishermen of Thoothoor village. The conversion of the Hindu fishermen of this village may be traced back to A.D. 1544. The event cumulated in the works of St. Francis Xavier, who is said to have converted 10,000 Mukkuva fishermen living in thirteen villages along the coast (from Pallam to Poovar--Neerody, Marthandanthurai,Vallavilai, Eraviputhenthurai, Thoothoor, Poothurai, Thengapattanam, Enayam, Midalam, Vaniyakudy, Colachel, Kadiapattanam, Muttom and Pallam) in December 1544. In 1600, the Thoothoor Parish Church was brought under the Padroado. Subsequently, this Parish came under the Diocese of Cochin. In 1838, St. Thomas Church, Thoothoor and other adjacent coastal Churches from Pallithura to Erayumanthurai were brought under the Diocese of Varapuzha. This unification brought the Padroado-Propaganda dispute to a crucial stage. Ultimately St. Thomas Church, Thoothoor was brought under the Diocese of Cochin with its revival in 1850. The Diocese of Thiruvananthapuram was founded on 1 July 1937[1]. But only in 1952 were all the coastal Churches from Pallithura to Erayumanthurai added to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trivandrum or Thiruvananthapuram Diocese. Thu,s at present Thoothoor Parish Church is one of the Foranate Churches of Trivandrum Diocese. Geography Thoothoor is a coastal village is situated on the Arabian Sea coast. It is the headquarters of Thoothoor panchayat, consisting of five villages, namely Thoothoor, Chinnathurai, Eraviputhenthurai, Poothurai and Erayumanthurai. These five villages together are commonly just called Thoothooor. Thoothoor is geographically located in Vilavancode Taluk, Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu India. It is located 45 km west of Nagercoil, the headquarters of Kanyakumari District and 40 km southeast of Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala State. Thiruvananthapuram Airport is the nearest airport and the railway station is at Parassala or Kuzhithurai. Thoothoor is almost exclusively a fishing village, even though a little group of people are involved in agriculture, especially in coconut plantations, besides their primary occupation in other professions. The fishing operation in this village is most often restricted to a coastline the length of one- kilometer. Its total population is about 6,000. This village is bounded in the north by the A.V.M Canal [Anantha Victoria Marthanda], south by the Arabian Sea, east by Poothurai village and west by Chinnathurai village. But most of the people of this village are settled in the north of Thoothoor Panchayat up to a length of about 500 meters due to the danger of a tsunami. Recently the Tamil Nadu Government constructed a housing colony named St. Thomas Colony in this zone. Those who are settled in the above zone also consider themselves part and parcel of the village of Thoothoor. As per Government demarcation, this zone is part of Ezhudesam Town Panchayat. But this zone also merged with the village. DemographicsEconomy As of 2007, Thoothoor is the home of several significant economic sources. The main business is Shark catching, using modern equipments such as GPS and other Navigation tools. The average cost of one fishing boat is 30-60 lakhs in Indian currency. Fishermen usually go fishing in the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. Boat owners travel in and around Tamil Nadu state and neighboring states such as Kerala, and the more distant state of Maharashtra. Now a few boat owners have moved to the Andaman & Nicobar Islands for deep sea fishing. The sweat of our boat owners and fishermen working with them make wonders to their generation. Fisherman support their families by fishing and hence their families are able to afford higher education. Thus, just like modern cities most of the kids are getting higher education in a good atmosphere with a tremendous amount of good energy. The positive energy flows and flourishes in success's path on each and every Thoothoor native. The children should be very proud to have had such hard working ancestors and parents. The main road allows money to be exchanged from the shark business and shark merchandise, as well as some other fish on a small level. In terms of jobs, in Thoothoor there are a few main sectors, a large number of people from this place are working in their respective industries such as IT, manufacturing, education, educational management, the medical field, business management, mechanical engineering, marine engineering, electrical engineering, lawyers, etc. All such people are trained professionals, graduates, and a few PhD holders in mathematics, history, Tamil and physics. There are masters in IT professional, fish merchandise, teachers in education sectors and a few health services. A few hundred people are working in the Persian Gulf in countries such as UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, etc. A fewer number of people working are in the UK, the USA, Canada and New Zealand. The mechanical engineers and marine engineers work on international and local ships. Some MBAs are working at south Indian bank. Some marine engineers work in international ships in the deep sea. They travel to various countries. There are a few hundred natives of Thoothoor working in Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, and Thiruvananthapuram. The few people working locally work in small businesses and agriculture. Agriculture resources are: Transportation *Government buses *Taxi *Auto rickshaws *Private buses for traveling to distant cities such as Chennai, Madurai and Bangalore *The nearest train station is in Kuzhithurai, 10 km away *Thiruvananthapuram international airport is about 40 km Education Education plays a vital role in Thoothoor. The Government Primary School provides education to the poor. The private schools include: *St.Jude’s College, Thoothoor It is affiliated with Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli. *Pius XI Higher Secondary School, Thoothoor *Infant Jesus Matriculation School, managed by St. Jude’s College *Canossa Pre – Primary School, managed by Canossa Convent, now this school is managed by St. Judes College *Navajeevan English Medium school, Nithiravilai The above said educational institutions are providing educational service for the educational uplift of this village and neighbouring villages and towns. Religion The territory is a Catholic Christian community. This Region was converted to Christianity during Saint Thomas the Apostle Period. Thoothoor Ferone church was built by foreigners in about 1600 and renovated on 2010.

Biography De Laumoy was the son of a French infantry captain. He entered the French military engineering school in 1760. He was assigned to America in 1777 and on 17 November Laumoy was commissioned Colonel of Engineers; joining Washington's winter camp at Valley Forge. The French engineers, de Laumoy, Louis de la Radiere, and Louis Lebègue Duportail, provided knowledge of European fortifications and siege warfare. Laumoy was deployed to the southern operations area on 8 February 1779; advising Benjamin Lincoln at Charleston to surrender given the inadequate fortifications. He accordingly was taken prisoner at the Siege of Charleston (on 12 May 1780) and was exchanged on 26 November 1782. Laumoy was breveted Brigadier General on 30 September 1783, and honorably discharged from the army the following month. He returned to France in December 1783. On 4 July 1784 he was awarded the Order of Saint Louis, a distinction his father had also received. On 1 July 1785, Laumoy was made Aide maréchal général des logis at Saint-Domingue. Later, returning to France, he was Mestre de camp on 2 December 1787. For some months in 1788, he served on the army general staff. On 14 February 1789, he was second-in-command at Martinique, when the French suppressed a rebellion by island's large African slave and ex-slave population. As one of the hated administrators, Laumoy was obliged to return to France in May 1790. For a while, Laumoy held a number of staff posts in the French Revolutionary Army. However, along with Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, on whose staff ge servedm he was forced to flee in August 1792, and was captured by the Austrians at Rochefort, Belgium. Upon release he lived in exile in Holland, but escaped to America when Napoleon invaded The Netherlands. Laumoy lived in Philadelphia until he was removed from the émigré list. He returned to France in the summer of 1801. He retired in 1810, and died 19 January 1832.

He is portrayed by Scottish actor Peter Capaldi. As with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has also appeared in other Doctor Who spin-offs. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a millennia-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. Capaldi's portrayal of the Doctor is a spiky, brusque, contemplative, and pragmatic character who conceals his emotions in the course of making tough and sometimes ruthless decisions. This incarnation's companions include school teacher Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), canteen assistant and student Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) and alien Nardole (Matt Lucas). He also made a guest appearance in the Doctor Who spin-off series Class, appearing in the show's first episode. DevelopmentCasting= 286x286px Matt Smith, who played the Eleventh Doctor, publicly announced his departure from Doctor Who on 1 June 2013, triggering extensive media speculation on the subject. On 3 August 2013, bookmakers William Hill suspended betting when Capaldi became the five to six favourite to be cast. Capaldi's casting was revealed on 4 August during a live broadcast on BBC One, titled Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor. The live show, hosted by Zoe Ball, was watched by an average of 6.27 million in the UK, and was also simulcast in the United States, Canada and Australia. While Capaldi was the first choice for the role, other actors were also approached in case Capaldi should turn the offer down. Ben Daniels, who was an early favourite following the announcement of Matt Smith's departure, said that he had been approached with a view to assessing whether he would be interested in playing the Doctor, with his name remaining as a potential contender until just before the live BBC broadcast. Doctor Who head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat said that Capaldi \\"briefly flicked through [his] mind\\" while casting the Eleventh Doctor, but that he dismissed the idea, thinking he was not right for the part at the time. Ben Stephenson, the BBC's drama commissioner, said that Capaldi was suggested months before the August revelation and that a secret audition was held at Moffat's home. Capaldi prepared for the audition by downloading old Doctor Who scripts from the Internet and practising in front of a mirror. He discovered he had been given the part during filming for Adrian Hodges' The Musketeers in Prague; after missing a call from his agent, Capaldi rang back to be greeted with \\"Hello, Doctor!\\" At 55 years old when originally cast, Capaldi was only a few months younger than William Hartnell (the First Doctor) was, when he was cast in the role, and is the oldest actor since Hartnell to star as the Doctor and the third oldest to portray the character. Moffat felt that an older actor would work best following the youngest actor, as it would both provide a change and lessen comparisons. He commented, \\"I can absolutely believe that the strange old-young Matt Smith will turn into the strange young-old Peter Capaldi.\\" Capaldi had previously appeared playing other roles in the Doctor Who franchise. He portrayed Lobus Caecilius in the 2008 episode \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\" and John Frobisher in Children of Earth, the 2009 serial of the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood. Moffat has stated that he plans on explaining over time why there are three characters in the Doctor Who universe with the same appearance; his predecessor Russell T Davies had once explained to him a theory for the first two, and upon Capaldi's casting assured Moffat that the explanation would still work. This situation was alluded to in \\"Deep Breath\\", when a confused Doctor is reminded of Caecilius when he examines his face in a mirror. In \\"The Girl Who Died\\", it is explained that the Doctor chose Caecilius' face to remind himself that he is the Doctor, and that he can always save people. While not explained in the episode, Moffat later said that he also shares a face with John Frobisher as Frobisher is Caecilius's descendant, and represents the end of Caecilius's bloodline, referencing the Doctor's \\"eternal battle with doom and destiny.\\" Capaldi's casting marks the second time an actor has previously appeared in the series and then been cast as an incarnation of the Doctor, the first being Colin Baker. Capaldi briefly appears in the 50th anniversary special. Moffat stated that it was his \\"plan from the start\\" that all the Doctors would fly in to save Gallifrey, and he knew there would be a new one at that time. He wrote it before knowing who would be cast. Capaldi filmed his appearance on 3 October 2013, long after principal photography for the special had ended, and the same day he filmed his debut scene for \\"The Time of the Doctor\\". Capaldi kept his native Scottish accent for the role. Speaking on his decision, he said he did it so he could feel closer to the character. A handful of tweets were reported in September 2014 in which it was claimed that some viewers struggled to understand Capaldi. A speech coach and linguistics expert both suggested that any problems with understanding Capaldi had more to do with delivery than accent. =Departure= Upon the announcement that Steven Moffat would leave the show in December 2017 and be replaced by new showrunner Chris Chibnall, this decision led to speculation over whether Capaldi would remain in the role or leave alongside Moffat. A month before this, Capaldi stated \\"This could be my final year; it's terrifying, I love Doctor Who but it can be an insular world and I do want to do other things. There will come a time when this is over, but I knew that when I started. I was thinking about my regeneration scene from the outset, that's my terrible melancholic nature, when you accept the job you know there'll come a day, inevitably, when you'll be saying goodbye.\\" On 30 January 2017, Capaldi confirmed that the tenth series would be his last. Regarding his decision to leave, Capaldi stated that despite his tremendous love for the show, he was unsure if he would be able to deliver at his best performance if he remained in the role for too long. CharacterCostume= Doctor Who Experience. The Twelfth Doctor's general outfit consists of a navy blue Crombie coat with a crimson lining, dark blue trousers, a long collared white shirt buttoned to the top, a black cardigan or waistcoat, and brogue boots. His shirt varies from episode to episode, with a navy shirt, a dark purple shirt and a black shirt with white polka dots appearing, as well as a black holey jumper, all being worn under his coat in his first series. He also wears a hoodie over his jumper as of series nine, over his T-shirt all being worn under his coat. In \\"Time Heist\\", the Doctor describes his costume as \\"hoping for minimalism, but I think I came up with magician.\\" The Twelfth Doctor in his crimson velvet coat, first appearing in \\"Face the Raven\\" (2015). The look was created by Doctor Who costume designer Howard Burden. His design was described as \\"No frills, no scarfs, no messing, just 100% rebel Time Lord.\\" Capaldi said that the costume took a long time to find. The reason he settled on his final costume was because, \\"I think it's quite a hard look. I always wanted him to be in black – I always just saw the Doctor in dark colours. Not tweed,\\" in reference to his immediate predecessor's original costume. \\"Matt's a really young cool guy – he can wear anything, but I wanted to strip it back and be very stark.\\" Moffat described the look as \\"A stick-insect sort of thing\\". He also said that Clara calls him \\"a grey-haired stick-insect at one point\\". Capaldi also stated that he chose the Twelfth Doctor's costume so fans of the show who enjoy cosplay could easily emulate it without going to great expense. Writing for Radio Times, fashion columnist Anna Fielding described it as \\"a classic early skinhead look\\" and linked it to Capaldi's history as a punk musician. Capaldi's costume has varied in some episodes. In \\"Mummy on the Orient Express\\" he dons a period-appropriate tuxedo and a black ascot tie. In \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\", he wears Ray-Ban sunglasses (later revealed in \\"The Witch's Familiar\\" to be a wearable version of his sonic screwdriver), a T-shirt and plaid baggy trousers along with the hoodie and Crombie coat. In \\"Face the Raven\\", the Twelfth Doctor sports a crimson velvet variant of his Crombie coat. After briefly ditching it in \\"Hell Bent\\", Clara comments that it made him look more 'doctory'. At the end of the episode, he dons the crimson coat in honour of her, and is given a new sonic screwdriver by the TARDIS. In the ending segment of \\"The Husbands of River Song\\", the Doctor again dons the same tuxedo and period dress worn in \\"Mummy on the Orient Express\\". In Capaldi's final season, the most variations were seen on the Doctor's costume. In the first episode of the season, Capaldi donned a new black velvet frock coat with blue lining and peak lapels. This coat appeared several times throughout the season. The navy crombie coat returned (\\"Oxygen\\") as well as the red velvet crombie. Another addition to the Doctor's wardrobe occurs mid season with the introduction of a grey distressed linen frock coat. The final look that Capaldi had for his tenure as the Doctor was a navy velvet coat with red lining. This coat is eventually trashed after his final battle with the Cybermen in the season finale, \\"The Doctor Falls\\". =Characterisation= The Twelfth Doctor is, according to Capaldi, \\"more alien than he's been in a while.\\" Whilst still defining himself as someone who \\"saves people,\\" the Twelfth Doctor cares little about being seen as a hero or even being liked by the people who he is trying to save. Unlike his previous two incarnations who cared about humans and tried to understand them, Capaldi has confirmed that, this incarnation \\"doesn't quite understand human beings or really care very much about their approval.\\" Clara is put on the back-foot by him post- regeneration initially not seeing through his 'Tough Exterior'. Playing Clara, Jenna Coleman says of this Doctor, \\"He's more removed, you can't quite access him in the same way\\", in comparison to his more friendly and accessible predecessor. Initially it was reported that Capaldi specifically requested that the Doctor will not flirt with his companion the way his previous incarnation did, but the actor stated that he said no such thing and that it was inflated by the media. Steven Moffat has teased that Capaldi's Doctor may perhaps be more in love with Clara than he'd like to believe. He has also been described as a \\"total adrenaline junkie\\" and, according to Moffat, \\"much fiercer, madder [and] less reliable\\". \\"He's not as immediately approachable and he's not necessarily looking for your approval, when he says 'Wait here, I'll be back', you're not absolutely convinced... what he's not doing is reassuring you very much.\\" Mark Gatiss said that Capaldi's Doctor was \\"sort of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee and even Christopher Eccleston style...it's someone who's not immediately going to be your best friend and can be quite abrupt and rude.\\" Moffat added to this analysis of the character by saying, \\"He has a tremendous ability with throwaway humour and a lot of it is around the fact that sometimes he is terribly rude. I think kids will think he is the rude Doctor [...] You might want to cuddle him but he really will resist.\\" It has been said that part of the Doctor's personality will share \\"a certain acid wit\\" of Malcolm Tucker, \\"specifically the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy...he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous\\". Capaldi has stated that all of the previous actors who had played the Doctor were channelled in his portrayal and that his particular influences were Hartnell, Pertwee and Davison. He has been described as an \\"older, fiercer, trickier Doctor\\".The Australian In spite of his darker personality, Capaldi has said that the Doctor is still, \\"funny, joyful, passionate, emphatic, and fearless.\\" While Jenna Coleman added that this time, the Doctor is more \\"enigmatic, mysterious, complex, worn, and unmannered\\" when compared to his immediate two predecessors. Steven Moffat has joked that he's \\"more Scottish than last time.\\" In Series 9, Capaldi described his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises that he is 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two- thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated \\"She's totally in love with him, always has been. It's its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It's a doctor-and-companion love, and there's nothing else like it really.\\" \\"They're kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously she was trying to keep him under control yet now the two of them are going 'Come on, lets jump, lets do it', egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,\\" she teased. Capaldi stated \\"It's sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara's fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.\\" Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature. For Series 10, Capaldi described his character as more \\"closed off\\" and \\"suspicious\\" than the previous season, he elaborated \\"If you've been following this Doctor, you've seen him go through all those different colours and all those different places, and as for where he goes now, I don't know, but he's been put through the mill.\\" Capaldi expressed in terms of his character \\"Because in some ways he's much more amenable, but in other ways he's even darker. So I think that makes for a very interesting character.\\" Upon discussing the interaction between The Doctor and his latest companion Bill Potts, Capaldi elaborated \\"It's a kind of teacher- pupil relationship, but it becomes more complex than that and I think ultimately the Doctor has to undergo some dramas by himself. So I think he becomes slightly worried that he's swept someone else up into his adventures without quite preparing them.\\" AppearancesTelevision= The Twelfth Doctor makes a first, uncredited appearance in the programme's fiftieth anniversary special, \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013), when thirteen incarnations of the Doctor unite to save his home planet of Gallifrey from destruction during the Time War. At first, Time Lords in Gallifrey's war room spot twelve blue TARDISes approaching and encircling the planet. This count is then corrected to thirteen, and Capaldi's hands, eyes, and forehead are fleetingly shown. He then makes his full debut at the end of the next episode, \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", after the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), about to die from old age, is given a new regeneration cycle from the Time Lords, who remain hidden in a pocket universe. In the series 8 premiere \\"Deep Breath\\" (2014), the Doctor arrives in Victorian London, where he recovers from the stress of his regeneration, initially under the care of the Paternoster Gang. After uncovering potential alien presence in London, the Doctor goes on the run as a homeless person for some time. While on the run, he believes he has seen his new face before, though does not recall from where. He and Clara (Jenna Coleman) are reunited by a third party, and realise that this third party has been conspiring to bring the two of them together for some time. The Doctor helps Clara overcome her reservations about his new personality and older physical appearance, and they begin travelling together once more. Over the course of the series, he and Clara have some ups and downs in their friendship caused both by the Doctor's callousness and because Clara wishes to keep her continued travelling a secret from her boyfriend, Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson); she is not able to resolve the situation before Danny dies in a road accident in the first part of the series finale, \\"Dark Water\\"/\\"Death in Heaven\\". In the finale, he meets Missy (Michelle Gomez), the latest incarnation of his nemesis, the Master, who reveals that she conspired to bring him and Clara together and has begun converting the Earth's dead into Cybermen; her plan is to compromise the Doctor's morality with the offer of an army with which to rule the universe. Missy's scheme is foiled, but not before many have died and Earth is in chaos. The Doctor takes a weapon from Clara, to spare his companion the burden of killing Missy herself. As the Doctor hesitates, a cyberconverted Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, retaining his humanity, appears to disintegrate Missy with a laser blast. After a traumatic ordeal, the Doctor and Clara part ways, seemingly for good, before they are reunited by a shared dream in \\"Last Christmas\\" and agree to continue adventuring. In the series 9 premiere \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\"/\\"The Witch's Familiar\\" (2015), the Doctor, along with Clara and Missy, who survived her apparent disintegration, are summoned to the planet Skaro by The Doctor's nemesis Davros (Julian Bleach), the creator of the evil Dalek race, who is dying. Davros plays on the Doctor's sympathies to trick him into revitalising a dying Dalek empire, siphoning some of the Doctor's regeneration energy to do so. The Doctor also enlivens a mass of dying Daleks consigned to the sewers of Skaro, who begin to tear the city apart, and he makes his escape with Clara, but not before visiting Davros as a young boy on the battlefields of Skaro, and instilling in him a lesson about the virtues of mercy. In \\"The Girl Who Died,\\" the Doctor finally remembers that he shares a face with a man he was persuaded to save in Pompeii, despite his initial reluctance to alter the timeline. He surmises that he subconsciously chose this face as a reminder that his job is to save lives. He is inspired to resurrect Viking girl Ashildr (Maisie Williams) with alien technology; he learns in \\"The Woman Who Lived\\" that she has become immortal and watches over his past companions. In \\"Face the Raven\\", Clara dies while trying to outsmart Ashildr, who stages an elaborate ploy to trap the Doctor, which he learns in \\"Heaven Sent\\" was on behalf of the Time Lords. Emerging from the trap on his home planet of Gallifrey, he sends a warning to his people of his return. In \\"Hell Bent\\", the Doctor deposes Time Lord President Rassilon (Donald Sumpter) and uses Time Lord technology to save Clara from the moments before her death, and then proceeds to run away with her to the end of time in the hopes of cheating death permanently. He is then persuaded by Ashildr that he and Clara are a dangerous influence on each other, and perhaps together constitute the \\"Hybrid of two great warrior races\\" which is prophesied to destroy Gallifrey. The Doctor attempts to wipe Clara's memories of him using a device, but she alters it so that it affects his memories of her instead; she leaves him behind on Earth with his TARDIS to start adventuring again. She departs in her own stolen TARDIS, alongside Ashildr, promising to one day return to Gallifrey and accept her death. The Christmas special \\"The Husbands of River Song\\" (2015) is the Twelfth Doctor's first appearance alongside his roguish time-traveling wife River Song (Alex Kingston). After an emotionally wrought adventure, the Doctor and River finally confess the full extent of their feelings for each another, and he ends up fulfilling the history River told his earlier incarnation in \\"Silence in the Library\\" (2008): giving her his sonic screwdriver and spending a 24-year long date together as their final encounter. The Doctor next appears in the first episode of Doctor Who spin-off Class, appointing two alien refugees and a group of teenagers with protecting the pupils and faculty of Coal Hill Academy from alien threats. He returns in 2016 Christmas special \\"The Return of Doctor Mysterio\\", alongside new companion (and the first full-time alien companion of the revived series) Nardole (Matt Lucas), an employee of River Song's introduced in the previous episode. Together, they save New York from being destroyed by aliens with ambitions of world domination. In the series 10 premiere \\"The Pilot\\" (2017), it was revealed that the Doctor has spent decades working as a professor in St Luke's University in Bristol, giving lectures on time and life, assisted by Nardole. The Doctor has taken an oath to stay on Earth and guard a mysterious vault beneath the university. Bored after decades of confinement on Earth, he takes on Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) as his new companion, despite Nardole's reminders about his oath. In \\"Extremis\\", the show reveals that Nardole came to assist the Doctor on orders given by River before she died, and that the mysterious vault contains Missy, whom the Doctor swore to watch over for a thousand years. Over \\"The Lie of the Land\\", \\"Empress of Mars\\" and \\"The Eaters of Light\\", the Doctor becomes more convinced that Missy has reformed her ways, and so in \\"World Enough and Time\\", he sends her to react to a distress call on a colony ship trapped in the gravity of a black hole. His plan goes horribly wrong when Bill is shot and converted into a Cyberman by medics in the lower floors of the ship, where due to time dilation many years go by. In the series finale, \\"The Doctor Falls\\", the Doctor faces an army of Cybermen and struggles to convince Missy to side with him; she is influenced by her past incarnation (John Simm), also on board the ship. Badly injured by the Cybermen's attacks, the Doctor sends Nardole away to evacuate humans from the ship before destroying an entire level of it. Appearing to have died, he is taken to the TARDIS by Bill, who has been restored to life by the timely intervention of her love interest, Heather (Stephanie Hyam). The Doctor wakes up alone, and vows not to regenerate. Clinging onto his life, he wanders out of his TARDIS and encounters his first incarnation (David Bradley) who is facing similar reservations about his pending regeneration. In the Christmas special \\"Twice Upon A Time\\", the two Doctors reflect on their lives and, after witnessing the Christmas armistice of 1914, both decide to move on to their next forms. Alone in his TARDIS, the Twelfth Doctor speaks words of advice directed to his successor before regenerating into the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker). =Literature= New Series Adventures released novels starring the Twelfth Doctor and Clara Oswald in September 2014: Silhouette, The Crawling Terror, and The Blood Cell. The next wave was released in September 2015, with the stories of Deep Time, Royal Blood and Big Bang Generation; the first two of these also feature the Twelfth Doctor and Clara, while Big Bang Generation sees the Twelfth Doctor reunited with the Seventh Doctor's Virgin New Adventures companion Bernice Summerfield. In April 2017, three new novels were released, featuring new companions Nardole and Bill Potts. They are titled The Shining Man, Diamond Dogs and Plague City. =Audio= In February 2019, the Twelfth Doctor made his first Big Finish appearance in The Astrea Conspiracy, narrated by Neve McIntosh. The Twelfth Doctor has since appeared in more Short Trips stories and the anthology series The Twelfth Doctor Chronicles narrated by Jacob Dudman. =Video games= Capaldi voices the Lego counterpart of the Twelfth Doctor in the video game, Lego Dimensions, alongside Jenna Coleman and Michelle Gomez as Clara and Missy respectively. He also lent his voice to the character in the CBBC online game, The Doctor and the Dalek and in the Doctor Who Game Maker on the official Doctor Who site. Reception Peter Capaldi has received critical acclaim for his portrayal of the Doctor. Following the broadcast of \\"Deep Breath\\", Euan Ferguson of The Guardian called his performance \\"wise and thoughtful\\", while Richard Beech of The Mirror agreed that Capaldi displayed \\"all the hallmarks of a great Doctor\\". Michael Hogan of The Telegraph felt that Capaldi's portrayal \\"crackled with fierce intelligence and nervous energy\\". Capaldi's performance in \\"Listen\\" was praised with Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club stating \\"Capaldi turns in a suitably fearless performance, reaching his obsessive crescendo as he prepares to meet whatever is waiting for him at the end of the universe\\". His acting in \\"The Caretaker\\" was praised with Ceri Radford of The Telegraph noting \\"Capaldi's ability to mould the character of the Doctor into his own unique intergalactic curmudgeon\\", alongside Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy noting \\"Capaldi's is the most complex and variable take on the Time Lord we've seen since Eccleston\\". Professor Brian Cox noted \\"he's complex, menacing and vulnerable. Exactly what the Doctor should be\\". Musician Marc Almond stated \\"Peter Capaldi brings back a touch of darkness and ageless mystery to the Doctor that I feel had been missing, as well as a dash of menace and mischief. He has some of the abrasiveness of William Hartnell, the stylishness of Jon Pertwee and the eccentricity of Tom Baker – all my favourite Doctors\\". Alison Graham of Radio Times stated \\"Peter Capaldi is the Victor Meldrew Doctor Who; he's abrasive, acerbic and has no truck with modern life\\". Interviewing Capaldi just weeks before his first episode, he said he was \\"a more grown-up Doctor\\" albeit one who is still \\"mirthful. He's serious when he needs to be, but he's still quite comic\\". Patrick Mulkern added \\"Peter Capaldi simply is the Doctor; the most persuasive since Tom Baker\\" and described him as \\"the Scotch-on-the-rocks Doctor – distilled, chilly, stinging on the palate but warming on the way down\\". In January 2015, Capaldi became the first actor to portray the Doctor to not be shortlisted for a National Television Award since the series revival in 2005. Ahead of the British Academy Television Awards that year, Paul Flynn of The Guardian noted that Capaldi's portrayal of the Doctor had the effect of \\"significantly reducing Doctor Whos glamour quotient\\". Later, Capaldi received a TV Choice Awards nomination for Best Actor. He was also nominated for a BAFTA Cymru Award in the Best Actor category for his acting in \\"Dark Water\\". Steven Moffat praised his leading man stating \\"we could argue for the rest of our lives about who's the best Doctor — but for me, the best single performance in the role is settled forever. You can only ask a solo of a virtuoso, so thank God and Scotland for Peter Capaldi\\". Capaldi's predecessor, Matt Smith, praised him as having \\"reinvented\\" Doctor Who. Colin Baker praised the 12th Doctor noting \\"[Capaldi's Doctor] is grumpy and curmudgeonly and intolerant, and gosh – I should be playing it now. I wasn't old enough when I did it. I can do intolerant!\\" \\"[Capaldi's] costume is less annoying! I love his style, and I love his character\\". In a later interview, Baker expressed that Capaldi initially had 'a rough deal' as fans weren't very kind towards his incarnation, as they had been conditioned towards 'eye candy' in the form of dashing role models including David Tennant and Matt Smith. Sylvester McCoy also expressed his admiration for Capaldi's incarnation for being portrayed as an \\"older\\" Doctor, as opposed to his younger predecessors, he went on to elaborate his casting helped provide a life-affirming message to serve as an inspirational role model for children. Scott Collura from IGN praised the interactions and dialogue between him and Davros in \\"The Witch's Familiar\\". Den of Geek praised Capaldi in \\"Before the Flood\\" noting \\"his performance continues to mix grumpiness, friendliness, intelligence and a large dose of alien, he's been on excellent, excellent form\\". Catherine Gee of The Telegraph credited Capaldi's acting in \\"The Woman Who Lived\\" noting \\"he has grown into the role utterly and completely. He embodies the weight of the Doctor's responsibility; his face wears every nuanced expression with a flickering ease\\". His performance in \\"The Zygon Inversion\\" was heavily praised by fans and critics most specifically his anti-war speech, with Dan Martin of The Guardian stating \\"this Doctor has never been written better, Capaldi has never channelled Tom Baker more\\". Most prominently Capaldi's performance in \\"Heaven Sent\\" received universal widespread acclaim, with Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times noting that \\"Peter Capaldi's one-man show is an instant classic\\", and that \\"Capaldi delivers 100%, carrying every scene and showing every facet of his Doctor: anger, terror, playfulness, intensity, resignation and, finally, a fierce refusal to do anything other than do what he has always done: find a way to win\\". In a review for \\"Hell Bent\\", Catherine Gee stated \\"Peter Capaldi proved that he is one of the greatest Doctors\\". Den of Geek praised the dynamic between the Doctor and River Song in \\"The Husbands of River Song\\", with Simon Brew noting the pair as a \\"strong double act\\", with Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy stating \\"this, combined with Capaldi and Kingston's sensitive work, means you feel a weight of history between these two people who've never shared a screen before\\". Andrew Billen of The Times praised the Twelfth Doctor for being at his \\"warmest\\" in \\"The Return of Doctor Mysterio\\", along with The Guardian applauding the dynamic between the Doctor and Nardole noting \\"Peter Capaldi and Matt Lucas are 'a pantomime treat'\\". In June 2016, Peter Capaldi was shortlisted for a national TV Choice Award for Best Actor. He had also been submitted for a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. In addition, Capaldi was announced as a BAFTA Scotland Awards nomination as Best Actor on Television. Michael Hogan of The Telegraph noted that \\"Capaldi is back to his charismatic best\\" in \\"The Pilot\\", stating \\"devoted Whovian is keen to go out with a bang\\", and described his character as \\"mercurial, magical and kind\\". Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in \\"Thin Ice\\", noting how she \\"examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge\\". Capaldi's performance in \\"Extremis\\" received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating \\"Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak\\". He also praised the interactions between him and The Master, noting how they recall \\"a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee's Doctor and Roger Delgado's Master had during their many encounters\\". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi's performance in \\"The Lie of the Land\\" proclaiming \\"he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He's world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he's working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race\\". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, \\"Peter only has to think at the screen and you know what he's thinking,\\" he said. \\"He only has to move his face and I know the particular blend of Scottish torment he's feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has given us the most emotional Doctor.\\" Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in \\"The Doctor Falls\\" with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he \\"stands tall\\", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he \\"simply shines\\". Flickering Myth stated \\"Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord\\". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's \\"Where I stand is where I fall\\" speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: \\"The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he's going to be missed when he finally departs Doctor Who at the end of the year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud \\"I don't want you to go\\"\\". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that \\"the man's been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been my Doctor for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that's wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have been blessed with his talents. I don't want you to go either, Peter\\". Critics heavily praised Peter Capaldi's performance in his last outing in \\"Twice Upon a Time\\" along with the Twelfth Doctor's evolution over the course of three series. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian, who considered himself a friend of the Twelfth Doctor, said it was hard to say goodbye to this brilliant Doctor, which has been \\"warm, wise, kind, funny and human\\". Patrick Mulkern named Capaldi his ideal kind of Doctor: \\"senior, crusty, steely, funny but with anguish burning through those wizened eyes\\". The Mirror noted that 12th Doctor's journey from \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" through to \\"Twice Upon a Time\\" has been epic: \\"From his early days as cranky and prickly foil to Clara, to a more caring, teacher figure alongside Bill it's been sublime to watch. And this evolution within a single regeneration is something only an actor like Capaldi could have pulled off\\". The A.V. Club agreed, stating the episode gave Capaldi a \\"beautiful final showcase that demonstrates just how much he's grown into the role since his rather ominous beginnings back in season eight\\". Ross Ruediger regarded the Twelfth Doctor as \\"the pinnacle\\" of Doctor Who. He admitted that the actor came into the show at not exciting time for the series, but he managed to make it exciting over again. He felt Capaldi's Doctor arguably the only Doctor in the shows history who grew as a character: \\"The Doctor we saw in \\"The Doctor Falls\\" is a drastically different sort of man than the person we met way back in \\"Deep Breath\\" — and yet they are absolutely, believably the same character\\". In the end, Ruediger acknowledged that it was marvelous to watch how this character learned and grew: \\"It's not something that this series has ever really dared tackle before, but now that it's been done and accomplished so successfully, it will be difficult for the show to turn back. Peter Capaldi raised the bar for who and what the Doctor can be, and the series is all the better for it\\". Alasdair Wilkins from Inverse stated that defining word for the 12th Doctor is \\"kind\\": \\"It's what moves him at the Christmas Armistice in Ypres, and it's part of his final advice to his next self. That the incarnation who began his existence so prickly and aloof would end it as the champion of kindness speaks to just how much this Doctor grew and developed over this three seasons\\". He said that it shows how brilliant Capaldi's performance has been. Wilkins noted how 12th Doctor gradually warmed up, realising showing his true self – reason for his older appearance – meant being \\"unashamedly, unreservedly kind\\". He went on to say that Capaldi played the Doctor's kindness as \\"the most urgently honest expression of himself, and in doing so made his Doctor vulnerable and open in a way none of his predecessors ever really attempted\\".

She was among the world's best ski racers in the mid-1950s. She competed in the 1956 Winter Olympics, the 1958 Alpine World Ski Championships and the 1960 Winter Olympics. She was born in Radstadt, Austria. Major Competitions History In 1956 Winter Olympics she won the silver medal in the giant slalom event. In the slalom competition she finished fifth and had a 13th-place finish in the downhill contest. Four years later, at the Squaw Valley, California Winter Olympics, she finished 16th in the 1960 slalom event, 21st in the giant slalom competition, and 39th in the downhill contest. Frandl and some of her friends and teammates went out to ski the fresh powder snow. Unfortunately, while coming down one run, the tip of one of Frandl's skis went under a log hidden just under the newly fallen snow. Her shin hit the log hard, scraping it and straining her leg. Frandl believed that the injury possibly prevented her from winning another Olympic Medal. At the 1958 World Championships, Frandl won silver in slalom and bronze in the combined. Personal life After retiring Frandl worked as a ski instructor in Austria. In one of her classes she met US Air Force officer Patrick Crotty. They eventually married. Patrick's career took Putzi and their family to many places, and whenever there was a ski resort close enough Putzi would teach skiing.

Im Spinnennetz (\\"In the Spider Web\\") Restoration The Spiders was considered a lost film for many years before an original print was discovered in the 1970s. This surviving print was used for a restoration of the film, completed in 1978.The Spiders at silentera.com The restored version appears to be missing a small amount of the original footage. This version was released on DVD in 1999 and Blu-ray in 2016. The three year reconstruction was done by film historians David and Kimberly Shepard, with music scored by Gaylord Carter. The source material was a 35mm duplicate negative from Czechoslovakia; the nitrate print had several defects that could not be taken out, was out of sequence and didn't have intertitles. The intertitles were obtained from German censor records. The film was tinted according to instructions by Fritz Lang, who was still living at the time.

History  The game was developed over a two-year period culminating in its present form on May 12, 1986. The original name for the game was Pinnacle, but it was discovered that an older board/card game had that name, so around 1989 the name was changed to Plateau. From the 1980s through the 1990s Plateau was played at Science Fiction conventions mostly in the Southeastern United States. From the 1990s to the present, the game is played live at an online game site and via email. In 1997 a computer implementation of the game was created which facilitates email play and has a computer robot. Plateau is self-published by Jim Albea.  Rules  The Official Rules are on the PlateauGame.com web site. = Goal = There are two ways to win: 1) build a stack of six of your pieces on the board; or 2) capture six of your opponent's pieces. = Equipment = A 4x4 square board and each player has 12 color- coded disks. = Opening Move = Black moves first by picking out two of his pieces and placing them in a stack on the perimeter of the board. White does the same on a different perimeter square. = Subsequent Moves = Players alternate moves. A move can be one of three types: 1\\\\. Onboard a new piece. Onboarding is adding one new piece to the play. 2\\\\. Move a stack already on the board. 3\\\\. Exchange captured pieces. = Onboarding = Onboarding is adding one new piece to the play. This new piece can be placed anywhere that doesn't directly harm an opposing piece. For instance, you can onboard to any blank square or on top of any of your own pieces. The majority of Plateau moves are onboards. = Movement direction = The direction that pieces move is determined by the color that is facing up. Some of the pieces have different markers on their two sides. Those pieces can be flipped over at the start of a move, which changes the direction they can travel. Blue topped pieces move diagonally When a piece has a blue side showing it moves diagonally. Red topped pieces move orthogonally When a piece has a red side showing it moves orthogonally (or straight). Blank topped pieces move both ways When a piece has a blank side showing it can move either diagonally or orthogonally. The orange piece moves one square straight and one square diagonally When the orange marker is showing the piece moves in a crooked fashion. It moves one square straight and one square diagonally. = Movement distance = A stack moves in a straight line up to one space for each piece in the stack. As a stack is moving it can pick up and drop off friendly pieces from the bottom of the stack. If it drops off pieces on opposing pieces then they become pinned, which means that they cannot move. A stack can jump over any pieces as it moves. left BEFORE: In this example white starts with a stack of four pieces. left AFTER: White moves three spaces dropping pieces off along the way. left BEFORE: In this example white starts with a two-stack and a three-stack. left AFTER: White moves two spaces picking up the three-stack as it passes over. = Capturing pieces = Pieces with a color marker facing up, called a weapon, can capture opposing pieces. You capture pieces by landing a stack on top of them. One piece is captured for each piece that lands on top. Captured pieces are removed from the board and become prisoners. When a stack performs a capture it has to stop its movement on that square. Captured pieces may be returned to the opposing player in a prisoner exchange. left BEFORE: In this example white has a two-stack with a weapon on top and black has a two-stack sitting on the next square. left AFTER: White moves on top of black and captures two pieces. left BEFORE: In this example there are three stacks on the board. White has a two-stack with a weapon visible and a single piece on the next square. Black has a two-stack that is pinning a white piece which is in turn pinning a black piece. left AFTER: White moves the two-stack two spaces picking up the single white piece along the way. This gives white three pieces when he begins the capture of black's pieces. Since he starts the capture with three pieces he can capture three pieces. = The Pieces = Each player has 12 color-coded disks: Four Mutes, which are blank on both sides. Mutes are worth 1 point in prisoner exchanges. Two Blues, which are blue on both sides. Blues are worth 4 points in prisoner exchanges. Two Reds, which are red on both sides. Reds are worth 5 points in prisoner exchanges. One Blue Mask which is blue on one side and blank on the other side. Blue masks are worth 8 points in prisoner exchanges. One Red Mask which is red on one side and blank on the other. Red masks are worth 10 points in prisoner exchanges. One Twister which is Orange on one side and blank on the other. Twisters are worth 15 points in prisoner exchanges. One Ace, which is red on one side and blue on the other. Aces are worth 21 points in prisoner exchanges. = Prisoner Exchange = Instead of Onboarding or Moving, a player can choose to spend his turn exchanging prisoners. Prisoners are exchanged using the point values of the pieces. A simple value-for-value system is used. Since the pieces range in value from 1 point (for the mute) to 21 points (for the Ace) there are usually several combinations and options available for the players. The player initiating the exchange selects the pieces he wishes to exchange. These pieces will all add up to some point value. The responding player then has four options depending on the point values of the prisoners that he holds. *Option 1: Give an equal value. If he has a combination of values that exactly equals the value being tendered then he has to exchange those pieces, or exchange a higher value if he would prefer. *Option 2: Give a greater value. If he has any combination of values higher than the value being tendered he always has the option of exchanging a higher value. *Option 3: Give the next lower value. If he doesn't have an exact match and chooses not to give a higher value, then he must exchange the next value below the value being tendered. *Option 4: Refuse the exchange. If he doesn't have an equal value, doesn't have a lower value, and doesn't wish to exchange a higher value then he can refuse the exchange. = Hidden information = Hidden information in the game consists of the true nature of the underside of pieces that have been onboarded. The significance of this information is that pieces can be flipped at the start of a move possibly changing the direction they can travel or possibly transforming a blank into a weapon. This information is revealed in the course of the game as pieces are flipped, captured, and onboarded. The rule that controls this flow of information is called the One Hand Rule: Any manipulations of pieces must be done with one hand in full view of the opponent. For instance, if you on board a piece inside one of your stacks you must do it in three steps: 1. Take pieces off the top (which displays the nature of the top of the next piece down). 2. Place your onboarded piece on the stack (which reveals the top of that piece). 3. Return the upper pieces to the stack. Before play begins and throughout the game the players arrange their unplayed pieces such that the opponent can't see them. The game box is used as a shielding wall for this purpose. You cannot inspect your opponent's uncaptured pieces. When pieces are captured they can be freely inspected by both players. = General = If a player has no legal moves, then his turn is forfeited. A draw can be called by mutual agreement of the players.

History The cathedral was built on the site of Mayan ruins T'ho. The cathedral of Mérida, seat of the bishopric of Yucatán, was the first cathedral to be finished on the mainland of the Americas, and the only one (with the exception of Santo Domingo de Guzman on the island of Hispaniola) to be entirely built during the 16th century. It is a unique monument with clear antecedents in Andalucia. The bishopric of Yucatán had an uncertain start. The Yucatán peninsula was explored by Francisco Hernandez de Córdoba and Juan de Grijalva on behalf of Diego Velazquez de Cuellar, the adelantado of Cuba, in 1517 and 1518. The creation of a diocese in the recently discovered country was urged by Velazquez, who presumed to have jurisdiction over the region and hoped to colonize it. An episcopal see known as \\"Carolense\\" was indeed created by Pope Leo X in 1519 (later renamed \\"Our Lady of Remedies\\" by Clement VII). But said diocese was not implemented in the territory of Yucatán but in that of Tlaxcala instead and later on was moved to Puebla. It cannot therefore be considered the predecessor of the diocese of Yucatán. The diocese of Yucatán proper, named \\"Yucatan and Cozumel,\\" was created by Pius IV in 1561. St. Ildephonsus of Toledo was invoked as the patron. Two prelates for the new see were nominated in succession by the Spanish Crown but neither could be consecrated for entirely accidental reasons. A third candidate, fray Francisco Toral, was eventually consecrated and took possession on August 14, 1562. He was the first of a long line of bishops, later archbishops, of Yucatán. The system of vaulting used throughout the building was based on the ideas of Andres de Vandelvira, first applied to the building of the cathedral of Jaen. Indeed, there is every possibility that Vandelvira's schemes were brought to the Mérida project by the first bishop of Yucatán, fray Francisco Toral, who hailed from Ubeda, a town in the Jaen province. References to the cathedral can be found in the Books of Chilam Balam.  Construction  Land had been set aside for the cathedral at Mérida, the place recycled by the Spanish under Francisco de Montejo as the capital of the new colony. The colonial city was set amidst the ruins of the Maya settlement of Ichcansiho (T'ho for short), and work for the church was begun shortly after Toral's arrival. The church was to be built on the eastern side on the main town square, where a temporary building with a roof of palms was erected. It was not until 1562 that construction of the cathedral began. Labor for this construction came from Mayans, some of who still practiced their own religion. Laborers used stones from the Mayan temple of Yajam Cumu to build the cathedral. Two known Mayan workers were Francisco Pool, and Diego Can. Although architect Juan Miguel de Agüero completed the cathedral, it was Don Pedro de Aulestia who led the initial construction.  Coat of Arms  The coat of arms on the cathedral facade was originally designed to reflect the Spanish royal coat of arms. The original royal coat consisted of four sections containing symbols of gold castles and crowned lions. At the very top of the coat was a representation of the royal crown of Spain. After Mexico's independence, the shield was partially destroyed due to anti-Spanish sentiment. The central piece of the shield containing the castles and lions were removed using a pickaxes and chisels. In 1824, the empty shield was filled with a Mexican eagle wearing the imperial crown of Iturbide. After the redesign of the shield, a second wave of anti-Spanish sentiment led to the entire coat of arms being buried beneath a slab on cement. The cement was later removed to reveal the coat of arms as can be seen today.  St. Peter and St. Paul  On the cathedral facade there are statues of St. Peter and St. Paul. The statue of St. Paul is distinguished by the sword and the book he is holding. St. Peter is depicted holding the keys to the Church.

On 23 August 1910, the team merged with other local clubs including Fußball-Club Viktoria Zaborze, Sport-Club Silesia Zaborze, and Sport-Club Zaborze to form Sport-Club Preußen Zaborze whose membership was largely made up of post office workers. They took on the name SC Preußen Hindenburg in 1915 when the city was renamed in honour of German military leader and statesman Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg, and in 1918 were joined by the membership of Sportfreunde Hindenburg.Grüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag The name of the club reverted in 1920 to SC Preußen Zaborze and then again to SC Preußen Hindenburg in 1934, reflecting the struggle between Germany and Poland over the territory of Upper Silesia. When the region was partitioned in 1921, Zaborze remained part of Germany and Preußen played in German football competition in the Südostdeutscher Fußball Verband (Southeast German Football Association). By 1923, the club had over 500 members with departments for athletics and handball. The footballers were a successful regional side capturing the title of German Upper Silesia in 1928, 1929, 1930, and 1931. They emerged as Südostdeutscher champions in 1929 and qualified for the national playoffs by defeating SpVgg Komet Breslau (7:3) before being soundly beaten 1:8 in an eighth-final matchup versus eventual vice-champions Hertha Berlin.Grüne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag German football competition was reorganized under the Third Reich in 1933 into sixteen top-flight divisions with Preußen becoming part of the Gauliga Schlesien. The following year the club's name was Germanized to Hindenburg and they remained in first division play until being relegated in 1942. During this period the club earned three second-place finishes (1936 and 1939 in the Gauliga Schlesien, 1940 in the Gauliga Oberschlesien), but was unable to make its way back to the national stage. Hindenburg played a final season in the Gauliga Oberschlesien (I) in 1943–44 before competition in the region was disrupted by World War II. The club played its final match in January 1945 and disappeared following the war when the area became part of Poland.

History Prince's band, the Revolution, were invited to the studio in 1982 to contribute to a majority of the material for the planned album, with the notable exceptions of \\"The Ballad of Dorothy Parker\\" and \\"Starfish & Coffee\\" (co-written by Susannah Melvoin). Some tracks included a few band members, most tracks none, some were full band recordings or included other musicians such as Sheila E. But in September 1986 at the end of the Parade Tour, Prince was too frustrated with the Revolution. The band was dissolved in October 1986, after which many of the album's tracks were incorporated into what was now a planned solo three LP project entitled Crystal Ball. However, Prince's record distributor at the time, Warner Bros., balked at a three-LP release, so the project was reduced to a two-LP set and retitled Sign o' the Times. Mavis Staples would later cover \\"Train\\" for her 1989 album Time Waits for No One, Prince's version would be unreleased until 2020. In March 2009, Vibe magazine featured the album on its \\"51 Albums That Never Were,\\" calling it a \\"coulda- been classic,\\" and even streaming \\"All My Dreams\\" for a limited time. Vibe also interviewed former Revolution members Wendy and Lisa on the project. Even though the album was never officially released, there is a bootleg CD available of the July 1986 track configuration, which comes with a color pencil sketch made by Susannah Melvoin as cover, which was a concept for the prospective sleeve. This album cover is attributed to The Flesh rather than Prince and the Revolution. A Super Deluxe Edition of Sign o' the Times was announced for release on September 25 2020, containing all the recorded music for the Dream Factory/Crystal Ball/Camille sessions as bonus tracks.

Origins Shamshi-ilu probably was not born in Assyria, though he was from noble lineage of the Bit-Adini tribe and was more than likely educated at the Assyrian court. Later, he rose in the ranks of the Assyrian army to become the commander in chief (turtanu) who had a high degree of influence over the kings of Assyria who lived in his time. He was probably made governor when Shalmaneser III annexed the territories of the Bit-Adini. Turtanu Rising in high order through the ranks thanks to his teachings in the Assyrian ways Shamshi-ilu rose to the highest position in the army under the Kings Adad- Nirari III and Shalmaneser IV, although he quite posibily could have been around much later, possibly coming into contact with Pulu (Tiglath-Pileser III) at some point. He may possibly have taken part in the rebellion that saw Tiglath-pileser III take the throne from Ashur-nirari V, although he may have been dead at this point. Campaigns Shamshi-ilu's most famous and well documented campaign was against the Urartu king Argishti I in 780 BCE. His name appeared on many public monuments such as the colossal stone lion which accounts for his victories on this campaign. He is also known to have transferred land and border agreements with the Syro-Hittites, which are recorded on a stone stele. He quite possibly could have been the prime leader in the Damascus campaign in 796 BCE.

Payne began building a second prototype in 1931, which first flew in fall the following year powered by a Salmson 9Ad radial engine. This aircraft was damaged in a forced landing due to fuel exhaustion during a demonstration flight for the press, and parts of the airframe were reused to build the second Knight Twister in 1935. This machine, powered by a converted Ford Model A automobile engine, was built for an Argentine buyer\\"The New Knight Twister\\" 1937, p.35 who eventually declined to take delivery. After it had passed through several hands, Payne himself bought the aircraft back after World War II and his son, Richard, was killed in it during a test flight on which the engine failed shortly after take-off.

In 1964, Clyde Parsons flying the \\"Parsons Twister\\", won the Sport Biplane Championship race at Reno with a speed of 144.7 mph. In the 1970s, Don Fairbanks competed with a Knight Twister preserved initially at the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America museum in Novi, Michigan, and later in the lobby of Sporty's Pilot Shop at Clermont County Airport, Batavia, Ohio. Fairbanks set the world record in the sport biplane class of 178 mph (284 km/h) with this aircraft. The Knight Twister has a reputation as a \\"handful\\" to fly,Davisson 2000 but this has been vigorously denied by both its designerPayne 1985 and by Fairbanks.Fairbanks Both men have attributed this reputation to the controls being lighter and more responsive than those of the light aircraft that most pilots are more familiar with.

De Faÿ was one of the first nobles to join the Third Estate. He was representative to Nord and Pas de Calais. De Faÿ was charged, with Antoine Barnave and Jerome Pétion, to return the royal family to Paris following its flight to Varennes (June 1791). His devotion on this occasion was misunderstood by Marie-Antoinette. However, in her memoirs, Madame Tourzel, witness of the facts, paid tribute to his dedication to the royal family. De Faÿ was Colonel of the 3ème régiment de chasseurs à cheval from 1791 to February 1792. With the separation of the National Constituent Assembly, he accompanied the marquis de Fayette with the Army of the Center in 1792 and emigrated with him after the dismissal by Louis XVI on 10 August 1792.

Background  Yuan Zi was born in 739, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Cai Prefecture (蔡州, in modern Zhumadian, Henan).New Book of Tang, vol. 151. It traced its ancestry from a clan of Han Dynasty officials, including Yuan An (who, however, was not a direct ancestor), with direct descendance through a line of officials of Han, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Liu Song, Liang Dynasty, Northern Zhou, Sui Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty. His grandfather Yuan Zhixuan () served as a prefectural official, while his father Yuan Chu () served as a county magistrate.New Book of Tang, vol. 74 Yuan Zi was said to be studious in his youth, and as his brother-in-law Yuan Jie (元結, note different surname) was already a prefectural prefect who had a good reputation, he lived with Yuan Jie while he studied. He interpreted the ancient works well, and Yuan Jie respected him.Old Book of Tang, vol. 185, part 2. He later lived as a guest in the region of Jing Prefecture (荊州, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) and Ying Prefecture (郢州, in modern Wuhan, Hubei) and taught students.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  Early in the Jianzhong era (780-783) of Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong, the official Zhao Zan () recommended Yuan Zi as a hermit with abilities, and he was made a Xiaoshulang (), a scribe at the Palace Library. Yuan later served on the staffs of the generals Zhang Boyi () and He Shigan (). On one occasion, one of his subordinates was falsely accused of embezzlement, but Yuan was able to discover that the accusations were false and get him released. When the deputy chief imperial censor Wei Tao () heard of this, he recommended Yuan to be an imperial censor with the title Shiyushi (). Yuan later served as Gongbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (工部, Gongbu). In 794, Nanzhao, which had previously been a Tang vassal but which had been a Tufan vassal for some time, reestablished a relationship with Tang based on communications between the Tang general Wei Gao and its king Yimouxun (), and Yimouxun offered Nanzhao's maps and local produce as tributes, and submitted the seal that Tufan's king had awarded him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. Emperor Dezong sought an appropriate emissary to visit Nanzhao, and many officials found excuses to decline due to the length of the journey, but Yuan did not decline, causing Emperor Dezong to give him much praise. Emperor Dezong made him Cibu Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of rites (禮部, Lǐbu), and sent him to Nanzhao as an emissary. Yuan, under Emperor Dezong's direction, bestowed a new Tang seal on Yimouxun. After his return, he was made Jianyi Daifu (), and then was made Shangshu You Cheng (), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng) and was put in charge of selecting officials at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Lìbu, note different tone than the ministry of rites). He wrote a five-volume work, the Yunnan Ji (), about his journey. Yuan was later made the prefect of Hua Prefecture (華州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), as well as the defender of Tong Pass and the commander of the Zhenguo Army (). His governance was said to be simple and lenient. When people came from other prefectures and wanted to settle in Hua Prefecture, Yuan gave them land and allowed them to settle. The people loved him for his mercy. However, it was also said that he did not punish people for crimes, and whenever he caught thieves, he would often release them or allow them to simply pay back what they stole. He was later recalled to Chang'an to be a general of the imperial guards, and when he was about to leave, the people of the prefecture tried to stop him on the road to prevent him from leaving. His successor Yang Yuling () had to publicly declare, \\"I, Yang Yuling, would not dare to alter the policies set by Lord Yuan.\\" The people bowed to Yuan and allowed him to leave.  During Emperor Shunzong and Emperor Xianzong's reigns  Emperor Dezong died in 805 and was succeeded by his severely ill son Emperor Shunzong. Several months later, however, with Emperor Shunzong's illness, his son and crown prince Li Chun was made regent, and Yuan Zi was made Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). He was also given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor, along with Du Huangchang. Emperor Shunzong soon passed the throne to Li Chun, who took the throne as Emperor Xianzong. Yuan continued to serve as chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. Soon thereafter, Wei Gao died, and his deputy Liu Pi seized control of the circuit that Wei governed, Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), requesting to be allowed to succeed Wei. Emperor Xianzong initially refused, and he sent Yuan on a mission to try to persuade Liu to submit to a new commander, as the surveyor of Xichuan and two other neighboring circuits, Dongchuan (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) and Shannan West (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). He then made Yuan the new military governor (Jiedushi) of Xichuan Circuit and tried to summon Liu to Chang'an to serve as imperial attendant. Liu refused and prepared to resist imperial forces. Yuan, fearing Liu, did not dare to try to advance to Xichuan, and Emperor Xianzong, angry over Yuan's fear, demoted him to be the prefect of Ji Prefecture (吉州, in modern Ji'an, Jiangxi). Soon thereafter, however, Yuan was repromoted to be the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). While there, the people were so appreciate of him that, although he was still alive, built a shrine dedicated to him. He was later recalled to Chang'an to serve as the minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu), and later served as the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei). In 814, Emperor Xianzong swapped his post with Yan Shou () the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. As of 816, Emperor Xianzong was waging a campaign against Wu Yuanji, who ruled Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian) in a de facto independent manner from the imperial government. Yuan, whose home Cai Prefecture was Zhangyi's capital prefecture, went to see Emperor Xianzong at Chang'an in 816, intending to persuade him to end the campaign against Wu, which was not going well at the time. On the way to Chang'an, however, he heard that the officials Xiao Mian and Qian Hui () had been removed from their offices due to their opposition to the campaign, and he became fearful. When he reached Chang'an, instead of his originally intended advice, he instead informed Emperor Xianzong that he believed that Wu could be defeated, and Emperor Xianzong allowed him to return to Jingnan. Soon thereafter, with the commander of the forces against Wu, Gao Xiayu (), having no success against Wu, Emperor Xianzong made Yuan the military governor of Zhangyi, briefly carving out three prefectures of Shannan East Circuit (Tang (唐州, in modern Zhumadian), Sui (隨州, in modern Suizhou, Hubei), and Deng (鄧州, in modern Nanyang, Henan)) to serve as his territory and headquartering the circuit at Tang Prefecture. Once Yuan arrived at Tang Prefecture, however, he stopped all of the scouting activities and incursions into Wu's territory, and when Wu attacked his military outpost Xinxingza () and put it under siege, Yuan wrote Wu in abject language requesting that he lift the siege. Emperor Xianzong was displeased when he heard this, and he had Li Su replace Yuan around the new year 817. Yuan was demoted to be the prefect of Fu Prefecture (撫州, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi), but was soon made the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Hunan Circuit (湖南, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan). He died in 818, while still serving at Hunan, and was given posthumous honors.

Often called \\"splash cups\\", the fruiting bodies are adapted for spore dispersal by using the kinetic energy of falling drops of rain. The \\"eggs\\" inside the bird's nests (technically known as peridioles) are hard waxy shells containing spores, and tend to stick to whatever nearby herbage they land on, thus increasing the odds of being consumed and dispersed by herbivorous animals. Members of this genus are saprobic, obtaining nutrients from dead organic matter, and are typically found growing on decayed wood and wood debris. The three known Crucibulum species (C. laeve, C. parvulum, and C. cyathiforme) are distinguished from other genera of the Nidulariaceae by their relatively simple funiculus – a cord of hyphae that connects the peridiole (the \\"eggs\\") to the exterior of the bird's nest. History Bird's nest fungi were first mentioned by Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius in Rariorum plantarum historia (1601). Over the next couple of centuries, these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds, and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature. For example, the French botanist Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his work Traité des champignons (1790–3), erroneously suggested that peridioles were ejected from the fruiting bodies by some sort of spring mechanism.Brodie, p. 15. The structure and biology of the genus Crucibulum was better known by the mid-19th century, when the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne published a monograph on the bird's nest fungi. Subsequently, monographs were written in 1902 by Violet S. White (American species),Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1906, Gordon Herriot Cunningham in 1924 (New Zealand species), and Harold J. Brodie in 1975.Brodie, The Bird's Nest Fungi. The type species for the genus Crucibulum described by the Tulasne brothers was Crucibulum vulgare, an older synonym of the species known today as C. laeve. However, this naming choice was later deemed invalid by rules of fungal nomenclature; the first name validly applied to the species was C. laeve, use by De Candolle, who had based his species upon Nidularia laevis as it appeared in Bulliard's Histoire des Champignons de la France (Paris, 1791). Kambly and Lee published the first taxonomically valid description of the genus in 1936. In their 1844 monograph on the Nidulariaceae, the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne used the name Crucibulum vulgare, and the species was known by this name until the International Commission on the Taxonomy of Fungi (ICTF) changed the starting-point date for the naming of fungi, and C. vulgare was deemed invalid.Brodie, The Bird's Nest Fungi, p. 148. The etymology of the specific epithet is derived from the Latin laeve, meaning \\"smooth\\". Description Crucibulum species have light tan to cinnamon-colored fruiting bodies, known as a peridium, that are cup- or crucible-shaped. Depending on the species, the size of the peridium may range from 2–4 tall by 1.5–3 mm wide at the mouth (for C. parvulum)Brodie, p. 149. to 5–10 mm tall by 5–8 mm wide (for C. laeve). Viewed microscopically, the wall of the peridium is made of a single layer of tissue, in contrast to the three-layered peridium wall in Cyathus species. The outer surface of the peridium has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments, a condition known as fibrillose; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively smooth surface. Cross section of C. laeve fruiting bodies in various stages of developmentYoung specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within. There are usually 4–6 peridioles (up to 15 have been noted for C. laeve) that are disc-shaped, whitish in color, and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a funicular cord. Made of mycelia, The funicular cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages. Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are thick-walled, translucent (hyaline) or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8 µm. the spores of C. cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved. Because the basic fruiting body structure in all genera of the family Nidulariaceae is essentially similar, Crucibulum may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Cyathus, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus that may have the hairy ectoperidium worn off.Brodie, p. 147. It distinguished from Nidula by the presence of a funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.Brodie, p. 150. Drawing of a cross-section through a part of a young fruiting body, showing the developing peridioles =Peridiole structure= Derived from the Greek word , meaning \\"small leather pouch\\", the peridiole is the \\"egg\\" of the bird's nest. It is a mass of basidiospores and glebal tissue enclosed by a hard and waxy outer shell. In Crucibulum, the disc-shaped peridioles are light buff or white; the is due to a persistent layer of tissue surrounding the peridioles, called a tunica. Inside the peridiole is a spore-bearing tissue (the hymenium) that is made of spore-bearing cells (basidia), sterile (non-reproductive) structures, and spores. Peridioles are attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In Crucibulum species the peridioles is covered by a whitish tunica.Brodie, p. 129. The funiculus of Crucibulum species is markedly different from those of Cyathus species: in Crucibulum, the purse is a rounded knob 0.3–0.5 mm wide, attached to the underside of the peridiole. Attaching the purse directly to the wall of the peridium is a stout yellow-grey cord 0.1 mm wide and about 2.5 mm long.Brodie, p. 86.  Spore dispersal  Douglas-fir cone Spores are dispersed when a peridiole is dislodged by raindrops or water dripping off an over-hanging leaf. The smooth inner walls of the fruiting body consistently form an angle of 70–75° with the horizontal; it has been demonstrated experimentally that the combined effect of the crucible shape and internal wall angle produce a good splash action.Brodie, The Bird's Nest Fungi, pp. 88–89, 96–97. The force of the falling water splashes out the peridiole, uncoiling and snapping the funiculus, the cord that connects it to the fruiting body. As the peridiole continues its flight, the funiculus extends to its full length. The sticky end of the funiculus may adhere to a leaf or a twig some distance away, and the peridiole may end up being wrapped around or hanging down the object to which the funiculus is stuck. The spores can germinate when the thick outer wall of the peridiole wears away, or the peridiole may be eaten by a herbivorous animal, and ultimately passed through its digestive system. This method of spore dispersal, first suggested by John Ray in the late 17th century, was tested experimentally by Martin (1927), and more thoroughly by Buller and Brodie in the 1940s.Brodie, The Bird's Nest Fungi, pp. 93–100. Life cycle The life cycle of Crucibulum, which contains both haploid and diploid stages, is typical of the species of Basidiomycota that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Like other wood-decay fungi, this life cycle may be considered as two functionally different phases: the vegetative stage for the spread of mycelia, and the reproductive stage for the establishment of spore-producing structures, the fruiting bodies. Cross section of C. laeve fruiting bodies in various stages of development The vegetative stage encompasses those phases of the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell- wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. Crucibulum laeve is saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.Deacon, pp. 231–234. After a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruiting body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruiting bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruiting bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruiting bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.Deacon, pp. 31–32.  Development  The initial studies on the development of the fruiting bodies in Crucibulum were performed by the brothers Tulasne (1844), Sachs (1855), DeBary (1866),DeBary A. (1866). Beiträge zur Morphologie und Physiologi der Pilze. Leipzig. Eidam (1877),Eidam E. (1876–7). \\"Keimung der Sporen und die Entdehung der Fruchtkörper bie den Nidularien\\". Cohn's Beiträge Biologie 2: 221–45. and Walker (1920). Collectively, these early researchers determined that basidiospores are produced on club-shaped basidia which line the internal cavity of the peridiole. Basidia typically have 4 spores, attached by a short projection (a sterigma); after being detached from the basidia the spores migrate towards the center of the peridiole concurrently with the collapse and gelatinization of the underlying tissues.  Bioactive compounds  Skeletal formula of salfredin B11. A total synthesis of the compound was achieved in 1998. Grown in liquid culture, Crucibulum laeve produces bioactive chemicals called salfredins that are structurally related to benzofuran and chromene, molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five-membered ring structures; these compounds are unique to this species. Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin- type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an enzyme that has been implicated in the formation of cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes mellitus. The salfredin compounds may have therapeutic use in the treatment of this disorder. Habitat and distribution Like other bird's nest fungi, Crucibulum species are saprobic and derive their nutrients from decomposing organic matter. They are typically found growing on wood and woody debris such as stems, twigs, wood chips, old nut shells, and old matting; they are sometimes found on \\"dried manure cakes\\". Brodie notes (of C. laeve) they are \\"never\\" found on soil or large logs. C. parvulum has been found on the roots and stems of old or dead dry land plants such as Juniperus horizontalis and Artemisia species. C. laeve, the most well-known species of Crucibulum, is a temperate-zone species with a circumpolar distribution. It has been collected in most European countries and the Canary Islands; in North America it has been found from Alaska to Mexico, while South American locations include Chile and Tierra del Fuego. It has also been found in Australia, Iceland, Japan, and New Zealand. C. parvulum has a primarily North American distribution, having been found in Alaska, southern Alberta Badlands, the Canadian Rocky Mountains and in semi-deserts of Idaho; in 2004 it was collected in China. C. cyathiforme is only known from Colombia—where it was discovered growing at an elevation of nearly 7000 feet (2146 metres)— and Armenia.  Edibility  Species in the family Nidulariaceae, including Crucibulum, are considered inedible, as they are \\"not sufficiently large, fleshy, or odorous to be of interest to humans as food\\".Brodie, p. 119. However, there have not been reports of poisonous alkaloids or other substances considered toxic to humans.  Species  Until the 1970s Crucibulum was thought to be monotypic, containing the single species C. laeve (formerly C. vulgaris). This was in part due to the stance that Curtis Gates Lloyd and other mycologists had taken in the early 20th century, believing that the designation of new species was not justifiable due to the existence of intermediate forms in similar habitats and close proximity. In 1970–71, Brodie discovered and reported two variants that differed from C. laeve sufficiently to justify naming them as new species. = C. cyathiforme = The specific epithet of this species refers to the vase-like or Cyathus-like (obconic) form of the peridia. It differs from Crucibulum laeve in the shape and pink-color of its peridia, as well as its slightly or strongly curved spores (typically 6.5–8 x 11–17 µm). It was found growing on rotten wood and soil in Colombia by mycologist Gastón Guzmán. = C. laeve = Close-up of the peridioles of C. laeve Peridia are 3–7 mm in diameter x 3–8 mm tall, cup- shaped, short and cylindrical with roughly parallel side walls. The tomentose exterior surface is tan to yellow when young and whiter in age. Young specimens have a coarsely tomentose epiphragm (membranous cover) that soon disappears. The peridioles are 1–2 mm broad, tan to white in color, disc- shaped, and wrinkled when dry. This species grows on material like twigs, lignin-rich vegetable debris, wood chips, old matting, or manure. The immature fruiting body of Crucibulum laeve (technically, the peridium), is roughly spherical in shape, but in maturity the base is narrowed slightly relative to the top, so that it appears like a cup, or crucible. The fruiting bodies are usually 5–8 mm tall and almost as wide at the mouth. When young, the mouth is enclosed by a thin membrane called an epiphragm, which is covered with surface hairs. As the fruiting body matures and the fruiting body expands, the epiphragm ruptures, exposing the internal contents. The wall of the fruiting body is made of a single uniform layer of closely interwoven hyphae (the threadlike filaments that form the mycelium) roughly 0.25–0.5 mm thick; this wall structure is in contrast to species from the bird's nest fungus genus Cyathus, which have a distinctly three-layered wall. Young species have a yellowish velvety cover of fine hairs, but this external surface becomes sloughed off and becomes smooth as the fruiting body matures; the color changes to brown, although some old weathered specimens may be bleached grey or dirty white. The inner surface of the fruiting body is smooth and shiny. The cups contain tiny pale ochraceous or white \\"eggs,\\" technically termed peridioles, usually 1–2 mm in diameter. In each peridiole is a spore-producing layer of tissue, the hymenium. This layer is largely composed of basidia (spore-producing cells) mixed with paraphyses (non-spore producing elements interspersed between basidia). Peridioles are covered by a thin membrane of loosely woven hyphae known as a tunica; separated from the light-colored tunica, the peridioles are black. The peridioles are attached to the inner wall of the peridium by a thin, elastic cord of mycelium, a funiculus, which can be extended at length when moist. Crucibulum laeve has spores that are elliptical, hyaline (translucent), and smooth, with dimensions of 7–10 by 4–6 µm. =C. parvulum= This species is characterized by its very small peridia (dimensions 1.5–3 mm wide at the mouth x 2–4 mm tall) with a color that may range from white to grey to pale buff, but never yellow – helping distinguish it from C. laeve. The peridia are obconic, thin-walled (150–180 µm at the lip, approximately 300 µm thick at the edge of the lip), tomentose on the outer side and smooth on the inner side, and taper to a narrow base. The peridioles range in width between 0.5–1.25 mm broad. Basidiospores have dimensions of 4–5 by 7–8 µm.

In 1959, he became the first player in the history of the Big Ten Conference to lead the conference in both points (469) and rebounds (379). Burton turned down offers to play in the NBA in order to attend medical school and received his medical degree in 1963. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1988. Muskegon Heights High School A native of Muskegon, Michigan, Burton played three years for Muskegon Heights High School from 1953-1955. He set the school scoring records with 1,141 points and led the team to the state basketball championship in 1954. Burton scored 22 points in the championship game, a 43-41 victory over Flint Northern before a crowd of 11,835 at Jenison field house in East Lansing, Michigan. Burton's 423 points in 1954 represented 35% of the team's season total, and he was named to the All-Tournament High School Basketball Team selected by the Associated Press. The championship was the first for Muskegon coach Oscar (Okie) Johnson who had been the school's coach for 27 years. Burton was a straight \\"A\\" student who graduated second in his class from Muskegon Heights High School. University of Michigan Over 50 colleges and universities offered scholarships to Burton, but Burton selected the University of Michigan, which offered him an academic scholarship and an opportunity to attend medical school. Burton played forward for the Michigan Wolverines basketball team. In 1959, Burton was selected to the first-team All-Big Ten team and was named the Most Valuable Player on the Michigan team. He scored 460 points and collected 379 rebounds in 1959, both of which broke the Michigan school records. His 1959 totals also made him the first player to lead the Big Ten Conference in both scoring and rebounds in the same year. Medical school and semi-pro basketball On graduating from high school, Burton announced he was not interested in playing in the NBA and would instead continue his studies at the University of Michigan Medical School. Despite Burton's stated intention, the Detroit Pistons selected him as the 73rd pick in the 1959 NBA Draft. The Pistons offered Burton $15,000 a year to play in the NBA, but Burton declined. He later recalled that, in 1959, the NBA did not offer an income that could compete with a career as a medical doctor. He noted: > \\"The money made my decision earlier. Even the Pistons general manager at the > time admitted that a degree in medicine would be worth more to me in five > years than a career in basketball.\\" While turning down the NBA, Burton did play semi-pro basketball to help pay his way through medical school. In the summer of 1959, he toured with an All- Star team playing against the Harlem Globetrotters. During his first two years of medical school, he played on weekends for the Holland Oilers in the Midwest Professional Basketball League (\\"MPBL\\"). He also played for the Battle Creek Warriors in 1961 and the Toledo Tartans in 1962. Burton graduated from medical school in 1963 and accepted an internship in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he supplemented his income by playing for the Grand Rapids Tackers of the MPBL. In 1964, Burton was inducted into the U.S. Navy. He was stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, where he was permitted to play the 1964-65 season for the Grand Rapids Tackers in the newly formed North American Basketball League (\\"NABL\\"). Burton's Naval duties prevented him from playing in the 1965-66 season, but he returned to the Tackers from 1966-1969. During the 1967-68 season, he led the Tackers to the NABL championship, led the league in rebounds, was third in scoring, and was selected as the NABL's Most Valuable Player. Medical practice After the 1968-69 NABL season, Burton ended his semi-pro basketball career and opened a medical practice in Grand Rapids, Michigan, specializing in obstetrics, gynecology, and infertility. Burton is a lecturer at schools, where he encourages students not to place all their eggs in the sports basket. He notes: > \\"Kids need more varied role models. … [E]verybody goes out and buys a $180 > pair of Reeboks and thinks that is what is going to happen to them. Instead, > maybe they should buy the old $30 pair of tennis shoes and two books by > Hemingway or someone else just in case things don't work out. You can have > two dreams. Politics, education, the science fields, the computer age is > here - there are so many dreams that these kids can have.\\" Burton currently works at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona as director of the ambulatory surgical center.http://healpth.com/doctors/memie-burton-770712/ He also maintains a practice in obstetrics and gynecology in Phoenix.http://www.doctorsdig.com/dr- memie-burton.html See also *University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor References Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:African- American basketball players Category:Basketball players from Arkansas Category:Basketball players from Michigan Category:Detroit Pistons draft picks Category:People from Blytheville, Arkansas Category:Sportspeople from Muskegon, Michigan Category:Michigan Wolverines men's basketball players Category:Small forwards Category:University of Michigan Medical School alumni Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"M.

Their fruit bodies resemble tiny egg-filled bird nests. The name comes from the Latin nidus meaning nest. The related genus Mycocalia was segregated from Nidularia in 1961 based on differences in the microscopic structure of the peridium. Taxonomy The name Nidularia first appeared in the scientific literature in 1790 when Pierre Bulliard published N. vernicosa and N. laevis. This name, however, was not validly published, as it predated the starting point for naming of gasteroid fungi (1801), and it lacked a generic description. Jean Bulliard gave a generic description in 1791 when he added N. striata. N. striata and N. vernicosa are now placed in Cyathus, while N. laevis is in Crucibulum. Bulliard's concept of Nidularia is synonymous with Cyathus. Nidularia was again circumscribed in 1817 by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries and his student Johann Nordholm. N. radicata, N. confluens, N. deformis, and N. denudata. Nidularia farcta was given as the type species; today both this taxon as well as N. radicata are thought to be synonymous with Nidularia deformis. N. denudata is now the type species of a related genus, Mycocalia. Granularia, a genus erected by Albrecht Wilhelm Roth in 1791 to contain Granularia pisiformis (now Nidularia deformis), is synonymous with Nidularia. In 1961, J.T. Palmer separated Nidularia section Sorosia as a distinct genus, Mycocalia, combining Nidularia denudata, N. castanea, N. fusispora, and N. reticulata, and adding the new species Mycocalia minutissima. In these species, the peridium comprises hyaline, branched, septate hyphae with clamp connections. In contrast, the peridium of Nidularia have tinted, rigid, spiny, aseptate hyphae that continue into long threads. The peridium of Mycocalia species is thin, white and short-lasting, while in Nidularia it is somewhat darker in color and more robust. Formerly classified in the family Nidulariaceae, along with other bird's nest fungi genera (Cyathus, Crucibulum, Nidula, and Mycocalia), molecular phylogenetic analysis has shown that these fungi belong in the family Agaricaceae. Description Fruit bodies of species in this genus grow together in large groups, and have dimensions that are typically 0.5–6 mm in diameter by 0.5–3 mm tall. They may be somewhat irregular in shape, or have a well-formed cup that is thin and fragile. The peridium has a tomentose surface composed of irregular, spiny hyphae over a more compact wall that later breaks down to expose may brown peridioles within. Unlike other bird's-nest genera formerly classified in the family Nidulariaceae, the peridioles of the Nidularia are not connected to the fruit body by a funicular cord, but rather lay clumped together in a gelatinous matrix. There may be over 100 peridioles embedded in the matrix. In Nidularia pulvinata, they have an average size of 1.1 mm diameter by 0.5 mm thickness, with an average mass of 0.2 grams. This species has an estimated 7 million spores per peridiole. Spores are roughly elliptical in shape, hyaline, and usually with dimensions of 5–10.5 by 4–5.5 µm. Nidularia griseolazulina, however, has larger spores than typical, measuring 14–18 by 10–14 µm. Habitat and distribution Nidularia species are saprophytic, and grow on rotting wood. The thin, fragile peridium is ruptured by falling raindrops, after which the impact of additional raindrops spreads the internal matrix and dislodges the peridioles within. The splash mechanism of Nidularia pulvinata discharges periodioles horizonally at speeds ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 meters per second, with ejection distances averaging .

Over time, the library has undergone several organisational changes. The Library endured through Qing dynasty, Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China. It witnessed greatest changes that took place in modern China and by itself gives clear records to the one-century history of modern China. Resources of books: Most of books were collected in 1949 (The year of establishment of People's Republic of China), including both printed and written document literature. Currently, the number of collection books in Nanjing Library is 2.3 million. One feature of Nanjing Library is ancient documents which is 1.6 million. = Jiangnan Library = In 1907 Duan Fang, Viceroy of Liangjiang, established Jiangnan Library on the site of Xiyin Academy at Nanjing in order to preserve ancient books and scrolls of Song Dynasty, Yuan Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, and Qing Dynasty. Miao Quansun () was appointed to be the librarian. The Jiangnan Library was the first modern public library in China. = China Studies Library= Jiangnan Library was renamed China Studies Library (or Library of Chinese Studies, 國學圖書館) during the Nationalist Government. In 1927, the University District System was adopted in Jiangsu Province, and according to the system, Jiangnan Library was to be administered by the national university with the additional function of administering educational affairs in Jiangsu, in that year, and then in the May 1928 it was renamed as Library of Chinese Studies, National Central University, the name of which university was successively changed from National Southeastern University to Nanjing Zhongshan University in 1927, Jiangsu University and then Central University in 1928 and finally Nanjing University in 1949. Liu Yizheng () was appointed to be the chief librarian. In October 1929, the University District System was abolished, and the library was administered by the Jiangsu Department of Education and was renamed as Jiangsu Provincial Library of Chinese Studies. = National Central Library = In 1933, the China Ministry of Education built the National Central Library () on Chengxian Street in Nanjing. The Library was relocated several times due to the Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. Jiang Fucong () was the chief librarian. Towards the end of 1948, Jiang Fucong took about 130,000 volumes of rare books to Taiwan under instructions of Republic of China. The core of this collection was formed by the \\"Rare Book Preservation Society\\" () in 1940-41. In May 1949, the library was handed over to the Nanjing Military Control Commission. During the civil war National Central Library moved to Taipei and the remained in Nanjing was later renamed Nanjing Library. = Nanjing Library = On March 19, 1950, National Central Library was renamed as National Nanjing Library by the Ministry of Culture, and was put under the joint administration of the Bureau of Cultural Relics and Ministry of Culture. He Changqun was appointed as chief librarian. In October 1952, National Nanjing Library merged with Jiangsu Provincial Library of Chinese Studies. In July 1954 the library renamed Nanjing Library and was supervised by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Culture. Wang Changbing was appointed as chief librarian.

Located on 47.45 acres, its anchor stores are Hobby Lobby, Jewel Osco, Bed Bath & Beyond and Art Van Furniture. Former anchors include Best Buy, Bally Total Fitness, Old Country Buffet, Blockbuster Video, Gamestop, Office Max, Sports Authority, TJ Maxx, Venture, Wonder and The Great Indoors. The mall is located on Waukegan Road, north of the Edens Spur and south of Lake Cook Road.  History  In 1970, 30 acres of land were purchased from Louis Werhane, a local farmer, with the plan to develop it into a mall. Primary construction was completed in 1971, with the mall's name being chosen by the winner of a drawing. The name is a combination of the two towns which the mall primarily serves: Deerfield and Northbrook. Originally the internal theme of the mall was of a communal street scene with street lamps and water fountains featuring brass frogs and other sculptures of aquatic marine life. Sunken communal seating areas contributed to the small-town Main Street-like feel. The floor is mostly made of heavily lacquered-over red and brown bricks. Venture, the now defunct retail chain, was a ten-year tenant in the mall. Previous to Venture, the space housed a Turn Style store. Venture closed and vacated the space in January 1989. Other large retailers who vacated the mall, primarily as a result of the economic failure and reduction of the chains themselves, include Service Merchandise, Spiegel Outlet, John M. Smyth's Homemakers, and Montgomery Ward. Marshalls originally occupied the interior space, hosting T.J. Maxx. Montgomery Ward also operated an auto repair and tire facility in a separate outbuilding immediately southeast of the main mall, built in 1986 and last occupied by Bally Total Fitness, and closed in the summer of 2012 the building was eventually torn down. Best Buy, which occupied the former Spiegel space, closed in 2012. The former Best Buy space became a Hobby Lobby in 2015. The former Service Merchandise space was later, briefly occupied by The Great Indoors, and then for three months by a local children's superstore called Wonder!. In 2014, TJ Maxx, the last remaining tenant of the interior mall, announced that it would be relocating. Deerbrook Mall formerly housed a four- screen General Cinema movie theater, which opened in the mid-1970s as a two- screen. Two auditoriums were added in the 1980s. The theater closed in 2001 amid the company's bankruptcy and never re-opened. In 2017, the theater, store fronts, mall interior and Ulta Beauty were demolished to make way for new construction between Hobby Lobby, south and Art Van Furniture, north. Sports Authority had closed their store as part of the chain's bankruptcy in 2016. Art Van Furniture opened Wednesday December 13, 2017, in the former Sports Authority location. Office Max closed on Saturday, December 16, 2017. On March 5, 2020, it was announced that Art Van Furniture would be closing as Art Van prepares to file for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and plans to close all locations.Art Van closing its stores CNN, 5 March 2020  1994 fire  In May 1994, a fire broke out in the Bed, Bath, and Beyond store. 12 separate town's fire departments and the Northern Illinois Police Alarm System responded to the blaze, which began on the loading dock and spread to the interior of the store, damaging merchandise and the interior ceiling.  Renovation  In 1998, Atlanta-based Lend Lease Real Estate Investments Inc. (Lendlease Group) acquired Deerbrook Mall on behalf of one of its public pension fund clients from Valenti Builders, a Northfield, Illinois based company. The new owners began a major interior and exterior renovation to update the aging mall which had been plagued by high vacancy rates.

Newman railway station was a station on the Wairarapa Line in the Tararua District area of the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand’s North Island. It served the small rural community of Newman, north of Eketahuna. It is accessed via Cliff Road, but is now located on private property.  History  Early years = The crossing of the Makakahi River by the Wellington – Woodville railway in December 1894 enabled the establishment of a station at Newman. The station was initially freight-only, while passenger trains continued to terminate at nearby Eketahuna as it was the nearest station with passenger accommodations. After the railway reached Eketahuna in 1889, local timber merchant Tom Price established a sawmill at Newman, named Albion Mill. At first, the timber was transported by cart to Eketahuna to be shipped out, but this caused problems with the local council when inclement weather caused his carts to damage the roads. Therefore, when Newman station was established, a siding was laid north of the station to his mill at the township of Newman. Until the mill closed in March 1900, it provided a significant source of traffic for the station. Price’s operations were responsible for of totora, rimu, and matai being shipped to his timber yard in Petone. Captain Alfred Shout VC = Nireaha Tramway = One of the most significant aspects of Newman’s history is its short-lived status as the junction with the Nireaha Tramway from 1895 to 1900. Unlike many other timber tramways of the period, the Nireaha Tramway was constructed to railway standards, with a fully ballasted track and iron rails, and used the national track gauge of . Permission was first sought in 1893 to construct the line, and was intended to resolve the problems caused by transporting timber using carts on the roads. Price was fortunate in that an economic depression had caused work on the government Wellington – Woodville railway to stall at Eketahuna, leading to the availability of a pool of skilled labour. These men were employed by Price to construct and run his tramway. The line started at the Albion Mill and passed by the township of Nireaha before terminating at a sawmill Price had established there on the eastern bank of the Mangatainoka River. This mill was destroyed by fire shortly after commencing operation and was not replaced. Motive power was initially provided by horses, but later a unique Aveling and Porter steam locomotive was employed. The locomotive was a wood-burner, and was imported from England by Price who had it assembled at Newman. It started service on 2 July 1896, and was driven by a local settler. Following the closure of the mill, the locomotive was relocated to Petone and later sold to mill operators in the King Country where it ended its working life in the 1920s. By 1900 most of the native timber in the area had been milled, causing Price to close his mill and relocate his plant to Dannevirke. Other millers in Nireaha continued to use the tramway, employing horses for motive power, and Eastern Nireaha children also used the line as a walking track to get to school in Newman. Shown here are the only obvious remnants of the railway history of the site, including the station's loading bank (left).  Services  After completion of the main line to Woodville in 1897, Newman became a stopping place for a variety of locomotive-hauled trains. Later passenger services were provided first by the Wairarapa-class RM railcars, and later, the twinset railcars. The 1959 railcar timetable for the Woodville–Masterton–Wellington and Wellington–Masterton–Woodville routes shows Newman as a \\"stops if required\\" station for the 15 services both ways each week. Railcar services were withdrawn from the Wairarapa Line in the mid-1970s, after which locomotive- hauled carriage trains provided passenger services on the northern section until they were cancelled on 1 August 1988. By this time Newman had been closed to passenger traffic for nearly two decades.  Today  Little can be found at the station site now to indicate what was once located there. The main loading bank and the remains of a building or other loading facility are the only visible remnants.

The village, near the coast four kilometers south of the regency capital Semarapura, contains a number of structures of cultural interest, and is known for its pottery and handwoven ceremonial songket cloth. The height of the village's power came during the kingdom of Gelgel, which dominated Bali from around the early 16th century to 1686. There are no traces left today of the old royal palace (puri). The old ancestral shrine of the ruling dynasti, Pura Jero Agung, is still standing in the old palace area. To the east of Pura Jero Agung is another old temple, Pura Dasar, which is a lowland counterpart of the \\"mother temple\\" of Bali, Pura Besakih. The village also contains the oldest mosque in Bali, which was built by Javanese retainers of the old kings.Adrian Vickers, 'Sights of Klungkung; Bali's most illustrious kingdom', in Eric Oey (ed.), Bali; Island of the Gods. Singapore: Periplus 1990, p. 168.  Early history  The history of Gelgel is described in detail in the traditional chronicles (babad), in particular the 18th-century work Babad Dalem. According to these texts, the conquest of Bali by the Hindu Javanese kingdom of Majapahit was followed by the installation of a vassal dynasty in Samprangan in the present-day regency Gianyar, close to the old royal centre Bedulu. This installation took place in the age of the Majapahit minister Gajah Mada (d. 1364). The first Samprangan ruler Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan had three sons. The eldest, Dalem Samprangan, succeeded his father, but turned out to be a vain and incompetent ruler. His youngest brother Dalem Ketut founded a new royal seat in Gelgel, while Samprangan's power waned. He later visited Majapahit and received powerful heirlooms (pusaka) from the king Hayam Wuruk. After a while the Majapahit kingdom fell into chaos and vanished, leaving Dalem Ketut and his Balinese kingdom as the heirs of its Hindu-Javanese culture.I Wayan Warna et al. (1986), Babad Dalem; Teks dan terjemahan. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidkan dan Kebudayaan Propinsi Daerah Tingkat I Bali. This traditional account is problematic since it includes irreconcilable chronological difficulties; the Majapahit ruler Hayam Wuruk died in 1389, while the fall of Majapahit occurred much later, in the early 16th century.  The golden age  It is clear from a comparison of external and indigenous sources that Gelgel was a powerful polity in Bali in the 16th century. The son of Dewa Ketut, Dalem Baturenggong, presumably reigned in the mid 16th century. He received at his court a Brahmin sage called Nirartha who had fled from chaotic conditions on Java. A fruitful patron-priest relation was forged between the ruler and Nirartha, who engaged in extensive literary activity. In the time of Dalem Baturenggong, Lombok, West Sumbawa and Blambangan (easternmost Java) are thought to have come under Gelgel's suzerainty. After his death, his son Dalem Bekung led a troubled reign marked by two serious rebellions by court aristocrats (traditionally dated in 1558 and 1578), and a severe military defeat against the Javanese kingdom of Pasuruan. His brother and successor Dalem Seganing was a successful king whose long reign was relatively free from internal troubles. An indigenous list of dates places his death at 1623, although some historians have placed it later. The son of Dalem Seganing, Dalem Di Made, dispatched another unsuccessful expedition against Java, which was defeated by the king of Mataram.H. Hägerdal (1998), 'From Batuparang to Ayudhya; Bali and the Outside World, 1636-1655', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 154-1, p.66-7. At his old age he lost power to his foremost minister (patih), Anglurah Agung (Gusti Agung Maruti). Certain indigenous texts place his death at 1642, but historians have also proposed 1651 or c. 1665 as the correct date.H. Creese (1991), 'Balinese babad as historical sources; A reinterpretation of the fall of Gelgel', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 147-2. Dutch and Portuguese sources confirm the existence of a powerful kingdom in the 16th and 17th centuries, to which the neighbouring areas Lombok, West Sumbawa and Balambangan stood in a tributary or loosely subordinate relation. At the side of the king (dalem) stood senior ministers belonging to the Agung and Ler families, and a hereditary line of Brahmana preceptors.P.A. Leupe (1855), 'Schriftelijck rapport gedaen door den predicant Justus Heurnius', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 3, pp. 250-62. The Gelgel kingdom was threatened by the sea-oriented Makassar kingdom in c. 1619, which deprived it of its interests in Sumbawa and at least parts of Lombok. With Mataram fighting took place over the possession of Blambangan in 1635-1647; in the end Gelgel gained the upper hand.H.J. de Graaf (1958), De regering van Sultan Agung, vorst van Mataram, 1613-1645, en die van zijn voorganger Panembahan Seda-ing-Krapjak, 1601-1613.

The Dutch appeared on the island for the first time in 1597 and entered friendly relations with the Gelgel ruler. Subsequent relations between the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the kings of Gelgel were usually good, although attempts at concrete political cooperation were mostly unsuccessful. The Portuguese in Malacca dispatched an abortive missionary expedition to the king in 1635.H. Jacobs (1988), The Jesuit Makasar documents (1615-1682). Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 35; C. Wessels (1923), 'Een Portugeesche missie-poging op Bali in 1635', Studiën: Tijdschrift voor Godsdienst, Wetenschap en Letteren 99, pp. 433-43. European sources describe Bali at this time as a densely populated island with more than 300,000 people and a flourishing agricultural production. By the early 17th century it was linked to the economic networks of the Southeast Asian Archipelago through traders from the Pasisir area on Java's north coast. These traders exchanged pepper from the western part of the archipelago for cotton cloth produced on Bali, which was then brought to eastern Indonesia and the Philippines. There was no significant category of native Balinese merchants, however.B. Schrieke (1955), Indonesian sociological studies, Vol. I. The Hague & Bandung: Van Hoeve, pp. 20-1.  Fragmentation and fall  According to both indigenous and Dutch sources, internal fighting broke out in 1651 after the demise of a Gelgel ruler, and the internecine trouble continued over the next decades. The royal minister Anglurah Agung set himself up as ruler of Gelgel from at least 1665 but encountered opposition from various corners. Finally, in 1686, Anglurah Agung fell in battle against the nobleman Batulepang. After this event, a scion of the old royal line called Dewa Agung Jambe established himself as the new upper ruler, with his seat in Klungkung (Semarapura).H.J. de Graaf (1949), 'Goesti Pandji Sakti, vorst van Boeleleng', Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 83-1. The Klungkung kingdom would last until the 20th century. However, the new kingdom was unable to gather the elite groups on Bali like Gelgel had done. The rulers (Dewa Agung) of Klungkung continued to hold the position as paramount kings, but in fact the island was split up in several minor kingdoms (Karangasem, Sukawati, Buleleng, Tabanan, Badung, etc.). This situation of political fragmentation continued until the Dutch colonial conquest between 1849 and 1908. With the royal seat moved, Gelgel itself was turned into a village that was administered by a side-branch of the Dewa Agung dynasty. In about the 1730s the current Gelgel lord was attacked and killed by three princes of Karangasem, whose father he had murdered.H. Hägerdal (2001), Hindu rulers, Muslim subjects; Lombok and Bali in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Bangkok: White Lotus, p. 29. In 1908, during the Dutch intervention in Bali, the local lord attacked a troop of Dutch colonial soldiers, which was the catalyst for the well-known puputan of the Klungkung Palace (18 April 1908) where the royal dynasty and their retainers performed a suicidal attack against well-armed Dutch troops.M.

He also collaborated with musicians such as David Hebert and Kenji Williams. Interested in bringing contemporary art not only to the public space outside galleries and museums but outside of the Western context itself, Van Hove has been prolific in such diverse places as the Siwa Oasis in Egypt, Mount Kailash in Tibet, the Laguna de Perlas in Nicaragua, the Issyk Kul lake in eastern Kyrgyzstan, the Fianarantsoa province in Madagascar or more recently the foothills of the Himalayas in the northwestern part of Yunnan Province, China.Here at Van Hove's website.

In 2012, van Hove arrived in Marrakech, Morocco to resume work on an ambitious sculptural endeavor he had prepared for years: V12 Laraki. In the space of nine months, van Hove gathered around him 42 master craftsmen from the region and began rebuilding a Mercedes 6.2L V12 engine using rural materials and centuries old craft techniques from the North African country. Conceptually this sculpture is based on the story of the Laraki Fulgura, a Moroccan supercar by Industrial designer Abdeslam Laraki. While the Fulgura was entirely manufactured in Morocco to the exception of its engine, the artist decided to try and reproduce that cutting-edge component locally using craft, which accounts for 20% of the country’s work force and he saw as an unjustifiably neglected part of the national industry. That sculpture, displayed at the 5th Marrakech Biennale and soon acquired by the Hood Museum of Art, would rapidly become the cornerstone of a new chapter in his creative practice leading to the founding of his atelier also known as Fenduq or Atelier Eric van Hove: a context-specific production facility and, in his own word “a living socioeconomic sculpture”, from where the artist started working on “a renaissance of African craft”. V12 Laraki was later made into a comprehensive publication introduced by well-known African curator Simon Njami and distributed by Motto Distribution in Berlin. In the following years, many more sculptures came out of Atelier Eric van Hove including D9T (Rachel’s Tribute) in 2015, and Mahjouba I in 2016, which is a functioning replica of a Chinese electric motorbike using traditional African craft. In turn, this grew into what the artist called The Mahjouba Initiative, \\"Éric Van Hove - BBC In The Studio interview\\" a long term project mixing African craft, 3D printing, and industrial production. Mahjouba II, a second craft-made electric prototype was made later that year. The Mahjouba Initiative is a long term on going artistic project aiming to re-integrate Moroccan craft into the mainstream industry via the manufacturing of electric mopeds for the local market using materials and techniques from the craft sector. The Initiative relies on two main facts: the presence in Morocco of nearly three million craftsmen whose trade is increasingly threatened by globalization, and the Noor Power Station Project by which the north African country plans to generate 42% of its energy from renewables by 2020. In 2018, Van Hove was a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College. Fenduq is a large retrospective exhibition the Fries Museum dedicated to the artist that opened in 2019, which will travel to Vandalorum, Sweden in February 2020.

Professional wrestling career Cannon was born in Montreal, Quebec as George Arnold McCarther, and spent some time in the Canadian Football League with what are now the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He began wrestling in Japan in 1953. He wrestled for a while in Canada beginning in 1955, left for a time, and returned for good in 1959. He got the nickname \\"Crybaby\\" from his ability to wipe sweat from his face, making it look as though he were weeping. Cannon hosted a weekly variety show on KTLA-TV in Los Angeles from 1968 to 1970, when he returned to Canada. It was after his return to Canada that he managed the Kangaroos. The team feuded with The Stomper and Ben Justice in a storyline in which the Kangaroos supposedly broke The Stomper's leg. The teams feuded for two years, during which time The Stomper continually tried to get revenge by attacking Cannon. As a manager, he often came to the ring wearing a battle helmet and a ring jacket emblazoned across the back in large capital letters with the phrase \\"I AM RIGHT\\", with \\"CANNON\\" above that. Cannon worked for the American-based International Wrestling Association run by Eddie Einhorn in 1975. McCarther performed many duties, including wrestling, managing wrestlers, and booking events. Cannon was also involved in several other areas of wrestling, including publishing magazines and hosting a wrestling television show taped in Windsor, Ontario called Superstars of Wrestling, which was nationally syndicated throughout Canada during the early 1980s. He later partnered with World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon but later became unable to continue his duties due to phlebitis. Cannon continued to promote small wrestling shows until dying of cancer on July 1, 1994.

Their fruit bodies resemble tiny egg-filled birds' nests, from which they derive their common name \\"bird's nest fungi\\". Originally described in 1902, the genus differs from the related genera Cyathus and Crucibulum by the absence of a cord that attaches the eggs to the inside of the fruit body. The life cycle of this genus allows it to reproduce both sexually, with meiosis, and asexually via spores. Species in this genus produce a number of bioactive compounds, including 4-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone, a major component of raspberry flavor and insect attractor used in pesticides. Taxonomy The genus Nidula was originally proposed by Violet S. White in her monograph on the North American species of the Nidulariaceae, and included the species N. candida and N. microcarpa. The genus name is derived from the Latin nidula, meaning \\"little nest\\".Brodie, The Bird's Nest Fungi, p. 142. Although originally classified in the family Nidulariaceae, molecular phylogenetics demonstrated that the Nidulariaceae are part of the agaricoid clade, and Nidula was later transferred to the family Agaricaceae. Description The fruit bodies (peridia) of species in Nidula are typically between 3–8 mm in diameter, 5–15 mm tall, and cup- or urn-shaped—having almost vertical sides with the lip flared outwards. Depending on the species, the color may range from white, grey, buff, or tawny. The peridia are covered on the external surface with closely matted, shaggy hairs, technically called a tomentum. Immature peridia have a membrane covering the mouth (an epiphragm), which later ruptures into 4–7 lobes when mature. The \\"eggs\\", or peridioles, are numerous, grey-brown or reddish-brown in color, and embedded in a gelatinous matrix when young and fresh. In contrast to other genera of the Nidulariaceae, such as Cyathus or Crucibulum, the peridioles of the Nidula are not attached to the peridia by a cord of mycelia known as a funiculus. Spores are ovoid to elliptical in shape, thick-walled, light brown, and have dimensions of 8–10 by 4–6 µm. Habitat and distribution Species in Nidula have been found in North America, the Himalayas, and mountains in Japan. N. niveo-tomentosa has been collected at an elevation of on Blue Mountains in Jamaica. Life cycle The life cycle of the genus Nidula, which contains both haploid and diploid stages, is typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Basidiospores produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After dispersal, the spores germinate and grow into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each compartment. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Like other members of the Nidulariaceae, species in Nidula have a heterothallic (bifactorial) mating system. After a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruit bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruit bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores. Species There are five extant and one extinct species of Nidula: * N. baltica :Described in 2014 from a fossil found in Baltic amber. * N. candida : Peridia are 10 to 15 mm tall, grey to dark buff, with a recurved rim at maturity. The peridioles are 1.5–2 mm wide, and light grey-brown, and smooth. The spores are elliptical, with dimensions of 4–6 by 8–10 µm.Brodie, The Bird's Nest Fungi, p. 144. * N. macrocarpa : Peridia are 5 to 10 mm tall, and white to yellowish in color; the rim is either straight or slightly recurved. Peridioles are 0.5 to 1 mm wide, wrinkled, and colored red-brown. Spores are elliptical or roughly spherical, with dimensions of 6–9 by 5–6 µm. N. niveo- tomentosa * N. niveo-tomentosa : Peridia are 4–6 mm tall with rims that have a fringe of white hairs. Peridioles are mahogany-brown and 0.5–1 mm wide. Spores have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are 6–9 by 5–6 µm.Brodie, The Bird's Nest Fungi, p. 143. * N. emodensis : Peridia are 4–6 mm tall by 4–5 mm wide at the mouth. The exterior surface is a grey color, the interior smooth and whitish. Peridioles are reddish-brown to black, have minute wrinkles, and dimensions of 0.5–1 mm. The spores are somewhat elliptical, obovate, or pyriform. * N. shingbaensis :Peridia are 6–9 mm tall by 5–7 mm wide at the mouth. Found in India, it differs from other Nidula in having a six-layered peridium. Bioactive compounds The Nidula are known to produce a number of bioactive compounds. N. niveo-tomentosa grown in liquid culture makes niduloic acid (3-hydroxy-5-(p-hydroxyphenol)pentanoic acid), 4-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol, trans-4-p-hydroxyphenylbut-3-en-2-one, 4-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol, 4-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone, zingerone, 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-propanediol, and 4-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone. The latter compound is commonly known as \\"raspberry ketone\\", one of the major chemicals contributing to the flavour of raspberries. This chemical is used (in its acetate form) as an insect attractor in the pesticide Cue-lure, structurally related to the sex pheromone that female melon flies (sp. Bactrocera cucurbitae) use to attract males for mating. Nidula candida contains the sesquiterpene compounds nidulal and niduloic acid, both of which have weak cytotoxic and antibiotic activities.

He has been called l'Ame du Médoc (the soul of Médoc). Biography Martin was born in 1903 at Château Gruaud-Larose where his grandfather then was maître de chai and his father Alfred Martin a cooper, the family having lived in the region for more than three centuries. Martin served as president of CIVB from 1956 to the mid 60s, was a co-founder and leader of the Commanderie de Bordeaux, and was a leading figure in Le Bontemps du Médoc. He was also a vocal opponent of the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. Wine estates Martin built his own estate Château Gloria from the ground, with no historical reputation or other advantages such as applying for the Cru bourgeois classification, although by acquiring desirable vineyards from classed crus, to become one of Saint-Julien's best- known properties, within the space of a generation. The process began in 1942 with the purchase of of vines. With the help of his father who was initially angered by the initiative, the acquisition of land grew to amass . In 1963, Martin was also appointed manager, along with Jean-Paul Gardère, of the premier cru Château Latour when foreign investors gained control of the estate, and Martin became a driving force of innovations in research and investments of restorations and vineyard acquisitions as well as replanting. Martin and Gardère formally resigned from the Conseil d'Administration in 1987, marking the end of a 24-year era. With the personal ambition to own a classed growth, this was achieved in 1982 at age of 78 when Martin bought Château Saint-Pierre, a quatrième cru where his father had once worked, and set out to improve, with noticeable results. The estate is currently home to his daughter Françoise and her husband Jean-Louis Triaud, current general manager of the estates under Domaines Henri Martin. Martin died in February 1991.

The Holyoke Range continues to the west as Mount Norwottuck and to the east as Harris Mountain. Geology and ecology Long Mountain, like much of the Metacomet Ridge, is composed of basalt, also called traprock, a volcanic rock. The mountain formed near the end of the Triassic Period with the rifting apart of the North American continent from Africa and Eurasia. Lava welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent faulting and earthquake activity tilted the strata, creating the steep ridge and talus slopes of Long Mountain. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Massachusetts. Recreation Several trails are located on Long Mountain, most notably the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and the Robert Frost Trail which share the same footway on the mountain. Several ledges near the summit provide views of greater Amherst region and the Fort River valley. Most of Long Mountain has been conserved as part of the Mount Holyoke Range State Park; local conservations commissions and private land holders own the remaining acreage. The nearest trailhead to the summit is located on Harris Mountain Road precisely as it crosses the Granby to Amherst boundary line. This location can be accessed either via Bay Road in Amherst or Batchelor Street in Granby. The trail leading to the west leads to the summit.

His Moscow based, Candidates' quarter- final match against Lev Polugaevsky, is a one-sided affair and Karpov emerges the victor by 5½-2½. In the other candidates' quarter-final matches, Viktor Korchnoi beats Henrique Mecking in Augusta, Georgia, Tigran Petrosian beats Lajos Portisch in Palma de Mallorca, and Boris Spassky beats Robert Byrne in San Juan. In the semi-finals, Korchnoi defeats Petrosian by 3½-1½ in Odessa, while Karpov is again utterly convincing, winning 7-4 against Spassky in Leningrad. The battle between Karpov and Korchnoi in the (Moscow) final proves to be a tense and difficult struggle, although the younger man ultimately triumphs 12½-11½, amidst a large number of draws. As the winning candidate, Karpov is scheduled to meet Bobby Fischer for a world championship decider in 1975 and for his efforts in 1974, is awarded his second successive Chess Oscar. Meanwhile, Fischer puts forward a plan to FIDE for the conditions of the title match. Running to 179 numbered paragraphs, each of his conditions are acceptable to all parties, except for two. The rejected conditions concern the match being of unlimited length (first to win 10 games, regardless of draws) and that the title stays with the holder in the event of the score reaching 9-9. Fischer insists he will not back down on these stipulations and threatens to resign his title if they are not accepted. He has until April 1975 to finally decide. *Evgeny Vasiukov excels at Manila, winning the tournament with 10½/14, ahead of Tigran Petrosian (9½/14) and Bent Larsen (9/14). *Montilla-Moriles is won by Ivan Radulov with 5½/9. In joint second place are Lubomir Kavalek and Helmut Pfleger (both 5/9). Oddly, the winner is the lowest rated of the ten contestants and while there is a large percentage of draws, many of the games are exciting and worthy of such a strong competition. *The 14th IBM tournament is held at Amsterdam and is a close run affair, with three grandmasters all sharing first place. Borislav Ivkov, Vladimir Tukmakov and Vlastimil Jansa score an identical 10/15. As with the Manila and Montilla tournaments, the entrants are all titled players, making for one of the strongest events of the year. *The Nice Olympiad is held at the Palais des Expositions. Offering an enormous playing arena, the venue should surpass those of recent years, but a lack of air-conditioning and poor lighting provokes some criticism from the participants. After managing only narrow wins at Siegen and Skopje, the Soviets reassert their pre-eminence at Nice, winning convincingly with 46/60, to silver medalling Yugoslavia's 37½/60. Third place is shared between the US and Bulgaria with 36½/60. Bulgaria's excellent showing can be partly explained by the incentives offered by their federation. A team medal of any kind would have earned each player a car, but they just miss the bronze on tie-break. Anatoly Karpov, Boris Spassky, Tigran Petrosian and Mikhail Tal take home individual gold medals for outstanding performances on their respective boards, while Viktor Korchnoi and Gennady Kuzmin must settle for bronze. Petrosian scores 12½/14 for an 89.3% performance, the best of the event. Michael Stean picks up the $1000 Turover Brilliancy Prize for 'best game of the Olympiad' against Walter Browne. Wolfgang Uhlmann coins the phrase \\"One is permitted to lose to Karpov with Black\\" after suffering defeat in their round 4 encounter. *Tony Miles wins the 13th World Junior Chess Championship, held in Manila, after narrowly missing out the previous year to Alexander Beliavsky. Miles' good form keeps him on track to becoming England's first grandmaster. *The 42nd USSR Chess Championship is won jointly by Alexander Beliavsky and Mikhail Tal (both 9½/15), ahead of Rafael Vaganian and Lev Polugaevsky (both 9/15). *The annual Las Palmas tournament results in a win for Ljubomir Ljubojević, whose tally is 11/15. He is a full point clear of second placed pair Alexander Beliavsky and Fridrik Olafsson, both having 10/15. *There is a strong entry at Sochi, where Lev Polugaevsky triumphs at the 7th Chigorin Memorial, with a total of 11/15. Runner-up is Alexei Suetin (9/15). Polugaevsky continues the winning form he displayed earlier at Solingen, where he scored 10/14, taking the tie-break from Lubomir Kavalek (also 10/14) and finishing well ahead of Boris Spassky and Bojan Kurajica (tied third on 8½/14). *Reykjavík is won by Vasily Smyslov with 12/14, ahead of Gyozo Forintos (11/14) and, tied in third place on 10½/14, Dragoljub Velimirovic and David Bronstein. *Mikhail Tal wins at Halle in East Germany with 11½/15, ahead of Rainer Knaak (10½/15) and Jan Smejkal (10/15). He is also a winner at Lublin and Novi Sad. *Vladimir Liberzon is victorious in Venice, taking first place with 9½/13, ahead of Vasily Smyslov (9/13) and Duncan Suttles (8½/13). A strong field includes rising stars Ulf Andersson and Jan Timman, as well as former USSR Champion Vladimir Savon. *The Hastings International Chess Congress has another good turnout of overseas grandmasters. A four-way tie for first place occurs between László Szabó, Mikhail Tal, Jan Timman and Gennady Kuzmin (all 10/15). *The 11th Capablanca Memorial Tournament is held in Camagüey, Cuba. Ulf Andersson wins with 11½/15, from Eduard Gufeld (11/15). Third place is shared between Evgeny Vasiukov and Rainer Knaak on 10/15. *The first Pan-American Championship is held in Winnipeg. It is won by Walter Browne ahead of an otherwise weak field. Browne has an eventful and rewarding year, winning the U.S. Championship in Chicago for the first of six times, scoring further victories at Wijk aan Zee and Lone Pine, and narrowly losing out to Bent Larsen at the 2nd World Open in New York City. *Jonathan Mestel wins the first ever World Cadet Championship, held in Pont-Sainte-Maxence in France. This is to become a regular and important event in the junior chess calendar and is a forerunner to the World Youth Festivals that expand to cover many more age categories. *Bulgaria's great effort and high placing at the Olympiad is followed by an intensely competitive national championship. Held at Asenovgrad, the result is a tie between Nikola Padevsky and Ivan Radulov (both 10/15), ahead of Evgeny Ermenkov, just a half point off the pace. *The 1st World Computer Chess Championship takes place in Stockholm. It is won by the program Kaissa (USSR), followed by Chess 4.0 (USA), which defeats third placed Ribbit (CAN) in a play-off for second. There are many interesting games and some surprising moves arise from tactical complications. The championship shows that chess computers are making rapid progress, although the quality of the endgame play is still very poor and poses no threat to human players of average strength. *The People's Republic of China makes an application for membership of FIDE. *The first chess book published in the United States by a major publisher using algebraic notation is printed.

The triumphal scene gives directors the opportunity for elaborate spectacle typical of the grand opera of the period in the nineteenth century. It often played during graduation ceremonies in Latin America and the Philippines which is also called the Martsang Pandangál (Filipino for \\"Honours March\\") which is an excerpt from Verdi's march.

Fleming is the fifty-third inductee into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame, recognized in the Meritorious Service category on June 12, 2008. His Total Performance Average statistical analysis is a standard metric for professional performance. Career As a child, Fleming had a keen interest in statistics. At the age of nine, when he began learning the game of pocket billiards, he made detailed records of his runs, how much he played, and his practice time. His love of statistics is how he came to create the Accu-Stats score-keeping system, which is still used today to measure the accuracy of pool games. Pat Fleming played straight pool in the 1970s and early 1980s. He has made many contributions to cue sport, but his most notable contributions is the creation and continuing development of Accu- Stats Video Productions, based in Butler, New Jersey. Accu-Stats Video Productions has been videotaping more than 1,000 tournament matches and preserved performances by the world’s greatest pool and billiards players since the mid-1980s. Fleming started the enterprise to document matches for statistical analysis. (An Accu-Stats Total Performance Average is now a widely known and recognized measure of pool performance levels.) Fleming started to offer videotapes of those famous performances and players for sale to players and fans of pocket billiards. Today, the VHS tapes and DVDs are invaluable as entertainment and training tools, along with the most complete video record of two generations of famous pool players. The BCA Hall of Fame Board held a general election deciding if Allen Hopkins and Fleming would be inducted into the BCA Hall of Fame for their careers and their work in early April 2008. The Board has a total of 52 members. Those members are current Hall of Fame members, billiard industry promoters and historians, and members of the billiard media. As it was voted that Hopkins and Fleming would be inducted, they became the fifty-second and fifty-third industry figures inducted into the BCA Hall of Fame, which was established in 1966. Fleming and Hopkins were inducted to the BCA Hall of Fame during the induction ceremony on June 12, 2008, at the Charlotte Convention Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.

At one point, he and an athletics department official argued publicly over the failure to secure recruit Tyree Evans and the transfer of Gus Gilchrist, two highly touted local players. Athletic director Deborah Yow responded to the situation by vowing support for Williams and ensured her intent to honor his current contract. Soon after, The Washington Post published a three-part feature on Maryland basketball that was critical of Gary Williams.

The battle was caused by the Mahdist blockade of the Ginnis-Kosha Fort, which British commanders hoped to relieve. The fighting resulted in a British victory that is principally remarkable as the last battle that was certainly fought by the British Army in red coats although a maxim battery from the Connaught Rangers may have fought in red at the Battle of Ferkeh in 1896.  Background  Situation = In 1884, a Sudanese Islamic religious leader, Muhammad Ahmed, also known as \\"The Mahdi\\", planned and executed a series of attacks that left a British general, William Hicks, and thousands of ill- trained Egyptian soldiers dead at the hands of angry Arab rebels called Dervishes or, more accurately, Mahdists. The Sudan was controlled by an Anglo- Egyptian administration. After it was decided that something must be done, General Charles Gordon was sent by the British government to be the Egyptian Army's Governor-General there. Gordon and his aide, Colonel John Donald Hamill Stewart, carried orders from both governments to evacuate the town from the Mahdi. Instead, Gordon built up the town's defenses and prepared for a siege. The British government sent two relief columns, the slow River Column and the mobile Desert Column, to rescue Gordon, Stewart and the Egyptian garrison. After both columns won hard-fought battles in Kirbekan and Abu Klea, respectively, Stewart was found to have bee been murdered by wandering Arabs north of Khartoum after his steamboat ran aground, and the treachery of an Egyptian deputy commander had allowed Khartoum to have been fallen. Gordon was killed, and the columns retreated, leaving behind a series of forts. One of the forts was near the towns of Kosha and Ginnis, in northern Sudan, where a detachment of Cameron Highlanders and Egyptian-Sudanese troops from the Ninth Sudanese Battalion were stationed. Thousands of Mahdist warriors, led by their provincial amirs, began raiding in the vicinity of Ginnis. They besieged the fort, the garrison's Gardner gun was once dismounted by a Mahdist artillery barrage. General Evelyn Wood, the British commander in Egypt and the sirdar (commander) of the Egyptian Army, became concerned about the siege and the raids and ordered Major General Francis Grenfell, with a force of two infantry brigades and a cavalry brigade, to rid the area of Mahdists. = Grenfell's force = The First Brigade consisted of the First Berkshires, the West Kent Regiment, the Second Durham Light Infantry, an Egyptian artillery battery escorted by 60 Egyptian troops and a Royal Engineer detachment. The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General Butler. Colonel Huyshe's Second Brigade was composed of the Yorkshire Regiment, six companies of the Cameron Highlanders, 152 Sudanese soldiers, 278 men of the 1st Egyptian Battalion, a mule battery of the Royal Artillery and detachments from both the British Camel Corps and its Egyptian counterpart. Three Gardner guns were also brought along by the Second Brigade. The cavalry brigade, led by Colonel Blake, was formed by another detachment of the Egyptian Camel Corps, a British Mounted Infantry company and 57 Egyptian cavalrymen. Some of the British troops were dressed in scarlet coats, but the Durham Light Infantry had left their red coats in Cairo before they headed south and were wearing khaki.Account of the battle in the Durham County Record Office The Egyptians were dressed in white or khaki. Some Egyptian officers preferred their traditional blue coat. British soldiers and officers wore white sun helmets, and the Egyptians wore red fezes.  Battle  Opening clashes = At 5:00 on the morning of December 30, 1885, General Grenfell and his troops marched out of their bivouack, which was between the Ginnis-Kosha fort and a smaller fort further south on the Nile. The First Brigade was at the head of the column, and the Camel Corps and Second Brigade followed. The Second Brigade took up positions overlooking Kosha, and the fort garrison, seizing the opportunity, sortied and stormed the town. On the Nile, the steamer Lotus, which had mounted a Gardner gun, reported that a large body of Dervishes was moving out of Ginnis in the direction of Grenfell's column. The Camerons and Sudanese, followed by the Second Brigade and covered by the Lotus, moved to investigate and counter the threat. = Main battle = As the Second Brigade fought through the palm groves near Ginnis, Dervish riflemen fired several volleys at the First Brigade. Although the firing was inaccurate, the smoke that it created allowed spearmen to surprise the Camel Corps.The Battle of Ginnis by Doug Johnson. Soldiers of the Queen, issue 11) In the ensuing skirmish, that detachment was forced to withdraw, but the Durham Light Infantry moved forward and repulsed the Dervish attack. As the First Brigade prepared to attack the main Dervish camp near Ginnis, the Second Brigade entered the town itself. Fighting its way through the streets, it took control of it. Nearby, the First Brigade's attack forced the Dervishes to retreat from their camp and pull back into the Atab Defile. Grenfell then ordered Colonel Blake's cavalry brigade to dislodge the Arabs in the Defile. After the Mounted Infantry took the Atab Defile with a bayonet charge, a general pursuit began, but Blake halted his men and the Dervishes fled to the desert. As the Firsst Egyptian Battalion marched through Kosha, the men noticed that some Dervishes, probably seeking shelter during the retreat from the town, had holed up, with their weapons, in a house. With a screw gun from the Mule Battery covering them, the Egyptians stormed the house. That encounter marked the end of the battle.  Aftermath  The Anglo- Egyptian victory at Ginnis effectively ended the First Sudan Campaign and the first third of the Mahdist War, which had begun with the destruction of an Egyptian force near Fashoda in 1881. A few more campaigns, mainly defensive or relief operations, were fought until a large Anglo-Egyptian army, commanded by both Sirdar Sir Herbert Kitchener, a former intelligence officer, and General Sir Reginald Wingate reconquered the Sudan in a massive campaign from 1896 to 1898. Most Mahdist resistance ended in the large-scale Battle of Omdurman in 1898.

This device must be interference fit to the crankshaft in order to operate in an effective manner. An interference fit ensures the device moves in perfect step with crankshaft. It is essential on engines with long crankshafts (such as straight-6, straight-8 engines) and V8 engines with cross plane cranks. Harmonics and torsional vibrations can greatly reduce crankshaft life, or cause instantaneous failure if the crankshaft runs at or through an amplified resonance. Dampers are designed with a specific weight (mass) and diameter, which are dependent on the damping material/method used, to reduce mechanical Q factor, or damp, crankshaft resonances. A harmonic balancer (sometimes crankshaft damper, torsional damper, or vibration damper) is the same thing as a harmonic damper except that the balancer includes a counterweight to externally balance the rotating assembly. The harmonic balancer often serves as a pulley for the accessory drive belts turning the alternator, water pump and other crankshaft driven devices.\\"Car Talk\\", March 2000, retrieved on 2009-12-10. Need The need for a damper will depend on the age of the engine design, its manufacture, strength of components, usable powerband, rev range and, most importantly, the quality of the engine's tune. The engine's tune especially in computer controlled applications can have a dramatic effect on durability, the aggressiveness of the tune puts the engine at risk of detonation which can be catastrophic to all rotating assembly components. Modern (roughly 1988+) DOHC, SOHC flat 4, I4, flat 6, I6, V6, flat 8, and flat-plane V8 have no need for this device. With or without the presence of a damper, a crankshaft will act as a torsional spring to some extent. Impulses applied to the crankshaft by the connecting rods will \\"wind\\" this spring, which will respond (as a spring–mass system) by unwinding and re- winding in the opposite direction. This crankshaft winding will usually be damped out naturally. However, at certain crankshaft rotational speeds, such winding can overlap with the crankshaft's natural resonant frequency, thereby increasing the frequency's amplitude and possibly leading to crankshaft damage. Torsional crankshaft movement and harmonics Each time a cylinder fires, the force of the combustion is imparted to the crankshaft rod journal. The rod journal deflects in a torsional motion to some degree under this force. Harmonic vibrations result from the torsional motion imparted on the crankshaft. These harmonics are a function of many factors including frequencies created by the actual combustion and the natural frequencies the metals make under the stresses of combustion and flexing. In some engines, the torsional motion of the crankshaft at certain speeds can synchronize with the harmonic vibrations, causing a resonance. In some cases the resonance may stress the crankshaft to the point of cracking or complete failure. Countering torsional crank motion and harmonic vibration The harmonic balancer helps minimize torsional crankshaft harmonics and resonance. The damper is composed of two elements: an inertia mass and an energy dissipating element. Most often made of rubber, this element may be composed of a synthetic elastomer, a clutch, a spring or fluid. The mass counteracts the torsional crank motions and in concert with the energy dissipating element absorbs the harmonics vibrations. Construction An OEM damper consists of an outer mass bonded/vulcanized to an inner hub. An aftermarket performance damper consists of a mass which is attached/mounted to a housing (steel, aluminum, titanium, etc.) based on the different types of damper and where the mass is controlled differently. The first three use older technology; First is the liquid type damper which surrounds the mass immersed in the housing which is then bonded or welded together. Second is the o-ring type which surrounds the mass with a number of o-rings as it sits in its housing. Third is the friction type which has clutches and spring acting on the mass inside the outer housing. Fourth is the newest type in which the mass sits over and is attached an elastomer ring which is then attached to the outer housing. The crankshaft and damper together become (in its torsional response) a spring–mass–damper system again which can only occur by the two being interference fit together.  Engine design, materials & other factors  thumb Over time engine development has continually advanced in almost all areas from material, operation, and function. Many of the advances were led by the Japanese manufacturers as they have made quality and durability the cornerstone of their programs. The Japanese advanced the proliferation of forged crankshafts with rotating assemblies at 0 gram balance. Forged crankshafts are much stronger and are significantly less apt to exhibit detrimental torsional crankshaft movement which also mitigates harmonic frequencies. This progression has also seen the addition of forged rods and pistons initially in forced induction engines and more recently in normally aspirated engines. Adding these additional forged components ramps the engines rigidity reducing concern about crankshaft damage even further. With the advent of computer aided design and finite element analysis, manufacturers can now find and re-engineer weaker areas. Regardless of some of these improvements, certain engines, like the traditional V8, have a firing order prone to excessive harmonics by nature necessitating the use of this device. The flat plane V8, traditionally used in more exotic engines, does not suffer from the excessive harmonics and therefore may use a solid undampened device. Modern (roughly 1988+) DOHC, SOHC Flat 4, Flat 6, Flat 8, Flat Plane V8 have no need for this device. Over the years many of these engines use solid cast iron or aluminum crank pulley or audible NVH damper (reducing engine noise heard in the occupant compartment). Audible NVH has been the biggest factor in OE manufacturer decisions throughout the vehicle. In addition the pulleys on these engines are mounted loosely with a location fit negating any potential to act as an engine protective damper. Continental has recently provided detailed information on the maximum acceptable noise (NVH) that should be heard from under the hood from the engine in their Elite Belt program http://www.thequietbelt.com/#the-art-of-silence. Identification The damper will be fitted at the front of the engine (opposite the clutch or transmission) just beyond the cover of the timing chain, gears, or belt, and behind the accessory drive pulley (which may carry one or more V, serpentine, or cogged belts.) In older vehicles the pulley and damper were separate units that were bolted together. In late model vehicles the two have been combined into one unit. Timing marks are almost always engraved for purposes of setting the ignition timing. Maintenance OE dampers are predominantly made using rubber as the bonding agent between the inner hub and the outer mass. Rubber is susceptible to operational and environmental factors. Rubber only has a finite ability to withstand operating temperatures plus any fluids that may find their way onto the damper. They are also susceptible to low temperatures which can make the rubber brittle. Any cracking of the elastomer(rubber) would be an immediate indicator of the need to replace the unit. OE dampers must be balanced, unless acting as an external balancer (Harmonic Balancer), as the quality of materials (usually cast or sintered iron) do not lend themselves to acceptable/perfect balance specifications straight from manufacturing. Most aftermarket dampers are rebuildable, excluding the fluid type. When used in racing (drag, circle track, road race, etc.) they require regular inspection to ensure their proper function. When used on street driven vehicles, the damper manufacturer can provide inspection and service intervals based on the particulars of the engine the damper is being used on. Effects of removal Some performance enthusiasts have been known to remove the harmonic balancer, believing that its mass reduces engine performance. Removal of this device from a traditional engine is very risky due to the potential for crankshaft damage. If the device has weight mounted on it to balance the rotating assembly, the effects may be felt immediately and could be catastrophic. Original invention Both Frederick Henry Royce and Frederick W. Lanchester have strong claims to the invention of the vibration damper, with the latest research showing Rolls-Royce using a crankshaft slipper (friction) vibration damper on their 1906 30HP models; however, Royce had not submitted it for patent. Lanchester had developed a theoretical multi-plate viscous design in 1910 (patent 21,139, 12 September 1910). Royce developed a viscous damper in 1912 that was then further developed and carried through to the B60 engine of the 1950s.Royce and the Vibration Damper.

Charteris wrote nine novels, 17 television screenplays and numerous children's books and short stories. Early life Charteris was born in London, the fourth child of Captain Hon. Guy Lawrence Charteris (1886–1967), the son of Hugo Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss and Mary Constance Wyndham, and his first wife, Francis Lucy Tennant (1887–1925), a granddaughter of Sir Charles Tennant. His sister was the socialite Ann Fleming.Andrew Lycett, 'Fleming , Ann Geraldine Mary [other married names Ann Geraldine Mary O'Neill, Lady O'Neill; Ann Geraldine Mary Harmsworth, Viscountess Rothermere] (1913–1981)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2014 accessed 9 Feb 2017 He and his sisters grew up at Stanway House surrounded by the creative influence of close family friends such as James Barrie who would write plays for them to perform during the summer months. Charteris was educated at Eton and in 1941 he left to join the Scots Guards. He was twice wounded in the war, eventually receiving an MC in Italy while defending his position against continuous enemy attack. Career After the war he went to Malaya and Java where he served as a public relations officer for south-east Asia command (1945–47). At this time he also edited an English language and wrote short stories. He soon left the army and went to Oxford where he read English at Trinity College for a few frustrating terms (1947–48). In 1948 he married Virginia Mary (born 1922), daughter of Colin Forbes Adam and granddaughter of Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock. Together they had two sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Richard, drowned at their home in Scotland in 1951. Through his brother-in-law, newspaper baron Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, he got work with the Daily Mail, where he was sub-editor until he was sent to Paris as second correspondent, mainly writing articles for the continental edition of the Mail. He retired from full-time journalism in 1951 when he decided to settle in Sutherland, intending to live as a novelist. While being sustained by commissions from Punch and The Telegraph magazines, Charteris wrote his first novel, A Share of the World, which was published in 1953. Francis Wyndham hailed it as \\"the most impressive first novel that has appeared since the war\\". Charteris went on to write eight further novels to great critical acclaim. His depiction of the aristocracy was often informed or based upon the lives of his relations. The family in his first novel was based upon his parents-in-law and he portrays Guy, his father, affectionately in many novels. Sir Oswald Mosley, who was related by marriage to his wife's family, launched but later abandoned a libel action over the tragic fascist portrayed in The River Watcher (1965). Charteris later developed a strong friendship with Mosley's son, Nicholas, 3rd Baron Ravensdale, who inspired a Congo mercenary in that same novel. After 1965 Charteris wrote for television. His most popular work was Take Three Girls (1969–71), based upon a flat-share. His greatest critical success came, however, with The Toggle, a moving portrayal of the helpless isolation of a schoolboy controlled by cold, harsh adults. He still wrote occasional pieces for newspapers and in 1959 interviewed Carl Jung for The Daily Telegraph at Bollingen. He worked with BBC producer Verity Lambert on scripts to adapt his novel, The Coat (1966), into either a film or television series. Work continued on the screenplays after his death by other writers but the ideas never came to fruition. His novel, The Tide is Right, was written in 1957 but was suppressed on the demands of people who thought they had been characterised. It was eventually published in 1991, 21 years after Charteris's death, with a new introduction written by Nicholas Mosley. Critical praise for Hugo Charteris: > \\"Hugo Charteris was among the most gifted British novelists of the postwar > generation and The Tide is Right (which was never published in his lifetime) > is one of his best books. He wrote, in my opinion, more truthfully about the > upper classes than any of his contemporaries. This study of family jealousy > and dispossession in an old Scottish landowning family is as exciting as a > thriller but its qualities are more than purely narrative. The people and > the place are seen with an unmatched intensity and brought to life by a > distinctive prose style of rare beauty and extraordinary expressive > power.\\"—Francis Wyndham Personal life Charteris was noted for his beauty in youth and later was gauntly handsome. He died of cancer on 20 December 1970, at his home, The Grange, Elvington, Yorkshire, and was buried in St Helen's churchyard, Skipwith, York. His widow, Virginia Charteris, never re-married and died aged 90 in 2012. She was interred next to her husband. In 1952 his sister Ann Fleming married Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels; she had earlier been married to Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere.

Life Mackenroth was pre-med at the University of California, Berkeley for the first two years, following in the footsteps of his mother, who was a nurse at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center, but later graduated with a double degree in Fine Arts and Sociology. Career Design = In 1991, Mackenroth moved to New York City to study Fashion Design at Parsons School of Design. After Parsons, Jack opened a menswear store on Bleecker Street in New York City's West Village called \\"Jack\\". In 1997, Mackenroth went to work for Tommy Hilfiger and then designed for Levis Slates brand. From 2003–2007, he was the Design Director at Weatherproof Active Wear. On October 15, 2008, Mackenroth unveiled a custom-designed wedding gown crafted entirely of condoms as a visual reminder of the importance of safer sex and correct, consistent condom use for San Francisco's Project Inform. =Modeling= As a fitness and fashion model through the 1990s, Mackenroth appeared in numerous magazines such as Paper, DNR, Men's Fitness, Men's Journal, Men's Health, Genre, Blue (Australia) and L'Uomo Vogue . After Project Runway, he graced the covers of many magazines including reFresh, POZ, HIVplus, and Gloss. His fashion illustrations have also been featured in Nylon, Elle, and in ad campaigns for Tommy Hilfiger and Sushi Clothing. In 2008, Mackenroth also he appeared as an extra in the Sex and the City movie as \\"Hot Guy #17.\\" =Swimming= Mackenroth was a competitive swimmer in elementary and high school and continued competing after college at the Masters level. Jack has earned three All-American titles and in the summer of 2006, he set a national record for the breaststroke leg of the 4 x 50 meter relay at the Masters World Championships in Stanford, California. Mackenroth first competed in the Gay Games in 1990 in Vancouver, British Columbia, without a team but won a bronze medal in the 50-meter breaststroke. He has won at least one gold medal in every one of the international competitions since. His mother watched his relay team set the national record at the 2006 Gay Games. He competed in the 2009 Outgames, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the 2010 Gay Games in Cologne, Germany, where he earned seven medals. Project RunwayEarly win= Mackenroth was solidly in the middle of the competition from the very start and never appeared in the \\"bottom three.\\" The third challenge, however, allowed him to showcase his talent in developing menswear. The challenge was to create a three-piece menswear outfit for guest judge Tiki Barber. Mackenroth won the challenge and his winning design was then worn by Barber during an appearance on The Today Show. =Withdrawal from competition= At the fifth challenge, Mackenroth decided to withdraw after a contagious staph infection. After leaving the show, Mackenroth spent five days in the hospital recovering from the infection (MRSA) where he received an IV antibiotic twice daily. HIV activism Mackenroth has been very open about his positive HIV status. Since his diagnosis on August 18, 1990, he has tried to combat the stigma of HIV by living honestly and being a role model through professional and athletic achievements. \\"I am most proud of the fact that I was open about my positive HIV status on the show and exemplified that a person can manage HIV and live a successful life,\\" Mackenroth says. \\"Every time a person with HIV is open about his or her status it helps everyone who is living with the disease....

They are given this name since they resemble tiny bird's nests filled with \\"eggs\\", structures large enough to have been mistaken in the past for seeds. However, these are now known to be reproductive structures containing spores. The \\"eggs\\", or peridioles, are firmly attached to the inner surface of this fruit body by an elastic cord of mycelia known as a funiculus. The 45 species are widely distributed throughout the world and some are found in most countries, although a few exist in only one or two locales. Cyathus stercoreus is considered endangered in a number of European countries. Species of Cyathus are also known as splash cups, which refers to the fact that falling raindrops can knock the peridioles out of the open-cup fruit body. The internal and external surfaces of this cup may be ridged longitudinally (referred to as plicate or striate); this is one example of a taxonomic characteristic that has traditionally served to distinguish between species. Generally considered inedible, Cyathus species are saprobic, since they obtain nutrients from decomposing organic matter. They usually grow on decaying wood or woody debris, on cow and horse dung, or directly on humus- rich soil. The life cycle of this genus allows it to reproduce both sexually, with meiosis, and asexually via spores. Several Cyathus species produce bioactive compounds, some with medicinal properties, and several lignin- degrading enzymes from the genus may be useful in bioremediation and agriculture. Phylogenetic analysis is providing new insights into the evolutionary relationships between the various species in Cyathus, and has cast doubt on the validity of the older classification systems that are based on traditional taxonomic characteristics History Bird's nest fungi were first mentioned by Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius in Rariorum plantarum historia (1601). Over the next couple of centuries, these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds, and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature. For example, the French botanist Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his work Traité des champignons (1790–3), proposed the erroneous notion that peridioles were ejected from the fruit bodies by some sort of spring mechanism.Brodie (1975), p. 15. The genus was established in 1768 by the Swiss scientist Albrecht von Haller; the generic name Cyathus is Latin, but originally derived from the Ancient Greek word κύαθος, meaning \\"cup\\". The structure and biology of the genus Cyathus was better known by the mid-19th century, starting with the appearance in 1842 of a paper by Carl Johann Friedrich Schmitz, and two years later, a monograph by the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne. The work of the Tulasnes was thorough and accurate, and was highly regarded by later researchers. Subsequently, monographs were written in 1902 by Violet S. White (on American species), Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1906, Gordon Herriot Cunningham in 1924 (on New Zealand species), and Harold J. Brodie in 1975.Brodie, The Bird's Nest Fungi. Description Species in the genus Cyathus have fruit bodies (peridia) that are vase-, trumpet- or urn-shaped with dimensions of 4–8 mm wide by 7–18 mm tall. Fruit bodies are brown to gray-brown in color, and covered with small hair-like structures on the outer surface. Some species, like C. striatus and C. setosus, have conspicuous bristles called setae on the rim of the cup. The fruit body is often expanded at the base into a solid rounded mass of hyphae called an emplacement, which typically becomes tangled and entwined with small fragments of the underlying growing surface, improving its stability and helping it from being knocked over by rain.Brodie (1975), pp. 5–7.Cyathus striatus (a) young and mature fruit bodies in longitudinal section; (b), (c) single peridiole entire, and in section Immature fruit bodies have a whitish membrane, an epiphragm, that covers the peridium opening when young, but eventually dehisces, breaking open during maturation. Viewed with a microscope, the peridium of Cyathus species is made of three distinct layers—the endo-, meso-, and ectoperidium, referring to the inner, middle, and outer layers respectively. While the surface of the ectoperidium in Cyathus is usually hairy, the endoperidial surface is smooth, and depending on the species, may have longitudinal grooves (striations). Because the basic fruit body structure in all genera of the family Nidulariaceae is essentially similar, Cyathus may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus that may have the hairy ectoperidium worn off.Brodie (1975), p. 147. It distinguished from Nidula by the presence of a funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus. =Peridiole structure= A peridiole and attached funiculus in cross section Derived from the Greek word peridion, meaning \\"small leather pouch\\",Alexopolous et al. (1996), p. 545. the peridiole is the \\"egg\\" of the bird's nest. It is a mass of basidiospores and glebal tissue enclosed by a hard and waxy outer shell. The shape may be described as lenticular—like a biconvex lens—and depending on the species, may range in color from whitish to grayish to black. The interior chamber of the peridiole contains a hymenium that is made of basidia, sterile (non- reproductive) structures, and spores. In young, freshly opened fruit bodies, the peridioles lie in a clear gelatinous substance which soon dries.Brodie (1975), p. 6. Peridioles are attached to the fruit body by a funiculus, a complex structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In some species the peridioles may be covered by a tunica, a thin white membrane (particularly evident in C. striatus and C. crassimurus).Brodie (1975), p. 129. Spores typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are thick-walled, hyaline or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8 µm. Habitat and distribution Fruit bodies typically grow in clusters, and are found on dead or decaying wood, or on woody fragments in cow or horse dung. Dung-loving (coprophilous) species include C. stercoreus, C. costatus, C. fimicola, and C. pygmaeus.Brodie (1975), pp. 102–3. Some species have been collected on woody material like dead herbaceous stems, the empty shells or husks of nuts, or on fibrous material like coconut, jute, or hemp fiber woven into matting, sacks or cloth.Brodie (1975), p. 105. In nature, fruit bodies are usually found in moist, partly shaded sites, such as the edges of woods on trails, or around lighted openings in forests. They are less frequently found growing in dense vegetation and deep mosses, as these environments would interfere with the dispersal of peridioles by falling drops of water.Brodie (1975), p. 101. The appearance of fruit bodies is largely dependent upon features of the immediate growing environment; specifically, optimum conditions of temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are more important factors for fruit rather than the broad geographical area in which the fungi are located, or the season. Examples of the ability of Cyathus to thrive in somewhat inhospitable environments are provided by C. striatus and C. stercoreus, which can survive the drought and cold of winter in temperate North America, and the species C. helenae, which has been found growing on dead alpine plants at an altitude of . Cyathus poeppigii, a tropical species In general, species of Cyathus have a worldwide distribution, but are only rarely found in the arctic and subarctic.Brodie (1975), p. 150. One of the best known species, C. striatus has a circumpolar distribution and is commonly found throughout temperate locations, while the morphologically similar C. poeppigii is widely spread in tropical areas, rarely in the subtropics, and never in temperate regions.Brodie (1975), p. 116. The majority of species are native to warm climates. For example, although 20 different species have been reported from the United States and Canada, only 8 are commonly encountered; on the other hand, 25 species may be regularly found in the West Indies, and the Hawaiian Islands alone have 11 species.Brodie (1975), p. 117. Some species seem to be endemic to certain regions, such as C. novae-zeelandiae found in New Zealand, or C. crassimurus, found only in Hawaii; however, this apparent endemism may just be a result of a lack of collections, rather than a difference in the habitat that constitutes a barrier to spread. Although widespread in the tropics and most of the temperate world, C. stercoreus is only rarely found in Europe; this has resulted in its appearance on a number of Red Lists. For example, it is considered endangered in Bulgaria, Denmark, and Montenegro, and \\"near threatened\\" in Great Britain. The discovery of a Cyathus species in Dominican amber (C. dominicanus) suggests that the basic form of the bird's nest fungi had already evolved by the Cretaceous era and that the group had diversified by the mid-Cenozoic. Life cycle The life cycle of the genus Cyathus, which contains both haploid and diploid stages, is typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Like other wood-decay fungi, this life cycle may be considered as two functionally different phases: the vegetative stage for the spread of mycelia, and the reproductive stage for the establishment of spore-producing structures, the fruit bodies. The vegetative stage encompasses those phases of the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.Deacon (2005), pp. 231–4. After a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus.Deacon (2005) pp. 31–2. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable. Cyathus stercoreus The development of Cyathus fruit bodies has been studied in laboratory culture; Cyathus stercoreus has been used most often for these studies due to the ease with which it may be grown experimentally. In 1958, E. Garnett first demonstrated that the development and form of the fruit bodies is at least partially dependent on the intensity of light it receives during development. For example, exposure of the heterokaryotic mycelium to light is required for fruit to occur, and furthermore, this light needs to be at a wavelength of less than 530 nm. Continuous light is not required for fruit body development; after the mycelium has reached a certain stage of maturity, only a brief exposure to light is necessary, and fruit bodies will form if even subsequently kept in the dark. Lu suggested in 1965 that certain growing conditions—such as a shortage in available nutrients—shifts the fungus' metabolism to produce a hypothetical \\"photoreceptive precursor\\" that enables the growth of the fruit bodies to be stimulated and affected by light. The fungi is also positively phototrophic, that is, it will orient its fruit bodies in the direction of the light source.Brodie (1975), pp. 57–8. The time required to develop fruit bodies depends on a number of factors, such as the temperature, or the availability and type of nutrients, but in general \\"most species that do fruit in laboratory culture do so best at about 25 °C, in from 18 to 40 days.\\"Brodie (1975), p. 48. Spore dispersal Like other bird's nest fungi in the Nidulariaceae, species of Cyathus have their spores dispersed when water falls into the fruit body. The fruit body is shaped so that the kinetic energy of a fallen raindrop is redirected upward and slightly outward by the angle of the cup wall, which is consistently 70–75° with the horizontal.Brodie (1975), p. 89. The action ejects the peridioles out of the so-called \\"splash cup\\", where it may break and spread the spores within, or be eaten and dispersed by animals after passing through the digestive tract. This method of spore dispersal in the Nidulariaceae was tested experimentally by George Willard Martin in 1924, and later elaborated by Arthur Henry Reginald Buller, who used Cyathus striatus as the model species to experimentally investigate the phenomenon. Buller's major conclusions about spore dispersal were later summarized by his graduate student Harold J. Brodie, with whom he conducted several of these splash cup experiments: > Raindrops cause the peridioles of the Nidulariaceae to be thrown about four > feet by splash action. In the genus Cyathus, as a peridiole is jerked out of > its cup, the funiculus is torn and this makes possible the expansion of a > mass of adhesive hyphae (the hapteron) which clings to any object in the > line of flight. The momentum of the peridiole causes a long cord to be > pulled out of a sheath attached to the peridiole. The peridiole is checked > in flight and the jerk causes the funicular cord to become wound around > stems or entangled among plant hairs. Thus the peridiole becomes attached to > vegetation and may be eaten subsequently by herbivorous animals. Although it has not been shown experimentally if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true.Alexopolous et al. (1996), p. 555. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within. Bioactive compounds A number of species of Cyathus produce metabolites with biological activity, and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C. helenae, C. africanus and C. earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C. striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and have the potential to be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C. stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C. stercoreus. Various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in C. bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from humulene), nidulol, and bullerone. Various Cyathus species have antifungal activity against human pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Extracts of C. striatus have inhibitory effects on NF-κB, a transcription factor responsible for regulating the expression of several genes involved in the immune system, inflammation, and cell death. Human usesEdibility= Species in the family Nidulariaceae, including Cyathus, are considered inedible, as they are \\"not sufficiently large, fleshy, or odorous to be of interest to humans as food\\".Brodie (1975), p. 119. However, there have not been reports of poisonous alkaloids or other substances considered toxic to humans. Brodie goes on to note that two Cyathus species have been used by native peoples as an aphrodisiac, or to stimulate fertility: C. limbatus in Colombia, and C. microsporus in Guadeloupe. Whether these species have any actual effect on human physiology is unknown.Brodie (1975), p. 120. =Biodegradation= Lignin is a complex polymeric chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C. bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications not only in the pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C. bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C. pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils. =Agriculture= Cyathus olla; note the smooth (not plicate) endoperidium, and relatively large peridioles Cyathus olla has been investigated for its ability to accelerate the decomposition of stubble left in the field after harvest, effectively reducing pathogen populations and accelerating nutrient cycling through mineralization of essential plant nutrients. Infrageneric classification The genus Cyathus was first subdivided into two infrageneric groups (i.e., grouping species below the rank of genus) by the Tulasne brothers; the \\"eucyathus\\" group had fruit bodies with inner surfaces folded into pleats (plications), while the \\"olla\\" group lacked plications. Later (1906), Lloyd published a different concept of infrageneric grouping in Cyathus, describing five groups, two in the eucyathus group and five in the olla group. In the 1970s, Brodie, in his monograph on bird's nest fungi, separated the genus Cyathus into seven related groups based on a number of taxonomic characteristics, including the presence or absence of plications, the structure of the peridioles, the color of the fruit bodies, and the nature of the hairs on the outer peridium:Brodie (1975) pp. 150–80. Olla group: Species with a tomentum having fine flattened-down hairs, and no plications. * C. olla, C. africanus, C. badius, C. canna, C. colensoi, C. confusus, C. earlei, C. hookeri, C. microsporus, C. minimus, C. pygmaeus Pallidus group: Species with conspicuous, long, downward-pointing hairs, and a smooth (non-plicate) inner peridium. * C. pallidus, C. julietae Triplex group: Species with mostly dark-colored peridia, and a silvery white inner surface. * C. triplex, C. setosus, C. sinensis Gracilis group: Species with tomentum hairs clumped into tufts or mounds. * C. gracilis, C. intermedius, C. crassimurus, C. elmeriThe shaggy (tomentose) outer peridial surface of C. striatus Stercoreus group: Species with non-plicate peridia, shaggy or wooly outer peridium walls, and dark to black peridioles. * C. stercoreus, C. pictus, C. fimicola Poeppigii group: Species with plicate internal peridial walls, hairy to shaggy outer walls, dark to black peridioles, and large, roughly spherical or ellipsoidal spores. * C. poeppigii, C. crispus, C. limbatus, C. gayanus, C. costatus, C. cheliensis, C. olivaceo-brunneus Striatus group: Species with plicate internal peridia, hairy to shaggy outer peridia, and mostly elliptical spores. * C. striatus, C. annulatus, C. berkeleyanus, C. bulleri, C. chevalieri, C. ellipsoideus, C. helenae, C. montagnei, C. nigro-albus, C. novae-zeelandiae, C. pullus, C. rudis =Phylogenetic analysis= The 2007 publication of phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data of numerous Cyathus species has cast doubt on the validity of the morphology-based infrageneric classifications described by Brodie. This research suggests that Cyathus species can be grouped into three genetically related clades: alt= ollum group: C. africanus (type), C. africanus f. latisporus, C. conlensoi, C. griseocarpus, C. guandishanensis, C. hookeri, C. jiayuguanensis, C. olla, C. olla f. anglicus, and C. olla f. brodiensis. striatum group: C. annulatus, C. crassimurus, C. helenae, C. poeppigii, C. renwei, C. setosus, C. stercoreus, and C. triplex. pallidum group: C. berkeleyanus, C. olla f. lanatus, C. gansuensis, and C. pallidus. This analysis shows that rather than fruit body structure, spore size is generally a more reliable character for segregating species groups in Cyathus. For example, species in the ollum clade all have spore lengths less than 15 µm, while all members of the pallidum group have lengths greater than 15 µm; the striatum group, however, cannot be distinguished from the pallidum group by spore size alone. Two characteristics are most suited for distinguishing members of the ollum group from the pallidum group: the thickness of the hair layer on the peridium surface, and the outline of the fruit bodies. The tomentum of Pallidum species is thick, like felt, and typically aggregates into clumps of shaggy or woolly hair. Their crucible-shaped fruit bodies do not have a clearly differentiated stipe. The exoperidium of Ollum species, in comparison, has a thin tomentum of fine hairs; fruit bodies are funnel-shaped and have either a constricted base or a distinct stipe.

History  The area where the municipality of Santa Maria del Rio now is, was a contact zone between various Mesoamerican cultures. Archaeological evidence shows that the region was once occupied by people of advanced culture, sedentary farmers who built permanent structures. However, sometime prior to the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors nomads invaded the area and there were no existing settlements when the Spanish came. However, after the fall of Tenochtitlan, the Otomi began to move north as allies of the Spanish. Otherwise, the semi-nomadic Guachichil were the local inhabitants at the time of the founding of the municipality.Velázquez, Primo Feliciano (1893) Descubrimiento y Conquista de San Luis Potosí: Conferencía dada en el Teatro Alarcón la noche del 27 de Agosto de 1892 M.

It is often listed as 1589, citing noted historian Primo Feliciano Velázquez's pamphlet Descubrimiento y Conquista de San Luis Potosí (Discovery and Conquest of San Luis Potosí); however, there is a Franciscan baptismal document dated 15 August 1542 for some Guachichil indicating that the settlement was already in place, and that instead of founding the town Viceroy Luis de Velazco merely gave it the name: Santa Maria del Rio.\\"Estado de San Luis Potosí - Santa María del Río\\" Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal, Secretaría de Gobernación (2005), in Spanish, accessed 29 December 2008 The Franciscan Convent was built in 1604. The settled inhabitants were Guachichil and Otomi, with the lands being divided between them by a road and the church. Cinnabar mining started with the general opening of mines in the province; however their mining techniques were labor-intensive, and the mines were subject to frequent flooding. The bridge over the Santa Maria river was begun in 1844, but it was not completed until the French intervention in Mexico. By the year 1853, the town of Santa Maria del Rio had twenty thousand inhabitants. In 1866 telegraph service was instituted, mostly through the efforts of General Tomás Mejía. In May 1914, the town of Santa Maria del Rio was the site for fierce fighting between the 150 occupying huertistas and the Constitutionalists. The 400 Constitutionalists captured the town.

Personal life  Vikena is the father of eleven children. He spent much of his professional career outside of Wallis and Futuna in Metropolitan France. Vikena served in the French Army and worked as a public servant while in France. He later moved to New Caledonia, where he served as a Nouméa Town Council officer. There are an estimated 20,000 Wallisians and Futunans living in New Caledonia.  Coronation  Vikena was crowned the new Tuigaifo of Alo, also known as the Kingdom of Futuna, in an official coronation on November 6, 2008. The coronation, which took place in the small village of Alo, included a mix of traditional and religious elements. The coronation began with a religious ceremony followed by traditional Polynesian rituals and customs indigenous to Alo (Futuna), including a kava ceremony and offerings from Vikena's family and allied chiefly clans. Roast pig offerings, dancers with spears, and tapas ornamentations similar in design to those traditional used on Samoa were also featured at the coronation. Vikena was 65 years old at the time of his coronation. Guests included representatives of several of Alo's chiefly clans, as well as French officials. Vikena's coronation was not without controversy. Some chiefly clans disapproved of Vikena. They argued that the decision to crown Vikena as the new Tuigaifo was the result of a unilateral decision from the chiefly council and not a result of a consensus among chiefly and royal clans and families. The position of Tuigaifo had been vacant since February 19, 2008, when Vikena's predecessor, Soane Patita Maituku, was deposed as the result of a unanimous decision taken by the kingdom's four chiefly clans. The position remained vacant from February until Vikena's coronation in November 2008. Abdication Vikena’s reign lasted only fourteen months and was strongly contested. “[S]everal chiefly clans” disputed his legitimacy, arguing that “his coronation did not result from a consensus among chiefly and royal clans and families, but from a unilateral decision from the chiefly council”. This resulted in “social tensions”, expressed notably through acts of vandalism against royal property. In this context, Vikena chose to abdicate on January 22, 2010.  Background  The two islands of Wallis and Futuna are home to three traditional kingdoms, which are also known as chiefdoms. One kingdom encompasses all of Wallis Island while Futuna Island has two distinct chiefdoms . Futuna is divided into two separate kingdoms: The Kingdom of Sigave, ruled by the Tuisigave, and the Kingdom of Alo, which is headed by the Tuigaifo.

He received notoriety with the release of the August 13, 2003 issue of Sports Illustrated. Sports Illustrated sportswriter Tom Verducci, along with Johnson's input, published an article about “What Really Happened to Ted Williams?\\" Immediately following the Sports Illustrated article, Johnson agreed to an interview with Diane Sawyer of Good Morning America. Alcor has accused Johnson of engaging in profiteering and attempting to sensationalize his experiences at Alcor as a means of making money. In 2003, CNN correspondent Gary Tuchman noted: \\"Johnson certainly doesn't mind using his connections as an ex- employee to make a buck. Johnson has started a Web site, where for a so-called donation of at least $20, graphic photographs were displayed, photographs, he said, documenting the fate of Ted Williams. Johnson won't talk on camera about Ted Williams, but his attorney acknowledges Sports Illustrated was not told about his client's money making plans.\\" During the fall of 2003, while Director of Clinical Services for Alcor, Johnson did an interview in Cryonics Magazine.http://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics2003-1.pdf On September 28, 2003, an article was published in the Phoenix, Arizona newspaper East Valley Tribune with the headline \\"Scottsdale company’s role in death probe.” This article reports that Larry Johnson speaks of a 1992 death of a North Hollywood, California man whose remains are frozen at Alcor. According to Johnson he has audio taped evidence that personally recorded, of an Alcor employee who may have hastened the death of one of their members. Johnson later stated that the police were not interested in pursuing an investigation. The nurse who pronounced the 1992 death has denied Johnson's claim that there was any hastening of death. The nurse's description of the events surrounding that death contradict Alcor's published case report. The nurse claims his patient died in the bedroom, while Alcor's case report and Larry Johnson's version of the story agree the patient died in a \\"makeshift operating room\\" in the garage. In October 2009, \\"Alcor's CEO at the time, (1992) Carlos Mondragon, told ABC News that the allegation that the patient's death was hastened was brought directly to him, and that his response was to cut Alcor's ties with the employee accused of administering the injection.\\" During the Fall of 2009, Johnson released a book called, FROZEN: My Journey into the World of Cryonics, Deception, and Death. This book has received heavy criticism from those working in the field of cryonics. Alcor Litigation Mr. Johnson retracted no specific allegations about Alcor in his statement associated with a legal settlement over his book.

It was formerly used as a draught animal, but this use has almost disappeared. It is now raised mainly for meat. It is one of four indigenous Korean breeds, the others being the Chikso, the Heugu and the Jeju Black.  History  The Hanwoo was traditionally a working animal breed. Until the expansion of the South Korean economy in the 1960s, it was little used for beef production. A herd book was established in 1968. Hanwoo beef has since become a premium product. The Hanwoo was listed by the FAO as \\"not at risk\\" in 2007. In 2003, the total population was reported to be about ; in 2014, it was reported as . In 2001, the Hanwoo was suggested to be a hybrid between taurine and indicine cattle. A mitochondrial DNA study in 2010 found it to be closely related to two taurine breeds, the Holstein and the Japanese Black, and distinctly different from the indicine Nellore and . In 2014, single- nucleotide polymorphism analysis found Korean cattle to form a distinct group with the Yanbian breed of China, separate from European taurine breeds and distant from the indicine group.  Characteristics  The Hanwoo is a small breed. The coat is brown; both sexes are horned. Cows have good maternal qualities, but milk production is low, little more than in a lactation of 170 days. The cattle are fed rice straw as their principal source of roughage. A rare white variant of the Hanwoo has been bred since 2009; in 2014 there were 14 head. It is reported to DAD-IS as a separate breed.  Use  Despite its high price, Hanwoo beef is preferred in Korean cuisine, as it is typically fresher and of better quality than cheaper imported substitutes. Kim et al. (2001) noted, \\"Hanwoo is regarded as a premium beef because of its high palatability and desired chewiness\\". Since Koreans consider Hanwoo beef a cultural icon and one of the top-quality beefs of the world, it is used in traditional foods, popular holiday dishes, or as a special-day gift. Hoengseong County is best known for its Hanwoo cattle, where the environment is well-suited for cattle farming. The county began a strategic marketing campaign to brand itself as the origin of the highest quality beef in Korea; selling meat as a \\"premium product\\".

Economy In 1900, António de Sousa Lara, the company \\"Ferreira Marques & Fonseca\\" of João Ferreira Gonçalves - a noted capitalist, and financier, Commander of the Order of Christ, owner of Horta-Seca Palace in Lisbon - and the Bensaúde firm created the Commercial Company of Angola (Companhia Comercial de Angola). Lara and Ferreira Gonçalves established his first sugar mill in 1901, expanding his sugar-cane plantations in Benguela to of land in 1915. He employed a thousand workers and produced 2,500,000 pounds of sugar annually. He used the profits from his initial investment to build a railroad to his personal port. The CCA became the largest trading company in the Angolan colony. In 1901, the Portuguese government imposed a quota of 6,000 tons of sugar production per year on Angola and Mozambique. Slavery and conquest The price of rubber declined in the 1900s, prompting a revolt in 1902. The uprising, the last attempt by the Ovimbundu peoples to resist Portuguese colonization, pitted rival traders against one another. However, while the Portuguese maintained ethnic and national solidarity, the Ovimbundu continued to engage in slave raids. The Portuguese suppressed the rebellion and annexed the Central Highlands. Degredado settlers and Boer farmers stole natives' lands, impressing and deporting workers to plantations. Portuguese authorities arrested the king of Bailundo after an Ovimbundu celebration in which natives consumed Portuguese rum, allegedly without paying. The king's advisor, Mutu ya Kevela, allied with Bailundo's neighboring kingdoms and launched a liberation war. He told his council, rallying them to fight, \\"Before the traders came we had our own home-brewed beer, we lived long lives and were strong.\\" Kevela's troops killed Portuguese colonists and burned down their trading posts. Native victories spread towards Bié, but Portuguese troops stationed in Benguela and Moçâmedes put down the revolt. The war ended in 1903, almost two years later, with the Portuguese victorious and Kevela dead. Thomas Fowell Buxton, at the time a member (and later President) of the Aborigines' Protection Society, wrote to Portugal's representatives in the United Kingdom in December 1902, inquiring about the state and extent of slavery in Angola. The Portuguese government replied to his letter in February 1903, denying the existence of slavery its colonies and deriding the \\"imagination of certain philanthropists.\\" In 1904, the Kwanyama Ovambo defeated the Portuguese, eradicating the Portuguese force with assistance from German-run South-West Africa which wanted to wrest control of Angola from the Portuguese. In 1905 the population grew to just under 11,000. The population of Boer and Madeiran colonists in Lubango grew to 2,000 in 1904. In 1914, the Mbunda waged an armed campaign in southeastern Angola to resist Portuguese colonial occupation.

Early life He was a grandson of William Hawes, founder of the Royal Humane Society, and son of Benjamin Hawes of New Barge House, Lambeth, who was a businessman and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London; his mother was Ann Feltham, sister of John Feltham. He had a younger brother, who also was called William. There was another brother, Thomas, and a sister Sarah, married name Curtis. Barge House, where Hawes lived in the 1830s, was in the Christ Church area of Lambeth, at the corner of Commercial Road and Broad Wall. Hawes was educated at William Carmalt's school at Putney, and when of age in 1818 entered into partnership with his father and uncle, in the business of soap- boiling. He spent relatively little of his life in the industry, but was later known in parliament as \\"Hawes the Soap-Boiler\\". Hawes Soap Works The Hawes Soap Works, 1843 engraving The Hawes Soap Works stood on the site of the royal barge house of the 16th century, later used as a glassworks; it is also described as being on Upper Ground Street, Blackfriars. To the west of Blackfriars Bridge, it was the largest soap factory in London in its time, during a period in the 19th century. The Topographical History of Surrey of the 1840s, by Edward Wedlake Brayley, stated that the works had been in existence for 75 years. In the 1820s manufacturers on Merseyside were beginning to compete seriously with those of London, and issues of process and duty on raw materials (such as kelp, barilla for alkali, and common salt) were affecting business decisions. The Hawes family were engaged in lobbying Parliament. Benjamin Hawes as MP spoke for the reduction of soap duties. In 1820 Josias Parkes gave evidence to a parliamentary select committee that his firm had supplied steam power to the boiler of the Hawes Works. The works then installed its own gas oil plant. In 1824 Benjamin Hawes the elder gave parliament evidence of the company's use of gas lighting. He went on to be chairman of the Gas Light & Coke Company. His younger son William innovated with \\"Hawes' soap\\", the product of the \\"cold process\\" for soap manufacture, and was granted a patent in 1839. The works closed down in 1849. Soap was taxed at that time in the United Kingdom, and an article in the Freeman's Journal made the case that the demands of the exciseman had put the Hawes factory out of business. In 1856, at the Royal Society of Arts, the industrial history of soap-making in the United Kingdom, in the first half of the nineteenth century, was debated by William Hawes and Warren De la Rue. Member of Parliament Hawes became a magistrate for Surrey in 1828 and was elected as a Member of Parliament for Lambeth at the 1832 general election. As a member of parliament he proposed radical changes in several areas, promoted technical advances, and was the instigator in 1841, and an initial member of, the Royal Fine Art Commission. Though not a member of the Anti-Corn Law League, he was an advocate of the repeal of the Corn Laws. He worked on behalf of the penny postage system; he was a supporter of the Thames tunnel scheme; and interested himself in the battle of the gauges. He was a proponent of the electric telegraph, and made the first arrangement for the partnership between Sir William Fothergill Cooke and Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1837. When Robert Peel announced in parliament the removal of support for the difference engine, in 1842, Hawes was the only MP to speak in its support.Anthony Hyman, Charles Babbage: Pioneer of the Computer (1985), p. 191; Google Books. Having engineered an inquiry in 1835 into the running of the British Museum, Hawes put the case for scientists having a voice among its trustees, a line supported by witnesses Robert Edmond Grant and Nicholas Vigors. Opposition came from Robert Harry Inglis. The zoologists Grant and Vigors were concerned that the Museum should become a research institution, with systematic across the field of natural history, and should implement current views on taxonomy; they had support from James Scott Bowerbank, but they were resisted successfully by Philip Grey Egerton and John George Children, who backed the more conservative views of Richard Owen.Desmond, pp. 146–50; Internet Archive. There were other issues, such as public access, and Edward Edwards addressed proposals about that to Hawes in 1836. Hawes joined the Church Rates Abolition Society founded in 1836 by Charles Lushington, with the MPs Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, William Ewart, Daniel Whittle Harvey, and Joseph Hume.John Stoughton, History of Religion in England from the Opening of the Long Parliament to 1850 vol. 8 (1901), p. 117; archive.org. He was one of a small group of MPs showing sympathy with Chartist agitation in 1837; though he backed away from close involvement.With John Bowring, William Sharman Crawford, Charles Hindley, Joseph Hume, John Temple Leader, Daniel O'Connell, and Thomas Perronet Thompson. See W. J. Linton, Recollections Ch. 1; online . He was also one of a group of radicals in parliament attempting to regulate the medical profession. With Hume, Thomas Wakley and Henry Warburton he tried, unsuccessfully, to introduce legislation for medical reform.Adrian J. Desmond, The Politics of Evolution: morphology, medicine, and reform in radical London (1992), pp. 14–5 note 34; Internet Archive. Under the government of John Russell, 1st Earl Russell he was made Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies rather than a full cabinet minister in an attempt to appease Henry Grey, the Secretary of State. When it was revealed Grey would prefer Charles Buller Hawes offered to resign. Grey being in the House of Lords, Hawes had to answer on Colonial Office business in the Commons; and managed to make his own opinions known, though a deputy.John S. Galbraith, Reluctant Empire: British policy on the South African frontier, 1834–1854 (1963), p. 17; Google Books. Hawes encouraged James FitzGerald, introduced by Anthony Panizzi of the British Museum, in his initial scheme of 1847 for a colony on Vancouver Island, closely based on the ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield; when there was serious criticism in the Commons, particularly from William Ewart Gladstone, of Grey and the Hudson's Bay Company as Fitzgerald's scheme foundered, Hawes defended the Colonial Office position in lukewarm fashion.John S. Galbraith, The Hudson's Bay Company as an imperial factor, 1821–1869 (1957), pp. 287–9; Google Books. Charles Pearson stood successfully, and Hawes was defeated, in Lambeth at the 1847 general election and was instead elected for the corrupt seat of Kinsale by only three votes. He resigned on 25 October 1851 by appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, and was appointed to the unelected position of Deputy Secretary at War, a position he held till 1857. At the War Office Hawes as official opposed sweeping change in his department. When Charles Edward Trevelyan reported on it, Hawes produced his own counter-report.Richard A. Chapman, J. R. Greenaway, The Dynamics of Administrative Reform (1980), p. 24; Google Books. For two years he served under Sidney Herbert, who worked closely with Florence Nightingale; but in 1854, during the first part of the Crimean War, Herbert went out of office. Hawes then acquired the reputation, with Nightingale, of obstructing her at every turn.Sue M. Goldie, Florence Nightingale: letters from the Crimea, 1854–1856 (1997), p. 110; Google Books. Jonathan Peel was of the view that the adoption of the Armstrong Gun was a result of Hawes's influence. In 1857, reorganisation of the War Office brought Hawes into a new post, as Permanent Under-Secretary.Charles Edmund Carrington, John Robert Godley of Canterbury (1950), p. 196; Google Books. In 1860 Charles Babbage was dealing with Hawes, promoting a scientific approach to gunnery.Anthony Hyman, Charles Babbage: Pioneer of the Computer (1985), p. 232; Google Books. He died on 15 May 1862. Works Hawes was the author of: * A Narrative of an Ascent of Mont Blanc during the Summer of 1827 by Mr. W. Hawes and Mr. C. Fellows (1828). * The Abolition of Arrest and Imprisonment for Debt considered in Six Letters (1836). * Speech of B. Hawes, jun., in opposition to the second reading of the Bank of England Charter Bill (1844). He also wrote a paper in the Transactions of the Central Society of Education, 1838. Family In 1820, Hawes married Sophia Macnamara Brunel, daughter of Marc Brunel. She died on 17 January 1878. The eldest daughter Sophia Brunel Hawes married Charles Justin MacCarthy in 1848. The marriage made Isambard Kingdom Brunel his brother-in-law; and in his capacity at the War Office, Hawes called in 1855 on the younger Brunel to design a pre-fabricated military hospital, for the Crimean War.John A. Shepherd, The Crimean Doctors: a history of the British medical services in the Crimean War, vol. 1 (1991), p. 436; Google Books.

He was the eldest son of Bolesław III the Generous, Duke of Legnica-Brieg by his first wife, Margaret of Bohemia. He was named after his maternal grandfather, King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. BiographyEarly years= The circumstances surrounding Wenceslaus's childhood and adolescence are unknown. The first attested presence of the young heir of Legnica-Brieg was in 1329, when he, alongside his father, paid homage to King John of Luxemburg, his uncle, husband of his maternal aunt Elisabeth. =Co-ruler= Bolesław III's free spending way infuriated Wenceslaus, who, worried about the fate of the family's patrimony. This prompted Wenceslaus to rebel against his father. Bolesław III didn't want to fight with his son, and so gave to him the Duchy of Namysłów as an independent fief, in 1338. Four years later (1342), Bolesław III decided to abdicate all his lands to his two surviving sons - Wenceslaus and his younger brother Louis I of Brzeg - in exchange for Namysłów, which was almost immediately sold by Bolesław III to King Casimir III the Great. Together with his second wife, Katharina Šubić, Bolesław III retired to the small towns of Brieg and Oława, where he retained residences. The two brothers initially decided to co-rule without any land divisions, in order to pay the huge debts of the duchy. The resources of Legnica were minimal, because their eccentric father had sold several productive parcels of land. Even the extraction of gold from the mines of Mikołajowice proved insufficient. In 1345, the brothers decided upon a formal division of their authority and rule. Louis convince his older brother to ceded him the overlordship of Legnica in exchange for the towns of Złotoryja, Chojnów, Chocianów and Lubin (Lüben). =Consolidation of power= However, within one year, Wenceslaus changed his mind, believing the division of the Duchy of Legnica to be inherently inequitable. Two reasons motivated him: he was seriously ill, and after eight years of childless marriage, his wife was expecting their first child. Wenceslaus claimed all the inheritance of Legnica; in exchange, he promised to name Louis as his sole heir, even if his unborn child was a son. Louis agreed and resigned his lands to Wenceslaus. In exchange, he received monetary compensation of 400 pieces of silver per year and the possession of the palace of Buczyna. The unexpected renunciation by Louis, without a fight, may have been motivated by his belief that his brother was dying, and that he would soon regain Legnica. However, with time, it became apparent that Wenceslaus, despite his illness, was not dying. The situation was further complicated by the birth of the first of Wenceslaus's four sons, Rupert. Louis sought to annul his resignation on the basis that the promised annual compensation was not paid, but without success. The situation remained in an unstable peace until the death of Bolesław III (21 April 1352), which resulted in a civil war between the brothers. =Period of Conflict= Despite attempts at mediation by Duke Konrad I of Oleśnica, Przecław von Pogarell, Bishop of Wroclaw, and Emperor Charles IV, the war continued for six years, during which time both sides won and lost advantage. The war ended in July 1359, when a settlement was reached between the brothers. In that settlement, Wenceslaus – who lost the final battle – was compelled to give to Louis the districts of Brzeg-Oława (which returned to him after the death of their stepmother, Katharina Šubić) and Chojnów as an independent Duchy (however, one half of Brzeg-Oława, with Byczyna, were already sold by Wenceslaus to Duke Bolko II of Świdnica). An additional concession by Wenceslaus was the payment of 4,500 pieces of silver to his younger brother, as compensation for damages. In addition to the conflict with his brother, Wenceslaus was also involved in promoting the rule of the House of Luxemburg in Silesia. In 1348 he represented the Emperor as a mediator in a dispute between the Bishop of Wroclaw, Przecław von Pogarell, and the local nobility. In February 1348, Wenceslaus was part of the entourage who accompanied Emperor Charles IV, when he traveled to Bautzen in order to arrange a meeting with Frederick II, Margrave of Meissen and Langrave of Thuringia with the purpose of settling their frontier disputes. Eleven years later, in 1360, Wenceslaus was again a mediator in the dispute between Duke Konrad I of Oleśnica and Duke Przemyslaus I of Cieszyn (Teschen) over the control of the Duchy of Bytom-Koźle. =Final years= During the entire period of his reign, Wenceslaus was confronted with the financial difficulties of his Duchy. The lands and property that he had inherited from his father, Duke Bolesław III, came with enormous debts attached. In an effort to manage this debt, Wenceslaus was forced to rent out large portions of his Duchy to neighboring Princes and Bishops, and even ordinary Knights and townspeople. Despite the disastrous financial situation of Legnica, Wenceslaus embarked upon several costly ventures, in an effort to raise the prestige of the Duchy, and himself. He founded a Benedictine monastery and Kolegiate in Legnica called \\"Church of God\\" (pl: Bożego Grobu), and ordered the creation of a gold coin called a \\"wacławki\\", which was circulated throughout the realm. Wenceslaus died on 2 June 1364 and was buried in the Church of God in Legnica, which was then under construction. His excommunication, as a punishment for unpaid debts, led to major complications. It was not until 1365 that his sons finally obtained a pardon for him. Wenceslaus's ornate tombstone remains intact, and is currently maintained in the Legnica Cathedral. Marriage and issue By 1338, Wenceslaus married with Anna (b. ca. 1325 – d. 1367), daughter of Duke Casimir I of Cieszyn. They had five children: #Rupert I (b. 27 March 1347 – d. bef. 12 January 1409). #Wenceslaus II (b. 1348 – d. 30 December 1419). #Bolesław IV (b. ca. 1349 – d. 3/4 March 1394). #Hedwig (b. ca. 1351 – d. 1 August 1409), married on 10 February 1372 to Henry VI, Duke of Głogów-Żagań. #Henry VIII (b. ca. 1355 – d. 12 December 1398).

Prescoed is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and acts as a satellite prison of the nearby HMP Usk. History Prescoed has been re-purposed multiple times since its construction by prisoner labour in 1939. From 1939 to 1964, it was an open borstal for youth. From 1964 to 1983, it was an open Borstal. The nearby HMP Usk was a Detention Centre. It was used for the next five years as an open Youth Custody Centre before, in 1988, becoming an open Young Offender Institution. By 2000, it was transformed into an adult open prison. In July 2003, Prescoed Prison (along with HMP Usk) was listed by the Prison Service as one of the top five performing Prisons in England and Wales, the first time that prisons had been ranked in a published league table. In 2004 Prescoed started to hold a number of convicted sex offenders who had been transferred from HMP Usk. There was considerable opposition to this from local residents, who feared that such inmates may abscond from the open jail and pose a threat to local children. There were several incidents of convicted sex offenders absconding from Prescoed. The prison holds [July 2017] around 10% (an average of 25) sex offenders. In August 2008, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that although there had been \\"dips in performance\\", Prescoed and Usk prisons retained good standards. Among features of the prison praised by the report were cleanliness, safety, race equality work, and interrelations between staff and prisoners. Also found to be good were the education and training provisions for inmates at both sites. However the report found that staff were not \\"sufficiently trained.\\" Resettlement projects for inmates at Prescoed were said to be run \\"reasonably well\\". Today Prescoed is an open prison, accommodating Category D adult males. Inmates are normally transferred to Prescoed from other jails (mainly Cardiff, Swansea, Parc, Earlstoke, Channings Wood and sometimes HMP Usk), to serve out the latter parts of their sentences, and re-integrate back into the community before release. Accommodation at the prison is divided into at least 10 purpose-built living units, some with single rooms, rest being doubles where each prisoner usually has his own room key. All prisoners are interviewed by the Learning and Skills Department of the prison in their first week at Prescoed. A range of education is offered to inmates on a full-time and part- time basis. Vocational training is also offered at Prescoed through work placements. Many inmates work on the prison's farm, which has 120 dairy cattle plus young stock, along with a small herd of pedigree Welsh Black cattle. There is also a sawmill, from which wood products, sourced from a woodland, are being developed by prisoners and staff. Other facilities at the prison include a library, IT suites, gym, and a chaplaincy service. The prison has an operational capacity of 230.

Some of Canada's most important institutions and landmarks lie along its route. During state visits, Confederation Boulevard is toured by foreign dignitaries. On Canada Day, much of Confederation Boulevard is closed to cars. Confederation Boulevard is an initiative of the National Capital Commission (NCC). The route's name commemorates Canadian Confederation. Design Example of a street sign on Confederation Boulevard Confederation Boulevard is a collection of several streets in Ottawa and Gatineau, forming a loop with several spurs. In order to connect these streets visually, urban designers employed the use of consistent street paving (using pink Canadian granite), lampposts adorned with bronze maple leaves, and distinctive street furniture. Along the route, art exhibits and interpretation panels can also be found. Opposite sides of the Boulevard were designed somewhat differently to emphasize the relationship between the \\"Town\\" (normal urban space) and the \\"Crown\\" (federal government space). The NCC created annual Confederation Boulevard banners display in 1992 for Canada's 125th birthday celebrations and the development of Confederation Boulevard. Since then, the NCC has commemorated important anniversaries and milestones in Canada's history with banners on the boulevard, including the 400th anniversary of Acadia (2004), the Year of the Veteran and the centenaries of Alberta and Saskatchewan (2005), the 150th anniversary of the Canadian Museum of Civilization (2006), and the 100th Anniversary of Parks Canada (2011).

Originated from Scotland. History In 1791, Sir John Sinclair brought ewes from the Cheviot Hills near the English border to the counties of Caithness and Sutherland in north Scotland. He named these sheep \\"Cheviots\\" after the hill area they originated. Another hill breed was introduced into the ranges of central Scotland thus the Scottish Blackface created a definite separation between northern counties of Caithness and Sutherland and the border region in southern Scotland. Most authorities speculate that both English and Border Leicesters may have been introduced into the North Country Cheviots at this time. The result was a larger sheep that had a longer fleece, and one that matured earlier. The North Country is about twice the size of its southern relative. In 1912, Caithness and Sutherland breeders formed the North Country Sheep Breeders Association to manage shows and sales. In 1945, the organization was reformed into the existing North Country Cheviot Sheep Society for registration, exporting, promotion and breed improvement. Characteristics Physical Characteristics = North Country Cheviots are considered a large breed of sheep, they are deep, broad, and long throughout the body. Their head and legs are covered with white, short hair. They have a long roman nose and are polled. the nostrils and eyes are typically outlined with black. = Temperament = They are a hardy, strong willed, independent breed of sheep that do well in harsh climates and on rough pastures. They are lamb easily with excellent mothering instincts. Their off spring are vigorous at birth and have high survival rates, although they only have an average rate of gain they make up for it in the quality and yield of their carcass. North Country Cheviots are excellent for crossbreeding both through the dam and sire, they pass on their maternal strengths and desirable carcasses to any offspring. The breed has a considerably longer working life than most of the other breeds. = Weight = North Country Cheviot ewe and lamb Rams weigh form 100-120kg, ewes weigh form 55-80kg, and their fleece weighs 2–2.3kg ReferencesExternal links *Irish North Country Cheviot Breeder website *UK North Country Cheviot website Category:Sheep breeds Category:Sheep breeds originating in Scotland ","title":"North Country Cheviot"},{"id":"20944095","text":"My Destiny In Your Hands () is a 1963 Brazilian drama film written, directed by, and starring José Mojica Marins.

They were arrested on November 11, 2008 in an operation carried out by French police throughout Paris, Rouen and particularly Tarnac, rural France. The operation resulted in twenty arrests, of whom eleven were released almost immediately afterward. The remaining nine who were held for questioning, and who on November 15 were variously listed as suspects and accused of crimes, then became known as the Tarnac Nine. One year later, Glibert's husband Christophe Becker was also arrested in Tarnac in connection with the matter; as a result, the group is also sometimes known as the Tarnac Ten. The group were \\"accused of 'criminal association for the purposes of terrorist activity' on the grounds that they were to have participated in the sabotage of overhead electrical lines on France's national railways.\\" In late October and early November 2008, horseshoe-shaped iron bars were used to obstruct power cables of the TGV railways at locations throughout France, resulting in delays for about 160 trains. In particular, one instance of this occurred on November 7–8, 2008, in Dhuisy, Seine-et-Marne, near Paris. On the same night, Coupat and his partner Lévy were driving in the area, under police surveillance. Three days later, the arrests were made. On April 12, 2018, following a long and complex legal case, the group were acquitted of the most serious charges brought against them, including sabotage and conspiracy, with some members being convicted on lesser charges. Background and Tarnac The original group of nine consists of five women and four men, aged from 22 through 34 at the time of the arrests, who are generally well-educated. Coupat was a former graduate student and is a political writer, having contributed to a philosophical journal called Tiqqun. Coupat's partner, Lévy, is an archaeologist. Others have been described as \\"a Swiss sitcom actor (Thomas), a distinguished clarinettist (Glibert), a student nurse (Hallez, an ex-partner of Coupat's) and Benjamin Rosoux, a University of Edinburgh graduate who runs the (Tarnac's) grocer's shop and its adjoining bar-restaurant.\\" At the time of the arrests, Deveaux and Hauck were also described as beginning graduate students in sociology and English, respectively. The nine were part of a larger group of like-minded, left-wing young people who sought to relocate to a rural area in order to live simply and communally, shunning consumerism. Consequently, they scouted locations and settled on Tarnac, both for its rural setting and also for the similar political orientation of the local residents: in Limousin, Tarnac is part of an area of France which has a long history with communism and the French Resistance of World War II, having successfully avoided German occupation. Upon moving in, the group began operating a disused shop and bar, and began community initiatives such as a film club and food delivery services for elderly locals. The newcomers were generally well-liked by their neighbors. On the other hand, authorities have rejected this positive image of the group, instead describing them as an anarchist terrorist cell who sought a rural location as a base of operations and who shunned cell phones in order to avoid detection by authorities. Legal Case From the time of the arrests until 2018, the group had been involved in complex legal proceedings in which the members faced various criminal charges related to terrorism, sabotage, conspiracy, and refusal to submit to biological sampling. Four of the nine were released shortly after the arrests; Glibert, Hallez and Rosoux were later released on December 2, 2008, and Lévy was released on January 16, 2009. Coupat, who was presumed by the prosecution to be the group's leader, was released on May 28, 2009. In late November 2009, a further arrest was made: Christophe Becker, husband of Glibert, was arrested in Tarnac on related suspicions, and released shortly thereafter. In response, and in defiance of the judicial supervision with which they were ordered to comply, the nine met and jointly wrote a letter, published in Le Monde in early December: Why we will no longer respect the judicial restraints placed upon us. The group's judicial supervision orders were lifted on December 18, 2009, and due to the new arrest, the group are sometimes instead described as the Tarnac Ten. The prosecution's case was based upon police surveillance of the group, particularly the above proximity of Coupat and Lévy to a site where sabotage occurred. Further, the group generally (and Coupat specifically) were suspected of being possible members of the Invisible Committee, an anonymous author (or authors) who wrote The Coming Insurrection, an anti-capitalist, anarchist tract originally published in 2007 which admonishes its readers to form communes and disrupt infrastructure, reminiscent of the politics and activities which the group were actually engaged in, and also of the specific crimes with which they were accused. In particular, according to the prosecution, one passage of the book seems to directly anticipate the rail sabotage: Over time, the prosecution's case weakened. As the case progressed, it was asserted that the method of sabotage employed could not have caused injuries, but merely disruption. Thierry Fragnoli, a magistrate originally assigned to the case, recused himself in April 2012. In addition to being released from jail and having their judicial supervision lifted (despite the seriousness of the accusations), on August 7, 2015, magistrate Jeanne Duyé ordered that the specifically terrorist related charges against the group be dropped, a judgment which was upheld by the French supreme court. On April 12, 2018, the group were acquitted of the most serious remaining charges brought against them, particularly sabotage and conspiracy, while certain members were convicted on lesser charges with minimal or no sentences. In response to the publicity of the arrests, several philosophers came to the support of the nine, including Giorgio Agamben, Alberto Toscano, Alain Badiou, and Slavoj Žižek. Further, several international \\"support committees\\", on behalf of the nine, \\"have sprung up across France and in the US, Spain, and Greece\\".

As Peter Hirtle writes, \\"Through a series of seminal articles in Science in the 1930s and 1940s, Seidell established a theoretical justification for the use of microfilms as a means of facilitating scientific information exchange.\\" With M. de Saint Rat, Seidell developed a simple, inexpensive ($2.00 in 1950), monocular microfilm viewing device, known as the \\"Seidell viewer,\\" that was sold during the 1940s and 1950s. Seidell's studies of vitamins lead to numerous publications, including the book, Solubilities of Inorganic and Organic Compounds. This text was first announced in a 1907 issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society, with the title, Solubilities of Inorganic and Organic Substances: A Handbook of the Most Reliable Quantitative Solubility Determinations. The text appeared in numerous editions over the course of fifty years, the last with which Seidell was involved being entitled, Solubilities, Inorganic and Metal Organic Compounds: A Compilation of Solubility Data from the Periodical Literature.

Announced on January 3, 2009, the name and some of the features of the game honor the 40th anniversary of the first manned mission to the Moon (Latin: Luna). It is FRC's 18th game. This is the first FRC competition to use the cRIO Mobile Device Controller control system from National Instruments. The driver station introduced for 2009 was the Kwikbyte DS, which was replaced in 2010 by the Classmate PC. Game overviewScoring= *Moon Rocks (Orange and Purple) — 120 available — 2 pts each *Empty Cells (Orange and Blue) — Up to 8 — 2 pts each *Super Cells (Green and Purple) — Up to 8 — 15 pts each Total score for the alliance is the total number of points scored by placing Moon Rocks, Empty Cells and Super Cells in the trailers of all of the robots of the opposing alliance, less any deductions for penalties. =Field= Lunacy field Lunacy is played on a rectangular field that is 54' by 27'. This field is a material called 'Glasliner FRP' and is referred to as 'Regolith'. The regolith is designed so that the robots, which have special mandated wheels that they cannot modify in any way, shape or form, have reduced traction, mimicking the effect of low gravity that would be seen by a robot driving on the moon. =Alliances= There are 6 robots on the field at a time, 3 on the red alliance and 3 on the blue alliance. Each team consists of 4 players - 2 drivers, a coach and a human player. There are a total of 6 human players, 3 on each alliance since there are 3 teams per alliance. Each alliance is assigned the 2 corner positions at either end of one long side of the field, and one position in the middle of the opposite long side of the field. All human players start with 20 Moon Rocks, and the players in the middle have, in addition to the 20 Moon Rocks, 4 Empty Cells. Each team can place up to 7 of their 20 Moon Rocks into their robot before the competition begins, but each human player must retain at least 13 Moon Rocks to start. =Robots= Robots have to fit within a 38\\" by 28\\" footprint, be less than or equal to 60\\" tall, and weigh under or equal to 120 pounds. The robots drag trailers behind them that correspond to the color of the alliance they are on. It is not possible for a robot to have any mechanism that takes Moon Rocks out of their trailer, or prevent another robot or human player from placing balls into their trailer. Robots must have bumpers on them in order to protect from damage from the collisions that will inevitably occur. =Game Play= The goal of the game is to score as many of the game pieces in the opposing side's trailers as possible. Robots start out in front of the opposite alliances' human players. There is a 15-second autonomous period, during which robots operate according to programs that teams download to their robot, and a 2-minute Teleoperated period, where robots are driven and controlled by a human drive subteam at one end of the field. Empty cells (also worth 2 points) must be handed to a robot by the \\"payload specialist\\" at the mid-field position known as the \\"outpost\\". The robot must deliver the Empty Cell to their human player on one of the corners in order to get a Super Cell that is worth 15 points. A robot can only carry one Empty Cell at a time. Super Cells can only be put into play during the last 20 seconds of play, and only if the human player has been delivered an Empty Cell. Common Robot TypesShooter= \\"Shooter\\" robots were able to shoot one ball at a time, usually over a long range. Successful shooters were fairly uncommon, and often did not directly score. Instead, they shot balls to the Human Players at the corners. Self-reloading was very common amongst the shooters. =Dump bot= \\"Dumper\\" bots typically started out the match with their entire supply of balls for the match, which scored by driving alongside the opponent's trailer and dumping all their balls into the trailer. =Vomit bot= 150px \\"Vomit\\" bots, also called \\"power dumpers\\", were a hybrid between the shooter and the dumper. They were often the best robots, combining the accuracy of the shooter with the massive scoring of the dumper. These robots would drive up to an opponents trailer and \\"vomit\\" a stream of balls into the trailer, (often as many as 10 or more at once). Many were self reloading, and were the rarest type of robot. =Dozer bot= \\"Dozer\\" bots were the most common, and often the least effective robots.

History The AN/URM-25 was part of a series of vacuum tube-based signal generators built for the U.S. military in the early Cold War-era. Today they are collected and used by vintage amateur radio and antique radio enthusiasts who say they provide reasonably high accuracy and stability for a low cost, with build quality reflecting tough military construction requirements and standards. R-390a.net, URM-25x discussions Specifications w/freq. meter Frequency output ranges from 10 kHz to 50 MHz with amplitude modulation selectable at 400 and 1,000 Hz. RF level from 0.1 microvolts to 100 millivolts or 2 volts is available depending upon termination load. Output impedance is 50,500 ohms. Carrier signal generation is performed by a 6AH6 tube with an additional 6AH6 buffer stage followed by a 6AG7 output amplifier. Amplitude modulation at 400 and 1,000 Hz is provided by a 5814A (military 12AU7) oscillator. URM-25x models also contain an internal VTVM (vacuum tube voltmeter) and crystal calibration. The carrier frequency can be set by interpolation using the graduated dial. Additionally, the URM-25's have a BNC connector for constant 200 mV output that can be connected to a frequency meter to display frequency accurately. A sufficient warm-up period is required to ensure the best stability at higher frequencies. The cabinet cover includes accessories such as an impedance adapter, fixed attenuator and antenna simulator. Additional accessory kit MK-288 includes adapters and more dummy loads.R.F.

The organization's logo is the international tourist information symbol, a lower-case white \\"i\\" inside a blue circle, followed by \\"perú\\". The Iperú headquarters are in Lima, and there are multilingual offices throughout the country. During 2007, Iperú handled 287,492 cases, including requests for information and for assistance or both, all over Peru. Functions Iperú has three core purposes: * To provide visitor information. * To advise tourists on relevant paperwork and procedures required by public and private institutions. * To contribute to the resolution of complaints from tourists against operators of tourist services. Iperú provides free information and services for various sorts of travelers to and within Peru - including tourists, businesspeople and academics - before, during, and even after their trip. The organization has a comprehensive database of registered tourism services in the country, as well as information about places, attractions, routes, and travel times. Iperú also provides assistance in cases of problems arises during a trip or if tourist services are not provided as hired. Iperú is responsible for handling claims submitted by tourists against the suppliers of tourism services, with mediating and conciliatory (but not punitive) powers to resolve them. History A cooperation agreement on 24 June 1994 between Promperú and INDECOPI established the Tourist Protection Service (', SPT). Through this agreement, INDECOPI gave to the new bureau the functions of the earlier Consumer Protection Commission (', CPC) in cases against tourism companies. In 2001, noting the need for objective tourist information to visitors in order to prevent adverse incidents and improve the services provided by SPT, it was decided to add the Tourist Information Service (', SIT). Merging the functions of both services gave rise to Iperú Tourist Information and Assistance.

History Femke Halsema in 2010 The political discussion on basic income was initiated in 1975 by Leo Jansen, an MP for the progressive Christian Political Party of Radicals (PPR) and Vrije Universiteit professor J. P. Kuiper. In 1977 the issue had been incorporated in the election manifestos of the PPR. The idea was also endorsed by several smaller trade unions of the Federation of Dutch Labour Unions. In 1985, the Scientific Council for Government Policy, an independent think tank of the Dutch government, endorsed a partial basic income. However, the council's proposals were never acted upon. The PPR and the trade unions which favoured the basic income rejected the Council's proposals because the proposed basic income would be too low and implementation would be accompanied by abolition of the minimum wage. The proposal of the Scientific Council broadened, however, the debate and the issue is debated upon in the social-democratic Labour Party, the conservative liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and the progressive liberal Democrats 66, but these parties did not adopt the basic income in their programs. In 1989 the PPR merged into the GreenLeft, with the Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP), the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN) and the Evangelical People's Party. In early 1990s the GreenLeft was ambiguous to the idea of a basic income, not endorsing it in its 1989 election manifesto, but debating the issue in several publications. In 1992 the debate is re-opened by the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, an economic advisory body of the government, which like the Scientific Council endorsed a low basic income as part of simplified social security system. By 1995 the basic income was a prominent issue on the Dutch political agenda. The issue continued to be debated by political parties; the Labour Party debated the issue in its 1994 election manifesto but still rejected it. The GreenLeft, however, endorsed a negative income tax in its 1994 election manifesto, which in the long term could be made into a basic income, according to the party. In 1994 D66 minister Hans Wijers publicly favoured the basic income, leading to negative reactions by his colleagues in cabinet. D66 endorsed his position in 1995, F. Empel and K. Versteegh \\"D66 wil de sociale zekerheid vervangen door basisinkomen,\\" in NRC 6-3-1995. but did not incorporate it in its 1998 election manifesto. After the success of the first cabinet-Kok to implement its agenda of \\"work, work, work\\" and increase the levels of employment the debate about the basic income lost attention and momentum. A welfare state policy oriented at the activation of the unemployed became accepted by nearly all parties. In 2006, Femke Halsema, leader of the GreenLeft, endorsed a partial basic income and her ideas were taken over in the party's 2006 election manifesto.

It was once the break-of- gauge between the broad gauge Victorian Railways Tocumwal line from the south, and the standard gauge New South Wales Government Railways Tocumwal line from the north. However, only the line from Victoria is still open. History Local agitation for a railway to Tocumwal dates as far back as 1899, when a deputation visited Melbourne, with the Minister for Railways supporting the project. The railway line from Strathmerton was opened to the south bank of the Murray River at Tocumwal on 28 February 1905. However, the railway was not extended north into Tocumwal itself and the current station until 1908, due to the lack of agreement between the two state governments. Later, other broad gauge lines into New South Wales were built under the 1922 Border Railways Act. In April 1906, the Premiers of the two states agreed that Victoria would construct the line and the road bridge over the Murray would be rebuilt to accommodate it. New South Wales would acquire the land for the extension, while the two states would jointly fund the works. Work commenced in 1907 on the short extension, the first train running on 8 July 1908. Facilities included a weighbridge, long turntable, passenger and goods platform, and goods shed. New South Wales extended its standard gauge line from Finley southwards to Tocumwal in 1914, providing separate facilities on the eastern side of the station yard. At the time, controversy arose into whether broad or standard gauge track should be used for the extension, with residents north of Tocumwal wanting the break of gauge to be located in their towns. In 1915, Tocumwal was the site of early tests with third-rail devices to enable standard gauge and broad gauge trains to share the same tracks.Early Tests of Third Rail Devices at Tocumwal Buckland, John L. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin March, 1949 pp8-9 While the track was usable, it was not adopted due to its complexity, although other third rail systems have since emerged. In 1941, the New South Wales station platform was removed to make way for gantry cranes, with the platform relocated to the east side of the Victorian building, where it remained until closure. Control and management of the combined station was transferred to the New South Wales Railway department in 1942, Tocumwal having been a Victorian station before that time. Victorian passenger services to Tocumwal ended on 8 November 1975, with the last train operated by T class diesel locomotive T324 and passenger carriages 3AS–31BE–2AE–22CE. Before that, the Strathmerton – Cobram section of the line was operated as the \\"branch line\\", with a 102hp Walker railmotor connecting with the main line train. A bus service was then introduced for the Tocumwal branch, connecting with the Cobram service. By 1977/78, the service between Cobram and Tocumwal was being operated by a VicRail-owned station wagon, driven by the Cobram station master. The last regular passenger service on the New South Wales line ran three days a week as a railcar shuttle from Narrandera and ceased in November 1983. The last goods train was in June 1986, with traffic officially being cancelled in September 1986. The line was closed in December 1987. The Victorian line was closed in January 1990, due to bushfire damage to wooden bridges, and was not reopened until February 1995. The same year, Gray's Container Terminal opened in the station yard across from the platform, with regular trains operating to Melbourne, carrying containerised freight. The line has also been a regular destination for heritage passenger trains, run by groups such as the Seymour Railway Heritage Centre. In 1996, the Berrigan Shire Council obtained a lease over the station building, with a grant of $10,000 made available for restoration work. It is now the site of a small railway museum displaying the history of the local area.  Heritage listing  Tocumwal railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The heritage listing of the station and its associated facilities notes that it is a rare building on the New South Wales system, which illustrates the interconnecting of the New South Wales and Victorian systems, and the conflicts, particularly over gauge, that took place over the years. The main value of the building is seen as its location on a section of line that was largely connected to the Victorian system via a combined road and rail bridge. The bridge is assessed as being of very high significance because of its technological value, as well as its importance in the history of transport in the New South Wales and association with interstate rivalries.

Graduating with honours from Goldsmiths, Von went on to develop his own style of abstraction, with a keystone on the masters that have gone before – particularly Pablo Picasso, Paul Gauguin and Georgia O'Keeffe. Von's philosophy on art finds its roots in Taoism. He expanded on many of his early ideas on art in an academic thesis based on creativity and its relationship with Taoism of Lao Tsu. Von's themes are an approach to abstract expressionism as embodied by the Tao. Von is of the Christian faith. Von's paintings have been said to have a prevailing message of tranquility.

His work is owned by people worldwide, with original paintings in locations from Australia to the far east, and from Europe to North America. Von's Art - From a philosophical backgroundThe Tao= Von is an artist who is a Jamaican that studied art in London England and found inspiration from the Sage Lao Tsu from ancient China. \\"The utility of the empty bowl is the space within\\". Lao Tsu, an older contemporary of Confucius, was keeper of the imperial archives at Loyang in the province of Honan in the 6th century B.C.Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English \\"Lao Tsu - Tao Te Ching\\" Vintage books, 1972. All his life Lao Tsu taught that \\"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao\\"; but, according to ancient legend, as he was riding off into the desert to die - sick at heart at the ways of men - he was persuaded by a gatekeeper in northwestern China to write down his teaching for posterity. This book is called the Tao Te Ching. The essence of Taoism is contained in the eighty-one chapters of the book- roughly 5,000 words- which have for 2,500 years provided one of the major underlying influences in Chinese thought and culture, emerging also in proverbs and folklore.Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English \\"Lao Tsu - Tao te ching\\" Vintage books, 1972. Whereas Confucianism is concerned with day-to-day rules of conduct, Taoism is concerned with a more spiritual level of being. Poem ONE Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English \\"Lao Tsu - Tao te ching\\" Vintage books, 1972. > The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named > is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. > The named is the mother of ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see > the mystery. Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations. These two spring > from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness > within Darkness. The gate to all mystery. The goal of an artist is to create art, to be creative. As the Taoist see it: Only Tao, mother of all things, is invisible and unfathomable, but it is through her manifestations, nevertheless, that all things are created. Alfred North Whitehead expressed his central concept thus: \\"In the philosophy of organism this ultimate is termed 'creativity' and God is its primordial, non- temporal accident.\\".Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality, 1929, P. 11 The Taoist, says that this ultimate is creativity, that creativity is Tao. Since Tao is inexpressible, explaining it in terms of the process of creativity is merely resorting to a verbal convenience, or, more precisely, a verbal inconvenience. Lao Tsu, of course, faced the same difficulty. In one place he turns to the use of numbers in attempting to describe the process of creativity. But his use of numbers is entirely without conventional meaning. In Chapter 42 of the Tao Te Ching we read: Poem Forty Two > From the Tao, the One is created; From the One, Two; From the Two, Three; > From the Three, Ten Thousand Things. The numbers as used here are simply intended to suggest the need for an intuitive awareness of the process of differentiation from nondifferentiation, the realization that the multiple diversities of existence emanate from the unity of the absolute realm of Tao. The numbers symbolize what our intellect is unable to explain. The same thing is true of the word process as is used here to try to explain it. Here obliged to resort to such a word in attempting to explain Tao intellectually. Actual creativity requires no intellectual explanation in terms of process. It is, rather, a mere intuitive reflection of things Chang Chung-yuan \\"Creativity and Taoism\\" A study of Chinese Philosophy, Art, and Poetry Wilwood House Publishing, 1975. Von the artist and student of the Tao in his academic thesis explored a subtle comparison of Taoist views and picture making. The first chapters had not dealt with any given technique or style of painting. As is reviewed in the next section (#On The Masters). For it is his view that different styles of expression are merely different directions or roads leading to the same light or oneness. As an artist and a poet Von appreciated Lao Tsu's views. Taking into consideration the idea that the artist's mind is the ultimate mirror. For he is the individual who is capable of reflecting the here and now of creation literally onto canvas. =On the masters= The style of art found in paintings by Von is primarily influenced by three masters. Pablo Picasso, Paul Gauguin and Georgia O'Keeffe. This is seen through a strong relationship with some aspects of the styles of these three masters of the visual arts. In Von's work there is a similarity in the flat shapes, hard-edged colours of Pablo Picasso, as well as a similarity in the inventiveness of their abstraction.\\"Two Naked Figures\\" 1908 http://www.pablo-ruiz-picasso.net/work-75.php\\"The Deal\\" http://www.artvontropic.com/USERIMAGES/HE4.jpg There are also similarities in Pablo Picasso's distortions of female body in some of his work with some of Von's work.\\"Trois Femmes Detail\\" http://www.pablo-ruiz- picasso.net/work-3109.php It was said that when Paul Gauguin first went to Tahiti he was amazed at the colours he was painting with, so much brighter due to the strong tropical light as opposed to France where he was formerly.Danielsson, Bengt, Gauguin in the South Seas, New York, Doubleday and Company, 1966. The tropical light and bright colours are also a strong feature of the works of Von. Beautiful women are likewise an inspiration to Von and the study of the female form. The Sunday Herald (Jamaica) 22 March 1998 Georgia O'Keeffe shows an open spatial awareness, and positive link with nature and her surroundings. This can be attributed to the time she spent living in New Mexico.Roxana Robinson. 1990. Georgia O'Keeffe: A life. Bloomsbury, London. This connection to nature and open spatial arrangement of work can be seen in Von's work as he has also been influenced by O'Keeffe. Von was born on an island and has interpreted everything in his own way from the time of the impressionists to the present, and invented his own style of painting trying to break new ground and be original in his own way. This style is termed tropical modernism i.e. von Tropic Mod. =Von's philosophy= \\"The Tao is Elusive and Intangible. Oh it is intangible and Elusive, and yet within is image. Oh elusive and intangible and yet within is form. Oh it is dim and dark and yet within is essence.\\" Lao Tsu finally says \\"thus I perceive the creation.\\" This verse encompasses that mystic unity of the physical and the metaphysical. The verse suggests that link with space and what is within the space if they complement each other. Just as how light complements darkness, some given thing, a source of material therefore an image complements nothing or emptiness, a void. To narrow this aspect of thought let us suggest that this material is our world complementary to outer space which it is within. Now the terms nature and super nature include everything which has already been reckoned with. Through the study of our visible surroundings, Cezanne came to the conclusion that everything is based on the sphere, the cone and the cylinder.Brion, Marcel (1974). Cézanne. Thames and Hudson. In this statement he did not include the cube which literally means a box, for nothing in nature is constructed from a box. Except perhaps an few seascape cliffs in remote paths for example the Giant's Causeway in Ireland. The cube or the box is a man made form and Cezanne was the first to introduce a slanting of basically rectangular patches of colour in various directions achieving three dimensional solidity and depth. This style of painting he used in landscape breaking up a natural environment. A good example is his paintings on Mont Sainte-Victoire. Sure this was a revolutionary way in seeing and out of it later came cubism, with father of modern art Picasso and Braque. They took this to its ultimate, including African sculpture as inspiration; but the cube or the box is a man-made form totally alien to natural construction unlike the sphere cone and cylinder. So her in Western society and civilisation i.e. the \\"western tradition\\", one looks out the window and there is a city to the horizon with millions of straight lines and boxes. Cubism has even influenced modern architecture. An infinity of boxes within boxes within boxes with people living within boxes. A shape which some African tribes to the day cannot accept, a shape certain American Indian tribes could not accept. Some of their buildings are the adobes of New Mexico. A shape which was uncommon in the splendid Eastern and Middle Eastern architecture. Von has been inspired by ancient Chinese Taoist thought and teaching which holds fast to the core within without losing touch with nature and therefore transcends nature into super nature. In other words, encompassing the mystic unity between the mystical and the metaphysical.Kramer, Kenneth (1986). World scriptures: an introduction to comparative religions.

A veteran of the War of 1812, Charles Danforth was also known for his patented invention, that of the Danforth Spindle, a cotton spinning frame. Mary Danforth married William Ryle of Macclesfield, Cheshire, England, reputed to be the largest and wealthiest silk importer in the United States. William Ryle was the nephew of John Ryle, the \\"Father of the U.S. Silk Industry\\" in Paterson. Throughout her life, Mary Danforth Ryle was always philanthropic. After her father's death, she donated the residence of her father to the city of Paterson to be used as the city's first library. She provided the funds to alter, furnish and equip the new institution. After the catastrophic fire of 1902, in which much of downtown Paterson was destroyed, including the Danforth Library, Ryle once again donated the funds necessary to build the new Danforth Memorial Library located on Broadway in Paterson. Ryle contracted with Henry Bacon, who designed the Lincoln Memorial to build the new city library. The Danforth Memorial Library is perhaps the most notable and beautiful public buildings in the city of Paterson, New Jersey. She died on December 21, 1904. Mary Danforth Ryle was so loved by the citizens of Paterson that at the time of her death, the funeral was one of the largest the city had ever seen. Mrs. Ryle was buried at Cedar Lawn Cemetery in Paterson. ReferencesFurther reading * Centennial Edition, Paterson (N.J.)

Underglow has become popular in car shows to add aesthetic appeal to the cars. Some US states prohibit underglow on public roads, while other countries restrict their use. Andrew Wilson, who holds 14 patents on ground effects lighting and other products, invented it in 1987. He changed his name from \\"Andrew\\" to \\"They\\" in 2004. Types of underglowNeon= Neon tubes are used for the underglow. Though neon gas only produces the color red, adding other elemental gases can produce up to 150 colors. Because neon tubes are gas compressed, they tend to break often while going over speed bumps. With the neon tubes, people are more able to adjust them to follow specific rhythms like music.Urban Neaon Car lights. FAQ page. 2005. http://www.urban-neon-car- lights.com/content/carlightfaq.html =LED= LEDs are light-emitting diodes which can be arranged in clusters. LEDs generally last longer than neon tubes, while LED strips are also considerably less fragile. They have multi-color capabilities and can have strobe effects. There are 3 major styles of underglow LED lights: pod style led lights, LED strips and flexible LED tubes. LED pods consist of a rigid housing containing several LED lights as well as a lens. LED strips are easy to install almost everywhere, including engine bays or air intake scoops. LED tubes produce steady light that resembles classic neon glow. Recent LED developments have led to underglow that can respond to music, draw patterns and act as courtesy lights or brake lights. Sometimes this is done via Bluetooth and a smart phone or an RF remote.

It was opened in 1867 by the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company as a single platform stop along the line from Bristol to Portishead. It was later taken over by the Great Western Railway and had a second platform added. Passenger services at the station declined following the Second World War, and the Beeching Report recommended the complete closure of the Portishead line. Passenger services at Clifton Bridge ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services following on 5 July 1965, although the line saw occasional traffic until 1981. Most of the station was demolished, leaving some remains of the platforms, a retaining wall and the footbridge. Regular freight trains through the station began to run again in 2002 when Royal Portbury Dock was connected to the rail network. The line is due to be reopened to passenger traffic as part of MetroWest, but there are no plans to reopen the station.  History  Clifton Bridge railway station was opened on 18 April 1867 by the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company, when services began on their line from the Bristol and Exeter Railway at Portishead Junction to a pier on the Severn Estuary at . The line was built as broad-gauge, and was largely single track. The station was sited in Bower Ashton at the southern end of the Avon Gorge, at the bottom of Rownham Hill and near the western bank of the river. The station, which took its name from the nearby Clifton Suspension Bridge, was from the line's terminus at Portishead, from and from the Great Western Railway's terminus at .Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. To the north, the railway ran along the riverbank in the gorge, and to the south through fields just outside the Bristol conurbation. The station was initially the first along the line from Portishead Junction, before . When it opened, the station had a single platform, on the west side of the track. Road access was through a large forecourt to the west from Clanage Road / Rownham Hill, now the A369. There was a two-storey building facing the road, the ground floor of which had a single long room, partitioned into a waiting room, booking office and station master's office. The ground floor also housed a coal-fired boiler and washing facilities, while upstairs was spacious living accommodation accessed by a private staircase. A single north-facing bay platform for goods vans was at the north end of the station. The station was noted as having an excellent garden alongside the platform. The nearby Rownham Ferry allowed passengers to cross the river to Hotwells and Clifton. Services on the Portishead railway were operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, with six trains per day in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays. The operation of these transferred to the Great Western in 1876, when they took over the Bristol and Exeter, and in 1884 the Great Western took ownership of the Bristol and Portishead. The station was visited by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1878. The station saw major works at the beginning of the 1880s. From 24 to 27 January 1880, the line was relaid as standard gauge, and on 15 September 1880 a passing loop was brought into use through the station, east of the original track, with a new platform serving it. The new platform had a large shelter and a small signal cabin immediately south of the shelter, with a footbridge at the south end linking it to the original platform. Both platforms had \\"half barrel\\" canopies added. The new \\"down\\" platform served trains towards Bristol, while the original \\"up\\" platform now served trains towards Portishead. The double track through the station was extended to Portishead Junction from 1883. The station's name was changed to Rownham in March 1891, but reverted to Clifton Bridge in 1910. In 1899 the station was flooded to a depth of several feet (one metre), as were other parts of Bristol. A new signal box with 27 levers was built at the south end of the western platform, with the original cabin taken out of use from 25 August 1907. The signal box contained three token instruments, connected to the line's other signal boxes at Oakwood, and Portishead, so that the Pill or Oakwood boxes could be switched out. The boxes at Clifton Bridge and Portishead were manned 24 hours a day. By 1889, services had increased to nine trains in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays, and from 1909 this increased to 13 on weekdays and two on Sundays. In June 1914, the station played a major role in bringing passengers to the Bristol International Exhibition, known locally as the White City, held on Ashton Meadows to the south-east of the station. The exhibition came to an early end due to the outbreak of the First World War, as the buildings were used for troop barracks. The station had earlier that year seen the discovery of a decapitated corpse, later identified as prominent local solicitor Edward Payne Press. The death was ruled a suicide by means of lying down in front of a train. The war saw the establishment of a mule depot, which handled mule traffic from the docks before the animals were transported to military installations such as at or Salisbury Plain. From 1917 the station was closed on Sundays as a wartime economy measure. After the war, services increased, and from 8 July 1929 a half-hourly service operated along the line: two trains per hour to Portishead, one to Ashton Gate and one to Bristol Temple Meads, equating to 21 trains per day on weekdays. On Sundays eight trains per day operated. There were eight staff assigned to the station in the 1930s, and in 1944 three carriage sidings were laid at the south end of the station. The Portishead line again saw a rise in use during the Second World War, as Bristolians evacuated to the more rural areas of Pill and Portishead commuted in to work, many alighting at Clifton Bridge and walking across the Cumberland Basin bridges, the Rownham Ferry now obsolete. During air raids, people would sleep aboard carriages in the station sidings, or in Clifton Bridge No. 1 tunnel north of the station. The station was also used during the war for timber traffic from the local woodlands, loaded onto trains by members of the Women's Land Army. Other freight traffic included goods from the Ashton Containers factory and a local firm dealing in herbal medicine. The station was taken out of service and mostly demolished in the 1960s, but certain parts, such as the western platform, are still visible. The station footbridge now carries a footpath over the railway. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, Clifton Bridge came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Services had reduced by 1949 to 13 trains per day on weekdays and seven on Sundays, and passenger numbers fell. The station became an unstaffed halt from 29 October 1962, and in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line. Passenger services at Clifton Bridge were ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services ending the next year on 5 July 1965. In the final year of passenger operation, there were only six trains on weekdays and none on Sundays. One of the carriage sidings had been taken out of service in 1964, and the others followed in 1966. The line through the site was reduced to single track in 1965, and the signal box was closed on 4 November 1966. The station buildings were mostly demolished, and the site became the headquarters of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary Mounted Police and Dog Section. Part of the western platform remained in situ, as did the retaining wall of the eastern platform shelter. The station footbridge became part of a footpath. Freight trains continued to pass through the station, but their number decreased over time, with the line falling out of regular use from 30 March 1981. The route however was kept intact by British Rail, with occasional freight trains, and in 2002 a single track was relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Dock.  Future  The Portishead Branch Line is to be reopened as part of the MetroWest scheme, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. The scheme was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government. A consultation on the plans was held between 22 June and 3 August 2015 to gather views from the community and stakeholders before moving on to detailed designs. Due to the additional capital costs, the line will not be electrified, but the design will include passive provision for future electrification. The station at Clifton Bridge is not being considered for reopening, but the line in the area will be increased to double track. Subject to final business case approval, construction work is expected to start on the line in December 2021 and then take around two years to complete. Trains along the reopened line will operate between Portishead and , with two trains per hour in each direction. Services would call at Pill and , with aspirations to also call at and a reopened . Trains could also be extended on to the Severn Beach Line. The trains used will be diesel multiple units, likely three carriages long. The line will be operated as part of the Greater Western passenger franchise. Great Western Railway, a subsidiary of FirstGroup, currently operates the Greater Western franchise, however their present contract expires before services to Portishead are likely to start.

Biography Scandone was born on March 4, 1966, in Santa Ana, California and learned to sail in an eight-foot Sabot dinghy at the Balboa Yacht Club in California. He started sailing when he was eight-years old, after being given the choice by his mother to learn to sail or attend summer school. He attended the University of California, Irvine, where he was an All- American and won a national championship in 1988 and graduated in 1990.Museler, Chris. \\"Nick Scandone, Winner of Paralympics Sailing Gold, Is Dead at 42\\", The New York Times, January 4, 2009. Accessed January 5, 2009. In 1991, he won the National American title in the double-handed 470 class. Described by The New York Times as \\"a rising star in the sailing world in the 1980s and '90s\\", Scandone entered the 1992 Olympic trials as the favorite in 470 class but just missed earning a berth on the United States Olympic squad. Following the disappointment in 1992, Scandone began working in the advertising profession and later became a restaurant equipment salesman. =Paralympic sailing= In July 2002, a doctor diagnosed what had started as chronic back pain as being caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He quit his job and began training for the Paralympic Games in the single-handed 2.4 Meter keelboat, a craft that has been considered ideal for handicap integrated sailing since the sailor does not move in the boat, and everything is adjustable from right in front of the sailor, with both hand-steering and foot-steering possible. By 2005, Scandone was participating as a Classification 7, under a system in which a Paralympic sailor's mobility is rated from 1 to 7, with the lowest number representing the most severe level of disability. He won the 2005 Open World Championships in the 2.4 Meter class in a regatta off the coast of Elba, Italy, defeating 87 other boats skippered by 60 able-bodied and 27 other disabled sailors, and was named as US Sailing's Rolex Yachtsman of the Year, making him the only Paralympic sailor ever to achieve the honor.Nick Scandone, US Paralympics. Accessed January 5, 2008. However, by the end of 2006, his condition had advanced to the point where he was physically unable to participate in the 2.4-Meter class, which specifies single-handed operation, and was approaching Classification 1 status. Scandone switched to the SKUD 18 class, a newly-added Paralympic event for Classification 1 sailors that was the first Paralympic class to specify a quadriplegic member participating in the two-person crew. Together with crewmate Maureen McKinnon-Tucker, a paraplegic from Marblehead, Massachusetts, he won the Gold medal at the U.S. Paralympic trials in 2007 held off of Newport, Rhode Island. Heading towards the 2008 Summer Paralympics in China in 2008, Scandone's physical condition deteriorated further. His coaches had to modify the steering and seat systems, and had to change the electronic controls from toggles to buttons to accommodate the weakening of his fingers. He was chosen by his fellow members of the 2008 United States Paralympics Team with the honor of being the flag bearer for the U.S. team at the opening ceremonies of the Paralympic Games in Beijing. Scandone and McKinnon-Tucker won most of their early races, but Scandone required feeding and hydration between races, sometimes intravenously. As the team had won most of their races, they did not have to compete on the final day of competition and won the gold medal in what was described as \\"dominating fashion\\". Scandone was nominated for the 2008 Yachtsman of the Year award for his gold-medal performance. Before his death, he helped promote the Maritime Sciences and Seamanship Foundation at Balboa Yacht Club, a program that he created to encourage disabled sailors to participate in the sport. Scandone died January 2, 2009 at his home in Fountain Valley, California aged 42.Noland, Claire. \\"Nick Scandone dies at 42; Orange County gold medalist in sailing at Paralympic Games\\", Los Angeles Times, January 4, 2009.

The unit was first activated in May 1943 and flew the P-38 Lightning in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The 433d distinguished themselves in air combat against Japan over New Guinea, Rabaul, and the Philippines, achieving over 200 aerial victories. Reactivated in 1964 for the war in Southeast Asia, the 433d was assigned to the 8th Fighter Wing at Ubon, Thailand, flying the F-4 Phantom II. The 433d was credited with 12 MiG kills over North Vietnam. HistoryWorld War II= Established by Fifth Air Force in Australia in May 1943 specifically to accommodate very long range Lockheed P-38J Lightnings at Amberley Airfield in Queensland, Australia. The 433rd was specifically trained to provide long- range escort for bombers during daylight raids on Japanese airfields and strongholds in the Netherlands East Indies and the Bismarck Archipelago. Engaged in combat operations, providing escort for B-25 Mitchell medium bombers that were engaged in strafing attacks on airdromes at Wewak but also destroyed a number of the enemy fighter planes that attacked the formation. Also intercepted and destroyed many Japanese aircraft which were sent against American shipping in Oro Bay on 15 and 17 October 1943. Covered landings in New Guinea, New Britain, and the Schouten Islands. After moving to Biak in July 1944, the squadron flew escort missions and fighter sweeps to the southern Philippines, Celebes, Halmahera, and Borneo. Moved to the Philippines in October 1944 and attacked enemy airfields and installations, escorting bombers, and engaging in aerial combat during the first stages of the Allied campaign to recover the Philippines, October–December 1944. The squadron flew many missions to support ground forces on Luzon during the first part of 1945. Also flew escort missions to Southeast China and attacked railways on Formosa. Began moving to Ie Shima near Okinawa in August 1945 but the war ended before the movement was completed. After active combat ended, on 22 September 1945, the squadron moved to Seoul Airfield, Korea for occupation duty as part of the 308th Bomb Wing, assigned to the 315th Air Division of Far East Air Forces. The unit moved to Kimpo Airfield, on 7 January 1946 where the it converted to the very long-range P-51H Mustang. The squadron was reassigned to Nagoya Airfield, Japan in March 1947 and later moved to Itazuke Airfield, Japan in August 1948. It became a subordinate unit of 475th Fighter Wing on 10 August. The squadron was inactivated on 1 April 1949 at Itazuke Airfield, Japan =Cold War= 433d FIS F-89D-75-NO Scorpion 54-191 about 1956 at Ladd AFB, Alaska Reactivated by Air Defense Command in 1952 as a Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, stationed at Truax Field, Wisconsin and equipped with F-89 Scorpions. Deployed to Eleventh Air Force at Ladd AFB, Alaska, 1954 performing air defense of central and Northern Alaska, responding to GCI directed intercepts of intruding Soviet aircraft. Returned to the Continental United States, being assigned to Minot AFB, North Dakota in 1957. However, no aircraft were assigned to the unit, and January 1958 the 433d FIS was inactivated due to budget restraints. Was reassigned to Tactical Air Command, being stationed at George AFB, California, assigned to 8th Tactical Fighter Wing. Equipped with F-4C Phantom II tactical fighter-bomber, engaged in training, participated in numerous exercises, operational readiness inspections, deployments. =Vietnam War= McDonnell F-4C-24-MC Phantom 64-0829, Known as \\"Scat XXVII\\", assigned to the 433d Tactical Fighter Squadron, Ubon RTAFB, Thailand. This aircraft was flown by Colonel Robin Olds while he was the commander of the 8th Tactical Fighter Fighter Wing at Ubon. Col. Olds was credited with shooting down four enemy MiG aircraft (two with this aircraft) in aerial combat over North Vietnam. Aircraft is now on permanent display at the Museum of the United States Air Force. Was deployed to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in December 1965, becoming part of Pacific Air Forces Thirteenth Air Force. Assigned to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, engaged in combat operations over Southeast Asia, the squadron's mission included bombardment, ground support, air defense, interdiction, and armed reconnaissance. Beginning in May 1967, was re-equipped with new F-4D aircraft. This gave the unit the distinction of being the first in Southeast Asia to be operationally equipped with improved Phantom II. In May 1968, employed laser-guided bombs (LGBs) in combat for the first time. During its final years of combat, used F-4Ds for fast-forward air control, interdiction, escort, armed reconnaissance, and other special missions. Continued combat in Vietnam until mid-January 1973, in Laos until 22 February 1973, and in Cambodia until 15 August 1973. Remained in Thailand until July 1974 when the squadron was inactivated. =Fighter Weapons Squadron= Reactivated as part of the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing at Nellis AFB, Nevada on 1 October 1976. Mission of the squadron was test and evaluate systems modifications to the McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle prior to those changes being released to operational units of Tactical Air Command and USAFE. Mission assumed by USAF Fighter Weapons School F-15 Division at the end of 1981, inactivated on 30 December. =Flying Training= Reactivated in 1983 at Holloman AFB, New Mexico as a T-38 Talon training squadron to provide Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) training for pilots assigned to fly the F-15 Eagle. Performed training on the T-38 until the LIFT program was sharply cut back in 1991, as part of the end of the Cold War. Inactivated 8 July 1992. =USAF Weapons School= 433d WPS F-22A Block 30 Raptor 06-0109 433d WPS McDonnell Douglas F-15C-36-MC Eagle 83-0041 Reactivated at Nellis AFB in 2003, replacing the USAF Fighter Weapons School F-15C Division. Mission was conduct Weapons Instructors Course at the USAF Weapons School and provide the world's most advanced training in weapons and tactics employment. Upon completing the course, graduates return to their home stations, taking the latest tactics, techniques and procedures for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat to their respective units. During the course, students receive an average of 400 hours of graduate-level academics and participate in demanding combat training missions. The climax of the course is the mission employment phase, a two-week staged battle over the Nevada Test and Training Range. Began teaching F-15 course in Feb 2003.

It can cause epizootic outbreaks of disease in houseflies and has been investigated as a potential biological control agent. Life cycle Soon after a fly dies from infection with this pathogenic fungus, large primary conidia are produced at the apex of a conidiophore which emerge from the intersegmental membranes. When the spores are mature they are forcibly ejected and may fall onto flies resting nearby. If no hosts are available for infection, a smaller secondary conidium may develop. Once on a fly, the conidia germinate within a few hours and a germ tube begins to penetrate the insect's cuticle. Once this reaches the haemocoel, the protoplast flows through the tube and into the fly's haemolymph. The mycelium of the fungus may grow into an area of the brain that controls the behaviour of the fly, forcing it to land on a surface and crawl upwards. The hyphae gradually grow through the whole of the body, digesting the guts, and the fly dies in about five to seven days. When it is critically ill, it tends to crawl to a high point, straighten its hind legs and open its wings, a behaviour that ensures that the fungal spores are dispersed as widely as possible. Some three hours later, conidiophores start to develop and a new shower of conidia is initiated. Host range Female Melanostoma scalare hoverfly infected with Entomophthora muscae As well as the housefly, Musca domestica, infection has been observed in adult flies in the families Calliphoridae, Culicidae, Drosophilidae, Muscidae, Sarcophagidae, Scathophagidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae. Ecology Outbreaks of infection with Entomophthora muscae tend to occur in the spring and autumn. The fungus is found in most temperate regions and sporulation usually takes place in cool, humid conditions in areas where flies congregate and rest. In houses, the corpses of flies are frequently seen attached to windows or window frames, a place where other flies may easily become infected. In the open, they may be seen attached to the underneath of leaves, on fences and walls, in agricultural buildings and poultry houses. Use in biological control There are technical difficulties in controlling flies with Entomophthora muscae. The fungus is sensitive to temperature and when the air temperature is high, the prevalence of the disease decreases to very low levels. Houseflies infected with E. muscae were able to rid themselves of the infection by resting at temperatures that inhibited the growth of the fungus. Storage of the organism in a viable state is difficult and it cannot be easily cultured in the laboratory. Captive colonies need to be maintained through direct transmission from fly to fly. There is no commercially available supply of the pathogen.

Architecture  It is significant in that it is \\"an excellent example of an early 20th century modern hotel designed by one of the leading hotel designers of the day.\\" It was designed by William B. Post of George B. Post & Sons of New York City in 1921. History Ground was broken for the building in 1922 and the Hotel Syracuse opened for business on August 16, 1924. Among its first guests that day was child star Jackie Coogan. The hotel celebrated its official opening a month later, on September 18, 1924, with its first event, a dinner for stockholders in the Grand Ballroom.https://www.facebook.com/MarriottSyracuse/photos/a.743059339135736.1073741828.717548138353523/951372364971098/?type=3&theater; In 1927, Charles Lindbergh visited the hotel to talk about his historic trans- Atlantic flight from New York to Paris in the Spirit of St. Louis. Hotel Syracuse seen in a 1930s postcard In 1980 the hotel was renamed the Hilton at Syracuse Square. It was expanded with an extension containing the Imperial Ballroom and a new tower wing designed by William B. Tabler. The hotel left Hilton in the 1990s and returned to its original name. The massive 790-room Hotel Syracuse eventually found itself battling bankruptcy and closed in 2004. =Decade of closure= In December 2004, the city announced that a million- dollar payment by the chief creditor of the Hotel Syracuse would settle the unpaid property taxes dispute. This allowed the hotel to emerge from bankruptcy. In August 2005, the Israeli firm GMUL agreed to buy the Hotel Syracuse and its garage and renovate the property into a new four-star hotel and condos. More detailed plans became public in December 2005,Knauss, Tim (December 16, 2005). \\"Condos, ballrooms for Hotel Syracuse\\". The Post- Standard, p. A1. listing the following plans for the complex: 54 condominiums located in the 1980 tower, 155-room business hotel, 150 Apartments, Restoration of banquet facilities and street-level store-fronts, Rehabilitation of the complex's parking garage, Pool and gym In May 2006, the Hotel Syracuse was sold to another Israeli company, AMERIS Holdings Ltd, as part of a larger package deal, which included other assets acquired from GMUL. AMERIS Holdings Ltd, controlled by Levi Kushnir and his son Elad, has a large portfolio of development across the globe and specifically in the USA. The new owners reconfigured some of the previous plans. Rather than selling condominiums in the tower, the condo portion of the project was to be shifted into the historic building. When ownership changed in 2006, Ameris Holdings ltd. reopened the banquet facilities, which had been closed for several years. Shortly after, the garage was fully renovated (Opened September 1, 2007), and the complex hosted some large-scale events, including the Syracuse Film Festival in April 2007. In July 2007, work began on converting the 1980 tower to apartments. Then-mayor Matt Driscoll committed to turning Onondaga Street near the hotel complex into a park, in order to push the development along. Hotel Syracuse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Ameris went bankrupt later in 2008, however, and work on the apartment tower was halted when about eighty percent complete. The 1980 tower, renamed Symphony Tower, was eventually severed from the rest of the building and sold to the Hayner Hoyt Corporation for $1.4 million in 2012. As of 2014, that sale was still the focus of ongoing litigation, and the Symphony Tower remains vacant. =Restoration= On April 14, 2013, Boston-based Pyramid Hotel Group made an offer of an undisclosed amount to the City of Syracuse to renovate and reopen the Hotel Syracuse. The City of Syracuse began a seizure process against the hotel's Israeli owners, GML, for $500,000 in unpaid taxes. Ed Riley, senior vice president of project management for Pyramid Hotel Group, said that if the deal were to go through, the hotel would be reopened with 260-280 rooms. He estimated that a renovation would take 14–16 months, and cost over $60 million. Riley said the hotel's rooms are too small and badly outdated. They would need to be renovated and enlarged, with all-new bathrooms installed. He said the hotel's spacious lobby and its ballrooms need updating but are in relatively good shape and would be preserved. City officials have been pushing for a hotel to complement the 99,000 square foot Nicholas J. Pirro Convention Center. Hotel Syracuse is located a block and a half away; a revamped Hotel Syracuse could serve as a convention center hotel. In 2014 Ed Riley acquired the Hotel Syracuse. In 2015 he began a $57 million restoration project in which gave the hotel 261 new guest rooms and returned all the major historic spaces to their former grandeur. On June 25, 2015, while restoration work was continuing, the hotel was renamed Marriott Syracuse Downtown. During the renovations, the hotel's main entrance was shifted from 500 S. Warren St. to the other side of the building, 100 E. Onondaga St. The hotel reopened on August 19, 2016.http://www.syracuse.com/business- news/index.ssf/2016/08/hotel_syracuse_to_reopen_friday_as_marriott_syracuse_downtown.html See also * Downtown Syracuse ReferencesExternal links *Marriott Syracuse Downtown official website Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in New York (state) Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1924 Category:Buildings and structures in Syracuse, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Syracuse, New York Category:Marriott hotels ","title":"Marriott Syracuse Downtown"},{"id":"20945031","text":"The 460th Fighter-Interceptor Training Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit.

The film stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott. Bombardier was nominated for an Oscar in 1944 for the special effects used in the film. It was largely filmed at Kirtland Army Air Field, New Mexico, site of the first bombardier training school.Orrisss 1984, pp. 74–75. The film follows the training of six bombardier candidates, seen through the differences between the two USAAF pilots in charge of their training over the efficacy of precision bombing. Brigadier General Eugene L. Eubank, commander of the first heavy bombardment group of the U.S. Army Air Forces to see combat in World War II, introduces the film with the statement: > I want you to know about a new kind of American soldier, the most important > of all our fighting men today. He is most important because upon him, > finally, depends the success of any mission in which he participates. The > greatest bombing plane in the world, with its combat crew, takes him into > battle, through weather, through enemy opposition, just so he may have 30 > seconds over the target.

I > want you to know about him, and about those who had the faith and vision and > foresight to bring him into being, to fit him for his task, long months > before our war began. Plot In 1941, at a staff meeting in Washington, D.C., two officers of the U.S. Army Air Corps (and old friends) debate the importance of bombardiers. Major \\"Chick\\" Davis (Pat O'Brien) argues that a bombardier, using the top secret American bombsight will be the \\"spearhead of our striking force.\\" After a year of observing the Royal Air Force fight the German Luftwaffe, Capt. \\"Buck\\" Oliver (Randolph Scott) is not convinced a bomber can get \\"so close that a bomb can't miss\\" and that new pilots are the priority. Davis challenges Oliver to a \\"bombing duel\\" to test their respective points of view. Oliver, using a dive bomber, misses the stationary target with all his bombs, while Davis, bombing from 20,000 feet in a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, succeeds in hitting his target with his first bomb. Later, Oliver recommends that \\"Hughes Field\\", in \\"Almansor\\", New Mexico, the civilian flying school of a friend, be leased as a new Bombardier Training School. As the school's first class nears graduation, Major Davis arrives, with right-hand man, M/Sgt. Archie Dixon (Barton MacLane), to take command. Davis is discomfited by the presence of so many civilian women clerks, including the field's former owner, Burton \\"Burt\\" Hughes (Anne Shirley), the daughter of a respected Air Corps general and now a secretary under terms of the lease. Davis is brusque with Burt and she observes he could use some training in manners. Buck Oliver arrives with the next cadet class, that includes Tom Hughes (Eddie Albert), Burt's brother. Davis is mildly disturbed to learn that Oliver and Burt have a romantic history, and the two friendly rivals continue to butt heads over the importance of bombardiers. Oliver, who heads the group of pilots flying bombers for cadet training, refuses to take them seriously because they will become sergeants upon graduation, not commissioned officers. Davis attempts to make up with Burt, and solicits the War Department to commission the bombardiers. Preflight ground school is intensive and with practice bombing, reveals many shortcomings: Tom Hughes has trouble with fear-induced air sickness, Joe Connors (Robert Ryan) with commitment issues, and \\"Chito\\" Rafferty (Richard Martin) with the lack of women on the base. Cadet Pete Jordan is not up to the complexity of the training and soon washes out. Connors reveals to Davis that a spy wants to buy information from him about the secret bombsight, and helps Davis lure the spy into a trap where he is arrested. Cadet Paul Harris, brilliant in ground school and a hero for saving his bomber from destruction when a flare goes awry, is conscience stricken that his mother thinks he will be a murderer of innocent civilians. Davis reassures him with a patriotic pep talk. When a bomber develops mechanical problems and the crew is ordered to bail out, Tom Hughes panics in fear and refuses to jump. His friend (and another suitor of Burt Hughes), Cadet Jim Carter (Walter Reed), crash- lands the aircraft, claiming that he is the one who panicked, but Hughes confesses afterward. Facing an elimination board, he successfully persuades Davis and receives a second chance. On a subsequent flight, Buck Oliver passes out from anoxia, nearly tossing Carter out of the opened bomb bay without a parachute. Tom Hughes falls to his death saving Carter's life. Oliver is subjected to a board of investigation but exonerated because his actions resulted from the failure of his oxygen equipment. Guilt- stricken and unable to face Burt, Oliver transfers out of the school. Shortly after, America is drawn into the war by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Davis, promoted to colonel, becomes a B-17 group commander, and awkwardly proposes marriage to Burt who turns him down. The group (and new bombardiers Carter, Connors, Rafferty, and Harris) leaves for a secret island base in the Pacific, and Burt passionately kisses Jim Carter goodbye, revealing her choice. At the base, Buck Oliver, now a major, joins the group just as it is about to fly a night mission to bomb an aircraft factory in Nagoya, Japan. Oliver's assignment is bomb with incendiaries to set the target on fire a half hour before the arrival of the group, which Davis will lead at high altitude. Joe Connors is Oliver's bombardier and Sgt. Dixon his tailgunner. Flying low, Oliver's bomber is shot down before he can drop his bombs, and Connors remains at his post, sacrificing his life to destroy the bombsight, fulfilling an oath he took upon entry into Bombardier School. Oliver and the remainder of his crew, including Dixon, are captured. The stretchers used to carry the dead Americans are stamped \\"USA Earthquake Relief 1923\\". Their Japanese captors execute the other crew members to coerce Oliver and Dixon into revealing the location of their base, but Dixon overwhelms his guard and attempts to escape. He is machine gunned in the attempt, but the shots also set fire to a truck carrying barrels of gasoline. Oliver drives the burning truck throughout the factory, setting fire to its camouflage netting and fulfills his mission, knowing he will be killed by his own men. The B-17 group fights off Japanese fighters, is riddled by flak, but overcomes the reluctance of the bombardiers to bomb their compatriots and successfully destroys the target. Cast * Brig. Gen.

Yokun Ridge is long and contains a conservation planning area called the Stockbridge-Yokun Ridge Reserve designated in 1993 by the U.S. Forest Service under its Forest Legacy Program. The ridge is notable for outdoor recreation and scenic beauty, as well as its conserved land and proximity to the tourist destinations of Lenox and Stockbridge. Yokun Ridge is located within West Stockbridge, Stockbridge, Lenox, Richmond, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Approximately one-third of the ridge is protected as open space reserve, municipal watershed, and wildlife sanctuary.Yokun Ridge (2005). Berkshire Natural Resources Council. Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Geography Yokun Ridge includes, from south to north, West Stockbridge Mountain , Lenox Mountain , Yokun Seat , The Damp , and Mahanna Cobble . Subordinate peaks located off the main ridge crest include Baldhead (now wooded at its summit), Osceola Mountain , and The Cobble . Water bodies related to the ridge include Lake Averic, Fairfield Pond, the two Lenox Reservoirs, Shadowbrook Reservoir (also called Monks Pond locally), and Darey Pond, as well a number of small brooks, ponds, and wetlands. A waterfall is located in Stevens Glen on the west side of Lenox Mountain. The southwest side of the ridge drains into Cone Brook, thence into the Williams River, the Housatonic River, and Long Island Sound; the southeast side drains into Marsh Brook, Stockbridge Bowl, and Larrywaug Brook, thence into the Housatonic River; the northwest side drains into Richmond Pond and Southwest Branch Brook, thence the Housatonic River; and the northeast side drains into Yokun Brook, thence into the Housatonic River. The Massachusetts Turnpike is located at the south end of the ridge, near the foot of West Stockbridge Mountain, and the Bousquet Ski Area is located at the north end of the ridge. Nomenclature The name Yokun derives from Jehoiakim Yokun, a Native American of the Mahican tribe.Frazier, Patrick (1994).The Mohicans of Stockbridge University of Nebraska Press. As early as the 19th Century, Yokun's name was applied to \\"Yokun Seat,\\" a summit of Lenox Mountain. This term was accepted by the Board of Geographic Names in 1894. George Wislocki, first director of the Berkshire Natural Resources Council, invented the name \\"Yokun Ridge\\" 1971.Friends, family gather at Mahanna Cobble to thank Wislocki.

History In the 1740s, Jehoiakim Yokun and another Native American of the Mahican Tribe bought all the unsold land between Stockbridge and Pittsfield for 12 English pounds from two fellow tribesmen. The land was subsequently acquired by the English in the 1750s. The Dutch name \\"Jehoiakim\\" may indicate that Jehoiakim Yokun was baptized by the Dutch in the Hudson Valley, a region where most Mahicans resided at the time. Yokun subsequently was active in the French and Indian Wars while later his son, Timothy, participated in the American Revolution as a member of the Stockbridge Militia at the Siege of Boston and died in a battle in the vicinity of present-day Van Courtlandt Park in Bronx, N.Y. \\"Yokuntown\\" (a designation for the village of Lenox in the 18th Century) was named after Yokun. European settlers logged the area's forests for lumber and charcoal, the latter used as a source for nearby iron foundries, which helped supply ordnance in the American Civil War. During the late 19th Century's Gilded Age much of Yokun Ridge was held by a handful of large estates, including the Stokes property, whose 1894 \\"Shadowbrook Cottage\\" below Baldhead was at the time reputedly the largest residence in America. It later became the site of a Catholic seminary and was subsequently destroyed by fire . The seminary's replacement building is currently occupied by the health and yoga retreat Kripalu. A former Stokes outbuilding is part of the Shadow Brook Farm Historic District. The American author Nathaniel Hawthorne, who briefly lived near Yokun Ridge, describes a fictional walk to the top of Baldhead in his A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys (1852). In the same work, Hawthorne describes Shadow Brook, the local name for a minor stream that flows in the ravine separating Baldhead from the southern reach of Lenox Mountain.A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys 1852 Tourism helped to boost interest in recreation and conservation in the area as early as 1929, when the Lenox Garden Club established the Pleasant Valley Wildlife Sanctuary on Lenox Mountain, now owned by the Massachusetts Audubon Society. The Bousquet Ski Area opened in 1932 on the north side of the ridge at Mahanna Cobble.Laurie Puliafico, Clarence J. \\"Clare\\" Bousquet; The founding of Bousquet Ski Area The New York Philharmonic gave a series of summer concerts in 1934 at the Hanna Estate, located on the lower east side of West Stockbridge Mountain. Two years later, the Boston Symphony began its longstanding seasonal residency at nearby Tanglewood, the former Brooks Estate. Beginning in the 1970s, the Berkshire Natural Resources Council and others helped to further highlight the area's recreational and scenic potential, in part by offering the invented name \\"Yokun Ridge\\" to emphasize its then relatively unrecognized continuity. Conservation Portions of Yokun Ridge are owned by the non-profit Berkshire Natural Resources Council (BNRC), the Massachusetts Audubon Society (MAS), and the towns of Lenox, Stockbridge, and West Stockbridge. The ridge and certain outlying features were designated as part of a conservation planning area in 1993 by the U.S. Forest Service under its Forest Legacy Program. Called the \\"Stockbridge-Yokun Ridge Reserve,\\" it consists of 6,300 acres and is among at least five in Massachusetts authorized in 1993 by the program, which enables federal purchases of conservation easements. About in the Stockbridge-Yokun Ridge Reserve, or about 6 percent of the area, had been conserved using the Forest Legacy Program as of 2000. The northern boundary of the Stockbridge- Yokun Ridge Reserve conservation zone includes Mud Pond and its surrounding wetlands, and the outlying summit of South Mountain . Both are located in Pittsfield. In December 2010, the Berkshire Natural Resources Council closed on the purchase of 80 acres of land around Mahanna Cobble from the Bousquet Ski Area after two years of negotiation.\\"BNRC Closes Purchase of Mahanna Cobble\\" Recreation The BNRC maintains trails through its Olivia's Lookout property on West Stockbridge and Lenox Mountain; they also manage a roadside scenic vista along Lenox Road at the Stockbridge/ Lenox border, as well as Steven's Glen, a waterfall on Lenox Mountain Brook. The Massachusetts Audubon Society (MAS) maintains a network of hiking trails at their Pleasant Valley Wildlife Sanctuary in Lenox. Cooperative agreements with towns, private landholders, and MAS and BNRC have resulted in the marking of a ridgeline trail extending from the southern end of West Stockbridge Mountain to the Bousquet Ski Area. The trails are open to hiking, skiing, picnicking, and similar pursuits. Mountain biking is permitted in some areas.Pleasant Valley Wildlife Sanctuary. Massachusetts Audubon Society.

The conflagration killed at least 278 individuals, with some accounts reporting more than 300 dead. One hundred and three unidentified victims were interred in a common grave at Green-Wood Cemetery, marked by an obelisk, while more than two dozen identified victims were interred individually in separate sections at the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn.

Fatalities mainly arose in the family circle, the highest tier in the theatre offering the cheapest seats.

A third floor gallery, the family circle, extended to the south wall of the structure and seated 450. The family circle had its own entrance and ticket booth and customers for this seating did not usually commingle with patrons purchasing seating for the lower floors. Furthest from the stage and up against the theatre ceiling, the family circle offered the cheapest accommodations and had the most roundabout access to the street. The passageway started from the gallery, passed through a curtain partition, then descended southward down a short flight of stairs to a platform set against the south wall. It turned right (west) and descended another flight of stairs anchored to the south wall, ending at a second floor corridor. Patrons then made a right turn into this corridor and follow the passageway northward along the west wall to the family circle box office. The passage then turned left, westward again, descended a third flight of stairs down to a short, street- level hallway that led onto Washington Street (see Floor Plan 2). Access to the dress circle was more straightforward. Patrons entered and left the dress circle via a flight of stairs that descended south to a landing, then turned right onto a second flight that opened into the lobby. Patrons in the dress circle also had a second emergency exit along the alley side of the building, going down a flight of stairs to the middle exit onto Flood's Alley. The exit was generally locked to thwart gate crashers so the stairs were little used and not well known. Eight private boxes, four on each side of the stage and each accommodating six people, rounded out the seating, the box seats furnishing the most elegant and expensive accommodations in the house. At the time the theatre opened in 1871, seating in the family circle cost fifty cents and the dress circle cost a dollar. In the lower auditorium, parquet seating, inconveniently close to the stage, cost seventy five cents while the parquet circle cost a dollar fifty. The box seats cost ten dollars.\\"Opening Night Announcement\\" Brooklyn Eagle September 25, 1871 page 1 column 2  Stage and flies  As with many 19th-century theatres, the Brooklyn Theatre's stage was a presentation platform, a prop factory and a warehouse.Behind the Scenes of an Opera-house page 436, column2 At the back of the stage was the painter's bridge, a walkway which ran the width of the stage and which could be raised or lowered as required for painting backdrops, or drops.\\"Everything above the proscenium arch\\" Behind the Scenes of an Opera-house page 437, column2 These and borders, scenic elements painted on canvas and mounted on wooden frames, were installed in a rigging loft, known as a fly system, a large wooden open frame equipped with the pulleys and tackle needed to raise or lower scenic elements.\\"Working Drops and Borders from the First Fly Gallery\\" Behind the Scenes of an Opera-house page 446, column 1 It was suspended high in the fly space or flies, the volume above the stage never seen by the audience. For a large production with many scene changes, the rigging loft could be heavily loaded with painted canvas. On the night of the fire, it contained drops and borders for The Two Orphans and the scenery for Julius Caesar was stacked on the stage, awaiting pickup.'J. W. Thorpe' \\"The Inquest: How Three Hundred People Met Their Death\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 20, 1876 page 3 column 9 This had bearing on the fire's outset when stage manager Thorpe considered getting the hose but was hampered by scenery. The proscenium arch housed a drop curtain.'Under the Stage' \\"Brooklyn Theatre\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle September 6, 1876 page 2 column 8 The arch itself was not integral to the theatre but was constructed with a lightweight, plastered curtain wall made of wood.\\"The Inquest: Statement of Thomas B.

Each border lamp was in a wire cage intended to keep the canvas borders at least a foot () away from the gas lamps within. Personnel were forbidden to ignite gaslights with matches or smoke anywhere on the stage.'The Safeguards Against Fire' \\"Assistance for the Destitute\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 8, 1876 page 2 column 8  Fire  Progress of the fire: 1. A border catches fire from a gaslight border lamp. 2. Actors attempt to calm audience; they fail and panic erupts. 3. Though panic-struck, patrons evacuate the lower portions of the theatre successfully. 4. The balcony suffers from clogged stairwells (orange) filled with panicking, frenzied patrons, but police and firemen restore order in time. 5. Choking, deadly smoke hits the gallery before half the people can evacuate via a single stairway (red), which has also become jammed by too many people trying to exit at once. On Tuesday evening, December 5, 1876, about a thousand patrons were in attendance. Samuel Hastings, who collected tickets at the gallery entrance, estimated that there were about 400 people in the family circle.'The Gallery Doorkeeper' \\"\\"Assistance for the Destitute\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 8, 1876 page 2 column 4 One of the theatre owners, Col. Abner Keeny, said that about 360 people purchased tickets for the dress circle and about 250 people in the parquet and parquet circle.\\"Holding Capacity\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 8, 1876 page 2 column 8 Edward B. Dickinson, a patron in the middle of the parquet about five rows from the stage, thought the auditorium floor was not more than half full. Charles Vine, high in the family circle, thought it was \\"one of the biggest galleries\\" he had seen in a long time. The play proceeded without incident until 11 p.m., the intermission between the fourth and fifth act.'No Trouble or Expense was spared' \\"Special Report of the Fire Marshall\\" British House of Commons page 14 The drop curtain was down, hiding the stage, and the orchestra was playing. Some attendees in the parquet circle heard what sounded like a brawl behind the curtain, shouting and machinery working, noise carrying above the orchestra's playing.'What Official Investigation Shows' \\"Calamity\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4, column 1 Behind the curtain, actors were taking their positions in a box set of an old boathouse on the bank of the Seine. Made of painted canvas on a flimsy wooden frame, it blocked the backstage from view. Kate Claxton, playing Louise the blind orphan girl, along with actors J. B. Studley and H. S. Murdoch, had taken their places on stage and were waiting for the curtain to rise. Claxton was lying on a pallet of straw, looking up. Actors Mary Ann Farren and Claude Burroughs were waiting in the wings. = Detection of fire = Around 11:20 p.m.,'The Origin and Progress of the Flames' \\"The Calamity\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4 column 2 while preparations for the final act were under way, stage manager J. W. Thorpe saw a small flame on the left side of the stage.'The Stage Manager's Testimony' \\"The Calamity\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 5, 1876 page 4, column 5 The fire issued from the lower part of a drop hanging below the rigging loft near the center stage border-light. The canvas was partially detached from the frame and, Thorpe thought, possibly slipped past the wire mesh border lamp guard and ignited. He estimated its size to be no larger than his hand. Though water buckets were once kept on the stage and in the rigging loft'A. M. Palmer Sworn' \\"Inquest: Searching the Cause of Three Hundred Deaths\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 19, 1876 page 4 column 8 and though a two and a half inch () water pipe still serviced a fire hose backstage,'No Evidence That Any Water Was Used' \\"Special Report of the Fire Marshall\\" British House of Commons page 14 none of these facilities were readily available.'Mrs Conway always kept these Hose attached' \\"Special Report of the Fire Marshall\\" British House of Commons page 16 Thorpe considered the fire hose, but there was much scenery in the way. Deciding that the fire would be well under way by the time the hose was in place, he opted to extinguish the flame by immediately available means.'J. W. Thorpe' \\"The Inquest: How Three Hundred People Met Their Death\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 20, 1876 page 3 column 9 He directed carpenters Hamilton Weaver and William Van Sicken to extinguish the flame, which they attempted by beating the fire with long stage poles. Another carpenter who was backstage tried to fix the drop in one of the grooves but \\"could barely reach it with his hand and he drew it hastily up. The rapid motion through the air of the half ignited and highly inflammable canvas, caused it to burst into a flame, which rapidly spread\\". The curtains rose while backstage personnel hastened to bring the fire under control. After speaking a few lines, Kate Claxton was alerted by Lillian Cleaves, who was standing behind the box set. She whispered sotto voce through the canvas that there was fire on stage and urged them to leave. Claxton recalled peering up through the flimsy canvas and seeing \\"sparks falling and little tongues of the fire licking the edges of the drops and borders that hung in the flies.\\" In spite of this, the actors continued with their performance, apparently thinking that any unusual behavior would only induce panic.In his Special Report, Police Fire Marshal Patrick Keady lamented: \\"When the sparks fell on the stage, and the fire could be no longer concealed from the people, the usual result in such cases was produced, confusion and alarm. The audience stood up to leave, and there was certainly no time to lose. The actors, however, thought differently, and stepping to the foot-lights, advised the audience to be quiet and sit down, that there was no danger. Miss Claxton says she did so, Mr. J. B. Studley says he did so, and both agree that the lamented Mr. Murdoch did the same thing. The result was that many of the people sat down again. This was only for a minute, however, but it was long enough to cost many of those in the theatre that evening their lives. No doubt the advice was well meant, and was intended, probably, to allay excitement and prevent a panic. It did not do either ... I never could, and cannot now, see any excuse for advising an audience to delay or remain in a burning building.\\" \\"Special Report of the Fire Marshall\\" British House of Commons page 14 Mrs. Mary Ann Farren made her entrance and after delivering her first lines, softly whispered, \\"The fire is steadily gaining.\\" The actors remained in character for only a little while longer, the audience growing increasingly restive. In spite of their efforts, the stage hands could not snuff the fire out; instead they had inadvertently knocked burning material free, spreading fire to the rigging loft. Bits of flaming debris were beginning to fall, descending onto the box set and other properties spread around backstage. Dickinson, sitting in the center parquet, saw a thin wreath of smoke curling along the ceiling of the boxed-in scene. \\"Immediately afterward, one corner of the canvas ceiling was raised, and through the opening thus made I saw the flames, and saw men trying to rake the fire off the ceiling [of the box set] with long poles.\\"'Statement of Mr. Edward B. Dickinson' \\"The Calamity\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4, column 3 With smoldering debris falling onto the stage, the actors fell out of character. Many in the audience, already restive, rose from their seats and commenced to crowd the aisles. = Actors' attempt to extinguish the fire and quell panic = Kate Claxton, H. S. Murdoch, and J. B. Studley at first urged the audience to be seated and \\"to be calm, as calmness was self possession, and self possession security\\". Thomas Rocheford, head usher, went to the auditorium when he heard someone yell 'Fire!' He later testified: \\"Mr. Studley and Mr. Murdoch sung out to the people to keep their seats. I also stopped quite a number going out who were making a rush. Finally a good many of them cooled down and took their seats.\\"'Statement by the Head Usher' \\"Holocaust\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 6, 1876 page 2, column 8 From his vantage point in the family circle, Charles Vine thought that Claxton was \\"the nerviest woman I ever saw ... [She] came out with J. B. Studley, and said the fire would be out in a few moments. She was white as a sheet, but she stood up full of nerve.\\"'The Nerviest Woman I Ever Saw' \\"The Calamity\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4 column 8 The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported Claxton saying, \\"There is no danger; the flames are a part of the play.\\" The assertion was disingenuous – fire had no part in the story – and it would soon prove short-lived. \\"As she spoke,\\" the Eagle continued, \\"a burning piece of wood fell at her feet, and she uttered an involuntary exclamation of alarm. This broke the spell which had heretofore held the audience.\\"'Fire, Fire, The House is on Fire' \\"Calamity\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4 column 2 Panic erupted. Thought turned to quelling it. J. B. Studley in particular reasoned: \\"If I have the presence of mind to stand here between you and the fire, which is right behind me, you ought to have the presence of mind to go out quietly.\\"'Cry of Fire' \\"Holocaust\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4 column 1 Kate Claxton echoed J. B. Studley's line, and stage manager J. W. Thorpe appeared, also urging an orderly exit. But the audience was now thoroughly panicked and ignored those on the stage. Claxton later recalled, \\"We were now almost surrounded by flames; it was madness to delay longer. I took Mr. Murdoch by the arm and said 'Come, let us go.' He pulled away from me in a dazed sort of way and rushed into his dressing room, where the fire was even then raging ... To leap from the stage into the orchestra in the hope of getting out through the front of the house would only be to add one more to the frantic, struggling mass of human beings who were trampling each other to death like wild beasts.\\" Claxton remembered that a private passage led from the leading lady's dressing room, through the basement and to the box office. Through that she and fellow actress Maude Harrison bypassed much of the lobby crush. Murdoch and Claude Burroughs thought there was enough time to get their street clothes from their dressing rooms − it was December and their stage costumes were flimsy. They became trapped and did not escape.'The Death of Murdoch and Burroughs' \\"Calamity\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4, column 7 Some actors and stage hands left by the utility doors exiting onto Johnson Street,Thomas Rocheford, among others, witnessed a surge in the fire's intensity, for him after he closed the lobby's door, and a few arriving fire fighters saw the Johnson Street scenic door open. 'Fred J. Manning' \\"The Inquest: Investigating the Cause of the Death of Three Hundred\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle January 4, 1877 page 2 column 9 'Interview with Colonel Abner N. Keeny' \\"Assistance for the Destitute\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 7, 1876 page 2, column 7 but the fire on the stage soon became widespread, cutting those exits off. All the remaining exits were in the front of the house, the main entrance exiting onto Washington street or the special exit doors leading into Flood's Alley.  Theatre evacuation  While the actors were attempting to quell the panic, the head usher, Thomas Rocheford, went to the rear of the auditorium to open the Flood's Alley special exit door on the east end of the vestibule, opposite of the Washington Street entrances, one of the three special exit doors designed by architect Jackson. Since the doors were rarely used, he found the locking mechanism corroded; he was initially unable to open the doors. He found a small piece of metal in his pocket and with this was able to release the doors.'An Involuntary Exclamation of Alarm' \\"Calamity\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4 column 2 This action enabled the people on the floor of the auditorium to evacuate the building fairly quickly, but Rocheford's action came at a cost. The open doors furnished airflow for the fire on the stage, which immediately grew in intensity.'Saved a Great Many Lives' 'What Official Investigation Shows' \\"Calamity\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4, column 1 = Parquet = Despite the initial scenes of despair and panic that had issued from that quadrant, patrons in the lower parquet and parquet circle were able to escape in under three minutes, having access to Flood's Alley and Washington Street exits and having no flights of stairs to negotiate. The least crowded section of the theatre had the best evacuation routes.'Looked to their own salvation' \\"Calamity\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4 column 2 = Dress circle = Those in the second floor dress circle had to contend with stairs. The main flight led to the lobby and eventually the Washington Street exit; a second flight led to the Flood's Alley side door close to Johnson Street. Most favored the main flight because it was the way in which they had first entered the circle and were already familiar with it. The stairway was over wide, and, according to Jackson's estimates, should have emptied the dress circle in under three minutes. But as Brooklyn Police Fire Marshall Patrick Keady noted later in his Special Report, instead of the orderly procession that had originally informed Jackson's evacuation estimates, everyone attempted to sally the stairs at once. Anything but orderly, people jammed in the doorway and stumbled under the relentless press from people behind them. Their feet got caught in balustrades; they tripped and fell.  Dress circle crush  As they emerged from the dress circle stairs into the lobby, they encountered a stream of other patrons on their right rushing from the parquet and wheeling toward the Washington Street exit. After Thomas Rocheford had opened the Flood's Alley exit, they collided with an opposing stream working toward that door, which was situated beneath the flight of stairs descending from the dress circle. (See Floor Plan 2). The crush developing from these cross-currents soon brought the pace on the dress circle stairs to a halt, inducing a frenzied panic when people further up pressed downward, unaware of the jam below. Sergeant John Cain, arriving from the First Precinct station house next door, estimated that there were about 150 people jammed on the stairs when he arrived. He was joined by Van Sicken, who had been driven from the stage, and Mike Sweeny, the building janitor, and other first precinct officers.'Met Mrs Farren' \\"The Inquest: Continuation of the Testimony Before the Coroner's Jury\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 23, 1876 page 2 column 8 The men began untangling the people, struggling to reinstate forward motion and using billy clubs on those who attempted to rush or push.  Alternate exit attempt  Some people in the dress circle, familiar with the theatre, tried to avail themselves of the other exit leading into Flood's Alley, near the corner of Johnson Street. Patrons in the first rush down the stairs found the door locked; no usher was in sight.\\"Holocaust\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 6, 1876 page 2, column 9 In the brief time it took them to discover that the door was locked and return to the dress circle, the stage had become engulfed and they had no recourse but to attempt to work their way down the main dress circle stairs to the lobby, adding their numbers to the crush on those stairs. Fire Marshall Keady would later write that he never found evidence that the exit had been opened.'The Audience Should be Dismissed' \\"Special Report of the Fire Marshall\\" British House of Commons page 14 Brooklyn Theatre Floor Plan 2. Published in the New-York Tribune, December 7, 1876. Note: this plan is rotated counter-clockwise 90° with respect to the other floor plan; East on top, west on the bottom. The stairway to the family circle, the third floor gallery, ran eastward from Washington Street, bypassing the main lobby. It turned southward on the second floor, above the ceiling of the lobby and vestibule. It turned eastward again and ascended to the third floor. Its anchorage on the south wall can be seen in the photograph below. It is likely that a fatal crush developed on this stairway which was not noticed by firemen on the lower floor. = Family circle = Circumstances were only worse in the family circle. With around four hundred patrons seated there, it was served by a single, long stairway to street level. In the stairs leading off the gallery platform, there were two right-angled turns and two long passages. At , it was wider than most gallery passages of that era,'John P. Smith Testifies' \\"The Inquest: Inquiry into the Cause of Three Hundred Deaths (part 1)\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 14, 1876 page2 column 8 but with smoke accumulating under the ceiling and the family circle located in the highest reaches of the theatre, there was an urgency for everyone to leave. To complicate matters, gas pressure in the building was beginning to falter, dimming the stairway lamps.William Field, inspector of the Brooklyn Gaslight Company, suspected that when the fire reached the gas meters, the lead couplings melted, interrupting gas flow to the gallery stairs. 'About Turning Off The Gas' \\"Special Report of the Fire Marshall\\" British House of Commons page 17  Conditions  When fire entered the roof of the theatre, dry and superheated, it spread with extreme rapidity. In the family circle, Charles Vine thought that less than four minutes passed from the time he saw fire on the stage to the arrival of smoke. To Officer G. A. Wessman, working to clear the crush in the dress circle, the smoke appeared as \\"a kind of dark blue [with] a most peculiar smell; no human being could live in it for two minutes.\\" As it filled the upper reaches of the theatre, Wessman \\"heard cries and a thumping noise, as of persons falling or jumping.\\"'Testimony Taken By The Fire Marshall' \\"At the Ruins\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 8, 1876 page 2, column 7  Descending the gallery stairway  Charles Straub had a seat in the family circle close to the stairway; he was in the company of his friend Joseph Kreamer. He remembered, \\"we could hardly run down the stairs; we were crowded down.\\" Though at first he saw no smoke, by the time he had been carried down to the last flight, it had grown thicker. There he tripped and people fell on top of him. By then the last flight of stairs was dark and full of smoke. Straub struggled up and stumbled forward. He estimated that about twenty-five people had gotten out ahead of him. Wondrously, though he had been pushed down three flights of stairs and thought that hundreds had fallen on top of him, only about ten or twelve people came out onto the street after him. He waited around the Washington Street entrance for three-quarters of an hour, but he never saw his friend Kreamer emerge from the stairway, nor did he ever see him again.'The Rush from the Gallery Described by an Eye Witness' \\"At the Ruins\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle page 2 column 5  Jumping from the gallery  Charles Vine, who had been beguiled with Kate Claxton's nerve, was far away from those stairs. Claxton's assurances had induced him to wait in his seat for a few minutes, but the crowd growing on the stairs made him uneasy. The sight of men trampling women appalled him; the din was maddening. He thought everyone was going crazy. Above all, dense smoke was beginning to fill the gallery, reducing visibility and making breathing difficult. He saw that movement down the stairway had stalled, with people piling over one another. He considered jumping from one of the windows facing Flood's Alley, but it was a drop. He walked to the front of the gallery and decided to make his jump there. He fell to the dress circle below, severely cutting himself in the groin on the iron-backed chairs, but he retained consciousness and was able to run to the dress circle door.\\"The Brooklyn Disaster\\" 'Daily Alta California' December 9, 1876 page 1 column 6 There, he encountered another scene of bedlam, this one on the stairway from the dress circle, where people were struggling over those who had fallen on the stairs. Fortunately, Vine was now nearer the Washington Street entrance, where Cain and his fellow police officers were slowly reinstating some kind of rough order.'Thomas Rocheford' \\"How the Great Disaster Happened\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 28, 1876 page 3 column 7 He was able to gain the lobby and helped clear the crush around the stairs. He left the theatre, carrying a woman who had been trampled underneath and \\"who seemed as dead as a door nail\\". Fire Marshall Keady felt that Vine had been the last person to leave the family circle alive. When he had jumped, there were still many people frantically struggling to leave.'Charles Vine' \\"Special Report of the Fire Marshall\\" British House of Commons page 18 = First responders and final evacuation = Brooklyn Theatre from Johnson Street, looking south from the stage area toward the front of the house. On the south wall of the theatre ruins, above the man in the light grey cape, are diagonal markings. These trace the flight of stairs from the gallery down to the second floor corridor and which had once been attached to the south wall of the theatre. The stairs themselves collapsed in the fire. The uppermost opening into masonry on the extreme right, above the man with the top hat, marks where the gallery stairs continued down to street level. Between this opening and the south wall ran a short, north–south corridor. Inside the lobby, Sweeny, District Engineer Farley and his firemen, Cain, and the other police officers eventually cleared the dress circle stairs to work their way up to the doors, where there was the connecting doorway to the family gallery stairway. They tried going up to the family gallery but were stopped by thick smoke. They heard no traffic on the stairway, heard no human sounds. They called up but received no response. Farley ordered one last inspection of the dress circle, but saw no activity. Nor was there any signs of life in the parquet and orchestra, below, now burning fiercely. To Farley the building seemed evacuated, barring, perhaps, a few stragglers. Not wanting to subject himself or others to any further risk, he ordered his men to quit the building. Within minutes, cracks appeared on the exterior theatre walls facing Johnson street, where, within, the heart of the blaze raged. At 11:45 p.m., less than a half hour after J. W. Thorpe had spied a flame no larger than his hand, the Johnson Street end of the building collapsed and an intense rush of air was drawn in, feeding the flames. Anyone who could speak of events transpiring within the building had already left.'Comprehension of the Dangers' \\"Calamity\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4, column 2 = Waiting for the flames to die down = Thomas Nevins, Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Fire Department, arrived at the theatre around 11:26 p.m.; he decided immediately that the building was lost and his job was one of confinement. Dieter Hotel, on the corner of Washington and Johnson streets, was lower than the theatre, its broad flat roof was an inviting target for flaming debris. The First Police Precinct station house, south of the theatre, was an old brick building with dry wooden support beams. Ramshackle wooden frame buildings stretched down the block on Flood's Alley opposite the burning theatre. At that point, the prevailing wind was from the west, carrying smoke and cinders east, dropping firebrands onto these old structures. The Post Office, south of the police station house, was filled with paper mail. Nevins had called in the second and third alarms while on the way to the fire; when the additional equipment arrived, he deployed the engines around the block to keep adjoining buildings free of sparks and burning debris.'The Alarm' \\"Report of Chief Engineer Nevins\\" British House of Commons page 10 By midnight, the fire had peaked, drawing around 5,000 spectators.'The Awful Fight' \\"Calamity\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4 column 2 It burned uncontrolled until around 1:00 am, and, in the wee hours, the walls along Flood's Alley collapsed, filling the alley with debris. By 3:00 am it began burning out. Nevins considered the blaze now partially under control. Many survivors found a temporary haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she huddled in the station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. Sitting quietly in Captain Smith's office, she would suddenly mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, the thought that she had lost her purse and was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and she would ask them about H. S. Murdoch, the actor who had been on stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for outerwear. No one had seen him; she would beseech the person to go look for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.\\"The Calamity\\" Brooklyn Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4, column 5 Despite the large number of people inquiring after other people, the received wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge. When the morning papers went to press, none carried news of casualties. Shortly after 3:00 am, Chief Nevins attempted his first sally into the vestibule of the theatre; no one had been in there since District Chief Farley's departure more than three hours prior. His first attempts failed, but eventually he worked his way into the vestibule. Outside the doors leading into the lobby, he found the body of a woman, legs partially burned away, face and arms disfigured. She was sitting upright with her back against the south wall. Nevins decided that at that point there were likely many more bodies to be found. He kept the news confined to his senior District Engineers, not wishing to incur a stampede into the fragile theatre of people seeking loved ones.  Aftermath  Funeral procession for victims of the fire on Flatbush Avenue on December 9 Memorial in Green-Wood Cemetery The next foray into the building did not occur until the daylight hours. Chief Nevins had his District Engineers organize recovery parties. Except for a short segment of the vestibule, the building had mainly collapsed into the cellar and burned until the wood was consumed. What first appeared to be a great deal of rubbish in the cellar underneath the vestibule turned out to be largely human remains, a large mass of people which had fallen into twisted and distorted positions and then burned. These were mainly from the gallery and the stairway, which, in the original structure, had been above the vestibule ceiling against the south wall of the building. Removal of these remains occupied much of the next three days. It was slow work; the conditions of the bodies were such that they would fall apart with only the slightest movement, and many had been mangled and dismembered. An exact body count was never obtained, given the state of forensic science in that era. With many bodies partially dismembered and scattered about by the gallery's collapse, and with faces burned beyond recognition, it was difficult to determine how many people were in a given pile of limbs, heads and trunks. The bodies could only be moved slowly. The capacity of the city morgue was quickly reached so an unused market on Adams Street was pressed into service.'Old Brooklyn Market Turned into a Morgue' \\"Calamity\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle December 6, 1876 page 4 column 7 By Friday, December 8, Coroner Simms reported that 293 bodies had been taken from the theatre site. The number was by no means definitive. Later, his own Coroner's Report would cite 283 fatalities. Much later, the memorial stone erected in Green-Wood Cemetery, would reference 278 deaths. = Reports = Coroner's report  The King's County coroner, Henry C. Simms, convened a jury on the disaster which heard testimony through December and January 1877. When it was published at the end of January 1877, it was especially harsh on the theatrical managers, Sheridan Shook and A. M. Palmer. The jury held Shook and Palmer responsible for failing to take adequate precautions against fire, failing to train stage hands in either fire prevention or the management of incipient fires, failing to establish clear chains of command in the theatre's management, permitting the stage to become cluttered with properties and failing to maintain in good working order fire fighting equipment and emergency exits that had originally been installed. The jury found lesser fault with the design of the building, observing that the five-year-old structure had better exits than many other public buildings in the city. Fault was found with the stairways leading to the family circle and the auditorium, which lacked a firewall between the audience and the stage. In delivering the verdict, the jury reported that death occurred mainly through suffocation in the dense smoke that prevailed in the gallery, likely in the few minutes after Charles Vine dropped from the family circle to the balcony below.  Fire Marshall's report  Police Fire Marshall Patrick Keady interviewed sixty- two people directly connected with the fire in the week following the blaze and delivered his report on December 18, 1876. He had been forcibly struck by the lack of use of water in any form of conveyance, though a two and a half inch () pipe serviced the hydrant near the stage. He was also forcibly struck by a certain laxness in the management of theatre by Shook and Palmer, especially in comparison to Sara Conway's management prior to her death. Many witnesses reported that Conway had insisted on filled water buckets to be positioned in various places back stage or in the rigging loft and kept the fire hose maintained. In contrast, Mike Sweeny could recall using the hose only once, and was not certain of its condition on the day of the fire; many of his colleagues thought the hose leaked and was up in the painter's gallery in the roof above the stage. = Later responses = While the immediate root cause of the conflagration found by Brooklyn police and fire authorities was negligence on behalf of the theatre lessees, Shook and Palmer, as time went on, theatre production practices that were regarded as acceptable risks in the 1870s were examined critically as the 20th century approached. Soon after the fire, New York Mirror began a campaign to eliminate or regulate many common theatre practices. Its agitation eventually spurred 1880s New York City fire code revisions barring the use of the stage in producing props and scenic elements, barring paints, wood, and construction material from the stage area, and widening theatre exits. Commenting on theatre fires in his December 1905 address to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Society President John R. Freeman found significant antecedents in the Brooklyn Theatre fire to the then-recent Iroquois Theatre fire, the 1881 Vienna Ringtheater fire and the 1887 Exeter Theatre Fire: stages crowded with scenery, an onrush of air from opening doors or windows, scant smoke vents over the stage, this giving rise to an outburst of smoke from under the proscenium arch with concomitant deadly effects upon upper gallery occupants. These observations, made twenty- nine years after the fact, resonate with those made on the night of the Brooklyn Theatre fire. Engineer Fred J. Manning, Engine Number 5, arriving at 11:22 p.m., testified that the scene doors were about two-thirds open, with \\"one or two men attempting to bring something out of these doors.\\" Abner C. Keeny, part owner and contractor of the building, commenting on the fire the following morning, believed that the sudden inrush of air from the scenic entrance fanned the fire and triggered its spread from the stage to the theatre at large, leading to the rapid advance of smoke onto the family circle. Sanborn Insurance maps of Brooklyn (Volume 2, Plate 40). By 1887, the original theatre had been razed and a second theatre rose in its place, occupying the same 'L' shaped lot once held by the original building. The interior arrangement of this 'new' Brooklyn Theatre was wholly unlike the original structure, however: the stage and main entrances swapped positions, as did the stage and lobby. The block was still organized very much like it had been in late 1875, but would soon change in June 1890 when the second theatre and the old Clarendon Hotel were razed to make way for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. By the early 20th century, cumulative New York City building code changes and additions required a solid brick proscenium wall, extending from the cellar to the roof, to minimize the risk of a stage fire spreading into the auditorium. Any openings in the wall, such as the large opening made by the proscenium arch itself, required special fire blocking facilities. Proscenium arches were equipped with non-flammable fire curtains; other openings in the proscenium wall required self-closing fire-resistant doors. Heat activated sprinkling systems were required for the fly space above the stage. At this time in New York City, uniformed fire department officers became permanent attendees of every theatrical production. These 'Theatre Detail Officers' were required to be in the theatre a half-hour before the performance, test the fire alarms, inspect fire wall doors and the fire curtain, and, during performances, ensure that aisles, passageways and fire exits remain clear and accessible. In the days following city officials were met with many families seeking news on loved ones and temporary financial support. The overwhelming demand of financial support caused undue stress on public finances due to disorganization. Due to many dishonest, \\"affected families\\" the mayor cut off public funds for the fire victims he called instead for a private organization to vet and systemize welfare for the victims affected by the disaster. Private relief funds were not uncommon at the time. After the Brooklyn Theatre Fire, the Brooklyn Theatre Fire Relief Association was formed to simplify efforts to support the families of the fire's victims. The relief efforts promptly raised $40,000 for the fire victims. Of the almost 300 fire victims, 188 families received aid from the BTFRA. Most families that were not helped either did not ask or had other means of support. The privatization of disaster relief was part of a greater effort to enhance urban welfare. The fear of some in the public was that relief funds would be used to buy votes instead of helping the poor. The Brooklyn Theatre Fire Relief Association's success led to the elimination of outdoor relief from the Brooklyn county budget in 1878. The BTFRA was dissolved in 1879 however, the association had a lasting impact on welfare and disaster relief in America . By 1900, outdoor relief was halted in most major urban areas in the United States. Kate Claxton wrote about the fire nine years later: Kate Claxton's career drastically changed and was closely associated with this incident. It became a pop culture phenomenon to associate any major fire that occurred with her. She disliked this attention, but it did boost her popularity as people were drawn to potential drama (\\"Kate Claxton, Fire Jinx\\"). Haverly's Theatre was erected on the same site in 1879, but it was razed 11 years later to make way for new offices of The Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Mid-20th century urban renewal subsumed Washington Street, Flood's Alley, and the site of the fire, giving rise to Cadman Plaza. Cadman Plaza East follows the old Washington Street course but now terminates at Johnson Street. The New York Supreme Court Building is nearest to the site, now occupied by a park on the west side of the courthouse.

MT-TE is a small 69 nucleotide RNA (human mitochondrial map position 14674-14742) that transfers the amino acid glutamic acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosome site of protein synthesis during translation.  Structure  The MT- TE gene is located on the p arm of the mitochondrial DNA at position 12 and it spans 68 base pairs. The structure of a tRNA molecule is a distinctive folded structure which contains three hairpin loops and resembles a three-leafed clover.  Function  The MT-TE gene encodes for a transfer RNA (tRNA), which are chemical cousins of DNA responsible for assembling amino acids into functioning proteins. MT-TE codes for a specific tRNA called tRNAGlu. tRNAGlu is responsible for attaching to glutamic acid (Glu) and inserting it into the specific locations of the growing peptide during protein assembly. The tRNAGlu molecule is localized to the mitochondria, and is involved in the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation proteins. Clinical significance Mutations in MT- TE can result in mitochondrial deficiencies and associated disorders. =Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness= A mutation in the MT-TE gene has been found in a small number of people with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD). People with this condition have diabetes and sometimes hearing loss, particularly of high tones. Affected individuals may also have muscle weakness (myopathy) and problems with their eyes, heart, or kidneys. This mutation likely impairs the ability of mitochondria to help trigger insulin release. In affected individuals, diabetes results when the beta cells do not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar effectively. Researchers have not determined how such mutations lead to hearing loss or the other features of MIDD. The mutation involved in this condition replaces the DNA building block (nucleotide) thymine with the nucleotide cytosine at position 14709 (written as T14709C). A family with a mutation of 14709T>C in the MT-TE gene showed phenotypes of congenital myopathy, mental retardation, cerebellar ataxia, and diabetes mellitus. Another patient with the same mutation was found to have Diabetes mellitus type 1 with severe myopathy, a high frequency deafness (hearing impairment) which suggested maternal inheritance. =Infantile transient mitochondrial myopathy= Infantile transient mitochondrial myopathy, also known as benign COX deficiency myopathy, is a rare disease which occurs within the infantile stages of life. The myopathy is characterized by clinical manifestations such as severe muscle weakness, hypotonia (poor muscle tone), and lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the body). Affected infants often require support from a machine for breathing and have difficulties feeding. However, the signs and symptoms have been shown to improve after several months, and most affected individuals show no symptoms of the condition by age 2 or 3. The mutations involved in infantile transient mitochondrial myopathy change single nucleotides in mitochondrial DNA. These mutations impair oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, muscle cells cannot produce enough energy, leading to the muscle problems that affect infants with infantile transient mitochondrial myopathy. It is unknown why only muscles are involved or how affected infants recover from the condition. Specific mutations of 14674T>G and 14674T>C have been observed in patients with the myopathy. = Complex IV deficiency = MT-TE mutations have been associated with complex IV deficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, also known as the cytochrome c oxidase deficiency.

The signs and symptoms of this disorder most often appear in childhood following a period of normal development, although they can begin at any age. Early symptoms may include muscle weakness and pain, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite, vomiting, and seizures. Most affected individuals experience stroke- like episodes beginning before age 40. These episodes often involve temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), altered consciousness, vision abnormalities, seizures, and severe headaches resembling migraines. Repeated stroke-like episodes can progressively damage the brain, leading to vision loss, problems with movement, and a loss of intellectual function (dementia).

Common symptoms include, myoclonus, myopathy, spasticity, epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, dementia, ataxia, atrophy and more. A majority of mutations in the MT-TK gene found to cause the disease were single nucleotide substitutions, such as 8344A>G.

Early actions included a blockade of a shipment of electronic waste from Australia and a campaign highlighting the dangers of PVC in children's toys.http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/about/achievements/ Before offices were formally opened in Guangzhou and Beijing in 2002, activists from the Hong Kong office ran several campaigns on the Chinese Mainland. These included investigations into electronic waste dumping in Guangdong province and a campaign to stop US-headquartered biotechnology firm Monsanto Company from patenting a Chinese indigenous soy bean variety.http://www.biotech-info.net/genetic_research.html Early mainland-based campaigns focused on food and agriculture and electronic waste. Since then Greenpeace East Asia has broadened its mandate into efforts to urge China's wood products industry to import environmentally sound timber, clean up its polluted rivers and lakes, and highlight the urgency of stopping climate change. Campaigns Greenpeace East Asia runs five main campaigns: climate and energy, food and agriculture, toxics (water pollution), forests and a campaign on air pollution. The organisation uses non-violent direct action to draw attention to what it considers significant threats to the environment and also lobbies for solutions. It emphasizes that while \\"surging economic development in East Asia has brought widespread prosperity, [it] has also taken a severe environmental toll, both regionally and worldwide.\\" The website also lists several achievements including: * In 1998, following a Greenpeace campaign, Hong Kong banned the import and re-export of hazardous waste. * In 2006, Greenpeace East Asia was the only NGO to be consulted on an early draft of a renewable energy law by China's National People's Congress. * Two Greenpeace expeditions to China's Himalayan region in 2006 and 2007 produced evidence of dramatic glacial retreat. * On July 6, 2010 Greenpeace China took action against Asia Pulp & Paper and French supermarket chain Auchan, which carries APP paper products such as Breeze (清风 Qingfeng) tissue paper. Activists, dressed as the Sumatran tiger buried themselves under packages of Breeze toilet paper rolls while forest campaigner Ma Lichao spoke to the media about the issues.http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/news/stories/forests/2010/a-world- without-tigers/ Although critical of its forestry practices in the past, Greenpeace is now working with APP to monitor its sustainability strategy including the implementation of its Forest Conservation Policy. Currently one of Greenpeace East Asia's key campaigns is to encourage China to reduce its reliance on coal as a power source and to speed up the development of the renewable energy sector instead.http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/news/stories/climate- energy/2008/coal-crisis/ Apart from specific campaigns, they also work with local organisations from time to time for general advocacy, including with the Geography Society of PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College between 2008 and 2009.

The mall was located on 51st Avenue and Indian School Road. It was sold in the late-1990s to the Cartwright Elementary School District. HistoryDevelopment= Maryvale Shopping City was designed by Victor Gruen and developed by home builder John F. Long, who also planned and developed Maryvale, which he named after his wife. The mall, which was built on a lot adjacent to an earlier retail development by Long that opened in 1956, was developed a way to give Maryvale residents a convenient place to shop. At the time, Maryvale was located west of the Phoenix city limits, and residents faced about a 20-minute drive to stores in Downtown Phoenix. The shopping center was developed with 19 stores, of retail space and 1,100 parking spaces, which included two supermarkets and a Bowling alley. Plans for the shopping center's development were announced on July 26, 1958. At the time of the announcement, two stores, S. S. Kresge (now KMart) and Piggly Wiggly, were announced as tenants. The shopping center's grand opening was a star-studded affair, as it was attended by Jim Backus, Jill St. John, and George Raft. In 1974, the bowling alley was converted to a department store, in a project that carried a multi-million dollar price tag. =Conversion to indoor mall= In the late 1970s, Maryvale Shopping City was enclosed, expanded and given the new name Maryvale Mall, with a new wing of the mall anchored by Mervyn's. The mall began to decline when Desert Sky Mall (originally named Westridge Mall) opened in 1981. Eventually, discount retailer Target moved into a mall that was once anchored by upscale department stores. The mall was almost vacant by the mid 1990s, but the structure was noted to still be in good condition. =Redevelopment= In the 1990s, Long offered the mall property to Cartwright Elementary School District for $7.3M, with a stipulation that the external structure be preserved. The school district opened an elementary school and a middle school on the property between 2000 and 2001. A former skating rink at the mall was converted to the district's first gymnasium, while a former movie theater became an auditorium. The parking lots were converted into athletic fields.

The prevalence of myoclonus dystonia has not been reported, however, this disorder falls under the umbrella of movement disorders which affect thousands worldwide. Myoclonus dystonia results from mutations in the SGCE gene coding for an integral membrane protein found in both neurons and muscle fibers. Those suffering from this disease exhibit symptoms of rapid, jerky movements of the upper limbs (myoclonus), as well as distortion of the body's orientation due to simultaneous activation of agonist and antagonist muscles (dystonia). Myoclonus dystonia is caused by loss-of-function-mutations in the epsilon sarcoglycan gene (SGCE). The disease is dominantly inherited, however SGCE is an imprinted gene, so only the paternal allele is expressed. Therefore, children suffering from this disease inherit the mutation from the father. If the mutated allele is inherited from the mother, the child is not likely to exhibit symptoms. While no cure has been found for myoclonus dystonia, treatment options are available to those suffering from the disease. Ethanol often ameliorates the symptoms well, and so the syndrome is also called \\"Alcohol-responsive dystonia\\". Alcohol may be substituted by benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, which work through the same mechanism. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is another viable option that can alleviate symptoms without the unwanted side effects of medications, and has been successful in treating other movement disorders.  Signs and symptoms  Myoclonus dystonia is characterized by two primary features: myoclonus and dystonia. For the majority of individuals with myoclonus dystonia, the myoclonus component of the disorder is often the primary and most disabling feature in comparison to the dystonia component. The symptoms of myoclonus dystonia vary substantially in severity. = Myoclonus = Myoclonus is characterized by rapid contractions that affect the upper body including the neck, torso and arms, but may also affect the legs. These movements are stimulated by various factors including stress, noise, caffeine, and physical stimuli. Myoclonus can be characterized in multiple ways including neurological basis, muscular activity, and by stimuli. Myoclonus can be positive or negative; positive myoclonus results from brief spurts of muscle activity and negative myoclonus occurs when there is a lack of any muscular activity. Myoclonus is usually classified physiologically to optimize treatment. Myoclonus is a precursor effect to myoclonus dystonia and most commonly begins in childhood or adolescence. Myoclonus is classified as cortical, subcortical, peripheral or spinal. Cortical myoclonus is the most common of these four and affects the upper limbs and face. Myoclonus dystonia has been characterized under subcortical origin, specifically under nonsegmented myoclonus or brainstem myoclonus. Symptoms within this classification include the startle response and reticular reflex myoclonus. Sudden stimuli like noise or touch to areas around the head or chest cause the startle response which will go up the brain stem and down the spinal cord causing jerk-like movements. Hyperekplexia is a heightened brainstem response where an affected person will continue to elicit the same response to a repeated stimuli. In contrast, reticular reflex myoclonus occurs spontaneously to stimuli applied to distal limbs. Spinal myoclonus is caused by defects in spinal organization or connections, and peripheral myoclonus has symptoms of rhythmic jerks due to a neuron-the most common being the hemifacial spasm. = Dystonia = Dystonia is a response to simultaneous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles seen as twisting and contorting that affect posture and stance. Other symptoms can include tremors and muscle spasms due to various interactions of muscle, contractions and movement. Dystonia can be either primary or secondary with the latter being more common. Primary dystonia or \\"pure\\" dystonia is only physiological in origin. Secondary dystonia has multiple origins that are physiological, pathological or neurological. = Myoclonus dystonia = Myoclonus dystonia includes the rapid contractions of myoclonus alongside the abnormal postures classified under dystonia, as well as neurological and psychiatric issues. This disease typically begins during childhood with symptoms of myoclonus and slight dystonia, most commonly cervical dystonia or writer's cramp. Dystonia symptoms tend to not get exaggerated over the course of the disease and is rarely the only associated symptom, while the myoclonus symptoms can become more severe. Psychiatric issues are clinically diagnosed with the aforementioned symptoms and include depression, anxiety, personality disorders and addiction. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is associated with myoclonus dystonia as both have been found to have a commonality on chromosome 7 in various studies. Neurological symptoms are relatively common in those with myoclonus dystonia. Any neurological abnormalities will not normally be present in those affected at a young age. Neurological testing has been performed to determine the origins of these symptoms and multiple parts of the brain have been pinpointed including the brainstem, neocortex, pallidum, and thalamus. These cause various effects in those diagnosed with myoclonus dystonia including changes in posture and tremors, and very rarely dementia and ataxia.  Cause  The majority of myoclonus dystonia cases are the result of a mutation in the epsilon sarcoglycan gene (SGCE). This gene is found on chromosome 7, with its specific cytogenic location being 7q21.3. The 70,985 bp SGCE gene encodes the protein epsilon (ε)-sarcoglycan. The five proteins that make up the sarcoglycan family function as integral membrane proteins that anchor the cytoskeleton of cells to the extracellular matrix. Epsilon sarcoglycan is a membrane protein that can be found in the liver, lungs, kidney, and spleen, but is most prevalent in muscle and neuronal cells. Its prevalence in both muscle fibers and the synapses of neurons suggest why symptoms of both myoclonus and dystonia appear from the improperly functioning protein. Recessive mutations in the other sarcoglycans also result in muscular disorders, further supporting that mutations in the SGCE gene cause myoclonus dystonia. Epsilon sarcoglycan itself is part of the dystrophin-associated protein (DAP) complex that binds the sarcolemma of muscle cells to the extracellular connective tissue. The purpose is to reduce the mechanical force on the sarcolemma as a result of muscle contraction. In addition to myoclonus dystonia, problems associated with a dysfunctional DAP complex include Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Upwards of 65 mutations of the SGCE gene are thought to cause myoclonus dystonia. The majority of the mutations lead to a truncated protein product that results in the loss-of-function of the epsilon sarcoglycan protein. The dysfunctional protein is ultimately recycled by the cell by degradation mediated by the proteasome, resulting in significant shortages of the integral membrane protein in both neurons and muscle fibers. The mutant allele is inherited in a dominant fashion—that is the mutation can be inherited if one parent has that allele. However, genomic imprinting occurs on the mother's allele, so only the father's allele is expressed. Therefore, inheriting a mutated, paternal allele of the SGCE gene will result in the expression of the dysfunctional epsilon sarcoglycan protein. Offspring will not produce a mutant protein product in 95% of cases where the mother passes on a mutation in the SGCE gene. While SGCE gene mutations are the central cause of myoclonus dystonia, there have been separate cases where individuals and families present symptoms akin to myoclonus dystonia but lack the mutations at this locus. Base-pair deletions of the DYT1 gene, missense mutations in the DRD2 gene, maternal uniparental disomy, and chromosome 18 linkage have all been associated in rare cases myoclonus dystonia where the SGCE gene is unaffected.  Treatment  To date, there is no single, universal treatment that has been found to cure myoclonus dystonia. However, there are several treatment methods that have been found to be effective for helping to reduce the symptoms associated with the syndrome. = Medications = Many drugs used to treat myoclonus dystonia do not have a significant impact individually, but when combined, can work on different brain mechanisms to best alleviate symptoms. The method of treatment used depends on the severity of the symptoms presented in the individual, and whether the underlying cause of the syndrome is known.  Benzodiazepines  Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam improve tremors caused by the myoclonus aspect of this syndrome by binding allosterically to GABAA ionotropic receptors, causing an influx of chloride ions that produce an inhibitory effect that can calm myoclonic jerks.  Antiepileptics  Antiepileptics like valproate must act upon GABA receptors and manipulate ionic conductance to reduce tremors and spasms in myoclonus dystonia. GABA neurons that fire rapidly and affect the motor cortex are blocked by antiepileptics in addition to changes in sodium and calcium concentrations that can excite the neuron. Different antiepileptics vary in sufficiency to control ionic conductance and can also produce seizures or myoclonus symptoms in some patients. Another agent that has been used is zonisamide.Salamon A, Zádori D, Horváth E, Vécsei L, Klivényi P (2019) Zonisamide treatment in myoclonus-dystonia. Orv Hetil 160(34):1353-1357  Anticholinergics  Anticholinergics like benzatropine alleviate dystonia symptoms by blocking the activity of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is involved in the pathophysiology of dystonia within the basal ganglia, although its exact role has not been determined. Acetylcholine is involved with dopamine and glutamate pathways in the basal ganglia, in addition to presynaptic muscarinic receptors which are involved in motor control. Acetylcholine is usually overactive in dystonia patients and blocking of this neurotransmitter would reduce contortion of the upper body, but can produce side effects of drowsiness, confusion and memory issues in adults.  Botulinum toxin  Botulinum toxin injections also act upon acetylcholine to reduce dystonia symptoms. The neurotoxin is active in presynaptic terminals and blocks exocytosis of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft which reduces muscle activity. Botulinum may also have a role in inhibiting glutamate and changing muscle movement. Studies have also shown possible axon transport of this neurotoxin as well as its function as a pain reliever without effect on overactive muscle movement in myoclonus dystonia patients. = Alcohol = Consumption of alcohol has also been found to be an effective agent for temporarily easing the severity of the tremors associated with myoclonus dystonia. Alcohol causes an increase in GABA transmission between interneurons and Purkinje cells. This then reduces the transmission of glutamate at granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses, which decreases muscle movements. This treatment only alleviates the strength of the tremors for a short duration and does not change how often tremors will occur. Doctors inform patients of risks associated with the use of alcohol for myoclonus dystonia due to the high susceptibility for alcohol abuse and dependency. Alcoholism itself causes tremors in the hands and degeneration of the Purkinje cells and other parts of the cerebral cortex, counteracting alcohol's original corrective effects. = Deep brain stimulation = thumbDiagram of Deep Brain Stimulation on a patient. This is a common treatment option for movement disorders that has shown to be successful in alleviating symptoms. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been found to be an effective and safe treatment for myoclonus dystonia patients, whose severe and debilitating symptoms are resistant to drug treatments. Electrical stimulation within the brain is a common treatment for many movement disorders because of the ability to excite or inhibit neurons within the brain. Deep brain stimulation patients have electrodes inserted into the brain and then an electrical signal is sent from an external source to elicit a response. The frequency and intensity of this signal can be changed to monitor the effects on neuronal activity using voltage recordings or neuroimaging, like functional MRIs. By re-positioning the electrodes in different areas or changing the size or timing of the stimulus, varying effects can be seen on the patient depending on the origin of the disorder. In one study, five patients with genetically determined epsilon sarcoglycan protein deficiency underwent deep brain stimulation of the internal pallidum. Each patient's movement and disability symptoms were assessed before and after treatment using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale. Upon completion of the surgery, both the myoclonus and dystonia symptoms of the disorder had decreased by 70%, with no report of unfavorable side effects. Therefore, deep brain stimulation has been shown to effectively improve both myoclonus and dystonia, unlike many drug treatments which may improve one or the other. Other studies examined the effects of DBS to both the ventrointermediate nucleus of the thalamus, Vim, and the globus pallidus interna, GPi. Following deep brain stimulation of GPi and Vim, the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale disability score improved 61-66%. In addition, the Dystomia Rating Scale score improved by 45-48%. While there was no significant difference in improvement between GPi-Vim stimulation and GPi stimulation, GPi-Vim stimulation was significantly more effective than Vim deep brain stimulation alone. Overall, Deep brain stimulation shows promise as a viable treatment for myoclonus dystonia. Although myoclonus and dystonia are present in myoclonus dystonia patients, optimum treatment for myoclonus dystonia differs from the treatment for myoclonus or dystonia alone. Myoclonus improved significantly more than dystonia when Deep brain stimulation was applied. In addition, myoclonus improved regardless of whether Deep brain stimulation was applied to GPi or Vim. However, GPi stimulation was more effective at reducing the symptoms of dystonia than Vim stimulation.

Plot summary According to the adventure background provided, drow priestesses are no longer receiving spells or guidance from their goddess, Lolth. While in most places the drow have remained steadfast, the Underdark city of Maerimydra is in a state of unrest and has been invaded by a host of enemy creatures. Some of the desperate survivors have begun making raids on the surface world. The adventure outline provided states that the player characters will be investigating these raids, travelling through the Underdark and exploring the ruined city, fighting the creatures that have taken it over, ultimately fighting a priestess of the rival drow goddess Kiaransalee. City of the Spider Queen begins with an introduction on pages 3–9. Following the introduction is the four-chapter adventure scenario: Part 1: Spinning the Web, is on pages 10–44, Part 2: The Deep Wastes, is on pages 45–63, Part 3: Maerimydra, is on pages 64–101, and Part 4: The Undying Temple, is on pages 102-114. The book also features two appendices. Appendix 1: Monsters and Magic, on pages 115-130, features the statistics for several monsters used in the adventure, and also presents a number of spells and magic items. Appendix 2: Creature Statistics, on pages 131-160, contains a summary of the statistics for all the NPCs and monsters that appear throughout the adventure. Included in the back of the book are 16 one-page maps of various locations that the characters may explore as part of the adventure. Publication history The book was published in 2002, and was written by James Wyatt, with cover art by Todd Lockwood and interior art by Scott Fischer, Rebecca Guay, Vince Locke, Raven Mimura, Puddnhead, Christopher Shy, Ben Templesmith, and Sam Wood. Rich Baker commented on how the adventure was developed: \\"James [Wyatt] and I were present in the original planning sessions with Bob Salvatore, Richard Byers, Thomas Reid, and Phil Athans as the whole War of the Spider Queen plan was hammered out, so the game guys and book guys were able to put together a common plot that everyone was happy with. That said, we hit an early snag when we realized that the adventure's original setting would give away the plot of the second book in the War of the Spider Queen series, but James came up with an alternate location for the adventure that worked even better than the original site.\\" Reception The adventure was ranked the 24th greatest adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine for the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game in 2004. Dungeon Master for Dummies lists City of the Spider Queen as one of the ten best 3rd edition adventures. James Voelpel from mania.com commented: \\"City of the Spider Queen is an excellent addition to anyone's Forgotten Realms campaign or with modifications, any Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition game.\\" City of the Spider Queen won the 2002 Origins Award for Best Role-Playing Adventure.

An adult or older child actually leads the horse in-hand, while the child that is judged sits on the horse and usually holds the reins, but only for the sake of appearance, as the actual control of the animal rests with the handler on the ground. Rules vary tremendously from one geographical region to the next, but as a rule the horse is shown at a walk and a trot, and the riding child is judged on their equitation, limited to proper seat, leg and hand position, to a lesser extent on poise. The child is usually not asked to actually control the animal, though in some locations a judge may award extra points if the child initiates certain commands to the horse and even more points if the horse actually responds. In many areas, judge may also ask the children simple questions about themselves or their horse, primarily to gauge the child's poise and manners more than equine knowledge. Occasionally, other elements, such as games or other group exercises may be added. Attire is generally the same as for equivalent equitation classes, though in some locations, children may also exhibit in costumes. In most cases, the handler is not judged, though some exhibitors nonetheless turn out with matching clothing for handler and rider. Equestrian helmets are usually encouraged, and sometimes mandated. Award policies also vary widely. As a general rule, an attempt is made to provide every participant some sort of award. At some shows, there is no actual evaluation of the riders and all children are given identical awards for participation, often blue (first place) ribbons. At others, a first place award will be given, with all other participants given smaller but equivalent awards. Yet others rank the top five to eight places but also provide participation awards, or ribbons identical to the lowest placing, to all entrants so no child leaves without an award. A few shows maintain the practice of providing awards in the same manner as regular horse show classes, even if this means some children do not receive any type of award. In lieu of a trophy, some shows award stuffed animals or other age-appropriate items.

It currently operates in both air defence and ground attack role with F-7 Skybolts from SLAF Katunayake. History SLAF F-7 fighter jets perform at the 70rth Independence day. Established in 1959 when the Royal Ceylon Air Force acquired BAC Jet Provost from the UK to introduce jet aircraft to its fleet, hence it was known as the Jet Squadron. Based at RCyAF China Bay just after its transfer from the RAF in 1956, its primary role was to train pilots for jet fighters that were planned. However no jet fighters were acquired by the RCyAF and the Jet Provosts were put into storage by 1970. The Squadron was reactivated and the Jet Provosts were taken out of storage and in to operational use when the 1971 Insurrection began in 1971. The Squadron moved to the civil Ratmalana Airport for the remainder of the insurgency, receiving six Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17F fighter-bombs and a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15UTI trainer from the USSR. By the 1980s these aircraft were retired and were not replaced until 1991 when F-5s and F-7s were acquired from People's Republic of China due to the Sri Lankan Civil War. Thus the No. 5 \\"Jet\\" Squadron was formed in 1991 at SLAF Katunayake. These were used for ground attack and in 1994 the squadron moved to SLAF China Bay. With the No. 10 Squadron SLAF became operational in 1996 the F-7s were used for pilot training and carry out combat training missions. By 2000 they were once again used for ground attack with newer models introduced. Six Mikoyan MiG-27s and one Mikoyan MiG-23UB trainer were introduced to provide close air support, these were later formed their own squadron; the No. 12 Squadron. In 2008 six F-7Gs were acquired to be used as interceptors with the squadron taking on the air defence role. October 2008 the SLAF claimed it first air-to-air kill, when it reported that one of the squadron's F-7G interceptors shot down a Zlín Z 43 of the LTTE air wing when it attempted to attack a military base in Vavuniya.Tamil rebels' aircraft shot down, says Sri Lanka Air Force Current role No. 5 Squadron currently operates from SLAF Katunayake and operates the F-7G in air defence role and F-7BS in strike bombing role.

While his musical output was small, he was one of the earliest composers of madrigals, and was influential on other early composers of madrigals, such as Philippe Verdelot. He may have been related to his more famous contemporary Costanzo Festa, another early madrigal composer. Life He was from Villafranca Sabauda in the Italian province of Piedmont, not far from Turin; his father, named Jacobinus, was a musician resident in Turin in the 1520s. Jacobinus was probably Festa's teacher. While it is tempting to suggest that he was the younger brother or other relation of the much more famous Costanzo Festa, since they were from the same region, had similar musical acumen and both wrote madrigals, no direct evidence of this has emerged. Sebastiano first appears in the record in a manuscript copied between 1516 and 1519, possibly as the copyist: the document contains motets both by himself and Costanzo.James Haar, Grove online He lived and worked in Rome in the early 1520s, with the Genoese aristocrat Ottobono Fieschi as his patron, and he worked with other musicians connected with Pope Leo X. Costanzo Festa had been a singer in the Sistine Chapel choir since 1517, so both Festas may have come to Rome at approximately the same time. Sebastiano received a canonicate at Turin Cathedral in 1520, but he died at Rome on 31 July 1524.James Haar, Grove online Music and influence Only fourteen compositions have been securely attributed to Sebastiano Festa: four motets and ten madrigals. Another seven madrigals are considered doubtful. Similarities in style between Sebastiano's and Costanzo's work have made some of the identification difficult. All of his works are for four voices, and most of the madrigals he published in a single volume in 1526 in Rome, Libro primo de la croce: canzoni, frottole et capitoli, by printers Pasoti and Dorico at the publishing house of Giacopo Giunta.James Haar, Grove onlineEinstein, Vol. I p. 141-2 Most of Festa's madrigals retain textural characteristics of the earlier Italian secular form, the frottola, particularly in their use of homophony and syllabic writing; however, what distinguishes them from the frottola and allows the label of \\"madrigal\\", is their patterning on the French chanson, then becoming influential in Italy; their refusal to repeat the same music for different lines of text, and their use of poetry such as that by Petrarch, an influence of Cardinal Pietro Bembo, the literary inspiration for the new madrigal form, who was working in Rome at the time.James Haar, Grove onlineFenlon/Haar, p. 10-11 These works, simple as they are, were influential on other early madrigalists such as Philippe Verdelot, who produced his first madrigals around the same time or shortly after Festa.Fenlon/Haar, p. 11 One of Festa's madrigals, O passi sparsi, based on a sonnet by Petrarch, acquired some fame beyond Festa's limited circle. It was copied in many manuscripts up to mid-century, and appeared in instrumental arrangements as well. Claudin de Sermisy, the French chanson composer, even based a parody mass on it – a common fate for a \\"good tune\\" in the sixteenth century. Albert de Rippe made an arrangement of this song for the lute, and Diego Pisador made an instrumental arrangement for the vihuela in his \\"Libro de Music de Vihuela\\" (Salamanca, 1552) under the title of \\"[Cancion Francesa] Sparci sparcium\\".

Meyers, Swift, Silent, and Deadly: Marine Amphibious Reconnaissance in the Pacific, 1942-1945, (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2004). They existed around the same exact moment when 1st and 2nd Marine Division were created. In 1941, each regiment had a scout and sniper platoon. They were assigned to the regimental Headquarters and Service Company. These companies were used in variety of tasks and, on occasion in severe combat, were used as \\"spare\\" rifle companies. When 6th Marine Division deactivated after the end of World War II, its recon assets also deactivated. Only the current Marine Division Recon Battalions that exist today hold history reference to the Scout and Sniper Companies. Many of their scouts and snipers companies were reinforced with tanks for speed and added firepower. These later developed into the Division recon companies (later battalions) that are presently operating in the Marine Regiments today; also forging the Marine Corps modern Scout Sniper teams that are existence. Later in the 1980s, the Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) battalions were born from reinforced light tank concept of World War II, remolding the mission plans for division recon. Although this has taken away their expedient armored reconnaissance roles, it was preserved and improved by the LAR battalions. Training While the two Marine divisions, (1st and 2nd Marine Division), were still fresh, many of the regimental intelligence sections (G-2) approached reconnaissance differently from the VAC's FMF Amphib Recon Company.Ray W. Stubbe, \\"AARUGHA!: History of Specialized and Force-level Reconnaissance Activities and Units of the United States Marine Corps, 1900-1974\\", Fleet Marine Reference Publication 12-21 (MCB Quantico, HQMC: Historical Division, 1981). Each of the specialized schools were followed by individual training back in the Corps's parent organization. This was normally scheduled by the company commander or the battalion commander. Each unit had its own means of training its Marines from the lessons learned from previous organization's last recon entry behind enemy territory. They kept individual and unit training at a high level of proficiency. In general, all scout and snipers were trained in scouting and patrolling. This included escape and evasion, land/maritime orientation, knife fighting, close-quarter combat, weapons and demolition, combat swimming, compass swims, hydrographic surveying, etc. Many of these Marines were exceptional marksman and sharpshooters. Most of these courses and training were conducted within the Marine's own training function. However, some were sent to train with the Royal Marines in England, and other specialized schools developed around the areas of the Pacific. An eight-week course was set up at Mornington Peninsula in Australia, instructed by 1st Lieutenant Holly Whyte. Lt. Whyte gained his recon skills while serving with the 1st Marines on Guadalcanal. The first class of students were mostly combat experienced recon Marines from each of the division's infantry regiments that fought on Guadalcanal. Although scouting and patrolling, field sketching and land navigation were mostly refresher training; rubber boats and amphibious reconnaissance was very new. The nearby Port Phillip bay was used routinely for rubber boat and training. 1st Marine Division's regimental intelligence officers, 1st Lieutenants R. B. Firm and John Bradbeer attended the United States Navy's Amphibious Scouts School. They learned in this eight week course in sophisticated ambushes and raids, and more rubber boat work. Bradbeer and Firm were pulled back to Guadalcanal to the Seventh Fleet's Amphibious component—the 3rd Marine Division. Retained by I Amphibious Corps (I MAC), Bradbeer and Firm was briefed on the pending Treasury Islands missions by Marine Raider Major Richard T. Washburn, who was schooling Raiders and division scouts on amphibious reconnaissance. Washburn's teams were about to depart on an amphib recon mission of the Shortland and Treasury Islands. History \\"Wild Bill\\" Whaling [sitting on ground] overlooking map of Guadalcanal with accompanying officers In 1941, Lieutenant Colonel William \\"Wild Bill\\" Whaling, the executive officer of 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, visualized and perceived the use for specialized missions encompassing reconnaissance at the division-level, which would be conducted above the normal infantry battalion-level in scouting and patrolling. He recommended to General Alexander Vandegrift the need of a special \\"Scout and Sniper unit\\" for the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal. Upon approval, by February 1, each of the three rifle companies that were used during the Guadalcanal campaign were tasked in sending one their best field craft Marines to devise the scout-sniper unit with each regiment containing a Scout and Sniper Platoon within the regimental headquarters and service company. This was the birth of division reconnaissance. Most of these Marines were skilled marksmen and outdoorsmen. General Vandegrift appointed Lt. Colonel Whaling to start a school where the selected Marines received intense additional training. While some Marines weren't selected and were sent back to their units, others took their place and the \\"Whaling Group\\" was available to scout and spearhead operations.Henry I. Shaw, First Offensive: The Marine Campaign for Guadalcanal, (Darby, PA: DIANE Publishing Company, 1992). Initially, they acted as guides in movement of units from one area to another and were able to confirm unit locations in the thick jungle foliage. They later conducted independent patrols into areas of critical interests to the Division. It wasn't before long many of the regiments requested their scouts to be heavily reinforced with tanks. The mechanized recon scouts proved to be very efficient in reconnaissance in force (RIF). They would ride on top the tanks and rapidly be inserted behind the enemy lines and \\"look\\" for the enemy. Whenever encountered, they would fall back and immediately report to the battalion commander of its new findings Although, the division commander retained the amphibious and ground reconnaissance to its company level and took advantage of its sniper development. Those scout and sniper platoons later formed the Marine Scout Sniper and Surveillance and Target Acquisition platoons. By 1944, The Marine divisions contained elements of scout/snipers, armored recon teams, and ground and amphib recon platoons within the division. Marines from the recently disbanded Raider and the Paramarine battalions filled most of the vacancies.Charles D. Melson and Paul Hanon, Marine Recon, 1940-1990, (London: Osprey, 1998). The division commander at that time reassembled the separate division assets. This formation consolidated collecting more efficiently under the Commanding General and his Intelligence (G-2) and Operations (G-3) staffs. =World War II= Prior to the arrival of Marines in this area of the Pacific War, the Australians had already established a network of deep reconnaissance agents known as the Australian Coastwatchers. They operated not only on coasts, but deep in jungles as well. Initially, some Marines became part of the unit.E. A. Feldt, \\"Coastwatching in World War II,\\" (U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings: September 1961) 87:9; pgs 72—79.

In 2006, Perth became the first Australian city to operate a seawater desalination plant, the Kwinana Desalination Plant, to reduce the city's vulnerability to droughts. A plant at Kurnell has also been built and supplies Sydney metropolitan area with water during droughts and low dam levels. More plants are planned or are under construction in Gold Coast, Melbourne, and Adelaide. The use of reclaimed water is also increasingly common. However, some desalination plants were put in stand-by modes in 2010 following above average rainfall levels and floods in 2010. Governments of Australian states and territories, through state-owned companies, are in charge of service provision in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, while utilities owned by local governments provide services in parts of Queensland and Tasmania. In Victoria, New South Wales and Southeast Queensland, state-owned utilities provide bulk water which is then distributed by utilities owned by either local or state governments. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities is responsible for water policies at the federal level.  Water resources and water use  Australia is the driest inhabited continent on Earth, and among the world's highest consumers of water. Amongst OECD nations Australia is ranked fourth- highest in water use per capita. Total water runoff in 2004–05 was estimated at 243 billion cubic meters (BCM) and total groundwater recharge was estimated at 49 BCM, giving a total inflow to Australia's water resources of 292 BCM. Over 50 per cent of runoff occurred in northern Australia. Only 6 per cent of Australia's runoff was in the Murray-Darling Basin, where 50 per cent of Australia's water use occurs. Australia's total large dam storage capacity was 84 BCM. While surface water is well known, groundwater resources are not well known. In 2004-05 the National Water Commission undertook water balance assessments for 55 priority geographic areas across Australia. Of these water management areas six were overused (consumptive use was greater than sustainable yield) and seventeen had a high level of consumptive use as a proportion of inflows (consumptive use greater than 30 per cent of inflows). Two water management areas (Great Artesian Basin and Mereenie Sandstone -- Alice Springs) had consumptive use greater than total annual inflow. Total water use in Australia in 2004-05 was nearly 80 BCM, with about 75 per cent of this water returned to the environment following in-stream uses such as hydroelectric power generation. Consumptive use of water in the Australian economy in 2004-05 was 18.8 BCM (6.4 per cent of resources), with the agriculture sector the largest user (65 per cent), followed by household use (11 per cent). Residential water use declined from 243 liter/person/day in 2003 to 191 in 2007.The International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET):Australia Country Report, accessed on 20 September 2010 According to the Prime Minister's office, as the impact of climate change intensifies, Australia faces increasingly acute long-term water shortages with lower rainfall, rivers drying up and dam water levels falling. In most parts of Australia, surface water stored in reservoirs is the main source for municipal water supply, making water supply vulnerable to droughts; only a much smaller share comes from groundwater. Non-conventional water sources, such as seawater desalination, play an increasing role in Australia's water supply, with one desalination plant commissioned to supply Perth and others being built in Sydney, the Gold Coast, Melbourne, Adelaide, and another is planned to be built at Port Augusta. The use of reclaimed water -- the non- potable reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation of green spaces, golf courses, agricultural crops or industrial uses -- is common and increasing in Australia. Among the 20 largest water utilities in Australia, the largest volume of recycled water supplied was by SA Water in Adelaide (25,047 ML or 29.6% of sewage collected), while the lowest volume of recycled water was by ACTEW in Canberra (2,104 ML or 7.4% of sewage collected). = Adelaide = The Happy Valley Reservoir stores water for supply to Adelaide. Adelaide receives its drinking water from six sources: * the River Torrens, flowing from the Adelaide Hills through the city into the sea, with storage provided in the Millbrook Reservoir, Kangaroo Creek Reservoir and Hope Valley Reservoir; * the Onkaparinga River south of Adelaide with storage in the Mount Bold Reservoir, downstream of which water is diverted by the Clarendon Weir via a tunnel to the Happy Valley Reservoir on the Field River; * The Barossa Reservoir, the Warren Reservoir, South Para Reservoir and the Little Para Reservoir north- east of Adelaide; * Most years the flow to these reservoirs is supplemented by water pumped from the River Murray through two pipelines, the Mannum–Adelaide pipeline to the reservoirs on the River Torrens, the South Para Reservoir and Warren Reservoir, and the other from Murray Bridge to the reservoirs on the Onkaparinga River; * The Myponga Reservoir on the Myponga river about 60 km south of Adelaide, supplying about 5% of the city's water supply. * The Adelaide Desalination Plant with the capacity to supply up to 50% of Adelaide's water needs, but currently only supplying approximately 4%. The amount of water required from the River Murray varies from about 40 per cent of Adelaide's water needs in a normal rainfall year to as much as 90 per cent in a dry year. At full capacity the above-mentioned reservoirs hold about 200 million cubic meters of water, or a little less than 1 year's supply for metropolitan Adelaide. A desalination plant near Port Augusta has been proposed which will supply almost all the residential water needs of towns on the Spencer Gulf. = Brisbane and Gold Coast = Water storage, treatment and bulk supply for Brisbane is handled by SEQ Water, which sells on to Brisbane Water for distribution to the Greater Brisbane area. Water for the area is stored in three major dams; Wivenhoe Dam on the Brisbane River, Somerset on the Stanley River and North Pine on the North Pine River. Water is also provided by a number of smaller dams that are connected via the SEQ Water Grid. The Wivenhoe Dam is shared with the Gold Coast, which has two more water sources, the Hinze Dam and the smaller Little Nerang Dam, both on the Nerang River. Groundwater from North Stradbroke Island is also transferred to the mainland to supplement the area's water supply. Gold Coast Water has constructed a desalination plant at Tugun, commissioned in 2009. A Southern Regional Pipeline is also under construction that will share Gold Coast water with the rest of South East Queensland. The A$2.5 billion Western Corridor Recycled Water Project whose construction began in 2006 includes the construction of three new wastewater treatment plants, 200 km of pipelines and 12 pumping stations. It will provide reclaimed water to industrial users, agricultural users and to supplement drinking water supplies in Wivenhoe Dam.Western Corridor Recycled Water Project. Retrieved 28 April 2009. A severe drought in 2005-2007 triggered major investments, including the Tugun desalination plant and the Western Corridor Recycled Water Project. When rainfall became abundant in 2008-2010 and reservoirs were full, the state government decided in 2010 to put the Tugun plant in stand-by mode, operating at less than 10% of capacity, and to close down a new advanced wastewater treatment plant on Gibson Island in order to save power and chemicals.Global Water Intelligence:Aussie plants go into hibernation, December 2010, p. 26 = Canberra = Canberra draws its water supply from three separate catchment systems: The Cotter River catchment, within the ACT; the Googong system on the Queanbeyan River in New South Wales; and the Murrumbidgee River, at the Cotter Pump Station. All these rivers drain into the Murray River which is ultimately part of the Murray-Darling Basin. =Melbourne= The Silvan reservoir supplies water to Melbourne. Some 90% of Melbourne's drinking water comes from uninhabited mountain ash forests high up in the Yarra Ranges east of Melbourne. More than 157,000 hectares has been reserved for the primary purpose of harvesting water. These water supply catchments have been closed to the public for more than 100 years. Melbourne's water supply system is based on the principle that it is better to start with the highest quality source water than having to treat it to reach required standards. According to Melbourne Water, Melbourne is one of only about five cities in the world that has such protected catchments. Water from the forests flows through streams in reservoirs, which provide security of supply for times of drought. One of these reservoirs is formed by the Thomson Dam on the Thomson River located about 130 km east of Melbourne in Gippsland, from where water flows through a 19 km long tunnel through the Great Dividing Range into the Upper Yarra Reservoir and then onto Silvan Reservoir for distribution as drinking water in Melbourne. In recent years, drought has resulted in depletion of much of the water in the reservoir of the Thomson Dam. In June 2007, the Victorian State Government announced a new plan to provide water security for Victoria's growing population and economy by diversifying and boosting water supplies, networking the State's water resources in a Victorian Water Grid and enabling a rapid and flexible response to changing future water needs. The plan includes A$4.9 billion of projects to secure Melbourne and Victoria's water supplies for the long term, including: * the 150 billion litre per year, A$2.2 billion Melbourne desalination plant in Wonthaggi which would be the largest desalination plant in Australia, supplying 30% of Melbourne's water needs, for which a Build–operate–transfer (BOT) contract was awarded in mid-2009 to a consortium led by the French multinational SUEZ; * a major irrigation upgrade in the Food Bowl in Northern Victoria to deliver water savings to be shared equally between irrigators, the environment, and Melbourne; and * a major expansion of the Victorian Water Grid with pipelines to connect Melbourne's water system with the desalination plant and Northern irrigation upgrades. These projects are expected to deliver a 50 per cent boost to Melbourne's water supply within five years and allow water to be moved where it is needed most. =Perth= Victoria Dam, shown here at 30.6% of capacity, supplies water to Perth. Perth receives approximately 10% to 20% of its water from a series of reservoirs, 40% from groundwater sources (mostly from the Gnangara groundwater system north of Perth), and 40% from two seawater desalination plants. Perth's climate has dried considerably since the 1970s and average inflows to Perth's metropolitan dams have dropped to around 60 gigalitres a year on average compared with 340 gigalitres in 1975. In 2006, Perth became the first Australian city to operate a reverse osmosis seawater desalination plant, the Kwinana Desalination Plant, and a second seawater desalination plant began operation in 2013 in Binningup near Bunbury. Together these two plants can deliver 145 gigalitres of water each year. Stage 1 of a Groundwater Replenishment Scheme has commenced, and when fully operational in 2019 it will have the capacity to recharge 28 gigalitres of highly treated wastewater to the groundwater supplies. = Sydney = Warragamba Dam is the main source of water supply for Sydney. More than four million people in Sydney, the Illawarra, the Blue Mountains and the Southern Highlands rely on the catchments of the Warragamba, Upper Nepean, Blue Mountains, Shoalhaven, and Woronora river systems to supply their drinking water. This is about 60 per cent of the population of New South Wales. These catchments cover an area of almost 16,000 square kilometres. They extend from north of Lithgow in the upper Blue Mountains, to the source of the Shoalhaven River near Cooma in the south -- and from Woronora in the east to the source of the Wollondilly River west of Crookwell. The catchments are the source of the raw bulk water stored in reservoirs, which is then supplied to Sydney Water, Shoalhaven City Council and Wingecarribee Shire Council. Given low water levels in reservoirs due to drought Sydney Water announced in 2007 it would build the Kurnell Desalination Plant, powered by wind energy, that would supply up to 15% of the drinking water supply to Sydney, the Illawarra and the Blue Mountains. It is the largest water supply project for Sydney since the Warragamba Dam was opened in 1960.  Responsibility for water supply and sanitation  Policy and regulation = The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia states that natural resource policy, including that relating to water, is a responsibility of the States: \\"The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.\\" (Section 100) However, this legal position has become less clear as a result of decisions by the Australian High Court. The Commonwealth Government has taken a much greater role in the Australian water sector in the early 21st century. The Ministry for Climate Change and Water is in charge of water policies at the federal level. (Section 109) Of the Constitution of Australia provides that: When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid. An example of the expanding role of the Commonwealth in the management of water resources is the federal takeover of the Murray-Darling Basin. In April 2007, amid a major drought, John Howard, then Prime Minister of Australia, announced that the region was facing an \\"unprecedentedly dangerous\\" water shortage and that water might have to be reserved for \\"critical urban\\" water supplies. The Federal Government proposed an A$10 billion Commonwealth take-over of the Murray-Darling Basin, arguing that effective management could not be undertaken by competing state governments. While the states of New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia as well as the Australian Capital Territory accepted the proposal, the state of Victoria initially refused to co-operate, arguing that its irrigators would be disadvantaged and that it would challenge the takeover in the High Court. Legislation to create the Murray-Darling Basin Commission was passed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in August 2007 in the form of the Water Act of 2007. In March 2008, Premier John Brumby indicated that the Victorian government would participate in the program, in return for $1 billion to upgrade irrigation and continue water security for farmers. National Water Initiative. In 1994 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed on a Water Reform Agenda to work towards reform in the water industry at the national level. In 2004, this was succeeded by the formation of the National Water Commission and the adoption of the National Water Initiative (NWI). The NWI \\"aims at increasing the productivity and efficiency of Australia 's water use and establishing clear pathways to return all water systems – rivers and groundwater – to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction\\". The government has also established Drinking Water Guidelines as part of a National Water Quality Management Strategy. The Government of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had announced that it would invest in greater use of recycled water, water desalination and stormwater through a $1 billion urban water infrastructure fund. The Government also announced that it would assist households to install water and energy efficient products, with rebates for rainwater tanks and solar hot water. State-level regulation. Various state agencies regulate water supply and sanitation in each state, with different arrangements found throughout Australia. State agencies with responsibilities in the sector include Water Commissions, Environmental Protection Agencies and Competition Authorities. They operate under different Departments (Ministries) such as Natural Resources and Water Departments and Trade Departments. For example, in Queensland under the Water Act 2000 water policy is the responsibility of the Queensland Water Commission, which is under the Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and the Minister of Trade.Queensland Water Commission:Legislation. Retrieved 5 November 2009. = Service provision = At the local level, commercialisation and corporatisation of many Australian urban water businesses has led to management responsibilities being vested in commercial utilities, in contrast to earlier arrangements where services were provided directly by an arm of government. The role of the utility's board members is to provide commercial skill and focus, as well as to buffer the organisation from arbitrary political interference. The private sector is involved primarily through Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts for major treatment plants, including desalination plants. The institutional arrangements for service provision vary among States and Territories. In parts of Queensland and in Tasmania, for example, local government is responsible for the provision of water services. In other states and territories, different arrangements have evolved. In New South Wales, Victoria and parts of Queensland, there are separate municipal retail service providers and state bulk service providers that cover large parts of each state. In other states, such as South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territories integrated state-level water utilities are in charge of both bulk water supply and retail distribution. South East Queensland has reformed its water sector in 2008. Under the new structure three state-owned authorities (Seqwater, LinkWater and the SEQ Water Grid Manager) are in charge of bulk water supply: * Seqwater supplies water from conventional sources such as dams, weirs and treatment plants as well as water from non-conventional sources such as the Gold Coast Desalination Plant and the Western Corridor Recycled Water Project. * LinkWater owns the transport infrastructure, and * the SEQ Water Grid Manager operates the transport infrastructure. There are three retail utilities, each owned by a group of local governments:Queensland Water Commission:SEQ water reform.

In the Wide Bay–Burnett region of Queensland and in North West Queensland, the government- owned corporation SunWater provides bulk water to industrial, mining and power companies as well as local governments and farmers. In Sydney, New South Wales, a catchment authority (Sydney Catchment Authority) has been established to supply water in bulk to the retail water and wastewater utility Sydney Water, a statutory State owned corporation, wholly owned by the New South Wales Government. In Melbourne, Victoria, three government-owned companies (City West Water Ltd., South East Water Ltd., and Yarra Valley Water Ltd.) are the retailers and the wholesaler is a government-owned corporation, Melbourne Water. The wholesaler also controls the catchment for most of its supply. In Adelaide, South Australia (SA), water and sanitation services are provided by SA Water. In 1996 the SA Government awarded French-owned United Water a 15-year contract to manage and operate the metropolitan Adelaide water and wastewater systems on behalf of SA Water.SA Water:United Water. Retrieved 28 April 2009. SA Water retains ownership of all infrastructure, sets service standards, and implements the government's pricing policy. SA Water also maintains control of all asset investment decisions, billing and revenue collection.United Water:CASE STUDY - ADELAIDE CONTRACT. Retrieved 28 April 2009. When the contract expired in 2011 SA Water decided not to short-list United Water for the follow-up contract. The South Australian government had accused the company of overcharging. In January 2011 the follow-up operation and maintenance contract with a duration of 6 years, plus another 6 years based on the performance during the first 6 years, was won by Allwater, a consortium consisting of Degremont and Suez Environnement from France as well as the Australian company Transfield Services. In Western Australia the Water Corporation, a government-owned corporation, provides urban water services. Canning Dam, one of Perth's major dams, at 34.4% of capacity In Canberra, and the Australian Capital Territory generally, a public-private multi-utility partnership (ActewAGL), of which 50% is owned by the state-owned asset-holding company Icon Water, provides electricity, gas, water and wastewater services since 2000. A government-owned multi-utility, the Power and Water Corporation, provides services to the larger and less remote communities in the Northern Territory, including Alice Springs and Darwin. Most organisations providing urban water services in Australia have experienced some degree of organisational reform in the 1990s, which has clarified accountabilities by separating policy, regulatory and commercial (operational) functions. The accepted wisdom is that this separation provides urban water businesses with clear commercial goals of customer service, while safeguarding public health and achieving environmental compliance in a sound business operation, free of other conflicting objectives. For a brief profile of each of the 33 of the largest water companies in Australia see: WSAA Members  Community consultation  The Water Reform Agenda, agreed in 1994, adopted the principle of public consultation by government agencies and service providers when change and/or new initiatives were being contemplated involving water resources. Subsequently, the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines emphasised the right of communities to participate in the development of policies relating to their water supply. The Guidelines also provide advice on how customers should be involved in considering options for effective and acceptable monitoring and reporting on performance of their water supply, and on the frequency of such reporting. The Water Reform Agenda also mentions the need for the public to be informed of the cause and effect relationship between infrastructure performance, standards of service and related costs, with a view to promoting levels of service that represent the best value for money to the community.  Water tariffs  In Australia, most water businesses have changed from a charging system based largely on property value to one based on actual water consumed (a user-pays policy), in line with the Water Reform Agenda. Hunter Water in the Newcastle area of New South Wales pioneered this policy in Australia in the 1980s and reported a fall in household water consumption of 30 per cent over previous trends. This experience encouraged other water authorities to adopt the policy with a view to managing demand for water. However, low-income households in Australia spend in proportional terms much more on utility services than high-income households. The implication is that increases in the price of utility services, if not accompanied by other compensation, will have a regressive and disproportionately negative impact on low-income households. It is generally expected that with the advent of expensive desalination water tariffs will have to increase in Australia. Across Australia, the average typical annual residential bill for water supply and sewerage services was A$713 in 2007 (US$557 using the January 2007 exchange rate of 1.28). In South East Queensland the average annual water bill of only A$465 in 2005, but that it could increase to A$1,346 by 2017 due to increasing bulk water costs.Global Water Intelligence:The bureaucracy behind Queensland’s tariff rises, November 2010, quoting a study by AECgroup commissioned by the Local Government Association of Queensland  Investment  In the capital cities alone, over A$2 billion of expenditure was undertaken in 2007/2008 (US$1.74 billion using the January 2008 exchange rate of 1.15). This expenditure is unprecedented in the industry. Urban water utilities invested A$835 million in replacing old and under-performing assets and A$535 million in maintaining asset reliability.  Demand management and water conservation  Demand management measures to encourage consumers to use less water include advertising, education, pricing and appliance redesign. Furthermore, the use of alternatives to conventional water supply such as effluent reuse, rainwater harvesting and greywater use are also being encouraged through state-based rebates and the national not-for-profit Smart WaterMark label. Some water businesses in Australia have opted for restrictions on water use to conserve water supplies and minimise capital expenditure. A series of restriction levels, depending on remaining storage capacity in reservoirs, can curb the maximum daily consumption during drought periods. For example, several water authorities in very hot and dry regions of Australia have adopted a cooperative policy with consumers to restrict peak water usage on very hot days or to restrict garden watering to periods in which it is more effective.  Wastewater reuse  When there are droughts in Australia interest in reclaimed effluent options increases. Two major capital cities in Australia, Adelaide and Brisbane, have already committed to adding reclaimed effluent to their dwindling dams. The former has also built a desalination plant to help battle any future water shortages. Brisbane has been seen as a leader in this trend, and other cities and towns will review the Western Corridor Recycled Water Project once completed. Goulbourn, Canberra, Newcastle, and Regional Victoria, Australia are already considering building a reclaimed effluent process. Indirect potable reuse (IPR) has been considered for regional communities in Goulburn, NSW, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Toowoomba, Queensland. In 2005, residents of Toowoomba rejected the proposal to reuse recycled water as drinking water in Toowoomba Water Futures referendum. The Western Corridor Recycled Water Scheme in South East Queensland was designed and built to produce drinking quality water suitable for release into the Wivenhoe Dam, Brisbane's principal water storage. The advanced wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) incorporated microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO) followed by an advanced oxidation system using UV- light and hydrogen peroxide to remove specific disinfection by-products and non-specific low molecular weight organics. The project had a production capacity of 232,000 m3 per day and over 200 km of interconnecting and product water delivery pipelines. In Perth in Western Australia, the Western Australia Water Corporation operated a three-year demonstration project investigating the feasibility of reclaiming water from the Beenyup wastewater treatment plant using MF, RO and UV disinfection prior to injection into the Leederville aquifer (production of 5,000 m3 per day). The demonstration concluded in 2012, and in 2013 the Western Australian Government agreed to a full-scale groundwater recharge scheme, which commenced construction in 2014. When complete, the full-scale facility will provide 14,000,000 m3 per annum to the aquifers supplying Perth's drinking water, with the option to expand to 28,000,000 m3 per annum in the future. While there are currently no full-scale direct potable reuse schemes operating in Australia, the Australian Antarctic Division is investigating the option of installing a potable reuse scheme at its Davis research base in Antarctica. To enhance the quality of the marine discharge from the Davis wastewater treatment plant, a number of different, proven technologies have been selected to be used in the future, such as ozonation, UV disinfection, chlorine, as well as UF, activated carbon filtration and RO.

He should never be allowed near a vibraphone again.\\" In a retrospective review, Mark Deming of Allmusic gives the album three-and-a-half out of five stars and feels that, \\"like most soundtrack albums of the period, Black Caesar sounds rather scattershot, especially when the music is divorced from the film's narrative,\\" but observed \\"several top-notch tracks\\", including \\"The Boss\\", \\"Make It Good to Yourself\\", and \\"Mama's Dead\\". Deming adds that \\"Fred Wesley's superb horn charts, Jimmy Nolen's percussive guitar, and Jabo Starks' dead-on-the-one drumming make even the weaker instrumental cuts worth a quick listen\\". Dave Thompson calls it a \\"kick-ass soundtrack\\" and \\"nothing short of a full frontal funk assault.\\" Track listing Personnel  Credits for Black Caesar adapted from Allmusic. * Charles Bobbit – Composer * Bob Both – Mixing, Production Supervisor * James Brown – Arranger, Composer, Conductor, Primary Artist, Producer, Vocals * Bodie Chandler – Composer * Lyn Collins – Composer, Primary Artist * Barry De Vorzon – Composer * Jeff Faville – Redesign * Jan Hammer – Composer * Joseph M.

It flew the RCAF's first bombing operation ten weeks later on 12/13 June, attacking the railway marshalling yards at Schwerte. It converted to the Handley Page Halifax in April 1942, taking part in the historic 1,000-bomber raid on Cologne on the night of 30/31 May 1942. In late October 1942, the squadron was loaned to Coastal Command to fly anti-submarine patrols in the Bay of Biscay at the time of the North African landings. Returning to Bomber Command at the beginning of March 1943, the squadron flew with No. 6 Group RCAF for short time before being selected for the elite No. 8 (Pathfinder) Group based at Gransden Lodge Airfield, with which it served until the end of the war. Through the last 20 months of the bomber offensive the squadron was equipped with the Avro Lancaster. The squadron's last operational mission took place on 25 April 1945 when nine Lancasters bombed the Berghof, and four aircraft bombed enemy gun batteries on island of Wangerooge. The squadron was disbanded on 5 September 1945. =Post war= The squadron was reformed on 1 April 1947 as No. 405 Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron at RCAF Station Greenwood, and was later redesignated No. 405 Maritime Reconnaissance Squadron and then No. 405 Maritime Patrol Squadron.

These were replaced in mid-1955 by the P2V7 Neptune giving the squadron a much greater anti- submarine capability. In April 1958 the squadron was given the distinction of being the first to fly the Canadian-built CP-107 Argus. The squadron made its last flight in the Argus on 10 November 1980 before introducing the CP-140 Aurora.

Shasta (IAST Śāstā) is the name of a Hindu deity in India. Shasta is a generic Sanskrit term for a teacher. The word Shasta was first used in the sense of a Hindu deity in South India during the 3rd century CE. He is identified with many deities like Aiyanar, Ayyappa. According to Guruswamy Viswanatha Sarma, who made an extensive study of the Sastha concept, Ayyanar and Ayyappan chose eight Sastha incarnations for Loka Kshema. Significance Shasta is a generic term that means \\"Teacher, Guide, Lord, Ruler\\" in Sanskrit. In South India, a number of deities are associated with Shasta. The Tamil song Shasta Varavu states that there are eight important incarnations and forms of Shasta. This is also present in the agamic work Dyana Ratnavali. The Ashta-Shasta (eight Shastas) are Aadhi Maha Shasta, Dharma Shasta, Gnana Shasta, Kalyana Varadha Shasta, Sammohana Shasta, Santhana Prapti Shasta, Veda Shasta and Veera Shasta. Brahma Shasta is another term associated with Kartikeya. =Tamil Nadu= In Tamil Nadu, Aiyanar is used as another name of the deity Shasta. The earliest reference to Aiyanar- Shasta is from the Arcot district in Tamil Nadu. The stones are dated to the 3rd century C.E. They read \\"Ayanappa; a shrine to Chathan.\\" This is followed by another inscription in Uraiyur near Tiruchirapalli which is dated to the 4th century C.E.Williams, J., Kaladarsana, p.67 Literary references to Aiyanar-Chathan are found in Silappatikaram, a Tamil work dated to the 4th to 5th centuries C.E. The Tamil sangam classics Purananuru, Akananuru etc. refer to ayyanar and \\"chathan\\" in many poems. There are several numerous references to sasta in sangam works.Some Tamil inscriptions of sangam times and also of the later pallava and chola period coming in from various parts of the empire refer to him as sevugan and mahasasta. The hymns of some alwars like tirumangai alwar and nammalwar in temples like tirumogur near madurai refer to sasta.Williams, J., Kaladarsana, p.66 A Sanskrit work dated prior to the 7th century known as Brahmanda Purana mentions Shasta as harihara suta or son of Narayana (Vishnu)(hari) and Shiva(hara). There are references in puranas that narrate as to how sasta during his tenure on earth long ago conducted discourses on vedas and vedantas to a galaxy of gods and sages. Later on the Saivite revivalist Appar sang about Shasta as the progeny of Shiva and tirumaal (Vishnu) in one of his Tevarams in the 7th century. The child saint tirugnanasambandar in one of his songs praises ayyanar as celibate god, invincible and terrible in warfare, taking his abode alongside bhootaganas of Lord Siva. The place sanctity and history document or sthalapuranam of tiruvanaikkaval, a saivite temple near trichy, which was first documented by sage kasyapa informs us that sasta once served lord sivan at that site and after being blessed with a vision was instructed by lord to take abode in the outer sanctorum. It says that sasta continues to worship lord during the day of tiruvadirai. Adi sankara also has referred to ayyanar in sivanandalahari in one verse . Some ancient hagiographies have accounted that sri sankara was a deivamsam(divine soul portion) of sree sasta(sevugan), the same way as tirugnana sambandar was a divine portion of skanda and sundarar a divine portion of alalasundarar.He is also known to have composed verses praising the deity but the same are not available to us as of today. From the Chola period (9th century C.E) onwards the popularity of Aiyanar-Shasta became even more pronounced as is attested by epigraphy and imagery.Williams, J., Kaladarsana, p.62 =Kerala= The Shasta religious tradition is particularly well developed in the state of Kerala. The earliest inscription to Shasta was made in 855 C.E. by an Ay King at the Padmanabhapuram Sivan temple. Independent temples to Shasta are known from the 11th century C.E. Prior to that, Shasta veneration took place in the temples of Shiva and Vishnu, the premier gods of the Hindu pantheon. Since late medieval times, the warrior deity Ayyappa's following has become very popular in the 20th century. Relation between Ayyapan, Aiyanar and Shasta According to the Brahmanda Purana ,which dates prior to the 7th century mentions Shasta as harihara suta or son of Siva and Narayana (Vishnu). The Saivite revivalist Appar sang about Shasta as the progeny of Shiva and tirumaal (Vishnu) in one of his Tevaram in the 7th century. The Tamil song Shasta Varavu states that there are eight important incarnations and forms of Shasta.The Dyana ratnavali confirms the same fact.The Ashta-Shasta (eight Shastas) are Aadhi Maha Shasta(Aiyanar), Dharma Shasta ( Ayyappan), Gnana Shasta, Kalyana Varadha Shasta, Sammohana Shasta, Santhana Prapti Shasta, Veda Shasta and Veera Shasta.Among the Ashta- Shasta,the Adhi Maha Sastha (Aiyanar) and Dharma Shasta ( Ayyappan) are widely worshipped.https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and- culture/shrines-for-sastha-in-eight-forms/article5425348.ece Aiyanar (Adhi Maha Sastha) is worshiped as the protector of Village in Tamil Nadu and in Sri Lanka(as Ayyanayake ).Ayyappan is worshipped in Kerala. Although Ayyappan and Aiyanar are incarnations of Sastha ,there are large difference between them.(Just like-although Krishna and Rama are incarnations of Vishnu,they are different).The major difference between them are *Ayyappan is celibate,while Aiyanar is grihastha and has two wives Puranai(Poorna) and Pushkalai(Pushkala) *Aiyanar rides on Horse and white elephant, while Ayyappan rides on Horse and Tiger. *In Kerala, Ayyappan is worshiped in Sabarimala temple while Aiyanar is worshipped in Achankovil Sree Dharmasastha Temple However, due to the fact that Ayyappan and Aiyanar both are incarnations of Sastha, the difference between them narrowed in the course of history. Tamil devotees did not discriminate Ayyappan with Ayyanar and they believe that Ayyappan is the avatar of Ayyanar. It can be noted that Sri Lankan Ayyanar temples are being converted into Ayyappan temples following the outbreak of Sabarimala pilgrimage of Sri Lankan devotees in recent years.http://www.ourjaffna.com/temples/அரிகரபுத்திர-ஐயனார் Sastha incarnations The Ashta Sasthas are:https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/ashta-sastha-temple-at- veppampattu *Adhi Maha Sastha-He is worshipped with two consorts – Poorna and Pushkala.He is worshipped in many villages of South, as a protector of their houses and cities. It is believed that Karikaala Chozhan, an ardent devotee of this Sastha, won many battles after worshipping Sastha in Kanchi Kamakshi Amman temple. *Dharma Sastha-He disseminates knowledge and peace. He is said to break the barrier of caste and creed and guides us towards righteousness and salvation. He is believed to provide solace when planet Saturn troubles people . Sri Dharma Sastha was a Brahmachari. However, in previous avatars, Sastha dwelt at Kantha Mala with two consorts Poorna and Pushkala. A distinction should therefore should be drawn between Sastha and Manikanta. *Gnana Sastha - as the name implies showers intellect and wisdom. He plays the Manikka Veena and sits under a banyan tree like god Dakshinamoorthi. There are references to this Sastha in \\"Aakasa Bhairava Kalpam.\\" Sree Dharma Sastha temple in Thiruvullakavu is considered the Abode of Wisdom. There is an idol of Sri Vidhya Sastha in Veda Nayaga Sastha temple at Vedikarampalayam, Salem. *Kalyana Varadha Sastha-He is worshipped for the removal of hurdles to marriage. He is worshipped with Poorna and Pushkala.There are references of Kalyana Varadha Sastha in verses such as Guhyia Rathna Chinthamani and Boodha Naadha Charitham. Mythology has it that Kalyana Varada Sastha resides in Kanthamalai. Sastha is worshipped as Kalyana murthy in Ganapathy Agraharam, * Gajaarooda(riding on an elephant) Sastha or Kaala Sastha or Maha Sastha -He is annihilator of enemies. Since one of his devotees won over Yamadharma Raja - Maha Kaalan, He is called as Kaala Sastha. Although there is no temple for Kaala Sastha, we can find Sastha sitting on an elephant, one of his Vahana, in Thriyambakapuram near Thanjavur *Sammohana Sastha -He stands for conjugal bliss and harmony. He is worshipped with Poorna and Pushkala. His grace is compared with Amudha Surabhi. There are references to Sammohana Sastha in Skanda Puranam. There is a temple for Sammohana Sastha in Sirkazhi, Kaivilanchery. The deity is called Kaividael Appan. *Santhana Prapthi Sastha -He represents Planet Venus and is worshipped for progeny. His consort Prabhavati has a Maanikka Veenai and hence he is also called Brahma Sastha . This Sastha is different from other incarnations as he is seen with his child Satyagan.An interesting piece culled from mythology is that it was Brahma Sastha who offered the Divine Payasam to King Dasaratha when he performed Puthrakameshti Yaaga. There are references of this Sastha in ‘Thantra Samuchayam\\" and ‘Silparathnam.’ *Veda Sastha-He also goes by the name Simharooda Sastha and is synonymous with the Vedas and the knowledge they represent.Even now, Ayyanar in Vedikarampalayam, Salem, is worshipped as Veda Nayaga Sastha, surrounded by four Neem trees representing the four Vedas. *Veera Sastha- He is a great warrior, visualised on a horse with weapons.He is worshipped to destroy evil and to protect humanity.There are references to this Sastha in ‘Adi Sankara Vicharitham’ which has Adi Sankara worshipping Veera Sastha in a place called Kudhiran.(Between Trichur and Palghat) As of 2013,an Ashta Sastha Temple was planned to construct in Veppampattu in Tiruvallur district of Tamil nadu See also *Nurani, a village in Palakkad, Kerala, noted for its Sastha devotion. *Aiyanar References Further reading  * * External links *Nurani, a village with a strong Sastha devotion. *Kuthiran Shasta temple *List of Shasta temples in Kerala *Sastha Ayyanar and Ayyappan *Ashta Sastha Temple *List of 108 Ancient Sastha Temples *Authoring the first purana on Shasta Category:Regional Hindu gods Category:Tamil deities ","title":"Shasta (deity)"},{"id":"20946090","text":"Kheri Naudh Singh is a village in the Indian state of Punjab.

CAM is a product of the OASIS Content Assembly Technical Committee. The CAM approach aligns with the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) approach and assists with producing Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD). The camprocessor tools enable creation of realistic XML examples from XSD schema structure definitions. These XML samples simulate test cases for use in interoperability testing and determination of templates for use in actual business information exchanges. The single most important problem that CAM is solving is simpler and more reliable interoperability for business information exchanges. Today's electronic commerce via the internet is extremely limited in the amount of automation or integration that is occurring. The ability to share accurate concise and verifiable information exchange definitions is a critical next step in enabling easier and cheaper global commerce. CAM is emerging as the definitive standard underlying effective management of information exchanges through the critical mass being generated by the open source solution. A broad range of OASIS standard definitions are now being documented, validated and enhanced using the CAM open source toolset and approach. To date these include EDXL, CIQ, and EML. CAM use is also extending to external industry groups such as PESC, MISMO, STAR Automotive, CAQH and then for government uses including stratML, LEXS and NIEM. Each group faces the same challenges in promoting localizations of their overall standards in ways that can be quickly verified and adopted. Using CAM they are able to take their existing XSD schema work and rapidly develop localization templates, XML test cases, new subset schemas for use with web services and create re-usable want lists and content hints. In addition CAM templates are used to build domain dictionaries directly from the XSD schema definitions and then produce cross-reference spreadsheets for individual templates to the master dictionary definitions. All these capabilities are aimed at improving the quality and speed of implementation and interoperability using business information exchanges based on XML.  History of CAM  The OASIS Content Assembly Technical Committee (CAM TC), which met for the first time in January 2003, was chartered \\"to produce a specification of a generalized mechanism in XML whereby implementers can deliver the means to bring together business process context and the localized implementation business rules needed to take a raw industry standard schema instance and combine that with actual business information content, context and roles and produce a valid consistent XML document instance.\\" OASIS is developing specifications for business process mechanisms, industry standard schemas, registry systems, and schema mechanisms. The CAM specification will allow these four components to be brought together in a consistent and standard way and publish assembly implementation instructions based on these OASIS specifications. This will facilitate the work of industry groups and allow development of software tools that work consistently with all these specifications. The original work predating CAM was begun in the later days of the ebXML initiative as an offshoot of the ebXML Registry work. This working group was dubbed \\"BRIM\\" – Business Registry Interface Model and the focus was Registry content assembly services and content syntax storage specifications link to BRIM reference at CEFACT. In addition the BRIM work was also positioned to enable core component message assembly (CCMA) for business processes. The work was moved into OASIS at the end of 2002 to better facilitate the necessary XML development. Implementations and deployments of CAM V1.1 are in progress as of this writing (January-2009) including open source solutions using Java and XSLT.  Versions of CAM  * CAM 1.1 was adopted as an OASIS Standard in June 2007. * Current work is continuing on refining and extending toward a new V1.5 release in 2009 mainly focusing on clarifications, corrections and limited extensions. The core role of CAM remains the same – defining, composing and validating XML content. The CAM template syntax for scripting is designed to be obvious, human readable and declarative.  CAM building blocks  CAM is built upon a number of existing standards: ; Extensible Markup Language (XML): CAM templates are expressed in a standardized XML ; XML Schema: CAM provides an abstraction layer for XSD schema that makes manipulating and defining business information exchange templates significantly easier than using just XSD schema alone XML Schema. ; XPath V2.0: CAM uses XPath extensively for defining rules and path target expressions that are at the heart of the CAM validator processing. ; XSLT scripting: the existing open source solutions leverage XSLT extensively. ; electronic business XML(ebXML): core components and registry concepts developed for ebXML (ISO15000) provide significant conceptual foundations to the CAM approach to content assembly. = CAM templates = A CAM template consists of four core sections. The header section, the structure section, and business rules section and the extensions section. These can be summarized in XML syntax as: The purpose of the Header section is to declare properties and parameters for the CAM process to reference. The purpose of the AssemblyStructure section is to capture the required content structure or structures that are needed for the particular business information exchange. Once the assembly structure(s) have been defined, then the next step is to define the context rules that apply to that content. The technique used is to identify a part of the structure by pointing to it using an XPath target locator reference, and then also applying an assertion using one of the structure predicates provided for that purpose. There are two sections to these business context rules, default rules normally apply, and conditional rules that only apply if a particular rule block evaluates to true. Rules are expressed using XPath 2.0 syntax along with an additional set of structure predicates that CAM provides that simplify the control over the structure and its information content model. CAM function predicates include:\` excludeAttribute(), useAttribute() excludeElement(), useChoice() excludeTree(), useElement() makeOptional(), useTree() makeMandatory(), useAttributeByID() makeRepeatable(), useChoiceByID() setChoice(), useElementByID() setId(), useTreeByID() setLength(), startBlock() setLimit(), endBlock() setValue(), checkCondition() setDateMask(), makeRecursive() setStringMask(), setUID() setNumberMask(), restrictValues() datatype() or setDataType(), restrictValuesByUID() setRequired(), orderChildren() allowNulls(), setDefault() setNumberRange()\` The Extension section then allows for the definition of miscellaneous items such as code list values. For more details on the CAM template approach see the formal OASIS standard specification OASIS CAM v1.1 standard = Canonical XML dictionaries = The CAM specification is being extended to include canonical XML dictionaries to support Content Assembly using blueprint templates and xslt expander tools. Examples of these include NIEM domain dictionaries and OASIS EDXL and EML dictionaries. For overview of these capabilities see OASIS CAM Blueprints and Dictionaries Quick Guide = Schema models = The CAM template format also supports the generation of structure component models such as UML/XMI and mind maps. This is achieved via a xslt transformation that renders the CAM template structure, rules and documentation components into the XMI or MM model formats.

It forms the boundary between the counties of Brecknockshire (currently administered as part of the unitary authority of Powys) and Carmarthenshire and, downstream of Ystradowen, between Brecknockshire and Glamorgan (and unitary authorities of Powys and Neath Port Talbot). Name The name derives from Welsh afon / 'river' and twrch / 'boar'. In common with other rivers sharing the same name, it is believed to refer to the burrowing or snouting action of the waters of the river.Owen, H.W. & Morgan, R. 2007 'Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales' Gomer Press, Ceredigion The river has also been associated with the legend of Twrch Trwyth. Geography The headwaters arise on the southern slopes of Bannau Sir Gaer (Carmarthen Fans) and Fan Brycheiniog and are soon joined by the waters of the Twrch Fechan. The river flows south-west and then south and finally south-east for about 14 km / 9 miles to its confluence with the River Tawe at Ystalyfera. Significant tributaries include the Nant Gwys and the Nant Llynfell.Ordnance Survey Explorer map OL12 'Brecon Beacons National Park: western area' Settlements on the lower section of the river include Ystradowen, Cwm-twrch-uchaf, Cwm-twrch- isaf and Gurnos. A colliery was established at Henllys Vale (OS grid ref SN762137) from which tramroads ran down the valley to Cwm-twrch-isaf. A tall brick chimney is the most impressive of the remains of several buildings associated with the former colliery.

The practice was employed by the IDF during the 2008–2009 Gaza War, Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014 to target the homes of police officers or Hamas political or military leaders. History As early as 2006 the IDF had the practice of warning the inhabitants of a building that was about to be attacked. Archived version 2009-01-29 Roof knocking was used during the 2008–2009 Gaza War, Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014. In the six months prior to its use, Israel collected data on Hamas members, which they used to issue warnings. Typically, Israeli intelligence officers and Shin Bet security servicemen contacted residents of a building in which they suspected storage of military assets and told them that they had 10–15 minutes to flee the attack, Archived version 2009-01-29 although in some cases the delay has been as little as five minutes. =Adoption by the U.S. military= In 2016, it was published that the US military adopted the Israeli battlefield tactic in its war against the so-called Islamic State or ISIS. It was used in an attack against an ISIS storage facility in Mosul, Iraq. As women and children lived in the house, a Hellfire missile was initially shot at the roof as a warning. Defiance In some cases, residents who were warned about an impending bombing climbed up voluntarily to their roofs to show they would not leave. When Nizar Rayan, a top Hamas military commander, was warned but didn't leave his home, he and his family of 15 were killed in the subsequent bombing. When faced with similar situations, IDF commanders have either bombed, called off the bombing or launched a warning missile at empty areas of the roof, in order to frighten the people gathered on the roof into leaving the building. The New York Times stated that according to Israel, Hamas asked residents to stand on the roofs of buildings to dissuade Israeli pilots from attacking their homes. These claims are supported by video footage of an interview with Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri. However, Amnesty International argued that Hamas' purported call may have been \\"motivated by a desire to avoid further panic\\" among civilians, considering both the lack of shelters in Gaza and the fact that some civilians who heeded the IDF's warnings had been casualties of Israeli attacks. Many reporters, including from the BBC, The Independent, and The Guardian have said that they have found no evidence of Hamas forcing Palestinians to stay and become unwilling human shields. Controversy The practice has been controversial, as many human rights and news organizations have shown the 'roof knocks' to kill and injure civilians. In July, 2014, Amnesty International called for a United Nations investigation into what it alleged were war crimes committed by Israeli fighters, and Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Programme Director for the organization, condemned the practice. The spokesperson for Gaza Health Ministry indicated that the same missiles used to give warnings are also used in assassinations, resulting in dozens of casualties and deaths where \\"remains were scattered, making it impossible to identify them immediately\\". The Goldstone Report commented that civilians inside their homes \\"cannot be expected to know whether a small explosion is a warning of an impending attack or part of an actual attack\\". It stated that the practice is not an effective advance warning, and is instead likely to \\"cause terror and confuse the affected civilians\\". According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, the warning of inhabitants by Israeli forces is psychological warfare, and after the first week of the Operation Cast Lead offensive, only 37 houses had been destroyed despite hundreds of warning calls, while no one can advise people not to take the threats seriously. In other cases, houses in Gaza Strip were bombed without any warning. For example, on July 12, 2014, an Israeli airstrike without any warning on the home of Gaza's police chief, Tayseer Al-Batsh, and a nearby mosque as evening prayers ended, killed 18 civilians, including children, and injured 45 others. The Israeli Government stated \\"While these warnings, could not eliminate all harm to civilians, they were frequently effective,\\" and that aerial video surveillance by IDF forces showed civilians departing from targeted areas prior to an attack as a direct result of the warnings. According to the Israeli army, striking homes suspected of storing weapons, when sufficient warning is given to the residents, falls within the boundaries of international law and is legitimate. In November 2014, the most senior US military official, General Martin Dempsey, cited \\"roof knocking\\" as an example where Israel \\"did some extraordinary things to limit civilian casualties\\" during Operation Protective Edge. Amnesty International has reported in a statement that it \\"does not have evidence at this point\\" that Palestinian civilians have been intentionally used by Hamas or Palestinian armed groups during the current hostilities to \\"shield\\" specific locations or military personnel or equipment from Israeli attacks\\". It additionally said that \\"public statements referring to entire areas are not the same as directing specific civilians to remain in their homes as \\"human shields\\" for fighters, munitions, or military equipment\\" and that \\"even if officials or fighters from Hamas or Palestinian armed groups ... did in fact direct civilians to remain in a specific location in order to shield military objectives ..., all of Israel's obligations to protect these civilians would still apply.\\" Human Rights Watch said many of the attacks on civilian targets appeared to be \\"disproportionate\\" and \\"indiscriminate\\". Salah Abdul Ati, the directory of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights in Gaza, described the \\"policy of destroying homes\\" a war crime and accused Israel of attempting to circumvent international law to avoid accountability. Marouf Hasian Jr., a professor of Communication at the University of Utah, describes the talk of the \\"beneficent usage\\" of \\"knock on roof\\" tactics as one that \\"plays well in front of American or Israeli audiences who feel that older Geneva Convention rules are too 'quaint' and too solicitous of the rights of civilians who may be aiding and abetting terrorist, but it infuriates critics who argue that satellite surveillance is being used in discriminatory systems that assume that homes of police officers or Hamas political or military leaders can be \\"precisely\\" targeted to minimize collateral damage\\".

These five were the progenitors of the Midianites.Charles B. Williams, \\"Ephah.\\" International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (1906). Ephah is mentioned again in Isaiah 60:6 as a transporter of gold and frankincense from Sheba, who shall thus bring enlargement to Judah and praise to Yahweh. Ephah is described as a land whence dromedaries would come to Israel: \\"A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah.\\" The tribe of Ephah is mentioned in inscriptions of the 8th-century BC Assyrian kings Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II, making it the only tribe of the Midianites to be attested outside of the Bible.Wayne T. Pitard, \\"Midian\\", in Bruce M. Metzger and Michael D. Coogan (eds.), The Oxford Companion to the Bible (Oxford University Press, 1993). Tiglath-Pileser's inscription calls them Ḫa- a-a-ap-pa-a-a, Sargon's Ḫa-ia-pa-a. This is consistent with the original Hebrew implied by the Septuagint, , Ghaiphah. Alongside the Adbeel, Massa, Tema and Sheba, they submitted to Tiglath-Pileser and paid tribute after a military campaign in southern Palestine. In the Annals of Sargon II, they are mentioned alongside the Thamūd, Marsimani and Ibadidi as those defeated by the Assyrians and exiled to Samaria in 716. Ephah is the only name common to both lists. Since the tribes mentioned by Sargon lay at a greater distance from Palestine than those in Tiglath-Pileser's inscription, it can be surmised that the Ephah were the closest to Palestine of these Arabian tribes. Presumably, they lived along the incense trade route, hence the reference to trade in Isaiah.

Life and works Pandolfi was born in Montepulciano in 1624, where he was baptised on 27 November, the second son of Giovanni Battista Pandolfi and the fourth son of his father's second wife, Verginia Bartalini, the widow of Mario Mealli. His name at baptism was Domenico; it would appear that he adopted the names Giovanni Antonio on entering religious orders at some stage of his life. His father was the servant of a lawyer. Pandolfi's stepbrother Lorenzo, at the age of around 8, had become a castrato singer at the court of Krakow. Another stepbrother, Giovan Battista Mealli, became a singer in Venice, where Domenico and the rest of the family joined him around 1630 following the death of old Pandolfi.Longo (2014). The annals of the court of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria in Innsbruck record that Giovanni Antonio Pandolfi Mealli was employed at the court in 1660. He is believed to have trained as a musician in Perugia. He moved to Innsbruck in 1652, and his sonatas Opp. 2 and 3 are dedicated to other court musicians there, many of whom were Italian.Manze (1999), pp. 4–5. He left Innsbruck in 1662, and then took a position in Messina.Manze (1999), p. 6. Of Pandolfi's works, his two collections of sonatas for violin and harpsichord (Op. 3 and Op. 4) published 1660 and his trio sonatas (Sonate Cioè Balletti) published 1669 have survived; they are at the Civic Museum of Bologna. No trace is known of Pandolfi's Opp. 1 and 2.Manze (1999), p. 4. The violinist Andrew Manze believes the 1669 sonatas may be the work of another composer of a similar name,Manze (1999), p. 6. although the music historian David McCormick argues for their common authorship. He points out that Pandolfi is named on the title page of the 1669 sonatas (although without the additional surname Mealli) as a musician of Messina, and that the 1669 sonatas are named after court musicians of that city; one of them to the castrato Giovanni Marquett, whom Pandolfi was to murder a few years later.McCormick (2011), pp. 4, 18. Pandolfi killed Marquett in Messina on 21 December 1675 following a political argument in the Duomo. Pandolfi is described in a contemporary chronicle as a \\"priest of Montepulciano\\", and Marquett as \\"an impertinent layman and eunuch\\". It reports that Pandolfi had seized Marquett's sword and killed him with it. After this Pandolfi fled first either to France or Catania, and then to Spain, where he was employed from 1678 in the Royal Chapel. He visited Rome in 1679. In 1682 he is reported as living in the household of the Papal nuncio in Madrid, Savo Mellini.McCormick (2011), p. 18. There are no references to him after the year 1687, which may be the year of his death. Legacy Manze expresses the opinion that the influence of Pandolfi's works can be detected in the sonatas of Arcangelo Corelli and others.Manze (1999), pp. 5–6.

Recorded in 1970 at Randy's recording studio in Kingston, it was produced by Lee Perry and written by regular Upsetter musician Glen Adams. It originally was released as a single in Jamaica and has appeared on various compilations such as Songs of Freedom. Because it is based on a ghost rumor, the song has lyrics and instrumentals based on a spooky style. The instrumental is called \\"Dracula\\". The song has been featured on a few Halloween albums, and has a remix with DJ Spooky. The song's music sampled Jackie Mittoo's \\"Peenie Wallie\\".  Background  The theme of the song relates to a rumor that was spreading through Jamaica that a duppy, or ghost, had been spotted in numerous locations speeding through the land on a three-wheeled coffin, perched upon which were three John crows, or buzzards, one of which could talk and was asking for a Mr. Brown. Glen Adams wrote the lyrics after hearing the story, and after Lee Perry's suggestion, was sung by The Wailers.Katz, David (2006). People Funny Boy: The Genius of Lee Scratch Perry, pp. 117-18. Omnibus Press, Worldwide.  Composition  The song is played in the key of C# major and is mostly based around the chord progression (I-IV-V-IV) with an A# minor bridge.

Habitat  It lives among the stones of the walls of the terraces and in crevices of limestone rocks. It loves the light and supports a few hours of sunshine in the early hours and tangential final hours of the day. It hates the rain directly on its fronds, preferring the moisture comes to its roots through the soil soaked by seepage of rainwater. For this usually grow well inside the crevices of the rocks and between the stones of the walls of the terraces, where no rain falls over.

With his advisor Mark Jerrum, Sinclair investigated the mixing behaviour of Markov chains to construct approximation algorithms for counting problems such as the computing the permanent, with applications in diverse fields such as matching algorithms, geometric algorithms, mathematical programming, statistics, physics-inspired applications and dynamical systems. This work has been highly influential in theoretical computer science and was recognised with the Gödel Prize in 1996. A refinement of these methods led to a fully polynomial time randomised approximation algorithm for computing the permanent, for which Sinclair and his co-authors received the Fulkerson Prize in 2006.2006 Fulkerson Prize citation, Notices of the AMS, December 2006, volume 53, number 11 \\\\- \\"Fulkerson Prize\\" Computational Complexity.

Service history The vessel was constructed by Versatile Pacific Shipyards at their yard in Vancouver, British Columbia with the yard number 557. The ship entered service with the Canadian Coast Guard in October 1990 but was not completed until December 1991. Named for Gordon Reid, a British Columbian who was famous along the British Columbia Coast for his knowledge of the area, the ship is registered in Ottawa, Ontario but homeported at the Coast Guard base at Victoria, British Columbia. Ordered by the Canadian Coast Guard to replace the older R-class cutters in the Western Region, Gordon Reid is used for fisheries patrol and search and rescue. In October 2014 the Russian container ship lost the use of its engines near environmentally sensitive Haida Gwaii. Gordon Reid was the first vessel to try to tow the disabled vessel to keep the container ship from running aground. However, Gordon Reids own engines were not powerful enough. The American ocean-going tugboat Barbara Foss was dispatched from nearby Prince Rupert, British Columbia to tow the disabled Russian vessel. In November 2015, the American-flagged cargo ship North Star lost power while transiting from Anchorage, Alaska to Tacoma, Washington. Gordon Reid was deployed to aid the ship, but North Star managed to get her engines going again and arrived in port without assistance.

(Worthy) Williams (May 5, 1894 - December 14, 1968) was an American Democratic Party politician who was the first African-American woman elected to the New Jersey Legislature. Early life and career Williams was born in Brunswick, Georgia, in 1894, the daughter of Josephine Frances (Jenkins) and Ephraim Wilford Worthy. She attended an all-black public elementary school and Selden Normal School in Brunswick, and then studied at Atlanta University for one year. In 1917 her family moved to Trenton, New Jersey, where she attended the State Normal School (now The College of New Jersey) as an extension student. She taught in the Trenton school system for eight years. She met Samuel A. Williams, a Newark post office worker, and they were married in New York City on April 2, 1926. Their only child, Samuel Alexander, was born on February 15, 1927. After their son's birth, the Williams family moved to East Orange. She became active in civic and church activities, as well as becoming youth division adviser and board member of the local branch of the NAACP. Her husband was a member of the national board of the NAACP and was New Jersey state president. Williams volunteered for the YWCA of The Oranges and Maplewood and served in several leadership capacities. She was one of the organizers of the East Orange League of Women Voters, serving as its vice president in 1947. In 1952, Governor Alfred Driscoll appointed her to the New Jersey Migrant Labor Board. Political career Through her work on the Migrant Labor Board Williams became interested in politics. In 1957 she was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, becoming the first African-American woman elected to either house of the state legislature. She was reelected in 1959. In the Assembly she focused on child welfare, child labor, juvenile delinquency, and migrant labor legislation. In 1960 she was elected Essex County Registrar, and was reelected in 1965. She was an alternate delegate to the 1960 Democratic National Convention and vice chairwoman of the delegation at the 1964 Convention in Atlantic City. In 1961 she was involved in a widely publicized dispute over segregated hotel accommodations at the Civil War Centennial Commission meeting in Charleston, South Carolina, commemorating the opening shots of the Civil War at Fort Sumter one hundred years earlier. Williams attended as a member of the New Jersey delegation, but she was denied accommodations at the Francis Marion Hotel, where the meeting was to take place. President John F. Kennedy, an ex officio member of the commission, supported the protest. The commission's executive committee originally refused to change the venue for the meeting, but eventually bowed to White House pressure and moved its sessions to the Charleston Naval Base. Williams died in 1968 at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge.

It was endemic to the island of Huahine, in the Society Islands of French Polynesia, and therefore had the easternmost distribution of all Aplonis species in the Pacific region. History The Huahine starling is known only by a subfossil tarsometatarsus unearthed in 1984 by American archaeologist and anthropologist Yosihiko H. Sinoto of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. It was found at the archaeological site of Fa'ahia in the north of Huahine and scientifically described by David Steadman in 1989. The bone is 38 mm long. Comparison with the tarsometatarsi of other Aplonis species shows that the Huahine starling was the second largest Aplonis species (the largest being the Samoan starling Aplonis atrifusca). The bones from the Fa'ahia site are from between 750 and 1250 CE. The extinction of this species is possibly a result of the early settlement of Huahine; forests were cleared, non-native plants were introduced and non- native birds as well as the Pacific rat became established there. The find of the Huahine starling bone is considered important in paleornithological circles because it has expanded our knowledge of the genus Aplonis and its biogeographical history. According to David Steadman it is possible that the 1774 painting by Georg Forster which depicts a mysterious bird from the island of Raiatea (formerly known as Ulieta) is not of a thrush or a honeyeater, as previously hypothesised, but of a relative of the Huahine starling. This suggests that Aplonis starlings may once have had a more extensive range in the Society Islands. References *David W.

The strike lasted from 8 to 27 May 1974. The 20 day strike by 1.7 million (17 lakh) workers is the largest recorded industrial action in the world. Reasons for the strike The strike was held to demand an eight- hour working day for locomotive staff by All India Railway Mens federation and a raise in pay scale, which had remained stagnant over many years, in spite of the fact that pay scales of other government owned entities had risen over the years. Furthermore, since British times the Railways termed the work of the locomotive staff as \\"continuous\\", implying that workers would have to remain at work as long as the train ran on its trip, often for several days at a stretch. The independence of India did not change this. The eight hour work day had not been implemented in Indian railways by the Railway Board, a quasi government bureaucracy despite having become a free country in 1947, this had led to dissatisfaction among labour, especially locomotive Pilots. Traditional railway union leaders too were starting to get distant from worker demands and closer instead to politicians, thus leading to further discord. The spread of diesel engines and the consequent intensification of work in the Indian Railways since the 1960s resulted in continuous working hours being extended by days, creating much resentment among the workers. The Railways, although government-owned, remained an organization in which the accepted worldwide standard of an eight-hour working day was violated with impunity. When the crafts unions raised the issue, they demanded a 12-hour working day for loco running staff. This led to railway strikes by rail workers across the country in 1967, 1968, 1970 and 1973, finally leading to the 1974 strike which was participated in by 70% of the permanent work force of railways. This was not the first railways strike in India, the earliest having occurred in British India in 1862 in Howrah, and a number of strikes having occurred in the private railway companies that operated in British India, most of them becoming part of the Indian freedom struggle.Chronicle of Strike As President of the All India Railwaymen's Federation, George Fernandes led the strike. Culmination The strike commenced on 8 May 1974. The strike was brutally suppressed by Indira Gandhi government with thousands being sent to jail and losing their jobs. The strike was called off on 27 May 1974.

The scale of harmonics is a musical scale based on the noded positions of the natural harmonics existing on a string. This musical scale is present on the guqin, regarded as one of the first string instruments with a musical scale.Yin, Wei. Zhongguo Qinshi Yanyi 【中国琴史演义】 (Chinese). Pages 1-10. Most fret positions appearing on Non-Western string instruments (lutes) are equal to positions of this scale. Unexpectedly, these fret positions are actually the corresponding undertones of the overtones from the harmonic series. The distance from the nut to the fret is an integer number lower than the distance from the fret to the bridge (see: superparticular number). Origin On the guqin, the left end of the dotted scale is a mirror image of the right end. The instrument is played with flageolet tones (harmonics) as well as pressing the strings on the wood. The flageolets appear on the harmonic positions of the overtone series, therefore these positions are marked as the musical scale of this instrument. The flageolet positions also represent the harmonic consonant relation of the pressed string part with the open string, similar to the calculations Pythagoras did on his monochord. The guqin has one anomaly in its scale. The guqin scale represents the first six harmonics and the eighth harmonic. The seventh harmonic is left out. However this tone is still consonant related to the open string (otherwise it would not be a harmonic) and has a lesser consonant relation to all other harmonic positions. This is the main reason all the ratios of the sevenths family (7:1, 7:2, 7:3, 7:4, 7:5 and 7:6) also often are not present in other musical scales like for instance the just intoned major and minor scale or the major scale in the Pythagorean tuning. Related Vietnamese scale of harmonics on c. A Vietnamese monochord, called the đàn bầu, also functions with the scale of harmonics. On this instrument only the right half (from the view of the musician) of the scale is present up to the limit of the first seven overtones (see 7-limit). The dots are on the string lengths , , , , , of the whole string length. The reason for this half scale is because the left half creates the same tones as the right half when played as a flageolet tone and therefore the extra dots on the left half are useless for how this instrument is played. The scale of harmonics was, together with the book of Helmholtz an inspiration for Harry Partch to switch to just intonation and alternate tuning systems to create more consonant music than possible with the equal temperament. Partch's tone selection otonality from his utonality and otonality concept are the complement pitches of the overtones. For instance: the frequency ratio 5:4 is equal to of the string length and is the complement of , the position of the fifth harmonic (and the fourth overtone). The Norwegian composer Eivind Groven also wrote a thesis on the scale of harmonics, claiming this to be the oldest usable scale, frequent in Norwegian folk music, and seemingly in other folk musical traditions as well. Groven used the seljefløyte as basis for his research. The flute uses only the upper harmonic scale. The scale is also present on the Moodswinger. Although this functions quite differently than a Guqin, oddly enough the scale occurs on this instrument while it is not played in a just intonation tuning but a regular equal temperament.

His metal, fiberglass and stone sculptures have won him international acclaim, though in recent years his drawings have gained recognition.Chandran T. Payyanur, N.N. Rimzon, Kashi Art Gallery, 2005  Career  Rimzon studied sculpture at the College of Fine Arts, Thiruvananthapuram. He studied at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, where he was considered among the best of the upcoming generation of artists that stemmed from MSU luminaries such as Jyoti Bhatt and Bhupen Khakhar.Ashish Radadhyaksha, Contemporary Art In Baroda, Tulika Publishers, 1997, In 1989 he earned his MA with distinction from the Royal College of Art, London. N. N. Rimzon's work has been featured in solo and group exhibitions worldwide and can be found in the collections of The National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi and Mumbai, the Talwar Gallery in New York City and New Delhi, The Foundation for Indian Artists in Amsterdam, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney.Anoop Skaria and Dorrie Younger, N.N. Rimzon, Kashi Art Gallery, 2005  Works  Born in the Indian state of Kerala, Rimzon's artistic vocabulary finds root in symbols derived from the rural landscape of southern India: the village compound, the palm tree, the temple, the forest pathway and the handmade canoe. In Rimzon's drawings he develops the themes that are found in his sculpture. Charcoal and dry pastel is used with a simple grace of line to create an often eerie and evocative stillness. This pristine tranquility seems to be intruded upon by symbols such as the sword and the felled tree. A sense of tragedy or alienation underlies depictions of what might otherwise be thought to be rural idylls. Rimzon's later works seem as much concerned with ecological threats as with communal aggression.Karen Miller-Lewis, Back to Nature, Art India, Quarter III, 2007 As a young man Rimzon experienced the political upheaval that accompanied Indira Gandhi’s Emergency during the mid-1970s. This was one factor that moved him away from narrative painting to experimentation with conceptually motivated sculpture. Rimzon concentrated on themes that depicted humanity's entrapment and anguish in a hostile environment that was of man's own making. In The Inner Voice (1992), a sculpted nude figure, cast in fiberglass, is displayed with its back against the wall and surrounded by a semicircle of cast iron swords. In Speaking Stones (1998), a crouching nude figure uses its hands to both hold its head and shield its eyes. The figure is surrounded by naturally sharp stones, which rest on photographs depicting massacres, demolitions, and other acts of communal violence that have been part of India's more recent history. His most recent show at Talwar Gallery in New Delhi, The Round Ocean and the Living Death, is a continuation of his career's effort to unite the beautiful traditions of India to the complexities of its modern life through an artistic language. The sculpture the show is named after depicts mother-goddess figure seated at the center of a circle representing a quiet power. Rimzon's work requires no prerequisites for engagement, but rather speaks to an older and deeper level of humanity.

Testosterone is a male hormone that promotes growth of many prostate tumours and therefore reducing circulating testosterone to very low (castration) levels is often the treatment goal in the management of advanced prostate cancer. Degarelix has an immediate onset of action, binding to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the pituitary gland and blocking their interaction with GnRH. This induces a fast and profound reduction in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and in turn, testosterone suppression. Medical uses The GnRH antagonist degarelix, through its ability to reduce serum testosterone, is used to treat hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Side effects As with all hormonal therapies, degarelix is commonly associated with hormonal side effects such as hot flashes and weight gain. Due to its mode of administration (subcutaneous injection), degarelix is also associated with injection-site reactions such as injection-site pain, erythema or swelling. Injection-site reactions are usually mild or moderate in intensity and occur predominantly after the first dose, decreasing in frequency thereafter. Less common: Anemia. Diarrhea, nausea. Hyperhidrosis including night sweats, rash. Gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, erectile dysfunction. Increased transaminases. Musculoskeletal pain and discomfort. Dizziness, headache. Insomnia. Weight gain. Chills, fever, fatigue, flu-like illness. Pharmacology GnRH antagonists (receptor blockers) such as degarelix are synthetic peptide derivatives of the natural GnRH decapeptide – a hormone that is made by neurons in the hypothalamus. GnRH antagonists compete with natural GnRH for binding to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. This reversible binding blocks the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary. The reduction in LH subsequently leads to a rapid and sustained suppression of testosterone release from the testes and subsequently reduces the size and growth of the prostate cancer. This in turn results in a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the patient's blood. Measuring PSA levels helps to monitor how patients with prostate cancer are responding to treatment. Unlike GnRH agonists, which cause an initial stimulation of the hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA), leading to a surge in testosterone levels, and under certain circumstances, a flare-up of the tumour, GnRH antagonists do not cause a surge in testosterone or clinical flare. Clinical flare is a phenomenon that occurs in patients with advanced disease, which can precipitate a range of clinical symptoms such as bone pain, urethral obstruction, and spinal cord compression. Drug agencies have issued boxed warnings regarding this phenomenon in the prescribing information for GnRH agonists. As testosterone surge does not occur with GnRH antagonists, there is no need for patients to receive an antiandrogen as flare protection during prostate cancer treatment. GnRH agonists also induce an increase in testosterone levels after each reinjection of the drug – a phenomenon that does not occur with GnRH antagonists such as degarelix. GnRH antagonists have an immediate onset of action leading to a fast and profound suppression of testosterone and are therefore especially valuable in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer where fast control of disease is needed. History In December 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved degarelix for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer in the United States. It was subsequently approved by the European Commission at the recommendation of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in February 2009, for use in adult males with advanced, hormone-dependent prostate cancer. Ferring Pharmaceuticals markets the drug under the name Firmagon. Research Degarelix is studied for use as a chemical castration agent on sex offenders in Sweden. A study published on April 29, 2020 in JAMA Psychiatry demonstrated a reduced the risk score for committing child sexual abuse in men with pedophilic disorder 2 weeks after initial injection.

At the time the Communist Party was seeking legal recognition, but the state authorities had instead decided to register a bogus 'Iraqi Communist Party' headed by Daud as-Sayegh. As-Sayegh had demanded that Adil, al-Haidari and Amir Abdullah be expelled from the Iraqi Communist Party as a condition for a merger with his party (which would have given the Communist Party legal status). In the end a settlement was reached (with as-Sayegh unofficially bargaining on behalf of the then government), al-Haidari and Abdullah were relieved of their party duties due to 'health reasons' and exit visas were provided (through as-Sayegh's government contacts) for them to travel to Moscow. In Moscow they joined Adil, who had already been sent there for medical treatment. Still, the merger between the Communist Party and as- Sayegh's party failed to go through for other reasons.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq.

It is part of the Bartlett Independent School District located in Bell County just north of the Bell-Williamson county line, and is classified as a 1A school by the UIL. In 2013, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency. History The school was established in 1916 by Mr V.I. Moore, superintendent from 1916 to 1925, who left Bartlett to assume a faculty position at the University Of Texas. Mr Swope, chief administrator from 1948 to 1966, retired after overseeing the construction of the 1974 high school building. The Old High School was built in 1917, at a cost of approximately $20,000. The auditorium and additional classrooms were added in 1924 at a cost of about $40,000. The class of 1918 was the first to graduate from the building and from Bartlett High School; the class of 1966 was the last to graduate from the old high school. Students moved to a new school building in 1966 when Bartlett High School consolidated with the Bartlett Colored School. In 2000, the newest building was built, and it is still the only high school in Bartlett. Bartlett High School has historically had acceptable ratings on the State Mandated test (TAKS). Bartlett Independent school district motto is, \\"We Are the Bulldog pack listen to us bark, be kind, accept responsibility, respect each other, keep doing your best, woof woof woof.\\"  Student body/demographics  The Bartlett High School student body is 56% Hispanic, 34% African American, 10% Caucasian and 4% Other.  Academics  Bartlett High School has usually done very well academically. It had acceptable ratings on the TAKS Test in 2007 and 2008. In the past few years, more and more students from Bartlett are being accepted into Division I universities and colleges.  Programs  Bartlett High School has several programs including S.T.A.R.S. program, UIL programs, One Act Play Club, Spanish Club, Entomology Team, FFA and much more. The Bartlett FFA Club has been successful in many ways at the Bell County Youth Fair. Bartlett also has a business club that allows many students to go on to get scholarships.

Southeast Asian issues  By mid-2008 the North-South Corridor segment of the Asian Highway, AH-3, was nearly fully paved, with only a few kilometers incomplete. The North-South Corridor Project has been part of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) agenda since 1993 and aimed to improve the connected economies of China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. The portion of the North-South Corridor known as Highway 3, which runs through northwestern Laos and connects China and Thailand, was expected to cost US$95.8 million and was being financed with a loan from the ADB, along with funds from the Chinese, Thai and Lao governments. The completed sections of the road have gone from being little more than dirt roads a few years ago to two-lane routes with concrete shoulders, drainage and concrete bridges. The journey from the Lao border town of Huai Xai to the southwestern Chinese border village of Boten situated in southwestern Yunnan province took as long as two days on the old mostly dirt road depending on weather conditions. The new roadway shortened that trip to five to six hours. The route was expected to be completed in 2007, but damage to the road from floods during the 2006 rainy season pushed the completion date into 2008. While the road was now made passable all year, there are still sections, some of several kilometers in length, which remained unfinished as of 2008. = Missing link in Southeast Asia = Construction of the Thai-built portion of the road lagged behind that of the Chinese section, but some observers contend that was because the Thai section was \\"much better constructed\\". They indicated that the Chinese side was built faster because of engineering shortcuts which may make that section of the road less durable. The most significant problem with the corridor was the lack of progress on the Fourth Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge to be built across the Mekong River connecting the Thai town of Chiang Khong, with its cross-border neighbour of Ban Houayxay in Laos. The Chinese and Thai governments earlier agreed to build the bridge and share the estimated US$33 million cost of the project. It was finally opened on December 11, 2013. Thai border disputes with Laos, the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, political indifference in Bangkok and a general reluctance on the part of Thais kept the project on the political 'back burner'. China meanwhile is anxious to develop its land-locked Yunnan province through the creation of trade links with Southeast Asia, including access to Thailand's sea ports. While Thailand may benefit broadly from a new road link with China, others feared a flood of inexpensive Chinese products will impoverish northern Thais. Some of those fears came to pass with the early implementation of some provisions with the Chinese-Thai free trade agreement, which resulted in a flood of inexpensive Chinese agricultural products. As of 2008, the last incomplete link to Laos represented a significant barrier to efficient trade between the two countries and some commented that was the reason for Thai procrastination on the bridge's completion. Bangkok might also have been using the bridge as a bargaining chip for trade negotiations with Beijing, since the Chinese appeared to increasingly value the route's completion. Until the bridge's completion in December 2013, the portion of the AH-3 North-South Corridor remained both incomplete and inefficient. As of 2008, Chinese goods destined for Thailand had to be ferried across the Mekong River between Chiang Khong and Huay Xai and many shippers have expressed their concerns that the ferry costs and Lao customs duties were too expensive, and traders also complained about the lengthy time required for Lao customs procedures and inspections. The bridge opened to the public on December 11, 2013.Wanwisa Ngamsangchaikit, \\"4th Friendship bridge opens\\" TTR Weekly 2013-12-12Des Ball and Jessada Burinsuchat, \\"New Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge across the Mekong\\" 2013-08-21 Although Laos was pressured to eliminate transit taxes, the cash-short government remained hesitant, in part because China and Thailand were seen to benefit disproportionately from the completed roadway. Currently almost all China-Thailand trade is conducted by shipping up and down the Mekong River, with goods taking from 10 to 15 days to reach their destination. As of 2008 the water route were suffering from frequent problems of inadequate levels to keep large cargo barges afloat, a situation which is likely to occur more frequently when more of China's planned dams on the river's upper reaches become functional in the future. The economic benefits of the roadway to Laos, meanwhile, are still undetermined. = Southeast Asian development issues = While the AH-3 highway was expected to increase business and trade through increased market access to both China and Thailand, including the country's agribusiness and tourism sectors, the Lao government appeared more open to increasing state revenues through the collection of transit fees and taxes on goods that arrived at its borders. It was also under pressure from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to embed new costs into the already low intra-regional trade. According to people involved in the tourism industry in northwestern Laos, while Western tourists were arriving in increasing numbers, tourists from neighbouring Thailand and China often only pass through Laos on their way to Boten on the Chinese border, where there is a large casino and a market. In addition to reaping less economic benefits, Laos will also likely have to deal with disproportionate social and environmental costs, people monitoring the project say. Without proper control mechanisms in place, the region's opening would disproportionately benefit government-connected business groups while displacing large numbers of the non-ethnic Lao groups currently living in the area. A 2002 ADB report estimated that approximately 2,500 people (500 households) might have to be relocated due to the road project; some monitoring groups put the real number much higher. Although resettlement plans were drafted by the ADB to compensate for the loss of houses, land, rice granaries and shops, it was not clear that the funds were truly reaching the people most affected. Among the issues involved was the resettlement of the original Lao inhabitants of Boten village near the Chinese border, who were moved a kilometer or more down the road to allow the construction of a new Chinese-owned casino, hotel and other commercial developments. The resettled Botens complained that their new site lacked services, and that the land set aside for them was smaller and less fertile than their original land. As well, others complained about rampant land grabs adjacent to the new road by government-connected traders and businessmen who established shops and other businesses on the new prime real estate. A lack of formal land deeds or proper court systems meant there was little justice available to the displaced residents. The legal vacuum also allowed an increasing flow of Chinese migrants, many of whom first arrived to work on the road and who then stayed on to establish businesses along the road, including whole new villages, which further aggravated those previously resettled to less fertile land. Rights groups were also concerned with the remote area's rapid development resulting in increases to exposure of HIV/AIDS, human trafficking and the possible exploitation of the surrounding forests and wildlife resources. While the ADB's original hopes that the route would reduce transportation costs for the movement of vehicles, goods and people, and also promote faster economic growth, as the North-South Corridor neared completion in 2008 the real costs and benefits of the project for the local populations of Southeast Asia were still in doubt.McCartan, Brian Roadblocks on the Great Asian Highway, Asia Times website, 23 January 2008.

He lives and works in Seville Spain. He started his artistic education in 1981 at the Escuela de Artes Aplicadas y Oficios Artísticos (School of applied arts and artistic offices.) He specialized in sculpting under the auspices of the Sevillan sculptor Jesús Santos Calero. After that, he studied molding and casting with Francisco Fatuarte. Eventually he graduated in Applied arts in 1991. He perfected his modelling techniques in the workshop of the famous Sevillan sculptor Luis Alvarez Duarte. Since then he has worked independently in his own workshop. Although he has made statues of secular subjects, he is known in particular for his religious works. He has worked for several processional brotherhoods (Cofradías) in Andalusia e.g. in Seville, Almería, Cádiz, Granada, Huelva, Jaén and Málaga. He has also worked outside of Andalusia and is known especially for the statue of Our Lady of Hope in Miami and Our Lady of Warfhuizen in the Netherlands. His statue of Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden in Warfhuizen, the Netherlands has attracted a lot of attention since 2003. It has turned the hermitage chapel of Our Lady into a shrine by attracting thousands of parents worrying about their children. This all happened rather suddenly and without an apparent cause, like an apparition or a miracle. Therefore the many pilgrims themselves are sometimes (mockingly) referred to as the 'Miracle of Warfhuizen.'

It was created in January 2002 by VML Inc (Previously Studiocom) an Atlanta-based digital agency using core technology from Sulake Corporation, the company responsible for a similar popular online game called Habbo Hotel. Version 2 of the game was released in late 2004 on a new technology platform called Galapagos, created by Studiocom, and featuring new locations and a special double-reward 'Coca-Cola Red Room'. On December 6, 2007 MyCoke closed, and encouraged users to join CC-Metro, which was part of There. There was closed on March 9, 2010. The main focus of the game was to socialize, mix music, and decorate various interiors. The in- game currency was decibels, and was rewarded for doing various activities. There were various locations based on real-life cities where the user could perform music, such as San Francisco or Mexico. Coke Studios had sponsored several high-profile films and television shows, in which events and promotions would happen on the website or the client.  Gameplay  The main focus of the game was to socialize, mix music, and decorate various interiors. The in-game currency was decibels, and was rewarded for: receiving 'Thumbs Up' votes from other users whilst performing music; drinking Virtual Coca-Colas found in crates, vending machines, and refrigerators; playing other games on the Coke Studios website; and filling out surveys. There are various locations based on real-life cities where the user can perform their music, such as San Francisco, Mexico, Goa, Tokyo, and London. MyCoke's website also hosted a number of smaller games that tied into Coke Studios. Players would be represented by their avatar(called a virtual ego or V-ego) to compete either against other players or against the clock in order to earn decibels or prizes in the form of virtual furniture. The games proved to be very popular especially during times when Coke Studios was not open as well as when Coke Studios was at full capacity. The games also used a lobby system similar to Coke Studios if they involved more than one player. The games offered were: *V-ego San :V-ego San was a game of rock paper scissors set in a sumo wrestling setting, with the players dressed in sumo wrestler costumes. Players would choose a move from the available list and see if their move beat their opponent. A move that beats the other player will receive a point. However, some move combinations would result in a stalemate and give neither player a point. The player with the most points at the end of 3 rounds would win decibels and stay in the ring to face another opponent. A tie at the end of 3 rounds would result in both players going to the end of the line, as there was no sudden death situation in place. If a player won a certain number of games consecutively, they would receive a prize in the form of virtual furniture for use in Coke Studios, starting with a tatami mat and gradually getting more valuable. *Uncover The Music :Uncover The Music was a matching game played in a jungle ruins setting where players compete to uncover matching symbols that play the same small beat, such as a jungle drum. A matching pair would give the player points. There were also two special tiles: a snake which would end the player's turn and a frog which would automatically match the player's selection. The player with the most points when all tiles were matched would receive decibels for use in Coke Studios. *MyCoke Coaster :MyCoke Coaster was a roller coaster race between two teams of players involving memory and speed. Each team would be given a combination of colored levers to pull and pulling them in the right order caused the roller coaster car to move up the hill. The combination gradually got more complex each round, requiring both memorization skills and speed in order to beat the other team. The team that completed each round and got to the top of the incline first would win the game and be awarded decibels. Jairo Fula was a major contributor to the art and design of this game. *Recycler :Recycler was a single player game in a factory setting. The player would have to take pieces of furniture and maneuver around moving obstacles to reach the other side and win points. If the player hit an obstacle, they would lose what they were carrying and have to start again. The game was a race against the clock to get the most points possible. If the player got a certain number of points, they would be rewarded special themed furniture, such as a robot statue or a gear chair for use in Coke Studios. There was also a high score system for players to compare their point totals against others. *Sports Challenge Quiz Game :The trivia game was a competition between 2 players to answer questions and win points. The player with the most points at the end would receive decibels. *Pop Quiz :Pop Quiz was a 5-player game that mixed trivia questions, photo-reveal and name-that-tune with open- ended creative competition. The creativity culminated in a rap battle. All players were given the same three lines from a fictional rhyme and each composed a fourth line to complete the quatrain. In the open-ended competition the players vote for the best line - but they cannot vote for themselves. This game was principally developed by GamesThatWork, including trivia content by Gerri Miller. Sponsors Coke Studios had sponsored several high-profile films and television shows including: Shark Tale in October 2004; American Idol in April 2005; Batman Begins in June 2005; American Idol in 2006; and FIFA in June 2006. During these sponsorships, the in-game client released furniture advertising such shows. The Shark Tale sponsorship changed the entire game, turning every avatar into fish in the style of the characters in the movie, and the rooms were underwater themed. There were also new minigames to be played.  Fan Remake  CaveJam is a growing multiplayer fan-remake with Coke Studios rooms, items, avatars, and user interface. It contains additional features which did not exist in the original game, such as infinite worlds, mining, and the ability to customize the layouts of private studios.  CC Metro  CC Metro is an online spin-off of the virtual world There. It was developed by Makena Technologies and sponsored by the Coca-Cola corporation. It was released December 6, 2007, but closed on March 9, 2010 because of the closure of There. In CC Metro, activities were focused on music, and entertainment. The virtual world included a hoverboard skate park and a theater presenting Coca-Cola videos. Players could use a \\"music mixer\\" tool to develop their own music. The chat system was focused on textboxes or voice over IP. Players could create their own customized avatar, and could obtain property, and buy pets and vehicles. CC Metro allowed players to use My Coke Rewards points to obtain various items in the game. Carol Kruse, vice president of Global Interactive Marketing at Coca-Cola, stated in an interview that \\"to evolve Coke Studios we needed a digital partner that offered technology and capabilities that we didn’t have\\". She further stated that \\"There.com’s digital platform offered more flexibility and creativity to develop a more lifelike world through which we can deliver greater and more varied content.\\" The virtual world was officially shut down on March 9, 2010. On May 18, 2011, Michael Wilson announced that There.com will be re-opening, on the There.com homepage. All previous members will have access to their old avatars.

English-language editions appeared under the titles You Shall Know Them, The Murder of the Missing Link, and Borderline. The author also adapted it into a play called Zoo ou l'Assassin philanthrope. Plot Anthropologists travel to New Guinea to search for the so-called missing link of human evolution. What they find is not a fossil, but an actual population of ape-like creatures, called Paranthropus greamiensis after the discoverer, and dubbed Tropis. A businessman named Vancruysen has the idea to use them as a cheap workforce without rights or pay. The scientists then realize they must come up with a definitive answer to the problem of whether or not the Tropis are human, something they have avoided doing on the grounds that fixing an arbitrary limit between human and non-human is akin to the sorites paradox. They try to use the criterion of interfertility, but it appears that Tropi females can be impregnated by sperm from both man and ape, making it impossible to decide before the offspring reach reproductive age. To force the authorities to reach a decision, thus giving legal protection of the Tropis whether as animals or citizens, one of the scientists deliberately kills the baby born from one Tropi female impregnated by his own sperm. The trial will then determine whether he committed murder (making the Tropis human) or simply killed an animal.

The idea of archetypal pedagogy stems from the Jungian tradition and is directly related to analytical psychology.  History  Clifford Mayes, professor in the Brigham Young University McKay School of Education, has developed what he has termed archetypal pedagogy. Mayes' work aims at promoting what he calls archetypal reflectivity in teachers; this is a means of encouraging teachers to examine and work with psychodynamic issues, images, and assumptions as those factors affect their pedagogical practices. Archetypal reflectivity, which draws not only upon Jungian psychology but transpersonal psychology generally, offers an avenue for teachers to probe the spiritual dimensions of teaching and learning in non-dogmatic terms. Mayes' most recent work, Teaching and Learning for Wholeness: The Role of Archetypes in Educational Processes (2017), develops his ongoing project of incorporating into Jungian pedagogy the psychoanalytic theories of Heinz Kohut (particularly Kohut's notion of the selfobject) and the object relations theory of Ronald Fairbairn and D.W. Winnicott. Some of Mayes' work in curriculum theory, especially Seven Curricular Landscapes: An Approach to the Holistic Curriculum (2003) and Understanding the Whole Student: Holistic Multicultural Education (2007), is concerned with holistic education.  Archetypes and pedagogy  Archetypes are, according to Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, innate universal psychic dispositions that form the substrate from which the basic themes of human life emerge. Being universal and innate, their influence can be detected in the form of myths, symbols, rituals and instincts of human beings. Archetypes are components of the collective unconscious and serve to organize, direct and inform human thought and behaviour. According to Jung, archetypes heavily influence the human life cycle, propelling a neurologically hard-wired sequence which he called the stages of life. Each stage is mediated through a new set of archetypal imperatives which seek fulfillment in action. These may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death. Pedagogy, or paedagogy, is the art or science of being a teacher. The term generally refers to strategies of instruction, or a style of instruction.[from NSF] Pedagogy is also sometimes referred to as the correct use of teaching strategies (see instructional theory). Pedagogy comes from the ancient Greek παιδαγωγία, of παιδός () \\"child\\" and ἄγω () \\"to drive, to raise, to take the way\\". Archetypal pedagogy is the discovery of self and knowledge by means of the archetypes. The archetypes are innate, universal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a complex, e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype. Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological constructs that arose through evolution. For example, an archetype \\"is as much an organ to the psyche as the liver is to metabolism\\". Archetypes can help educators become more deeply self-aware and recognize themselves in the collective unconscious or \\"soul of the world\\" through images of not only 'the teacher' but also \\"healers, great mothers, warriors, visionaries, tricksters, and so on\\". Teachers can engage in a process of archetypal reflectivity through such practices as journal work, interpersonal writing exercises, meditation, or even psychotherapy in order to make unconscious factors of their teaching practice conscious and \\"to 'surface' the deeper images and assumptions that inform their sense of calling and classroom practice\\". Archetypal dimensions for teacher reflection Teacher as the Icarus Archetype: Like Icarus, a teacher's \\"wax wings will melt in the unforgiving daily sun of classroom reality\\" if they lack the humility to recognize themselves as \\"co- learners\\" involved in the process of learning with their students. Teachers who function as \\"co-learners\\" and authoritative facilitators create the best classroom environments Teacher as \\"co-learner\\" is balanced by two Archetypes: The Sage – has already conquered many challenges and developed a deeper understanding of life's lessons. The Novitiate – the novice, beginner who is about to embark on his/her life journey, but has yet to conquer the challenges. This archetypal orientation (Sage/Novitiate) frees the teacher \\"from the impossible burden of feeling that [they] must have all the answers\\" that is characteristic of the omniscient all-knowing authority figure archetypes: the Wise One, the Great Mother and the Great Father. Student as Hero Archetype: The student is understood as the Novitiate-hero (the novice) who is beginning the individuation quest. Teacher as Sage Archetype: The Novitiate-hero meets the wise old man or woman who has already completed his or her archetypal quest. As this Sage encourages the Novitiate through the guidance of riddles and conundrums, the Novitiate's world is deconstructed, thus forcing the Novitiate to seek \\"a higher wisdom\\".< Teacher as an Archetype of Spirit: Mayes explores four variations of Jung's idea of teacher as archetype of spirit. 1\\\\. Discursive Spirituality – Teacher as philosopher :Potential: when archetype is balanced it can foster 'cognitive intelligence' and 'higher order thinking' :Problem: over emphasis on this archetype constricts other domains i.e. poetics and spiritual insights 2\\\\. Civic Spirituality – Teacher as national prophet :Potential: calls students to their \\"noblest traditions and aspirations\\" in terms of social justice and communal equity. :Problem: the teacher as a shadow prophet can call students toward a \\"bias against merit, wealth, individual achievement\\" – understanding these to be racist vices. 3\\\\. Ontological Spirituality – Teacher as Zen master, counsellor, mother :Potential: Zen teaching becomes a mysterious and paradoxical form of \\"non-teaching\\" and counsellor/mother teaching is grounded in receptiveness, relatedness and responsiveness (focused on the needs of the Other). :Problem: The ontological exemplar can deteriorate into elitism, anti- intellectualism and self-absorption for both teacher and student. 4\\\\. Incarnational Spirituality – Teacher as priest :Potential: Teacher becomes \\"minister of light and love\\", and teaching is seen as a sacred act that incarnates religious doctrine into a teaching practice in order to create a positive learning environment for all students (regardless of faith commitment). :Problem: Teachers may consciously or unconsciously project their faith commitments onto their students in the context of increasingly multicultural classrooms. =Individuation and self-realization= Individuation is a process of psychological differentiation, having for its goal the development of the individual personality. \\"In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology\\" (C.G. Jung. Psychological Types. Collected Works Vol. 6., par. 757). An innate need for self-realization leads people to explore and integrate these rejected materials. This natural process is called individuation, or the process of becoming an individual. According to Jung, self-realization can be divided into two distinct tiers. In the first half of their lives, humans separate from humanity. They attempt to create their own identities (I, myself). This is why there is such a need for young men to be destructive, and can be expressed as animosity from teens directed at their parents. Jung also said they have a sort of \\"second puberty\\" that occurs between 35–40 – outlook shifts from emphasis on materialism, sexuality, and having children to concerns about community and spirituality. In the second half of their lives, humans reunite with the human race. They become part of the collective once again. This is when adults start to contribute to humanity (volunteer time, build, garden, create art, etc.) rather than destroy. They are also more likely to pay attention to their unconscious and conscious feelings. Young men rarely say \\"I feel angry.\\" or \\"I feel sad.\\" This is because they have not yet rejoined the human collective experience, commonly reestablished in their older, wiser years, according to Jung. A common theme is for young rebels to \\"search\\" for their true selves and realize that a contribution to humanity is essentially a necessity for a whole self. Jung proposes that the ultimate goal of the collective unconscious and self-realization is to pull humans to the highest experience. This, of course, is spiritual.

Konrad was born about 1435 as a son of a citizen in Kitzingen in Lower Franconia. In 1453 he went to the university in Heidelberg and left as a Master of Arts four years later.Immatrikulation 1453 at the university of Heidelberg In 1460 he was one of the first professors at the young University of Freiburg in Breisgau, which belonged to Austria at that time and became its president for the first time in 1469. At the same time he studied canon law and got his doctor's degree (Dr. jur. can.). In 1478/1479 he again became president of the University of Freiburg.

In 1481 he changed completely from the university to the court of Sigismund in Innsbruck and became his chancellor in 1486. When the upper classes of society (Ständegesellschaft) of Tyrol became unsatisfied with his misgovernment Sigismund was compelled to hand over the leadership to King Maximilian I. In 1490 Konrad was significantly involved in organising the transfer of power from Sigismund to Maximilian. Konrad was in attendance on the Roman-German King as his Chancellor of Tyrol. Obviously in return for his support he was ennobled by Frederick III. on January 24, 1488 which was confirmed three years later by his son Maximilian who granted the name Sturtzl von Buchen on July 4, 1491 in Nuremberg. The political significance of Chancellor Stürtzel grew as Maximilian put the chancellery in Innsbruck more and more in charge of duties of the whole Empire. But Maximilian's plan to make the court chancellery (Hofkanzlei) a chancellery of the Empire (Reichskanzlei) got into a grim conflict with Archbishop Berthold von Henneberg who was Elector (Kurfürst) and Archchancellor of the German part of the Empire. At the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) 1495 in the city of Worms it came to a constitutional dispute about the relationship between the king and the estates of the realm (Stände) leading to the Imperial Reform. In these negotiations during the following Imperial Diets Stürtzel and other advisors had to act for the king who was often absent. When Maximilian lost Milan to the French king Charles VIII he lost power and influence in his empire and the court chancellery was withdrawn from all imperial duties 1500. Then Konrad asked for his retirement and was honorably discharged and allowed to keep his titles until the end of his life. Nevertheless he was mandated for several diplomatic missions after his retirement. Konrad was also engaged in many foreign affairs acting as a delegate of Sigismund and later Maximilian in negotiations with the Duke of Milan, with the dukedoms Geldern, Friesland and the Swiss. During his career Stürtzel gained considerable assets. On the one hand, the Chancellor of the court was paid very well, but he also knew how to invest his money profitably. In 1491 he bought the villages Buchheim, Holzhausen and Hugstetten northwest of Freiburg as a fiefdom (Lehen) covering all rights and inhabitants. Beside that he bought seven neighboring houses in the center of Freiburg near the Gothic Münster and rebuilt them in the 1490s into one large residence which was the largest private house in town at that time. This was later known as 'Basler Hof' as it belonged from 1587 to the cathedral chapter (Domkapitel) of Basel and after 1651 the government of Further Austria (Vorderösterreich) was located there. From 1933-1941 the Gestapo was located there and it was mainly destroyed in 1944 during World War II. Reconstructed in 1951 it serves today as headquarters of the government of South-Baden. In 1505 a new chorus was built in the Freiburg Minster and Konrad sponsored the first chapel for the grave of his family. He ordered two stained-glass windows with a picture of himself and his family which were drafted by Hans Baldung several years after Konrad's death and finalized about 1530.Window inscription of the donator: CONRAT STÜRZEL VON BUOCHEIM ERBSCHENK DER LANTGROFSCHAFT ELLSES [Elsaß] RITTER DOCTOR R.

[1505] The windows were replaced in 1910 by copies as the original windows are in bad condition. Also in 1505 Konrad commissioned Hans Wydyz to fabricate a Three-Kings-Altar for his residence which can still be seen in the Minster today. Konrad was married twice. His first wife was Elisabeth Griesser and his second wife was Ursula Laucher. His hometown Kitzingen, the city of Freiburg and the village Buchheim nearby named a street after him.

From a simple beginning of 93 students, 10 staff members, and 2 buildings, to a current population of 740 students, 65 teachers, 11 buildings, and a recently completed Music/Drama/TAS. The college has been approved as an asthma friendly school, and upholds a healthy canteen scheme to better encourage healthy eating in the student population. The college holds a Christian community spirit helping both inside and outside the boundaries of the college, raising funds in the Red Cross door knock, and contributing to many charities through various events and special days. Statistics show that on average students have performed better than the rest of the state in the school certificate, NAPLAN, ELLA, SNAP, and Basic Skills.  Pastoral Care  The pastoral care program is structured through the following means to strive for the above ideals. =Tutor Groups= Each student is in a tutor group of 15–18 students with a tutor who is the main person responsible for their pastoral care. The Tutor Group meets regularly to enable the tutor to get to know each member of their group very well through a wide range of activities such as informal conversations, diary inspections, devotions, discussion of important issues, games, group celebrations and much more. In this way a tutor builds rapport with the members of their group and is able to guide them, correct them, and positively affirm them on a regular basis. =Head of House= The Head of House has a special role in the area of pastoral care in looking after the welfare of the students in their House group. They provide an important channel of communication between the student and classroom teacher and home and school and also focus on the particular needs of the whole House group. =Outdoor Education= The College’s Outdoor Education Program continues to be developed with a very strong focus on challenge and overcoming fears, friendship, teamwork and support of others. Students from Years K – 12 will be engaged in Outdoor Education and it is considered an integral part of our Pastoral Care system. For these reasons it is an optional activity for all students to save stress Year 11 will follow a modified program during the period that Years 5 to 6 are participating in Outdoor Education. =The 'House' System= The ‘House’ system is strongly linked to Tutor groups and students are encouraged to find ways to be involved in a wide range of co curricular activities including sport, music, drama and public speaking. Each House has a staff member to coordinate, staff assigned to assist and senior leaders to organise and enthuse students. The aim of House activities is to enable students to feel they belong and can contribute in a variety of ways to the success of their house and to build house and school spirit. The house names have been produced from four contemporary Christian Australians who have made a valuable contributions to society. The Houses are Allen, Booth, Chapman, and Chiswell. Named from Carol Allen, Brian Booth, John Chapman, and Nicky Chiswell.

He was the second youngest winner of Germany's highest decoration for valor, the Pour le Mérite, or the \\"Blue Max\\". Early life Kurt Wüsthoff was born in Aachen, the westernmost city in Germany,https://www.tvk.rwth-aachen.de/ on 27 January 1897. His father was a music director. In 1913, the family moved to Dresden, where Kurt studied art in high school. He joined the German air service at age 16½, in mid 1913. After earning his pilot's license, he was assigned to be a flight instructor in Flieger-Ersatz-Abteilung 6 because he was considered too young for combat.Franks (2000), p. 19. He flew such two seater aircraft as the LVG C.II, Aviatik B.I, and Albatros C.I. When old enough for combat duty, Wüsthoff served on the Western Front with Kampfgeschwader I over Verdun and the Somme in 1916. When KG I moved east, Wüsthoff got his chance to fly observation and bombing missions in Bulgaria, Rumania, Macedonia, and Greece. Fighter service By June 1917, Wüsthoff had been promoted to Vizefeldwebel. He transferred to fighter service with a Prussian squadron, Jagdstaffel 4, under the command of Oberleutnant Kurt-Bertram von Döring. The squadron was part of Germany's original fighter wing, von Richthofen's Flying Circus. Wüsthoff scored his first aerial victory on 15 June 1917, shooting down a Sopwith 1½ Strutter near Vormezeele, Belgium. He then shot down three observation balloons on three different days, and followed them up with a Sopwith Camel on 20 July, making him an ace in just over a month. The last day of July saw his sixth confirmed triumph. He was commissioned as a leutnant on 1 August. He scored only once in August, then ran off a string of 14 victories in September, making him a quadruple ace. He shot down two more enemy aircraft in October, and three in November. He won the Pour le Mérite on 22 November 1917, having previously been awarded the Iron Cross and the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. His rapid rise to fame came with a price, however. The teenage ace began struggling with severe emotional and physical problems. He was also beginning to suffer from battle fatigue, and the stress of combat was causing him stomach problems. Granting Wüsthoff command of the squadron inflamed many of his fellow fliers; they felt their youngest member was pushy and over-ambitious. While his first tenure as acting commander was fleeting, from 12 through 20 December 1917, he was appointed Staffelführer permanently on 19 January 1918. He held the post for two months, until 16 March. By February, he had already made his first sojourn to Doctor Lahmann's Dresden sanatorium for treatment of his stomach and \\"nervous disorders\\".Van Wyngarden & Dempsey (2004), pp. 52, 66. Wüsthoff's personality clashes were not the only thing wrong with his leadership; he failed to lead by example, not scoring in battle. He finally shot down his 27th and final victim on 10 March 1918. Six days later, his immediate superior, Manfred von Richthofen, relieved him from command.Van Wyngarden & Dempsey (2004), p. 64. As his successor remarked, \\"He was the youngest—very much younger than all his pilots—and he had a very cheeky way. Apart from not being a very sympathetic man, he reported victories he did not always check.\\" Wüsthoff was given a desk job in the wing's headquarters. He left the wing altogether on 4 May and was sent back to Doctor Lahmann's care for his combat fatigue. On 16 June, he returned to duty as a pilot in another Prussian squadron, Jagdstaffel 15. He borrowed the fancifully marked Fokker of Georg von Hantelmann to fly a patrol the following day.Van Wyngarden & Dempsey (2004), p. 52. He engaged a Royal Air Force group of four SE5's of No. 24 Squadron, three of which were aces, Ian McDonald, Horace Barton, George Owen Johnson, and C. E. Barton, who forced Wüsthoff down in the vicinity of Cachy, France. Wüsthoff was seriously wounded in both legs, taken prisoner, and treated in various French hospitals. He complained bitterly about the adequacy of his treatment. Having scored 26 of his victories in the Albatros D.III he was one of the most successful pilots in the type. Post war Wüsthoff remained in French captivity in Château-Gontier until 1920. When he was finally released, he was malnourished and on crutches. He eventually improved to the point he could walk again. Wüsthoff returned to aviation and flew for advertising campaigns. On 18 July 1926, he flew a plane built by Ernst Udet in a memorial show to Max Immelmann in Dresden. He crashed while performing aerobatics. He was taken to Friedrichstadt Hospital with a fractured skull and two legs so mangled they had to be amputated. On 23 July 1926, Wüsthoff succumbed to his injuries.

Considered as one of Poland’s leading metal acts Devilish Impressions officially started in 2000 as a three-piece, with founding singer / guitarist Quazarre the only remaining original member. Squeezing a unique dimension of brutality and catchiness into their music the band keeps pushing boundaries further out with each consecutive release. Early years Marking their presence with the 45-minutes-long Eritis sicut Deus; Verbum Diaboli Manet in Aeternum; Vox Vespertilio Act I – Moon Var Dies Irae, self-released in 2002, the band began the process of shaping up its own spirit. 2005 saw them recording \\"Plurima Mortis Imago\\", released in September 2006 on the London-based Conquer Records. The video for the song \\"SataniChaoSymphony\\" was shot in London and two months later Devilish Impressions hits the road along with Aeternus as part of the European \\"Ageless Void Tour\\". In April 2007 they land a direct support slot on Marduk's \\"Swords In The East\\" Eastern European run.  Diabolicanos – Act III: Armageddon and Extensive Touring  After the successful tours, in May 2007 the group enters Studio X for the 3-months-long recording session of their second full-length album \\"Diabolicanos – Act III: Armageddon\\". While the record was being mastered by Andy Classen at Stage One Studio, Devilish Impressions appears at Red Alert Festival in the Crimea, accompanying such acts as Suffocation and Vader. Autumn 2007 sees Devilish Impressions shooting the video for the song \\"Har-Magedon\\", set to promote the \\"Diabolicanos...\\" album. At the end of the year, the band sets off for the \\"Verbum Diaboli Tour\\", their first ever headlining run across the Eastern European countries. The \\"Diabolicanos...\\" album, released in January 2008 again on Conquer Records, was widely praised in the international metal press and gave Devilish Impressions the opportunity to open for Behemoth and Suicide Silence on \\"The Apostasy European Tour\\", and then embark with Dismember for the \\"UK, Ireland and Northern Ireland Tour\\". Meanwhile the group was invited for selected shows of Wacken Road Show 2008 yet, due to above-mentioned tours having been booked earlier, they eventually managed to join the WRS bill, Overkill, Tristania, Samael and Enslaved, for a show in Kiev only. In May 2008 the album comes out in Poland licensed to Empire Records. The same month sees Devilish Impressions joining forces with their home country-mates Hate for their first time ever Polish invasion named \\"Rebel Angels Tour\\" being forced to drop off from the tour’s last date, as they had earlier been booked for the special show with Satyricon in Ukraine. The summer of 2008 included the band’s appearance at Pro Rock Festival while co-headlining with Rage and at Metal Heads Mission Festival with bands like Moonspell, Gorgoroth and Samael to name but a few. After finishing over a half-year-long touring cycle in support to the \\"Diabolicanos...\\" album, Devilish Impressions decide to continue their crusade, despite facing many problems on both, professional and personal levels, leading to further shifts in their line-up and temporary stage absence.  Simulacra and Fear No Gods of the East Tour  In the middle of 2009, Quazarre began to compose on what would later become the \\"Diabolicanos...\\" successor, introducing even more of a thrash and heavy metal influences in the song-writing process, and thus injecting a new dimension of brutality and catchiness in Devilish Impressions' music. Increasing the use of clean vocals and further development of a melodic side of the new songs, made their sound even more of an epic character, sound that eventually turn into something the band themselves would describe as \\"MUSIC for the EXTREME experiMENTAL generation ONLY\\". In the second half of 2010 Devilish Impressions enters few recording studios, incl. Studio X and Hertz Studio in order to produce their latest full-length named \\"Simulacra\\". The long-lasting recording session backed up by session synth appearances of Flumen (Asgaard) and Lestath (METransmissionAL), as well as special guests incl. Orion (Behemoth, Vesania), Jacek Grecki (Lost Soul) and Roman (Lecter), resulted in extremely sharp and massive sound of the album, that along with the new songs' outstanding craftsmanship, breath-taking artworks and lyrical concept based on works of the world’s famous poets makes the \\"Simulacra\\" record one of the 2012 must- have metal offers. Releasing the album in 2012 on several record labels: Lifeforce Records (Europe / North America), Icaros Records (Poland), MSR Productions (Russia / CIS countries), resulted also in signing the worldwide deal with The Flaming Arts Management and Booking Agency. Nominated for a 2012 Metal Storm Award \\"Simulacra\\" was voted one of the Best Melodic Black Metal / Metalgaze Album and gets very good press all over the world. In support to the record the group appears at a bunch of summer festivals, incl. Hard Rock Laager (with Samael, Melechesh), Carpathian Alliance (co-headlining with Dark Funeral, Carpathian Forest, Týr, Arkona), Castle Party and Brutal East, followed by \\"Fear no Gods of The East Tour 2013\\", a month-long headlining run across The Baltic States / Eastern European countries. After the tour Devilish Impressions plays at Wave Gotik Treffen (with Paradise Lost, Lacrimosa) and at MetalFest Open Air Poland (with Helloween, Accept, Sodom, Destruction, Down, Satyricon).  Adventvs  During the Summer of 2013 the band re-enters Hertz Studio for the drums recording session of what is now known as \\"Adventvs\\" EP. Several months later, having the material mixed and mastered by Arkadiusz \\"Malta\\" Malczewski at Sound Division Studio, the band decides to re-master their 2002 never-published-before demo \\"Eritis Sicvt Devs\\" to eventually add it up to the new tracks portraying the band’s re-defined sonic path. Released on May 2014 \\"Adventvs\\" features over an hour of both the band’s new and old music - Experimental Black Death Metal at its best. In support to its premiere Devilish Impressions hit the road for a headliner tour across Poland. Soon after the material got the attention of the now-legendary Hammerheart Records that released a 12’’ MLP in February 2015. Soon after that the band hit the road once again, spreading their message across the motherland as part of the tour with Christ Agony and Beheaded. Shortly after, the band appeared at NCM Festival Vol. 4 (co-headliner w/ Vader) and Dark Fest II (w/ Vader, Decapitated, Hate and more). This left the passion raging on all levels and gave Devilish Impressions an easy return to the studio in May 2015 to commence the recording sessions for \\"The I\\" - the band's fourth full-length album which is said to be their darkest, heaviest and most intriguing offering to date. The I and a new chapter Right after finishing the recording process of the upcoming album, Devilish Impressions announced a long awaited tour for their legion of fans in China and Taiwan supporting the \\"Simulacra\\" record, released in China through Mort Productions in September 2016. The trek lasted for nearly a month. At the same time the band joins the elite roster of New York based Extreme Management Group, Inc. alongside notable bands such as Suffocation, Cattle Decapitation, Origin, Cryptopsy, Atheist, Rings Of Saturn, King Parrot, Internal Bleeding to name but a few. This newfound partnership has both the band and the management hard at work on all the vital arrangements for the new album to make the impact intended.

This halt opened with the introduction of the GWR steam railmotor services between Stonehouse and Chalford. The halt was between Brimscombe and Stroud, on the minor road \\"Butterow Hill\\" between Bowbridge and Rodborough Common.

It stars Dominique Moore as Sally, the receptionist; Gary Damer as Lenny; Sam Phillips as Jamie, the bellboy; and Tanya Franks as Dolly and Sheila Bernette as Mrs. Poshington, a guest who never leaves (and who becomes the hotel's cleaner in series two and three). It is a farce sitcom. A total of 39 episodes have aired on TV between December 2008 and August 2011. Many guest stars have appeared, including Tom Price, Josie d'Arby, Miranda Hart, Stephen Evans, Steve Furst, Steve Marsh, Dan Wright, Les Dennis, Phil Cornwell, and Susan Wokoma who played new regular 'Daisy' in Series 3. Reruns have not been broadcast on CBBC since late-2013. CharactersJamie= Jamie is the bellboy of Hotel Trubble and probably the one with the most common sense, he does at some parts, have a lack of confidence and panics. He also does embarrassing things when he is in a panic. He is always the first person to yell \\"Noooooo!\\" when its time to panic. He was also like Sally, nominated, but for being the best bellboy. He is sensitive, has strong emotions like the time Verity Lumiere kissed him. Jamie is a good character and always means well. He is probably the most normal of the threesome. It is shown on several occasions that he has romantic feelings for Sally - for example in \\"Super Trubble\\", he shouts \\"Don't hurt the woman I love!\\" after Lionel shoots her with an arrow, only to correct himself moments later. Sally and Jamie are technically married after an accident with a mix-up between a fake and real vicar. It's shown that Jamie is very over-enthusiastic about his work, as in one episode it is noted that he never wears anything other than his uniform; it can only be assumed he has a wardrobe somewhere full of identical blue suits. =Sally= Sally is the receptionist of the hotel. She can be troublesome and often arrogant, but well-meaning, and is arguably the smartest out of the staff. Although glamorous, she finds life at the hotel dull, and prefers to read gossip magazines in spare time. She has shown an interest in acting and dancing, despite having no talent in either; her only role has been a sheep in her school's production of Cinderella. She and Jamie have shown an occasional attraction to one another - in one episode she displayed gratitude when he helps her out of a tight spot and flirted with him. =Lenny= Leonard \\"Lenny\\" Lemon, is the eccentric member of the trio, often serving as the comic relief. He is the most unintelligent out of the group, he regularly manages to mess up things for his mates, asking strange people for advice, and takes numerous directions and comments too literally. However, he is good-hearted and hard working; but this does not necessarily mean his efforts go to plan. =Dolly= Dolly is Mr Trubble's fiancée who first appeared in series two. A rich woman, she is effectively Hotel Trubble's manager, and is always coming up with odd business ideas including a toilet made out of flowers and hosting exclusive parties at the hotel. She is seen as rather dimwitted, and is clearly disliked by Mrs. Poshington, Jamie and Sally - Lenny gets on best with her due to their low common sense, often being roped into helping with her schemes. In series 3, it is discovered she used to be a successful singer in Japan, performing under the name \\"Yolly Dolly\\". =Mrs. Poshington= Mrs. Poshington is a guest, who literally never leaves. Every morning she asks pointless questions and she claims to be a marathon runner, running the London Marathon 30 years ago (in 2009) even though it was established in 1981, the Queen's cousin, a former actress and a grandmother. In a few episodes, she helps Sally, Lenny and Jamie with solutions to their problems. Mrs. Poshington seems to be demanding, but kind-hearted and filled with willpower. She loses her entire fortune in series 2 and is allowed to stay at the hotel as long as she is the new cleaner. In \\"Time Trubble\\", it is revealed she's had eight husbands; all of which died in suspicious circumstances. Mrs. Poshington is not a great cleaner as it shows in episodes 13 (4011); her video shows her breaking various items. =General Sirius Poshington= General Sirius Poshington is a fake stuffed cat belonging to Mrs. Poshington. She does not seem to realize that he is not real and she pushes it on a wagon. Mrs Poshington says things like \\"Sirius doesn't like running, he likes the cycling trips we go on together\\". She even asks Sally to look after it for her when she goes out and calls frequently during this period to ask how he is in series 1 and 2. In \\"Fashion Phonies\\", Jamie says Sirius will never walk again. =Mr. Trubble= Mr. Trubble owns Hotel Trubble and calls very often on a special red phone with a siren instead of a bell or tone caller. Once, he threatens to fire Sally, Jamie and Lenny if they don't give him a good birthday party. Mrs. Poshington is responsible and is told that she will lose her room if the party isn't good. In one episode the Trubble diamond is brought in by an impostor who tries to steal it. He first tries to accuse Sally and then Lenny. Mr. Trubble does not have a particular personality as he is never shown and is heard only as a shouting, unintelligible voice over the phone, a la the General in the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series Dastardly and Muttley in their Flying Machines. =Chef= Like Mr. Trubble, Chef is never seen and is represented only as a shouting unintelligible voice emanating from behind the double doors leading to the kitchen. He would seem to be an extremely hostile individual, as whenever Jamie or Lenny enters the kitchen to speak to him, there is always a lot of shouting before they emerge looking rather frightened or covered in something. He is French. =Daisy= Daisy is the new receptionist, first appearing in the series 3 episode \\"American President\\". She is an animal rights activist who has kidnapped an elephant from London Zoo, and is on the run from the police. Daisy is plotting to smuggle the elephant, which she has named Trunky and has hidden in room 360, back to the jungle where the two of them can start a new life together. She states that Sally found out her secret, thus prompting her to kidnap Sally and post her to Guatemala so that she would not be found out. The rest of the characters are unaware of all of this, despite regular elephant noises coming from room 360. In \\"Fashion Phonies\\", the characters receive a postcard from Sally in Guatemala saying \\"DON'T TRUST THE RECEPTIONIST!\\", but Daisy tells them it's actually Guatemalan for \\"Ahh, lovely time\\". Note: The character of Daisy, played by Susan Wokoma, was introduced when Dominique Moore had to leave the show during recording of series 3 to have treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The scripts were rewritten so that Sally would not have to appear (though she would still be referred to in dialogue), incorporating the underlying sub-plot of Daisy having kidnapped an elephant and Sally's absence being explained by her having been sent to Guatemala by Daisy.

Joseph is born prematurely to parents Chris and Rachel, and named after Rachel's stepfather Joe Sugden (Frazer Hines) and Rachel's brother Mark Hughes (Craig McKay). Since Chris and his dad Frank Tate (Norman Bowler) are away in a meeting when Rachel goes into labour, Chris's former wife Kathy Tate (Malandra Burrows) helps Rachel and becomes Joseph's godmother. When Chris and Rachel divorce, Rachel obtains custody of Joseph. The following year, Rachel begins a relationship with Graham Clark (Kevin Pallister), who later murders her by pushing her off a cliff. Joseph begins living with Chris, although when Chris marries Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins), Joseph opts to attend boarding school. Two years later, Chris commits suicide, framing Charity for his murder and leaving Joseph an orphan. Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell), Chris' sister, obtains custody of Joseph and in 2005, they leave the village with Zoe's daughter, Jean Tate (Megan Pearson). Joseph continues to attend boarding school in England where he becomes friends with groundskeeper Graham Foster (Andrew Scarborough) and saves him from a fire. At the age of 15 Joseph locks his headmaster in a cupboard as a prank and Zoe makes Graham Joseph's guardian to prevent him being expelled. On leaving school Joseph starts his own business with Graham as his associate. Twelve years after leaving the village, Joseph returns to Emmerdale, using the alias Tom Waterhouse. He meets Debbie Dingle about leasing a Bentley. Tom and Debbie later kiss and sleep together, he then buys her a Bentley and a house, Jacob's Fold. They begin a relationship. Debbie soon discovers that Tom has invested in a golf course that is to be built on the land that the Dingles' cottage, Wishing Well, is built on. Joseph reveals his true identity, takes back the Bentley, evicts Debbie and her children, Sarah and Jack Sugden, out of Jacob's Fold and ends his relationship with Debbie, telling her that she was collateral damage in his pursuit of seeking revenge on her mother, Charity, for driving his father, Chris, to suicide. Joseph buys his childhood home, Home Farm, from the Whites and later moves into it. He makes up with Debbie and starts a relationship with his brother Noah Dingle. On 13 September 2017, it was announced that Porteous had been cast as Tom Waterhouse, a love interest for Debbie. Tom is billed as a \\"wealthy businessman\\", while Porteous described the character as \\"very cool and fun\\", the actor admitted he found his casting enjoyable but intimidating. On 4 January 2018, Tom was revealed to be Joseph Tate in a surprise on-screen twist which revealed that Joseph had returned to take revenge on Charity, blaming her for his father, Chris' death. On 11 October 2018, Joe is seemingly killed after a single punch by Debbie's father, Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley). However, when Graham puts Joe in the boot of his car, Joe's hand twitches.

It was formed through the merger of six municipalities in Val d'Anniviers: Ayer, Chandolin, Grimentz, Saint-Jean, Saint-Luc and Vissoie. The merger became effective 1 January 2009,Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 19 July 2011 creating the third largest municipality of Switzerland by surface area.  History  Human settlement dates from the Bronze Age and Iron Age. The region was later occupied by Gaulish tribes, who were conquered by the Roman Empire during the first century. Under Rome the valley was incorporated into the province of Helvetia and became known as Annivesium. The present inhabitants of Anniviers are claimed to be descendants of Huns or a related people, who migrated to Europe from Central Asia, during or after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. An extinct and unrecorded language formerly spoken in the area is reported to have had similarities to Hungarian.Anton Karl Fischer: Die Hunnen Im Schweizerischen Eifischthale Und Ihre Nachkommen Bis Auf Die Heutige Zeit. 1896. Kessinger Pub Co 2010. The inhabitants of Val d'Anniviers generally became Christian much later than their neighbours; the Swiss travel writer Marc-Théodore Bourrit, in Description des Alpes Pennines et Rhetiennes (1781) writes of how the Bishopric of Sion struggled to convert the people of the valley, who long adhered to a pagan religion. A century later, the Hungarian cleric and historian Mihály Horváth says of the inhabitants: \\"They say they are the descendants of the old Huns. The majority of them have light-blue eyes or grayish green eyes, blonde or brown hair, with large and bony forehead and a slight yoke-bone. They have a common nose, broad chin, prominent shoulders and neck, and they are in general low- statured.\\"Mihály Horváth, Századok (journal) Other cultural features including folk art, cuisine and burial rituals are also said to support this link.Kiszely István: A svájci \\"hun völgy\\" http://mek.niif.hu/01500/01522/html/index.htm There are two main theories regarding the inhabitants' connection to the Huns: * the inhabitants are descended from followers of Attila who settled in the valley after being defeated in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (451 CE) and/or; * they are descended from Magyars (Hungarians) who invaded western Europe during the 10th century. The valley was known as Annivesium until 1052. The Bishop of Sion owned the valley between 1116 and 1138 and donated it to the chapter. In the year 1193, the area became a demesne of the Anniviers family, then by Raron (1381). The property was returned to the bishopric in 1798. Ayer was first mentioned in 1296, and Chandolin about 1250 as Eschandulyns. Grimentz was first mentioned in 1052 as Grimiens; the village was formerly known by its German name Grimensi. Saint-Jean was first mentioned in 1250 as de Sancto Johanne. Saint-Luc was first mentioned in 1267 as Lus and in 1304 as Luc; the name Saint-Luc first appeared around 1850, and was nout the official name until 1904. While the valley's first cart path was cleared in about 1300, a wagon road was not built until 1854 for the transport of nickel and cobalt ores. The paved road dates from 1955; it was constructed to allow transportation of materials needed to build the Dam Moiry. The number of parishes increased from two in 1805 to five in 1932. By 1905 there were six municipalities: Ayer, Chandolin, Saint-Luc, Saint-Jean, Grimentz and Vissoie. Geography Val-Anniviers Anniviers has an area, , of .

Their work on the court house was featured in exhibitions published by architectural organizations. In 2000 the Livingston County Board of Supervisors approved US$77,000 in renovations for the courthouse, which included exterior painting work and security improvement.

In 2001 a fund campaign began to build a statue of James S. Wadsworth on the grounds of the courthouse, modeled after the bronze statue of Wadsworth at Gettysburg National Military Park in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. In February 2002, the Livingston County Board of Supervisors agreed to allow the statue to be built on the front lawn of the courthouse. The fund raising campaign had its inaugural event on April 5, 2002, with a speech at the State University of New York at Geneseo by Pulitzer Prize winner and Civil War historian James M. McPherson.

Writing in Rochester History published by the Rochester Public Library, Erville Costa comments: \\"The Livingston County Courthouse, which they built in 1898, reflects Bragdon's conviction at the time that colonial architecture was a more honest expression of a truly national spirit than either the eclectic or Richardsonian architecture which dominated the scene.\\" The \\"Decorative Scheme for the Court Room\\" and floor plans of the new courthouse were featured in the Catalogue of the Thirteenth Annual Exhibition of the Architectural League of New York, by the Architectural League of New York, published in 1898.

In February 2002 the Livingston County Board of Supervisors agreed to allow the statue to be built in front of the courthouse, at the northern end of Main Street. \\"It seems like it's in line with the historic nature of the courthouse and the history of the region,\\" said County Administrator Nick Mazza in a statement in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. The fund raising campaign was launched with an inaugural event April 5, 2002 with a speech on civil war history given at the Wadsworth Auditorium at the State University of New York at Geneseo by Pulitzer Prize winner and civil war historian James M.

It is under the Advanced Infantry Training Battalion (AITB) of the School of Infantry (West), Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. Scout Sniper Course The 50-day Scout Sniper Basic Course provides the operating forces with qualified Scout Snipers with the MOS 0317, who are proficient with advanced scouting and marksmanship skills. Marines Awaiting Reconnaissance Training (MART) This is the platoon that all junior Marines go to while preparing for RTAP. It is an intensive workout program that develops the Marines to the standards needed to successfully complete RTAP. It also provides manpower for working parties around the RTC barracks and training facilities. Marines in this platoon typically do a pool based workout in the morning followed by a land based workout in the afternoon. They are supervised by the Instructors, as well as by “Ropers”, i.e. Marines who have completed RTAP but are waiting to pickup with a BRC course. Reconnaissance Training and Assessment Program (RTAP) RTAP (formerly known as BRC Primer Course) is a 5 week course (25 training days) designed to select Marines that are physically and mentally able to attend and pass the Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC). RTAP focuses the students mental strength and physical fitness on land as well as in the water. Students can expect daily running, swimming and calisthenics required for the Basic Reconnaissance Course. Students receive basic knowledge of knots and management of mountaineering equipment, water survival and combat conditioning. Any student can Drop on Request (DOR) and will be reassigned usually back to original unit. All students regardless of rank must attend and complete RTAP prior to attending the Basic Reconnaissance Course. Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) BRC is a 12 week course (65 training days) with an average training day of 15.5 hours and introduces the students to the amphibious reconnaissance environment. During this tenure, they gain working knowledge of the reconnaissance doctrines, concepts and techniques that emphasize ground and amphibious reconnaissance missions. They also learn the fundamentals of all types of weapons (air, sea, and land) that are employed in supporting arms such as calling and adjusting naval gunfire, artillery, and close air support. The BRC was relocated in 2007 from the Amphibious Reconnaissance Schools (ARS) on Fort Story at Little Creek, Virginia and Expeditionary Warfare Training Group at Coronado, California to the School of Infantry (West) on MCB Camp Pendleton. This facilitated the reconstruction of the course's training protocol and to meet the demands of 600 more recon Marines per year. Candidates are issued a rope; at any time instructors will demand candidates tie knots of the instructor's choice. Due to that practice, the candidates are often known as \\"ropers\\". The term \\"ropers\\" was borrowed from the Reconnaissance Indoctrination Platoon (indoc platoon) which was dissolved in 2004. Students practice day and night learning to operate behind enemy lines and how to conduct immediate action drills. Surveillance and reconnaissance skills such as photography with field and underwater cameras are taught along with field sketching and range estimations. In addition, Recon students learn insertion/extraction techniques in Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) and Helicopter Rope Suspension Training (HRST).MCO 3500.42A, 9 July 2004 Even though every Marine has learned to read a map and compass and to patrol beginning in boot camp, BRC training is more in depth to ensure that the candidates will operate efficiently in small 4 to 6 man recon teams. Candidates will need to complete a 12-mile, three-hour march with more than 50-pounds of equipment and an hour long, 1 ¼-mile open-water swim with fins. Upon graduation, Marines receive the 0321 MOS, Reconnaissance Marine. For those Marines who are already qualified as parachutists and combatant divers, particularly recon Marines assigned to Force Reconnaissance companies, the special \\"B\\" 0326 MOS, Reconnaissance Marine, Parachutist/Combatant Diver Qualified is assigned.

Nominally. the commanding officer of the front was King Ferdinand I of Romania; however, the de facto power lay in his \\"deputies,\\" which were Imperial Russian Army generals delegated by the Russian Stavka. Initially the front consisted of three armies: the Russian 4th, 6th, and 9th Armies.

Overview The requirements to apply for selection are very stringent and much higher than what is needed for other warrant officer appointments. For example; minimum time in service is sixteen years and minimum rank to apply is Gunnery Sergeant (E-7) versus eight years and Sergeant (E-5). They are not appointed Warrant Officers, but rather commissioned directly to the grade of Chief Warrant Officer-2 and are the only officers who are officially designated the title, \\"Marine Gunner\\" and authorized to wear the \\"Bursting Bomb\\" insignia. The title \\"Gunner\\" is almost always used in lieu of rank (i.e., \\"Gunner Smith\\" as opposed to \\"Chief Warrant Officer Smith\\"), and the rank insignia worn on the left collar is replaced with a \\"Bursting Bomb.\\" A larger \\"Bursting Bomb\\" insignia is worn ¾\\" above the rank insignia on both shoulder epaulets when a coat is worn. Occasionally other warrant officers are referred to as \\"Gunner\\" but this is incorrect. The Gunners' technical skills complemented with infantry field experience fundamentally posits them as advisers to the force commanders within the Fleet Marine Force's task forces (i.e. Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and its subordinate units). Marine Gunners may be responsible for developing and monitoring weapons training protocols, tactical employment of weapons, preventive maintenance of the unit's infantry weapons, management of the unit's ammunition allocation and the unit training plan, infantry training, and fire support planning. Additional assignments may be based on future needs of the Marine Corps; such as new weapons systems acquisition, new weapons systems research and development. During combat operations, Marine Gunners assists their force commanders in battle tracking; They are sent forward to oversee the battle, reporting directly to task force commanders in a \\"directed telescope\\" fashion. Billet description and core competencies The Marine Corps Infantry Training and Readiness Manual describes The Gunner as follows: The Gunner is a Chief Warrant Officer specifically trained in the employment and training of battalion organic weapons and assigned personnel. He is a special staff officer employed as the principal advisor to commanders at all levels to assist in the development of training plans and employment of organic weapons. During combat, the Gunner may be tasked to inspect fire plans to ensure organic fires are integrated and mutually supporting at the battalion level, perform other supervisory tasks at critical events, and/or command task organized or provisional combat units. Gunners are advisors on the MOS training requirements and development of all MOS 0321, 0313, and 0369 (Infantry SNCOS). They have oversight of the unit's ammunition allocation and annual weapons re-qualification programs. They accommodate all weapons organic to the MAGTF in accordance the current version of MCO 3570.1. Additional duties will include: new weapons systems acquisition, new weapons systems research and development, foreign weapons training, curriculum development for infantry MOSs and Marine Corps Marksmanship Programs, and Fire Support Planning. The Gunner's strength is his ability to vet, conduct and quantify combined-arms training. As infantry weapons officers advance in grade, billet assignments will include: Marine Gunner Plans, Policies & Operations Headquarters Marine Corps, Marine Gunner Infantry Training Battalion (SOI East or West), Marine Gunner Advanced Infantry Training Company (SOI East and West), Marine Gunner Marine Corps Ground Combat Operations Training Course, Tactical Training and Exercise Control Group (TTECG) MAGTF-TC, Marine Gunner Infantry Regiment (Active and Reserve) Marine Gunner Infantry Division (Active & Reserve Component), Marine Gunner Infantry Officer Course, Marine Gunner The Basic School, and Marine Gunner Small Arms Weapons Instructor School.

Since that time the Gunner designation has undergone many changes, including periods where no new Gunners were made from 1943 to 1956, 1959 to 1964, and 1974 to 1988. These usually being the result of Gunners being promoted to Temporary Commissioned Officer status or changes in the laws governing the rank structure of the military. Throughout this time few Marines have been able to rightly call themselves \\"Gunner\\" but though the list is short it is filled with legends of the Old Corps such as: * Henry L. Hulbert; hero of Samoa, Belleau Wood, and Blanc Mont. A trophy bearing his name and image is presented to a Marine Gunner for Outstanding Leadership every year by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. * Henry Pierson Crowe, who talked General Julian C. Smith out of putting him in for a Medal of Honor after the Battle of Tarawa (he received the Navy Cross instead). *William A. Lee, the first Marine to receive three Navy Crosses but would spend World War II as a Japanese POW in China. * Lee's father-in-law Calvin C. Lloyd for whom the rifle ranges in Quantico are named; though Lloyd retired a Major he always answered the telephone as \\"Gunner Lloyd\\". There are other less well known, but important Gunners such as; * Ira Davidson, the \\"Daniel Boone of Iwo Jima\\", who received a Navy Cross for taking out multiple Japanese pill boxes with uncanny accuracy while under withering fire. * Gilbert Bolton who was himself decorated for valor with a Silver Star in Vietnam for defending his platoon's position against a vastly larger NVA force by calling in six artillery missions on his own position and provided a link for the new breed of Gunners to the past. * Neil Goddard who served in the USMC for 32 years. Gunner Goddard was a Gunnery Sergeant (E-7), a Gunner, a CWO4, and a Captain (O-3). Gunner Goddard spent time at Quantico developing rifles for the USMC during the Vietnam era. He is most famously known for his work in creating the M40A1 sniper rifle.

This line was opened in 1845 as the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway from Swindon to Gloucester, and this station opened 3 weeks after the general opening of the line, originally as \\"Brimscomb\\". The station was renamed as \\"Brimscomb near Chalford\\" in June 1865 and finally to Brimscombe on 2 August 1897. The main building was on the up side (towards Kemble) and consisted of a Brunel style chalet building with a large canopy and a bay window. On the down platform, a large waiting shelter with canopy was provided and a covered footbridge was provided in 1898 following the death of a young woman crossing the line. A large stone good shed with timber ends was provided along with several sidings at the west end of the station on up side. Originally, a small signal box stood at the west end of the down platform, but this was replaced with a new west box in July 1896 and an east box on the up platform in 1898, following the increase in freight traffic. At the eastern end of up platform, a small engine shed with an integral water tower over the entrance was built. This was used by banking engines based at Brimscombe that assisted freight trains up the 1 in 75 Sapperton Bank beyond Chalford. The 1934 GWR locomotive allocation lists 2-6-2T 31xx class no.3171 as based at Brimscombe and in the 1960s this would have been a 2-6-2T of the 51xx or 61xx classes. Closure of the station came on 2 November 1964 following the withdrawal of local stopping passenger services on the line. Goods traffic had ceased the previous year on 12 August 1963. Almost all traces of the station have gone and it appears that the adjacent A419 road has been realigned through the eastern side of the station. Services This halt was served by the Gloucester to Chalford local passenger services, known as the Chalford Auto. Brimscombe station site today bereft of platforms.

This is done by aggregating the information in a single computer \\"Browse Master\\" (or \\"Master Browser\\"). All other computers contact this computer for information and display in the Network Neighborhood window. Browser service runs on MailSlot / Server Message Block and thus can be used with all supported transport protocol such as NetBEUI, IPX/SPX and TCP/IP. Browser service relies heavily on broadcast, so it is not available across network segments separated by routers. Browsing across different IP subnets need the help of Domain Master Browser, which is always the Primary Domain Controller (PDC). Therefore, browsing across IP subnets is not possible in a pure workgroup network. In Windows XP In Windows XP, Computer Browser Service provides backwards compatibility for versions that don't use Active Directory. For My Network Places, Windows Explorer, and the net view command, Computer Browser is still needed in XP.Microsoft: What Is Computer Browser Service? Windows NT Windows NT uses the Computer Browser service to collect and display all computers and other resources on the network. For example, opening Network Neighborhood displays the list of computers, shared folders, and printers; the Computer Browser service manages this list. Every time Windows NT boots up, this service also starts. Computer Browser is responsible for two closely related services: building a list of available network resources, and sharing this list with other computers. All Windows NT computers run the Computer Browser service, but not all of them are responsible for building the list. Most computers will only retrieve the list from the computers that actually collect the data and build it. Windows NT computers can therefore have different roles. Let's take a look at them: Domain master browser: In NT domains, the primary domain controllers (PDCs) handle this role. The PDCs maintain a list of all available network servers located on all subnets in the domain. They get the list for each subnet from the master browser for that subnet. On networks that have only one subnet, the PDC handles both the domain master browser and the master browser roles. Master browsers: Computers maintaining this role build the browse list for servers on their own subnet and forward the list to the domain master browser and the backup browsers on its own subnet. There is one master browser per subnet. Backup browsers: These computers distribute the list of available servers from master browsers and send them to individual computers requesting the information. For example, when you open Network Neighborhood, your computer contacts the backup browser and requests the list of all available servers. Potential browsers: Some computers don't currently maintain the browse list, but they're capable of doing so if necessary, which designates them as potential browsers. If one of the existing browsers fails, potential browsers can take over. Nonbrowsers: These are computers that aren't capable of maintaining and distributing a browse list.

Latitude The northernmost point in the Commonwealth is in the far north of Canada. Cape Columbia, on Ellesmere Island, in the territory of Nunavut lies at 83°08″41′N. Nunavut is a full part of Canada, which is an active member of the Commonwealth, making its position as the northernmost point uncontroversial. The southernmost point in the Commonwealth depends on whether the Antarctic claims of three of the Commonwealth's members – Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom – are counted. If so, the southernmost point is the South Pole (by definition, 90°S), where those three claims (and those of other, non-Commonwealth, countries) meet. However, these claims are generally not recognised, except by some or all other claimants to Antarctica. If Antarctic claims are not included, Thule Island, in the British overseas territory of South Sandwich Islands, lies farthest south, at 59°27″00′S. These, still, are overseas territories of a Commonwealth member. Including only integral parts of members, the most southern point is Jacquemart Island, New Zealand, at 52°37″10′S. Longitude Using lines of longitude (rather than the International Date Line), the easternmost and westernmost points in the Commonwealth are the same, as the 180th meridian goes through three Fijian islands, as well as New Zealand's Antarctic Ross Dependency. The three Fijian islands are Vanua Levu (far eastern peninsula, near Nambouono), Taveuni (centre of the island), and Rabi (western tip). Using the International Date Line yields different results for the most easternmost and westernmost points, as it is drawn such that all Commonwealth members lie either to the west or east of it – and not across it – to simplify administration. In this case, the westernmost point is on Banaba Island, in Kiribati, at 169°32'13\\"E. The easternmost point is on Niue, a state in free association with New Zealand, at 169°52'11\\"W. Including only territories that are themselves directly members of the Commonwealth, the westernmost point would be on Vatoa, Fiji, at 178°15'W. Elevation The highest point in the Commonwealth by elevation above sea level is the summit of K2, which lies at 35°52′57″N 76°30′48″E, on the border between Pakistan and China. At , it is the world's second-tallest mountain. The most-prominent peak in the Commonwealth is Kilimanjaro (in Tanzania), which has a prominence of , making it the fourth-most prominent peak in the world. The result is significantly different as K2 is only the 22nd-most prominent peak in the world, due to its proximity to Mount Everest. The lowest point in the Commonwealth by elevation below sea level is the shore of Lake Eyre, which lies at 28°22′S 137°22′E, in Australia. It lies approximately below sea level.

He was one of the very few KMT commanders who could defeat both the Imperial Japanese Army and Communist PLA in the Second Sino-Japanese War and Chinese Civil War, respectively. Whampoa Military Academy Liu enrolled in the fourth cadet class in 1925. Some of his well-known classmates included Lin Biao, Hu Lien, and Zhang Lingfu. After graduation, he participated in the Northern Expedition and Central Plains War and was promoted to the commander of the 5th Regiment, the 2nd Division when the Sino-Japan War began. Second Sino-Japanese War In fact, Liu had already experienced fighting with Imperial Japanese Army in 1933, during the Defense of the Great Wall, in which he suffered a minor wound. After the war against Japan broke out in 1937, he distinguished himself in the Battle of Taierzhuang, Battle of Wuhan. In 1939, he was promoted to the brigade commander and also the garrison commander of Changsha and fought against the Japanese Army in the First Battle of Changsha. In 1941, his commander Guan Linzheng promoted him to the post of the commander of the 2nd Division, the 52nd Corps, while the corps stationed in Yunan. In 1945, he led the 2nd Division to Vietnam to accept the surrender of Japanese Army there. When the Chinese communist forces invaded Manchuria, Liu's 52nd Corps were sent to Manchuria to fight with the communist forces under his former classmate, Lin Biao. Chinese Civil WarRecovery of Shenyang= In September 1945, the Soviet Red Army of USSR occupied Shenyang. In March 1946, the Red Army withdrew from Shenyang and the KMT took over the city. Soon afterward, the PLA started large offensive operations against Shenyang. Liu was commander of KMT troops, and CPC's commander was Lin Biao, Liu's former classmate who had now become his enemy. Both men were fighting for the control of the city. Liu defeated Lin Biao's troops and won the battle, recovering Shenyang successfully at last, and after this victory Liu was promoted to lieutenant general. This battle was one of the early engagements in Manchuria where KMT had initial success. =Refusal to obey Chiang's order= When the Liaoshen Campaign broke out in September 1948, Liu's 52nd Corps was part of the 9th army. The 9th army was tasked personally by Chiang Kai-shek to relieve the city of Jinzhou, and both 9th army commander General Liao Yaoxiang and Liu knew that the city was a lost cause, so they suggested to President Chiang Kai-shek if the relief effort was not successful that the 9th army should withdraw to Yinkou via sea. Chiang and nationalist overall commander in Manchuria, General Wei Lihuang agreed their proposal. But the 9th army failed both objectives and on 26 October, the Communist Manchurian Field Army captured General Liao and took 100,000 nationalist soldiers as their prisoners. =Yingkou retreat= When CPC won the Liaoshen Campaign, KMT still had 50,000 troops near Yingkou port when CPC began the final siege of the city. Liu's 52nd Army fought in rear guard actions to help those 50,000 men retreat to friendly territories such as Shanghai by sea, On 31 October 1948 Liu boarded the last KMT naval ship to leave port when communist rocket and mortar fires fell on the beach. At this point he became extremely emotional and cried because he knew that KMT had lost the whole of Manchuria forever. =Trained in Command and General Staff College= Liu succeed his classmate Hu Lien as commander of Kinmen defense area and was sent to United States to study by Chiang Kai-shek. He was one of the few Chinese generals who graduated from an American military academy besides General Sun Li-jen.

Margaret Lockwood was originally announced to play the role, but was replaced by Jean Kent. Lockwood wrote in her memoirs that she felt it was \\"a very poor and unsuitable role... I was so offended by the script that, although I was under contract, I had made up my mind I would not accept it.\\" At the suggestion of Phyllis Calvert they went to see J. Arthur Rank, who neither had met. Lockwood said \\"he was absolutely charming, heard both of us voice our opinions on various scripts, and, as far as I was concerned, upheld my determination not to accept the part of Bianca.\\"Lockwood p 135 Kent later recalled \\"I had marvellous costumes in that bit not a very good part. You expect she [Bianca] is going to do something and she never does. It's a film that went wrong. Originally I believe they wanted Margaret Lockwood to play it. Presumably then it would have been a much better part, I don't know what happened. Bernard Knowles was a very good cameraman but not a director.\\"Brian MacFarlane, An Autobiography of British Cinema, Methuen 1997 p 340 (Kent routinely played roles devised for Lockwood.) Producer R. J. Minner said that: > We are doing it [the film] as delicately as possible, as a study of sacred > and profane love. Paganini's relationship with Bianca is rather a tricky > business to get past the Hays Office, but we hope, with tact, to manage it. > He knew Bianca all his life. He couldn't do it without her. She sang at all > his concerts. He kept quarrelling with her and coming back to her. She made > him ill and nearly killed him, and in the end he left her. Granger was given two violin tutors. Menuhin used two violins and spent six weeks recording tracks. ReceptionBox office= More traditional Gainsborough melodramas like The Wicked Lady andCaravan made the list of popular British films for 1946 but not The Magic Bow.Robert Murphy, Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939-48 2003 p209 =Critical reception= In their review, The New York Times concluded, \\"...the behind- the-scenes playing of Yehudi Menuhin as the violinist, drawing his magic bow over the compositions of Paganini, Tartini and Beethoven, is in itself almost worth the price of admission. Stewart Granger, playing Paganini, offers creditable make-believe as a violinist and does his best to play the man in a forthright manner. Considering the script, that is something of an accomplishment. Phyllis Calvert, as the other half of the romance, does well under the same handicaps, while Jean Kent and Dennis Price, aso facing script difficulties, do the best they can as a couple of jilted lovers. What few pleasant moments occur in the film — outside of the splendid musical sequences — fall to Cecil Parker as Paganini's manager. He presided over the two or three occasions when the audience laughed.\\" The film was entered in the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.

Italo Selvelli Biography Italo Giovanni Selvelli was born in Constantinople in 1863. His parents were Michele Selvelli (Fano, Italy, 1825 - Constantinople, 1895) and Maria Sigalla (Syros, Greece, 1838 - Constantinople, 1904). Italo Selvelli attended the Royal College of Music of Palermo between 1876 and 1881. Since 1887 he was active in conducting operas, operettas and ballets at the Nouveau Theatre and Concordia Theatre of Constantinople. Throughout his life he also practised as a music teacher for several members of the Ottoman aristocracy. On 16 June 1889 he married Anna Maria Pussich (1866-1954) who gave him two sons and two daughters. In 1891 Italo Selvelli was appointed director of the orchestra and the music school of Tophane, the first non-military band of the Ottoman Empire, founded by Zeki Pasha. In 1909, when Sultan Reşâd came to the Imperial throne with the name of Mehmed V, an open competition was called for deciding the new official march of the Sultan. To be chosen was Italo Selvelli's polyphonic composition, since then known as the \\"Reşadiye Marşı\\" (\\"March of Mehmed V Resad\\"). This march was actually the last official personal march of a Sultan in the history of the Ottoman Empire, as the subsequent and final Sultan Mehmed VI, who ascended the throne in 1918 in a difficult political situation, refused to adopt a personal march. Italo Selvelli died on 11 May 1918, most likely from an anthrax infection. He is buried in the Osmanbey Christian Cemetery of Istanbul.

She married the 29-year old Robert Thompson Crawshay on 15 May 1846 at St Peter's Church, Caversham. He was the last of the Merthyr Tydfil ironmasters. She became the mistress of the 72 roomed and 15 towered Cyfarthfa Castle. Her home in the 1840s The marriage was not happy but they did have five children William Thompson in 1847, Rose Harriette Thompson the following year, Henrietta Louise in 1851, Robert Thompson in 1853 and Richard Frederick in 1859. The following year her husband had a stroke which left him deaf. She involved herself in public life and encouraged the idea of reforming matrimonial law. She was not keen on Welsh culture and she joined the National Society for Women's Suffrage founded by Lydia Becker in 1867. She became a Vice President of the Bristol and West of England National Society for Women's Suffrage. In 1870 women were first allowed to become members of school boards. The following year she had joined the school board in Merthyr Tydfil and she not only joined but chaired the school board at Vaynor. No woman before 1900 sat on two school boards, and Crawshay chaired one and was re-elected twice retiring in 1879. Meanwhile in 1872 she had helped form the Swansea Training College which was the first facility in Wales where women could train to be qualified teachers. She created the Byron, Shelley, Keats In Memoriam Prize Fund in 1888, stated by the British Academy to be the only UK literary prize for female scholars. The Rose Mary Crawshay Prize is now \\"only\\" £500, but it provides a valuable recognition for non-fiction women writers. It has been awards since 1916 by the British Academy.

It is the central tenet of Bhakti Yoga and Bhakti movements, which are seen as reform movements in Hinduism as compared to the Hinduism which finds its origins in the Vedas;The Embodiment of Bhakti, by Karen Pechilis Prentiss, Oxford University Press US, 1999. . Page 3-6. though variously it can mean \\"grace\\", \\"mercy\\", or \\"blessing\\", depending upon the context.Glossary of Sanskrit Terms - Kripa www.swami-krishnananda.org. The Hindi word Kirpala from Sanskrit Kripala means \\"kind\\" and is used as a given name for males, while \\"Kripa\\" (Kṛpā), is used as a female given name.  Significance of Kripa  Kripa is akin to similar beliefs prevalent in mysticism of all traditions. In Hinduism as well, the bestowal of divine grace or Kripa is considered an event which catapults a devotee or bhakta into a period of intense personal transformation leading to his Moksha. Devotional or Bhakti literature available throughout India is replete with references to Kripa as the ultimate key towards realizing the spiritual path of self-realization Descent of divine grace The Hindu, June 30, 2005. In fact, some like the ancient sage Vasistha, in his classical work Yoga Vasistha, considered it to be the only way to transcend the bondage of lifetimes of Karma. He states to Rama that divine grace or Kripa is the only way to help us go beyond the effects of Prarabdha karma, or collection of all the past Karmas, Sanchita karma chosen to experience during a lifetime. The Hindu philosopher Madhvacharya held that grace was not a gift from God, but rather must be earned.McGreal,Ian. Great Thinkers of the Eastern World. HarperResource, 1995. As Krishna says to Arjuna in the final chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Verse 18.66, \\"Setting aside all meritorious deeds (Dharma), just surrender completely to My will (with firm faith and loving contemplation). I shall liberate you from all sins. Do not fear.\\" Similarly, Adi Shankaracharya composes his famous verse Bhaja Govindam in 8th century, where he declares: :: \\"Bhajagovindam bhajagovindam :: Govindam bhaja muudhamate :: Sampraapte sannihite kaale :: Nahi nahi rakshati dukrijnkarane..\\" :: Translation: ::Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda, :: Worship Govinda. Oh fool! :: Rules of Grammar will not save you :: At the time of your death. The Skanda Purana mentions the grace of a Guru in various places, especially in the Uttarakhand, section Guru Strotram, known as Guru Gita, in the form of a dialogue between Shiva and Uma (Shakti): :: \\"Guru Brahma Guru Vishnu :: Guru Devo Maheshwara :: Guru Sakshat Param Brahma :: Tasmai Shri Gurave Namah\\" :: \\"Dhyana Moolam Guru Murti. :: Puja Moolam Gurur Padam, :: Mantra Moolam Gurur Vakyam, :: Moksha Moolam Guru Kripa\\".Guru Strotram  Bhakti movement  Bhakti or devotion has often remained an ignored aspect in Indian philosophy, hence its significance was lost to majority of the populace. For some time it was considered befitting only to the lower classes and woman, as only the elite were considered able to comprehend the message of the Vedic tradition. Things changed with the revival and reform movements in Hinduism which brought this aspect of Kripa into a new light and made the divine accessible to all, and not just the preserve of the priestly class.Tradition and Modernity in Bhakti Movements, by Jayant Lele. Published by Brill Archive, 1981. . Page 6.  Kinds of Kripa  Kripa has been categorized in various ways as Ishwara kripa (grace of God), variously Hari Kripa, Shastra kripa (grace of the Scriptures), Guru kripa (grace of the Guru) and lastly Atma kripa (grace of the Self).

She has written, edited and co-translated over twenty books, many about Japan, its relationship with the U.S.A., on the changing role of Japanese women in literature, art and society, and about the lasting effect of the Second World War and the desire for reconciliation in contemporary Japanese society. Career During the 1990s, Lowitz helped to bring many modern Japanese poets and fiction writers into English for the first time. She was editor and co-translator with Miyuki Aoyama and Akemi Tomioka of the groundbreaking anthology: A Long Rainy Season: Contemporary Japanese Women’s Poetry (1994), which introduced Western readers to the haiku and tanka (waka) of Fumi Saito, Yuko Kawano, Machi Tawara, Akitsu Ei and thirteen others. Lowitz and Aoyama later published The Collected Tanka of Akitsu Ei (AHA Poetry Press.) A companion volume, Other Side River: Free Verse (1995) featured contemporary Japanese women free-verse poets in translation. It contains the work of three dozen Japanese women writers, including well- known poets as Shiraishi Kazuko, Ishigaki Rin and Ibaragi Noriko, who appeared alongside emerging Korean-Japanese (Zainichi) poets Chuwol Chong, Kyong Mi Park and Ainu poet Mieko Chikapp, among others. The two volumes, A Long Rainy Season and Other Side River, reflect a variety of literary styles and present an astonishing political and social awareness of women in a still male- centered society. Western readers are offered a new perspective on the lives of contemporary Japanese women. In 1993, she collaborated with the shakuhachi master Christopher Yohmei Blasdel on a series of readings and musical performances from these anthologies throughout Northern California. In 1995, Lowitz edited Manoa: Towards a Literature of the Periphery, another anthology of translated Japanese literature, with fiction by Kyoko Murata, Hiromi Itoh, Yoshiko Shibaki, Teru Miyamoto, and Ango Sakaguchi. In 2001, she edited Manoa: Silence to Light: Japan and the Shadows of War, which contained essays by Donald Richie and Ishii Shinpei, last letters of kamikaze pilots (first-time in translation), testimonials from Taiwanese comfort women, voices of student nurses from Okinawa ordered to commit suicide, and war-related fiction and essays by Mishima Yukio, Hayashi Kyoko, Dazai Osamu, Kijima Hajime and Yōko Ogawa. The book also contains manga from Barefoot Gen by Keiji Nakazawa (translated by Frederik Schodt et al.), poetry by Tamura Ryuichi, Ayukawa Nobuo, Ko Un, Sagawa Aki, Ishigaki Choko, and war-related fiction by Mary Yukari Waters and Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston. In 2003, she and Hisako Ifshin translated the prison-camp haiku of World War II internee Itaru Ina, which appeared in Modern Haiku and later in the Emmy Award-winning documentary film From A Silk Cocoon, directed by Satsuki Ina. Lowitz, Ifshin and with Ralph McCarthy also translated the poetry of pop sculptor cum cultural icon Yayoi Kusama (Violet Obsession) in conjunction with Kusama's solo exhibition touring the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the New York Museum of Modern Art and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 1998/99. In 2004, Lowitz edited The Japan Journals 1947-2004 by Donald Richie. From the former curator of film at the New York Museum of Modern Art and the leading Western authority on Japanese film, The Japan Journals include post-war encounters with Yasunari Kawabata, D.T. Suzuki, Yukio Mishima, Toru Takemitsu and Bando Tamasaburo. In 2008, Lowitz with Shogo Oketani translated America and Other Poems by Ayukawa Nobuo. These are war poems by Japan's foremost modernist poet, who was the Japanese translator of T. S. Eliot and a founding member of the Arechi or Waste Land school of poetry, but also an unhappy soldier in the Japanese Imperial Army. This book received the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission Prize for the Translation of Japanese Literature from The Donald Keene Center of Japanese Culture at New York's Columbia University. Lowitz first lived in Tokyo from 1989 to 1994, when she worked as a freelance writer/editor for The Japan Times and the Asahi Evening News and was an art critic for Art in America. She lectured on American Literature and Writing at Rikkyo University and Tokyo University. She was a regular book reviewer for KQED Radio’s Pacific Time, covering Asia and the Pacific Rim, and also reviewed books on Asia for The Japan Times and Manoa (1991-2003). Lowitz's own writing explores the idea of place, displacement and what \\"home\\" means to expatriate women. Her 2001 book Yoga Poems: Lines to Unfold By used the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali to structure her personal quest for a spiritual life. The book has appeared in French, Japanese and Persian editions, with individual poems having been translated into Spanish and Burmese as well. She and Reema Datta later co- authored Sacred Sanskrit Words for Yoga, Chant, and Meditation for Stone Bridge Press. She also writes short stories and essays. After a decade in America (1994-2004) she returned to Tokyo, where she opened a yoga studio. She is currently Contributing Editor for the Kyoto Journal. Lowitz’s work has appeared in hundreds of literary journals including The Huffington Post, Shambhala Sun, Yoga Journal, Best Buddhist Writing of 2011, Harpers, ZYZZYVA, Prairie Schooner, Wingspan (All Nippon Airways in-flight magazine) and anthologies such as Language for A New Century (W.W.

Common names in English include sweet clover (or sweet-clover), sour clover (sour-clover, sourclover), Indian sweet-clover, annual yellow sweetclover, Bokhara clover, small-flowered sweet clover, common melilot, small-flowered melilot, small melilot, sweet melilot, Californian lucerne and Hexham scent. In Australia and New Zealand, where it is naturalised, it is sometimes called King Island melilot or King Island clover. Description It is an annual or biennial herb from in height (rarely to one metre), with yellow flowers. Similar to Melilotus altissima Thuill. in general. The flowers are 2 – 3 mm long they produces a hairless pod of similar length.Webb, D.A., Parnell, J. and Doogue, D. 1996. An Irish Flora. Dundalgan Press Ltd., Dundalk. Taxonomy It was first published as Trifolium indicum by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species plantarum. It was transferred into Melilotus by Carlo Allioni in 1785. Distribution and habitat It has a wide native distribution, ranging from Macaronesia and northern Africa, through Europe, and into temperate and tropical Asia. It is naturalised throughout most of the rest of the world, including the United Kingdom, the United States, South America, Australia and New Zealand. Uses and economic importance It is used as a source of nectar for bees, as forage, and as a soil improver. It is also used in folk medicine. It is poisonous to some mammals, and is a potential seed crop contaminant. In Pakistan, Melilotus indicus is called sinji, which is used as a vegetable. It has many medicinal uses. It has antioxidant properties . It also has alpha- amylase inhibitory activities , because of which it may be useful for type 2 diabetes.

He became popular in the 1960s and 1970s as a French language interpreter of the songs of American and Canadian songwriters such as Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, and Pete Seeger, and remained active into his nineties. Life and career Born in Wellington, New Zealand, he grew up in Hāwera before attending Wellington College. While growing up he heard jazz and American folk songs on radio broadcasts for US troops stationed at Paekakariki and Titahi Bay, and sang with his family at local fairs. He started acting in Wellington at the age of 15, and won a scholarship to attend the Old Vic theatre school in London. He travelled to England by ship, working as a cabin boy to pay his way, and began training and working as an actor in London. He was offered a place at the Royal Shakespeare Company but turned it down so as to move to France in 1948 with his girlfriend Catherine Dasté, a fellow theatre student who was the daughter of actor and theatre director Jean Dasté. Allwright worked as a carpenter on theatre sets while gradually becoming fluent in the French language. He and Catherine married in 1951; they later divorced. Sam Coley, \\"Graeme Allwright Profile\\", Audio Culture, 13 June 2019. Retrieved 17 December 2019 Allwright then worked in the vineyards of Burgundy and ran a theatre group in Pernand-Vergelesses, while learning the guitar and listening to the records of American singers such as Woody Guthrie, Tom Paxton and Pete Seeger. He lived in Blois, where he worked in a psychiatric hospital, and then settled in Dieulefit where he taught English and started a children's theatre group. He discovered an aptitude for translation while adapting New Zealand stories into French for his students, and then, after moving to Saint-Étienne, began translating American songs into French. In the early 1960s he began performing in small clubs in Paris, where he met fellow singer Colette Magny and the actor and singer Marcel Mouloudji, who were impressed with Allwright's ability to adapt the lyrics of writers such as Dylan and Cohen into French. Mouloudji recorded Allwright and released his songs in 1965, firstly on the EP \\"Le Trimardeur\\" (a song adapted from Woody Guthrie's \\"Hard Travelin'\\"), and then on a self-titled LP. The album included adaptations of songs by Guthrie and Oscar Brand as well as several by French songwriter Paul Koulak, and Allwright's own material. He won a recording contract with Mercury Records, and his second album, also entitled Graeme Allwright, was issued in 1968. It featured adaptations of Dylan's \\"Who Killed Davy Moore?\\" (\\"Qui a tué Davy Moore?\\") and Malvina Reynolds' \\"Little Boxes\\" (\\"Petites boites\\"), as well as his own song \\"Il faut que je m'en aille (Les retrouvailles)\\", and became popular with students during the May 68 protests. > Allwright’s songs were perfectly timed to capture the mood of the young > protesters..

Frank, and Roger Miller. His most popular song was the title track, adapted from the Peter, Paul and Mary song \\"Very Last Day\\". The stress caused by the song's unexpected success led Allwright to leave his young family in France and go travelling, initially with a friend to Egypt and Ethiopia, where he spent six months in the city of Harar. He said: \\"I didn’t even think of the singing career I left behind. I was living something completely different and discovering another world.\\" In 1970 he released the album A long distant present from thee...\\"Becoming\\", a collaboration with other musicians described as \\"a sprawling psychedelic album that draws on his experiences in India\\", followed by the English-language album Recollections (1971), and Jeanne d'Arc (1972), comprising his own material as well as songs by Leonard Cohen. Over the next few years, Allwright developed a tendency to record an album and then leave France for some time to travel in Africa, India, and the Americas, which enhanced his cult status in France. In the mid-1970s he lived for 18 months on Réunion in the Indian Ocean. He became friendly with Cohen, who approved of his adaptations, and in 1973 Allwright released the album Graeme Allwright chante Leonard Cohen. The same year, he released the double live album A l'Olympia. He continued to release albums through the 1970s, culminating in the 1979 album Condamnés?. In 1980 he played a series of concerts with Maxime Le Forestier, recorded on the album Enregistrement Public au Palais des Sports, with the royalties donated to children's charities. In 1985 he released a collection of songs by Georges Brassens. He continued his campaigning activities, protesting against the French government's nuclear testing in the Pacific, and the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985. Allwright later worked on film soundtracks, and recorded an album of songs for children. He released the album Tant de Joies, a collaboration with American jazz trombonist Glenn Ferris, in 2000. In 2005, he made a rare return to New Zealand to perform. He performed until the 2010s to spread his non-violent message of working in our conscience to change inegalitarian society. In the 2000s, together with Sylvie Dien, he wrote new lyrics to the French national anthem, \\"La Marseillaise\\", to make it a song of peace rather than of war.Performance of new lyrics of 'La Marseillaise'.

(1937 – 2007) was a South African jazz guitarist born in Postmas in the Northern Cape province. Biography Growing up in the town of Benoni in the Gauteng province of South Africa, his first passion for music came while watching cowboy movies and Fourie wanted to imitate the sound of the musicians. After hearing the George Shearing Quintet in 1949, he focused on jazz music.Schadeberg, Jurgen. Jazz, Blues & Swing: Six Decades of Music in South Africa, p. 151 (New Africa Books, 2007). At the age of 15, he left his parents' house in order to pursue his career in jazz guitar playing. His first gigs were with Boeremusiek (traditional South African Afrikaans music) bands, and he quickly gained recognition as a great guitarist in the Johannesburg music scene of the 1950s. In 1961, Fourie took a boat to London. In the first two weeks, his money ran out and his wife was becoming desperate. Fourie then got his first gig playing with an Eastern European violinist at the Blue Boar Inn. He described the situation: \\"What I saw in Soho forced me to leave in November on a boat destined for London with my wife and baby and about two hundred Rand\\". A short while after this, Fourie auditioned for the Ray Ellington Quartet of The Goon Show fame, and worked in London with jazz greats like Ellington and Tubby Hayes. Following the end of apartheid, he became a professor of jazz at the Technikon University in Pretoria, and told his students about the Ellington audition: \\"This was the biggest test of my life. It was a make or break period. I could not read the notes and initially I was turned down, but when they heard me play they told me that they would like me to perform. I was very exhilarated, but had no ability to read music. I had two weeks to memorize four years of work. It was the moment of truth and I passed!\\" After this, Fourie become the resident guitarist for the esteemed jazz club, Ronnie Scott's. Here, he was exposed to Bill Evans, Jim Hall, René Thomas, Freddie Hubbard, Stan Getz, Roland Kirk and Sonny Rollins, among others. After London, he returned to South Africa to go and practice the new style of jazz fusion, which began its growth during the 1970s. After this, he briefly settled in New York, where he worked with John McLaughlin, the famous British jazz/fusion guitarist. He then taught students the guitar in South Africa for the remainder of his career. Fourie formed a band with friends Johnny Boshoff and Hennie Becker and played covers of John Mclaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra at The Branch Office club in Johannesburg. McLaughlin said of him: \\"Johnny Fourie is one of the greatest guitar players of our époque.\\" ReferencesFurther reading *Johnny Fourie and his influence on the development of the jazz guitar in South Africa; Master's thesis by Jonathan Crossley External links *Johnny Fourie - a detailed biography by Jonathan Crossley (first published in Rootz Magazine 2002) *Obituary (20 August 2007, Mail & Guardian) *\\"Memories of a Guitar Master: Johnny Fourie\\" by Stefan Joubert (student of Johnny Fourie) Category:South African jazz guitarists Category:2007 deaths Category:1937 births Category:20th-century guitarists ","title":"Johnny Fourie"},{"id":"20948963","text":"Un giorno nella vita (\\"A Day in Life\\") is a 1946 Italian war film directed by Alessandro Blasetti.

It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings. Its first use was in the SMART Information Retrieval System. Definitions Documents and queries are represented as vectors. :d_j = ( w_{1,j} ,w_{2,j} , \\\\dotsc ,w_{t,j} ) :q = ( w_{1,q} ,w_{2,q} , \\\\dotsc ,w_{n,q} ) Each dimension corresponds to a separate term. If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector is non-zero. Several different ways of computing these values, also known as (term) weights, have been developed. One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting (see the example below). The definition of term depends on the application. Typically terms are single words, keywords, or longer phrases. If words are chosen to be the terms, the dimensionality of the vector is the number of words in the vocabulary (the number of distinct words occurring in the corpus). Vector operations can be used to compare documents with queries. Applications 250px Relevance rankings of documents in a keyword search can be calculated, using the assumptions of document similarities theory, by comparing the deviation of angles between each document vector and the original query vector where the query is represented as a vector with same dimension as the vectors that represent the other documents. In practice, it is easier to calculate the cosine of the angle between the vectors, instead of the angle itself: : \\\\cos{\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{d_2} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{q}}{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{d_2} \\\\right\\\\ \\\\left \\\\ \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\right\\\\} Where \\\\mathbf{d_2} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{q} is the intersection (i.e. the dot product) of the document (d2 in the figure to the right) and the query (q in the figure) vectors, \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{d_2} \\\\right\\\\ is the norm of vector d2, and \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\right\\\\ is the norm of vector q. The norm of a vector is calculated as such: : \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\right\\\\ = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n q_i^2} Using the cosine the similarity between document dj and query q can be calculated as: :\\\\mathrm{cos}(d_j,q) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{d_j} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{q}}{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{d_j} \\\\right\\\\ \\\\left \\\\ \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\right\\\\} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum _{i=1}^N w_{i,j}w_{i,q}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum _{i=1}^N w_{i,j}^2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum _{i=1}^N w_{i,q}^2}} As all vectors under consideration by this model are element wise nonnegative, a cosine value of zero means that the query and document vector are orthogonal and have no match (i.e. the query term does not exist in the document being considered). See cosine similarity for further information.  Term frequency-inverse document frequency weights In the classic vector space model proposed by Salton, Wong and Yang G. Salton , A. Wong , C. S. Yang, A vector space model for automatic indexing, Communications of the ACM, v.18 n.11, p.613–620, Nov. 1975 the term-specific weights in the document vectors are products of local and global parameters. The model is known as term frequency-inverse document frequency model. The weight vector for document d is \\\\mathbf{v}_d = [w_{1,d}, w_{2,d}, \\\\ldots, w_{N,d}]^T, where : w_{t,d} = \\\\mathrm{tf}_{t,d} \\\\cdot \\\\log{\\\\frac{D}{\\\\\\\\{d' \\\\in D \\\\,  \\\\, t \\\\in d'\\\\\\\\}}} and * \\\\mathrm{tf}_{t,d} is term frequency of term t in document d (a local parameter) * \\\\log{\\\\frac{D}{\\\\\\\\{d' \\\\in D \\\\,  \\\\, t \\\\in d'\\\\\\\\}}} is inverse document frequency (a global parameter). D is the total number of documents in the document set; \\\\\\\\{d' \\\\in D \\\\,  \\\\, t \\\\in d'\\\\\\\\} is the number of documents containing the term t. Advantages The vector space model has the following advantages over the Standard Boolean model: #Simple model based on linear algebra #Term weights not binary #Allows computing a continuous degree of similarity between queries and documents #Allows ranking documents according to their possible relevance #Allows partial matching Most of these advantages are a consequence of the difference in the density of the document collection representation between Boolean and term frequency-inverse document frequency approaches. When using Boolean weights, any document lies in a vertex in a n-dimensional hypercube. Therefore, the possible document representations are 2^n and the maximum Euclidean distance between pairs is \\\\sqrt{n}. As documents are added to the document collection, the region defined by the hypercube's vertices become more populated and hence denser. Unlike Boolean, when a document is added using term frequency-inverse document frequency weights, the inverse document frequencies of the terms in the new document decrease while that of the remaining terms increase. In average, as documents are added, the region where documents lie expands regulating the density of the entire collection representation. This behavior models the original motivation of Salton and his colleagues that a document collection represented in a low density region could yield better retrieval results. Limitations The vector space model has the following limitations: #Long documents are poorly represented because they have poor similarity values (a small scalar product and a large dimensionality) #Search keywords must precisely match document terms; word substrings might result in a \\"false positive match\\" #Semantic sensitivity; documents with similar context but different term vocabulary won't be associated, resulting in a \\"false negative match\\". #The order in which the terms appear in the document is lost in the vector space representation. #Theoretically assumes terms are statistically independent. #Weighting is intuitive but not very formal. Many of these difficulties can, however, be overcome by the integration of various tools, including mathematical techniques such as singular value decomposition and lexical databases such as WordNet.

The Church conducts Mass every day in English, Konkani, and Portuguese. The colonial Portuguese Baroque style church was first built in 1541 as a chapel on a hill side overlooking the city of Panjim. It was eventually replaced by a larger church in the 1600s as part of Portuguese Goa's religious expansion. This church houses the ancient bell that was removed from the Augustinian ruins of the Church of Our Lady of Grace (Nossa Senhora da Graça) in the once famed city of Old Goa. This bell is considered to be the second largest of its kind in Goa, surpassed only by the Golden Bell which resides in the Sé Cathedral in Old Goa. History A chapel was first built in Panaji in 1541, to serve the religious needs of Portuguese sailors at their first port of call in colonial Portuguese India. At that time the settlement was a small fishing village. It became a Parish in 1600, and in 1609 the small chapel was replaced by the present day large church to minister to the residents and sailors. In the 18th century the stairways, in a symmetrical zigzag form, were added to the church. The second largest church bell in Goa was installed in a bell tower in 1871. It was formerly at the Augustinian Monastery on Holy Hill, and was retrieved after the monastery was damaged.The largest church bell in Goa is at the Se Cathedral . Location 240px The church is located in Panjim and sits atop a hill facing the square below. The city's municipal garden (Garcia da orta) lies to its southeast and can be seen from atop the hill. The site was once the location of a colonial port landing where ships sailing from Lisbon made first call, and where sailors disembarked before proceeding further inland to Ela (now Old Goa) – the capital of Goa until the 19th century. A laterite stone walkway with ziz-zag stairs ascend the church while lines of thin and tall palm trees form part of the scene. Architecture Exterior = The exterior facade of the church, rich with Portuguese Baroque style architectural elements is painted a bright white to signify the Immaculate virgin, Mary. The tall belfry centered atop the facade houses the bell from the Augustinian Monastery. The imposing facade is distinctive with its two towers and centrally placed taller belfry. It can be seen from a great distance and is often known as the ‘crown’ of Panjim. The church is laid out in the orthodox cruciform fashion with a nave and a transept. The steps are possibly remodeled after the Nossa Senhora da Peneda Sanctuary in Penada and the Bom Jesus do Monte church in Braga, Portugal. 300px =Interior= The interior of the church is not extravagant, but is colorful. The main altar, which has an elegant decor, is dedicated to Mother Mary. There are two other intricately carved, gold plated and decorated altars on either side of the main altar. The one to the left is of Jesus's Crucifixion and the one to the right is of the Our Lady of the Rosary. These two altars are flanked by marble statues of St Peter and St Paul. On festive occasions, the wooden structural elements, which form part of the vaulted ceiling above the altars, are festooned with twines of blue and white flowers, an indication of the external color scheme of the church. There is also a chapel of St. Francis Xavier, located in the south transept to the right side of the main altar; the statues in this chapel are enclosed in a glass case. Festival During the Festival of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, held every year on 8 December, the church is colourfully illuminated. A fair is also part of this festival.

It consists of the detection of the semantic arguments associated with the predicate or verb of a sentence and their classification into their specific roles. For example, given a sentence like \\"Mary sold the book to John\\", the task would be to recognize the verb \\"to sell\\" as representing the predicate, \\"Mary\\" as representing the seller (agent), \\"the book\\" as representing the goods (theme), and \\"John\\" as representing the recipient. This is an important step towards making sense of the meaning of a sentence. A semantic analysis of this sort is at a lower- level of abstraction than a syntax tree, i.e. it has more categories, thus groups fewer clauses in each category. For instance, \\"the book belongs to me\\" would need two labels such as \\"possessed\\" and \\"possessor\\" whereas \\"the book was sold to John\\" would need two other labels such as \\"goal\\" (or \\"theme\\") and \\"receiver\\" (or \\"recipient\\") even though these two clauses would be very similar as far as \\"subject\\" and \\"object\\" functions are concerned. History The FrameNet project produced the first major computational lexicon that systematically described many predicates and their corresponding roles. Daniel Gildea (University of California, Berkeley / International Computer Science Institute) and Daniel Jurafsky (currently teaching at Stanford University, but previously working at University of Colorado and UC Berkeley) developed the first automatic semantic role labeling system based on FrameNet. The PropBank corpus added manually created semantic role annotations to the Penn Treebank corpus of Wall Street Journal texts. Many automatic semantic role labeling systems have used PropBank as a training dataset to learn how to annotate new sentences automatically.

God Help the Girl is also the name of the band and the accompanying film released in 2014. The songs are about a Scottish girl who is hospitalized after a nervous breakdown. Two songs (Funny Little Frog and Act of the Apostle) were taken from the repertory of Belle and Sebastian.  Origin of the project  The author of the project God Help the Girl is Stuart Murdoch, lead singer of the Glasgow- based Scottish indie pop group Belle and Sebastian. In 2004, during a tour promoting their album Dear Catastrophe Waitress, he came up with the idea of writing a series of songs telling about the life of girls and young women which could be sung not by his group but female vocalists. Thinking about this project, he started writing new songs which were shelved for the time being; after some time the idea of arranging them in a logical whole and making a film occurred to him. Looking for performers for his songs, Murdoch placed an advertisement in a local magazine in Glasgow in 2004. The first vocalists who joined the project were Celia García from Edinburgh, Scotland, who responded to the advertisement placed in the magazine, and Alex Klobouk from Germany, who met Stuart Murdoch on the Dear Catastrophe Waitress tour. Stuart Murdoch also held an open audition on the imeem community portal – the candidates who wanted to work with the group were to send in their demos of two Belle and Sebastian songs: Funny Little Frog and The Psychiatrist Is In. Brittany Stallings and Dina Bankole from the US were chosen out of about 400 applications; in February 2008 they were invited to a trial recording session in Glasgow. Eventually Funny Little Frog was sung in the project by Brittany Stallings, with Dina Bankole performing some of the other pieces. In 2008 and 2009, some other vocalists joined the project, including Asya from the Seattle-based group Smoosh, Linnea Jönsson from the Swedish band Those Dancing Days; there was also one man in this group: Neil Hannon from The Divine Comedy.  Work with Catherine Ireton  The main discovery of the project turned out to be Catherine Ireton, with whom Murdoch had established contact by chance in 2005. Catherine Ireton comes from Limerick in Ireland, she was studying Drama and Theatre Studies at University College Cork between 2002 and 2005. There she was the vocalist in the pop-jazz group elephant,See information about the band on website . with whom she published the album In the Moon in 2004. The band broke up in July 2005, but before that the songwriter and guitarist of elephant, Michael John McCarthy, moved to Glasgow to do a post-graduate course and passed the album In the Moon to his friend who showed it to Stuart Murdoch. When Stuart Murdoch heard the album of elephant, he invited Catherine Ireton, who was in her final year at university and both directed and played in theatre performances in Ireland at that time, to Glasgow in March 2005, held a trial recording session for her and afterwards asked her if she wanted to work with Belle and Sebastian. The singer agreed and moved to Scotland in the same year. She joined the project along with other vocalists, singing and recording demos of nearly all the songs. Catherine Ireton appeared on the sleeve of the EP The White Collar Boy as early as 2006 even though she did not perform any songs on it. Finally she appeared as the vocalist in the single Come Monday Night and then in the main album God Help the Girl, both released in 2009. Out of 14 pieces on the album, Catherine Ireton performs (solo or with other singers) in 10 songs.  Film  The film of the same name was shot in Glasgow during 2012 and released in 2014. It was premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2014 in the World Cinema Dramatic section, and a European premiere was held on the Berlin International Film Festival in February. The film was awarded a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2014.  Musical releases  The records released within the project include so far three singles, one EP (Stills) and the album God Help the Girl with the following pieces: Come Monday Night – single, released on 11 May 2009: # Come Monday Night (Catherine Ireton) # Howard Jones Is My Mozart (Kim Moore) God Help the Girl – the main album of the project, whose recording began in CaVa Studios in Glasgow and which was released on 22 June 2009: # Act of the Apostle (Catherine Ireton) – 2:43 # God Help The Girl (Catherine Ireton) – 3:25 # Pretty Eve in the Tub (Stuart Murdoch and Catherine Ireton) – 2:46 # A Unified Theory (instrumental) – 1:15 # Hiding Neath My Umbrella (Catherine Ireton and Stuart Murdoch) – 3:44 # Funny Little Frog (Brittany Stallings) – 4:04 # If You Could Speak (Catherine Ireton and Anna Miles) – 2:47 # Musician Please Take Heed (Catherine Ireton) – 3:58 # Perfection as a Hipster (Neil Hannon and Catherine Ireton) – 3:26 # Come Monday Night (Catherine Ireton) – 3:28 # Music Room Window (instrumental) – 1:00 # I Just Want Your Jeans (Asya) – 3:24 # I'll Have to Dance with Cassie (Catherine Ireton) – 3:47 # A Down and Dusky Blonde (Asya, Dina Bankole, Catherine Ireton, Celia Garcia, Brittany Stallings) – 4:49 Funny Little Frog – single, released on 31 July 2009: # Funny Little Frog (Brittany Stallings) # Mary's Market (Stuart Murdoch) Stills – EP, released on 3 November 2009: # I'm in Love with the City (Catherine Ireton) # He's a Loving Kind of Boy (Stuart Murdoch) # Stills (Alex Klobouk) # Baby's Just Waiting (Celia Garcia) # The Psychiatrist Is In (Catherine Ireton) Baby, You're Blind – single, released on 24 May 2010: # Baby, You're Blind (Linnea Jönsson) # A Down and Dusky Blonde (Dina Bankole, Catherine Ireton - new version) All the records were published by Belle and Sebastian's home record companies: Rough Trade Records in the UK and Matador Records in the US. The album was promoted in concerts on a short tour which was held in November 2009: during the Crossing Borders Festival in The Hague in the Netherlands (20/11), in the 100 Club in London (21/11), and the Usher Hall in Edinburgh (29/11). The latter featured the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. The above pieces include only part of the music material which has been recorded within the project so far.  Character and themes of the songs  Owing to Stuart Murdoch's authorship and the accompaniment of the group Belle and Sebastian, the songs from the project God Help the Girl much resemble in their musical aspect the other work of Stuart Murdoch and Belle and Sebastian band. These similarities are all the more visible that some of the songs (Funny Little Frog, Act of the Apostle) were taken directly from the band's repertory and were performed earlier by Murdoch himself. In the project God Help the Girl, however, the band limited itself to the accompaniment, the main roles are played by the vocalist – Catherine Ireton and others; which means that the released singles and albums cannot be regarded, strictly speaking, as part of the output of Belle and Sebastian. The invitation of female vocalists to take part in the project resulted from the subject matter of the songs and the planned film: their main character is a girl named Eve, who dropped out of college (where she was not a very good student), starts work, but wants to change her life – she would like to become a singer or a songwriter. She also has many love and other personal problems – she has just absconded from the psychiatric ward. The problems, however, do not look dramatic in the songs in the form as they were written by Murdoch and are performed by the vocalists. Most of the pieces are cheerful in tone, with elements of irony and self- irony; even the more reflective songs, like Come Monday Night, have a cheerful and catchy tune. In the musical aspect, God Help the Girl is a reference to, or even pastiche of British girl bands performing in the 1960s, with a rich orchestral arrangement.
