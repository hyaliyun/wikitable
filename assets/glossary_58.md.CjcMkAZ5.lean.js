Background Hard Spun is a bay horse with a white star standing 16.2 hands high. He is from one of the last crops of three-time leading sire in North America Danzig. Hard Spun was owned during his racing career by Wilmington, Delaware automobile dealer Richard C. Porter, who races under the Fox Hill Farms banner. At maturity, he reached high. Racing career =2006: two- year-old season= Bred for endurance, at age two Hard Spun made his debut on October 22, 2006, at Delaware Park Racetrack, winning by an 8 ¬æ-length margin. He then showed he could handle sloppy tracks when he won the Port Penn Stakes on the same track by five lengths on November 14. In December, he won the 2006 Pennsylvania Nursery Stakes at Philadelphia Park Racetrack, a race won in 2003 by Smarty Jones. =2007: three-year-old season= Hard Spun heads back to the grandstand after a 2nd-place finish in the 2007 Breeders' Cup Classic. Entering the three-year-old racing season in 2007, jockey Mario Pino rode Hard Spun to his fourth straight win, capturing the January's Lecomte Stakes at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans, Louisiana. In his next start on February 19 in the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas, he was sent off as the 2-5 betting favorite. However, the colt finished fourth to winner Teuflesberg, who was ridden by Stewart Elliott. Trainer Larry Jones said that Hard Spun had a difficult time with his footing on Oaklawn's dirt surface and decided to skip the racetrack's Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby. Instead, Hard Spun was sent to compete in the Lane's End Stakes on the Polytrack at Turfway Park in Northern Kentucky. On March 24, Hard Spun scored his fifth win in six starts with a 3¬º-length victory in the Lane's End Stakes in a strong time of 1:49 2/5 for the 1‚Öõ-mile event. Hard Spun was expected to next start in the Blue Grass Stakes on the Polytrack at Keeneland Race Course, but Jones instead decided to go directly to Churchill Downs to see if the colt could handle its dirt surface. Hard Spun passed his test and finished 2nd at the Kentucky Derby on May 5. For Hard Spun's owner, trainer, and veteran jockey, it marked their first entry in America's most prestigious horse race. Hard Spun finished third in the Preakness Stakes and fourth in the Belmont Stakes. On June 2, 2007, owner Richard Porter sold Hard Spun's breeding rights to Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Darley Stud. Hard Spun ran second by 4¬Ω lengths to Any Given Saturday in the $1 million Grade I Haskell Invitational Handicap at Monmouth Park on August 5, 2007.http://sports.si.cnn.com/default.asp?c=cnnsi&page;=horse/news/BJN4095342.htm Third place went to the betting favorite, Curlin. On August 25, 2007, Hard Spun got his first Grade I win in the King's Bishop Stakes at Saratoga Race Course in a time of 1:22:34 over a fast track. On September 29, 2007, he won the 1 1/8 mile Grade II Kentucky Cup Classic Stakes on Polytrack at Turfway Park, beating Kentucky Derby winner Street Sense and earning not only the base purse of $130,000 but a bonus of $150,000 offered by the track to any starter of a Grade I winner for 2006 or 2007. Hard Spun finished second in the Breeders' Cup Classic. Stud record Retired from racing, Hard Spun stood as a stallion for the Darley Stud with an initial stud fee of $50,000. He was based at the Jonabell Farm, Kentucky in 2011. Hard Spun's first two-year-olds reached the racetrack in 2011 and featured the American Champion Three-Year- Old Filly Questing. Hard Spun has also found success as a sire internationally, siring Superlative Stakes winner Red Duke (from first crop), multiple Gr.I winning Australian Le Romain, and Japanese graded stakes winning mare Someries. He is also the sire of Lil Rockerfeller, a graded stakes winning steeplechase runner. In 2014, son Wicked Strong was a favorite for the Kentucky Derby, but finished fourth behind California Chrome, whom he also tied with for fourth in the Belmont Stakes. Hard Spun's most notable progeny includes: * Wicked Strong: In 2014, won Wood Memorial Stakes and Jim Dandy Stakes, 4th Kentucky Derby. * Hard Aces: In 2015, won Gold Cup at Santa Anita Stakes and Louisiana Handicap.

The tunnel is bounded by the bones of the wrist and flexor retinaculum from connective tissue. Normally several tendons from the flexor group of forearm muscles and the median nerve pass through it. There are described cases of variable median artery occurrence. The canal is narrow, and when any of the nine long flexor tendons passing through it swell or degenerate, the narrowing of the canal may result in the median nerve becoming entrapped or compressed, a common medical condition known as carpal tunnel syndrome.  Structure  Carpal tunnel as seen on MRI The carpal bones that make up the wrist form an arch which is convex on the dorsal side of the hand and concave on the palmar side. The groove on the palmar side, the sulcus carpi, is covered by the flexor retinaculum, a sheath of tough connective tissue, thus forming the carpal tunnel. On the side of the radius, the flexor retinaculum is attached to the scaphoid bone, more precisely its tubercle, as well as the ridge of trapezium. On the ulnar side it is attached to the pisiform and hook of hamate. The narrowest section of the tunnel is located a centimetre beyond the mid-line of the distal row of carpal bones where the sectional area is limited to 1.6 cm2. The tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus pass through a common ulnar sheath, while the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus passes through a separate radial sheath. The mesotendon shared by these tendons is attached to the radial and palmar walls of the carpal tunnel. Superficial to the carpal tunnel and the flexor retinaculum, the ulnar artery and ulnar nerve pass through the ulnar tunnel/Guyon's canal. Function Transverse section across the wrist and carpals; the palm is at the top (carpal tunnel not labeled but visible at centre) Ten structures pass through the carpal tunnel, most of them flexor tendons (not the muscles themselves): * flexor digitorum profundus (four tendons) * flexor digitorum superficialis (four tendons) * flexor pollicis longus (one tendon) * Median nerve between tendons of flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis The flexor carpi radialis (one tendon), is often incorrectly stated to travel within the carpal tunnel. More precisely, it travels within the fibers of the flexor retinaculum which forms the roof of the carpal tunnel, rather than running inside the tunnel itself. = Effect of wrist movements = Movements in the wrist affect the shape and width of the carpal tunnel. The width decreases considerably during normal range of motion in the wrist and because the carpal bones move in relation to each other with every motion of the hand the bony walls of the tunnel are not rigid. Both flexion and extension increase compression in the carpal tunnel. * Flexing the wrist causes the flexor retinaculum to move closer to the radius which considerably decreases the cross section of the proximal opening of the tunnel. Additionally, the distal end of the capitate presses into the opening. * In extreme extension, the lunate constricts the passage as it is pressed toward the interior of the tunnel. Clinical significance 3D medical animation still of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome is a syndrome characterised by tingling burning and pain (needle, pin) through the course of median nerve particularly over the outer fingers and radiating up the arm, that is caused by compression of the carpal tunnel contents. It is associated with repetitive use, rheumatoid arthritis, and a number of other states. It can be detected using Tinel's sign and the Phalen maneuver. It may be treated non-surgically by splinting and/or corticosteroid injection, though definitive management often requires surgical division of the flexor retinaculum, which forms the roof of the carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel symptoms can sometimes be caused by tight muscles in the neck and shoulder region.

The station began broadcasting from the Radio Caroline ship on 15 July 1973. The station was owned by Belgian businessman Adriaan van Landschoot who ran a chain of companies all named Carnaby: * Carnaby boutiques trading Carnaby Jeans and Jackets * a factory producing the Carnaby clothing * a musical artists management bureau, \\"Adriaan van Landschoot Bvba\\" * a recording and production studio, Carnaby Studios * a record label, Carnaby Records. Van Landschoot's complaints about the lack of radio advertising opportunities on Belgian public radio networks and the prohibition on establishing a commercial radio station made him decide to organize his own \\"Radio Veronica-like\\" offshore radio station aimed at promoting his products. The station broadcast taped programmes aimed at Flemish and Dutch audiences. They were recorded in a studio at Oostburg, Netherlands. In October 1973, the station's contract with Radio Caroline was terminated, following the collapse of the mast on Mi Amigo. The station acquired its own ship, naming it after van Landschoot's wife, the MS Janine. Following three weeks of tests the station recommenced broadcasting on 30 December 1973. Both taped Flemish and mostly live English programmes were broadcast until the station was forced off the air by the Dutch Marine Offences Act. Radio Atlantis closed on the evening of 31 August 1974, the day before the act came into force. (Radio Veronica and Radio North Sea International also closed, though Radio Caroline and its new Belgian partner Radio Mi Amigo defied the act and remained on the air.) It was originally intended that programmes would begin on 15 July 1973, using Mi Amigos 10-kilowatt transmitter on 773 kHz (388 metres, announced as 385). In readiness for this Atlantis adopted a postal address of Postbus 385, Oostburg, which remained the station's address throughout its lifetime. This plan went awry when it was discovered that Mi Amigos 773 kHz transmitter crystal had gone missing. The crystal, which was about the size of a matchbox, had been used as a replacement pawn for the ship's chessboard, and had apparently been thrown overboard when the chess set was replaced. Consequently, when Radio Atlantis launched it was on Mi Amigos 50 kilowatt transmitter, on Caroline's main frequency of 1187 kHz (253 m), although all of the DJ announcements originally gave the wavelength as 385. It has been claimed that Atlantis was the only offshore radio station ever to launch on its announced date, even though it was on the wrong frequency. Broadcasts from Mi Amigo The Caroline DJs who played the Atlantis tapes soon realised that many of the programmes overran their allotted lengths and had to be faded out early to make room for the following ones. A message was sent to the Oostburg studios reminding the Atlantis DJs that there were only 60 minutes in an hour. In October 1973 Mi Amigos lattice antenna mast (itself a replacement for the tubular steel mast that had collapsed a year earlier) fell into the sea during a storm. Caroline's engineers rigged up a temporary horizontal wire antenna but this could only achieve very limited coverage. Meanwhile, Caroline was approached by another Belgian businessman, Sylvain Tack, who had plans for a new Flemish/Dutch station, later to be known as Radio Mi Amigo. Janine Atlantis bought Zondaxonagon, a small and poorly-equipped radio ship that had tried to broadcast Dutch programmes under the name Radio Condor. Van Landschoot renamed the ship MS Janine after his wife. (NOTE: sources differ as to the spelling of the ship's name; alternative spellings include Janine, Janiene and Jeanine. Even the station's official QSL card gives the spelling as Jeaniane. The spelling given in this article is the one actually painted on the ship's bow.) Janine was equipped with two transmitters. First a 10 kilowatt transmitter that had formerly belonged to Radio 270 and Capital Radio (the 1970 offshore pirate station of that name). By this time, however, the transmitter had been cannibalized for spare parts and had to be rebuilt. The second transmitter was a 1 kilowatt RCA transmitter that had been used ten years earlier by the Dutch offshore station Radio Noordzee from the REM- island. This became Radio Atlantis' primary transmitter. A new studio had to be built from scratch, and Atlantis commissioned a new antenna mast from a Dutch shipyard to replace the ship's existing T-aerial. The story of what happened to the mast is a matter of dispute between Radio Atlantis and Radio Caroline. According to Atlantis, Caroline stole the mast to replace the one it had lost. According to Caroline, Atlantis had not paid for the mast so Caroline made an offer to buy it instead. Whatever the truth of the matter, the mast found its way to the MV Mi Amigo instead of the MV Janine. Test transmissions from Janine began on Christmas Day 1973 using the 1 kilowatt transmitter and T-aerial. In an attempt to achieve better coverage of Belgium the ship was anchored close to the Belgian border, from Knokke. Official programming began on December 30. Two days later rival station Radio Mi Amigo went on the air with 50 kilowatts, using the mast that Atlantis had commissioned. In addition to its regular taped Flemish and Dutch programmes by day Atlantis also broadcast an \\"International Service\\" (in practice, an all- English service) from Janine by night. This did not carry commercials but was entirely subsidised by the Flemish Service. Ex-Caroline DJ Steve England was appointed Programme Director for the International Service. England had grown dissatisfied with Caroline's album-oriented rock format, and so he insisted that Atlantis's format should be heavily singles-oriented. Presentation was to be upbeat, fun and humorous, and punctuated by frequent American jingles, as a homage to the pirates of the previous decade. Most of the English programmes were presented live from the ship, although there were also some taped shows. British DJ Ray Warner recorded his programmes in England, in deliberate contravention of the 1967 Marine Offences Act. With its cobbled-together transmitter (the power of which was gradually increased to almost 3 kilowatts), inefficient antenna, repeated frequency changes and interrupted broadcasts, Atlantis never achieved very strong coverage in the United Kingdom, but nevertheless gained a small but loyal cult following. In July 1974, the Belgian authorities threatened Atlantis' advertisers with prosecution under the 1962 Law. The wealthy Van Landschoot's response was to cancel all advertising contracts and meet the station's running costs (estimated at the equivalent of ¬£1,500 sterling per week) out of his own pocket. By this time it was clear that the station's days were numbered. The Dutch Government had finally drafted an anti-pirate bill which was due to come into effect on 1 September. Closedown Atlantis' Flemish Service closed down on 25 August. For the station's final week the International Service ran 24 hours per day, finally closing down with a \\"Goodbye Party\\" from 6:00 to 7:05 PM on 31 August. The following day the tug Onrust raised Janine's anchor and towed the ship into Vlissingen Harbour. The station had been broadcasting announcements asking fans to meet the ship at Vlissingen and say their goodbyes, and a crowd of 1,000 turned up to greet Janine's arrival. Van Landschoot was fined 1,500,000 francs and threatened with five years' imprisonment under the 1962 Act. After appealing directly to King Baudouin, he had his sentence suspended and his fine halved. Radio Atlantis's theme tune was Atlantis by The Shadows, although the Flemish service used a cover version by The Spoetniks. After Atlantis In September 1974, several people with broadcasting equipment, including a 10 kilowatt transmitter, boarded the long- abandoned Gunfleet Lighthouse off the British coast and began to make structural improvements and modifications. On 19 December, the boarders and their equipment were removed by the British authorities. It is believed that this may have been an abortive attempt to relaunch Radio Atlantis. Gunfleet is owned by Trinity House, which because of its responsibility to ensure the safety of shipping does not tolerate trespassers on any of its properties. The mast that Radio Atlantis commissioned remained standing aboard Mi Amigo until the ship sank in 1980, and thereafter remained above water as a marker of the wreck's position for several years. Meanwhile, Radio Mi Amigo, which parted company with Radio Caroline in 1978, was relaunched from its own vessel, MV Magdalena on 1 July 1979, although this only lasted until 21 September 1979 when the MV Magdalena stranded during a Force 8 gale at the shore of Goeree. It was not until 1999 that Van Landschoot admitted the open secret that he had been involved with the relaunch of his former rival station, again aimed at the promotion of his Carnaby clothing and boutiques, and records of artists he was managing at the time: Dream Express, its offspring L.B.S., Luke and Puzzle. In 1980 he established a new record company, Mouse Music. The company specialized in dance records, which were heavily promoted via discotheques and vrije radio (\\"free radio\\": unlicensed, commercially-run FM pirate radio stations in Belgium. Such stations existed until 1986/1987 when the remaining stations, most of which had been clustered together, became legalized and licensed). Documentary; Reference In 1982 Steve England produced a documentary LP for the fan organization Offshore Echos, entitled Offshore Echos Presents: The Story of Radio Atlantis, featuring numerous interviews with the station's staff and DJs. This was reissued on CD in 1996.

It is about northwest of the towns of Pemberton and Whistler, and about north of Vancouver, British Columbia. The Lillooet Icecap is one of the largest of several large icefields in the Pacific Ranges which are the largest temperate-latitude glacial fields in the world. At its maximum extent including its glacial tongues it measures east to west and north to south; its central icefield area is approximately in diameter. The Lillooet Icecap is the source of several major rivers which radiate out from it in a wheel pattern. The Lillooet River is fed by the Lillooet Glacier on the icefield's southern flank and runs southeast via Pemberton to Harrison Lake. The Bridge River is fed by the Bridge Glacier on the icefield's eastern flank and runs east to the town of Lillooet. On the icefield's north side are the Taseko River (a tributary of the Chilcotin River), the Lord and Tchaikazan Rivers (tributaries of the Taseko), and the Edmond River which feeds Chilko Lake, the source of the Chilko River, which like the Taseko is a tributary of the Chilcotin River. On the west side of the icecap are the sources of the Southgate River runs to Waddington Harbour at the head of Bute Inlet and shares a common delta with the Homathko River, and the Toba River, which runs to Toba Inlet. The divide between the Lillooet and Southgate Rivers is on the southwestern flank of the icefield and is named Ring Pass. This was investigated for a possible route for the Canadian Pacific Railway but the survey party led by Stanley Smith was lost and never found. The Stanley Smith Glacier and Frank Smith Glacier in the central area of the Lillooet Icecap are named in their memory. Southwest of Ring Pass is the Compton N√©v√©, another large icecap. The Lillooet Icecap and Compton N√©v√© form one contiguous icemass, but because they are two distinct massifs of the lower elevation and active glacial movement in Ring Pass they have been customarily considered to be separate.

Retrieved 24 December 2013. On 1 February 1746, the Jacobites abandoned the siege of Stirling Castle and withdrew to Inverness to wait for spring.

Retrieved 24 December 2013. Advance elements of the Jacobite force arrived outside the fort on 8 March; operations began on 20 March but made little progress. When the Duke of Cumberland and his army left Aberdeen in early April, the besiegers were recalled to Inverness and the siege abandoned. Background Modern day Fort William pier; control of the sea and loch allowed the defenders to be resupplied, while the ships also provided fire support After the 1715 Rising, a line of forts was built along what is now the Caledonian Canal, the most important being Fort George, Inverness, Fort Augustus and Fort William. The garrisons were reinforced when the 1745 Rising began but the defences had been neglected and were in a poor state. It was not until the Jacobites retreated from Stirling Castle in February 1746 that a serious effort was made to capture them. The capture of Fort Augustus on 1 March left Fort William as the last government-controlled position in the Great Glen. On 5 March, an engineer named Russell arrived to inspect the defences and after making some improvements, he reported it should easily be held. The current governor Alexander Campbell was a \\"careful and good man\\", but there were doubts about his competence; on 15 March 1746, he was replaced by Captain Caroline Frederick Scott of Guise's Regiment. The garrison totalled around 400 men; two companies from Guise's, two from Johnsons and one from the Campbell of Argyll Militia. A well-built, modern position, its triangular shape was designed to use the head of Loch Linnhe as cover; it had six 12-pounder cannon, eight 6-pounders, seven smaller pieces, two 13-inch mortars and eight coehorns, with plenty of ammunition. Additional firepower was provided by the sloop of war Baltimore and the Serpent, a bomb vessel; this made it a formidable target, its only weakness being lack of a permanent water supply. On 25 February 1746, the garrison began demolishing buildings in the nearby village of Maryburgh to provide a clear field of fire, although they could not prevent the besiegers occupying the surrounding heights. The Jacobite force from Fort Augustus consisted of 150 French regulars under Colonel Stapleton, plus clansmen led by Lochiel and MacDonald of Keppoch. The siege The Jacobites blockaded Loch Linnhe at the Corran Narrows, capturing one of Baltimore's boats and threatening to cut connection between the garrison and the outside world. Alexander Campbell quickly responded and early on 4 March, sent three boats with 71 men to the Narrows from Fort William. They surprised the Jacobite sentries, reportedly killing two men and wounding many others, burning houses and boats. Campbell militia under Argyll destroyed property and livestock in the surrounding area, denying supplies to the Jacobites but also putting pressure on Cameron and MacDonald clansmen to defend their lands. Lochiel and Keppoch wrote to Prince Charles, asking him to sanction reprisals against Clan Campbell and promising to hang one Campbell for every house destroyed. Unlike Fort Augustus, Fort William was a well-designed, modern position; control of the sea meant it could easily be reinforced, while Serpent and Baltimore gave the garrison more firepower than the besiegers. Stapleton considered it too strong for the Jacobites to take and Cumberland apparently considered it a way of diverting Jacobite resources. Charles and his senior Scots commander Lord George Murray agreed with Stapleton but Lochiel and Keppoch insisted, due to the damage caused to their lands by the garrison. Replica of Coehorn mortar; designed for use against infantry, these made little impact on Fort William Stapleton arrived outside the fort on 8 March with the French regulars, followed by Scott on 15th aboard Serpent. The garrison began firing on the Jacobites as they constructed gun positions and one shot injured Grant, the engineer in charge at Fort Augustus. He was replaced by Mirabel de Gordon, whose performance at Stirling was regarded as so incompetent, some suspected he had been bribed. The besiegers opened fire on 20 March but poor roads and lack of horses to pull them meant the heavy guns remained at Inverness; the light guns and mortars available made minimal impression on the walls. In accordance with then prevailing rules of war, the garrison was summoned to surrender on 22 March; unsurprisingly, Scott refused, telling them he would defend the place to 'the last extremity'. It was now clear the Jacobite gun positions on Sugar Loaf Hill and Cow Hill were poorly sited and a new position had to be built higher up Cow Hill. Although the 6-inch guns apparently caused some concern, Scott's counter- battery fire proved effective; clear, moonlit nights prevented the Jacobites getting close without being seen and the only opportunity for combat was when water parties left the fort. As at Stirling and Carlisle, the Highlanders were not suited to lengthy siege operations, while Baltimore continued to land raiding parties up and down the loch. Frustration at being unable to protect their lands led to disputes between the Camerons and MacDonalds, and also with the French troops who did most of the construction work. On 27 March, a new battery of four 6-pounder guns above the Governor's garden opened fire but the strength of the exterior walls meant the focus shifted to making the interior untenable. On 28th, artillery on the eastern side opened up using heated shot, together with grapeshot, old nails and red-hot lengths of notched iron intended to lodge in the timbers. Bomb vessel, similar to the 'Serpent'; equipped with large fixed mortars, this provided considerable additional firepower for the garrison While this caused substantial damage to the roof and upper works, the fort was otherwise untouched. On the night of 31 March, Scott sent out 150 men to destroy the Jacobite battery; timed to occur when the guard was being relieved, it was left unprotected at the crucial moment. The attackers captured or spiked four 6-inch mortars along with three 4-pounder and one 6-pounder cannon. They then attacked the battery above the Governor's garden but lacking the element of surprise were repulsed. Reinforced by Scott, the assault party returned safely to the fort; casualties were estimated as eleven or twelve on each side. After two weeks, the siege had made little progress and with Cumberland preparing to leave Aberdeen, Prince Charles needed all available men. The Jacobites were ordered back to Inverness, taking only what they could easily carry; on 3 April, the garrison discovered they had gone, leaving guns and heavy equipment behind. Aftermath In the aftermath of the siege, the Baltimore and Terror were employed intercepting French supply ships and preventing clansmen in the Western Highlands and Islands reinforcing the main Jacobite army. In the repression that followed Culloden, Scott conducted the search for Prince Charles, gaining a reputation for brutality; most of the stories lack witnesses but he appears to have actively disliked Highlanders. He transferred to the East India Company in 1752 and died of fever in Calcutta, modern Kolkata. After the Rising, a number of modifications were made to the fort's defences, including a moat on the landward side and strengthening of the ramparts. The fort was manned until 1854, primarily to deter smugglers, then decommissioned in 1864 and sold to the West Highland Railway.

The opening credits of the film, in fact, paid tribute to the author with the words \\"a film by Pietro Germi\\" which is followed only later by \\"directed by Mario Monicelli\\". The film, which made it to number one on the Italian box-office in front of Steven Spielberg's Jaws, was followed by two sequels, Amici miei Atto II (1982, also by Monicelli), Amici miei Atto III (1985), directed by Nanni Loy. Plot Like in many other Monicelli movies, the main theme of Amici miei is friendship, seen from a rather bitter point of view. It tells the story of four middle-aged friends in Florence who organize together idle pranks (called zingarate, \\"gypsy shenanigans\\") in a continuous attempt to prolong childhood during their adult life. Tognazzi (right) attempting to confuse a traffic agent with his \\"Supercazzola\\", a trademark prank consisting of a series of meaningless, fast-spoken phrases. Count Mascetti (Ugo Tognazzi) is an impoverished noble who has no means to support his family, but does not renounce high living pleasures anyway, and has an underage mistress, Titti (Silvia Dionisio). Perozzi (Philippe Noiret) is an easy-living journalist harassed by the unceasing disapproval of his wife and his son. Melandri (Gastone Moschin) is an architect employed by City Hall (for the preservation and restoration of the City's countless monuments), whose main goal is to find the ideal woman. Necchi (Duilio Del Prete) is the owner of a caf√© and pool hall where the friends usually plan their zingarate. During the movie, they are joined by a renowned, military-like surgeon, professor Alfeo Sassaroli (Adolfo Celi), in whose clinic they recover after being hospitalized, injured after a mismanaged zingarata. Melandri falls in love with Sassaroli's wife, exclaiming \\"I've seen the Madonna!\\", only to discover she has psychological problems. The plot is mostly composed of elaborate practical jokes organized by the friends, including the creation of a fake mafia mob in whose \\"criminal acts\\" they involve a pensioner, Righi (Bernard Blier), who used to snatch croissants from the cake tray in Necchi's caf√©, and Mascetti's attempts to save his marriage despite his relationship with Titti. Mascetti widely uses no meaning words that Italian people misunderstand in talking such as \\"supercazzola\\", \\"autoscapellamento\\", \\"sbiligudi\\" and many other ones. The film ends with Perozzi's death, which still does not deprive the friends of their desecrating hijinks, not even in face of their own mortality; Perozzi himself makes a last joke (a \\"supercazzola\\") to the priest. When Perozzi's wife, criticized by Melandri for her lack of tears, comments: \\"One can weep if somebody dies. But here nobody has died\\", Mascetti replies: \\"Well, in reality he had never been so much, but I liked him\\". During the funeral procession they \\"pay homage\\" to their dead friend by telling the wide-eyed Righi that Perozzi was killed for being a traitor to their mafia. Melandri starts sobbing, but not out of sadness, but out of laughter, because Righi believed the hoax. Even the friends begin to laugh, almost unable to control themselves. Righi, believing that they are heartbroken over the loss, begins to be moved for real.

This novel is considered as a fantastic literature for its remarkable description of ‚Äúdreamlike‚Äù themes and the complexion of ‚Äúdouble identity‚Äù portrayed by the character. Its narrative is completely carried out in second person. The first English translation, by Lysander Kemp, was published in 1965 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. It was adapted to the screen in 1966 in La strega in amore, starring Richard Johnson, Rosanna Schiaffino and Gian Maria Volont√©. Plot Felipe Montero is a young historian looking at the newspaper one day when he sees a job posting that catches his eye. The poster is looking for a French-speaker, youthful, passionate about history, and able to perform secretarial duties, who would be a live-in assistant to help organize and finish the memories of her deceased husband, General Llorente. This strikes Montero because he feels as though the posting is describing everything about him, and only lacks his name. For a few days, Montero ignores the posting, assuming someone will have already taken the job, but every day Montero returns to the newspaper, eventually unable to avoid it anymore. The posting gives the address \\"Donceles 815\\", a street mixed with old and new houses, side by side. Upon arriving at the address, Montero finds the house to be completely dark, with the door ajar, as if the owner were waiting for him to arrive. Montero then enters the dark house, and hears a voice in the darkness calling to him. The voice guides him through the dark house, upstairs, to a room where an old widow, Consuelo, is lying in her bed. The old widow appears to be expecting Montero, and immediately begins to explain what she needs Montero to do: organize, finish, and publish her dead husband's journals before her death. While she is explaining this task to Montero, the widow's niece, Aura, enters the room. Montero is mesmerized by the young niece's beauty ‚Äí especially her bright green eyes. Shortly after, the widow directs Montero to the room where he will be living. Montero passes the night in his room, where only a small amount of light is provided. The next morning, Montero wakes up to find Aura in the kitchen preparing breakfast, while the old widow remains in her room in bed. Aura and Montero have breakfast together, though Montero finds the breakfast awkward and long because the young niece barely speaks. Afterwards, Montero heads to the office to begin his work constructing the memories and journals of General Llorente. As he reads the General's writings, he makes some discoveries about Consuelo's infertility, her fantasy of having a child, and her obsession with youth. While working, Montero cannot seem to get the beautiful image of Aura out of his head, and soon begins fantasizing about her. These fantasies eventually begin to grow stronger, and often take over many of Montero's thoughts. Then, over the next few days, Montero realizes a strange connection between the old widow and Aura: often, whenever Consuelo is speaking, Aura's lips will move as well, and motions that Consuelo makes are also made by Aura at the same time. Montero is intrigued by Aura's beauty, and one day enters her room to find her in bed. Montero holds Aura in bed, when suddenly the youthful Aura transforms into the old widow, Consuelo, in his arms, as he himself transforms into the old General Llorente. Throughout the story, Felipe Montero and Aura project the youth of life, and mirror the younger lives of General Llorente and Consuelo. For this reason, Felipe is able to connect so much with the General through his writings, and Aura mirrors the actions and movements of the old widow. The entire story depicts the eventual progression of Felipe Montero's transformation into the General, as well as Aura's transformation into Consuelo.

It was a compact version of the Colt Model 1902 Sporting Model pistol derived from the original Colt M1900. The Colt M1902 Sporting Model and 1903 Pocket Hammer model have significant differences to the military-inspired Colt 1902 Military Model although they fire the same cartridge. Its design is in no way related to the Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless or the FN Model 1903 pistol. Background At a glance, this pistol is visually more similar to the later Colt 1911 than to the Colt 1902 Sporting Model from which it evolved. However, a cursory inspection will show many differences to the Model 1911: the lack of any safety as well as the lack of a slide lock, the magazine release is at the bottom of the grip rather than a button on the side, and a wedge retaining the slide. The locking system uses two links vs. the single link of the later M1911. The two links (one near the muzzle, the other under the chamber) unlocked the barrel in a motion identical to that of a parallel ruler. The drawback to this design was the need for a cross-wedge in the slide near the muzzle, for assembly and dis-assembly. If the slide cracked or the wedge came loose, the slide could exit the frame to the rear, injuring the shooter. The design limited the strength of the cartridge that could be used. It was chambered for the .38 ACP, which is stamped on the slide as \\"Calibre 38 rimless smokeless\\". The .38 ACP was a slightly less powerful cartridge than the 9√ó19mm Parabellum and it is now considered obsolete as there are no new firearms being chambered in .38 ACP. While using a locked breech, the pistol's locking design was not very strong, and was superseded in 1929 by an M1911A1-pattern pistol chambered in .38 Super. The .38 ACP (aka .38 Auto) and the .38 Super use cases with identical dimensions, the only difference being the maximum operating pressures of each. It would be unwise to use new, factory .38 Super ammunition in any pistol based on the M1900 series Colts. (1900, 1902, 1903.) .38 Super pistols, on the other hand, can often work well with .38 ACP (or .38 ACP pressure-level) ammunition. They may require a slightly less-powerful recoil spring to function normally. Initially popular, the sales of the .38 ACP models dropped off with the introduction of the M-1905 in .45, and then the M-1911 caused sales of the .38 to essentially cease. Colt listed it in their annual catalog until existing parts were used up in the early 1920s. The .38 Super Automatic +P: A Brief History by Mark Freburg, Outdoor Network, 2006 Production of the Model 1903 Pocket Hammer Model, basically just a short-barreled 1902 Sporting Model, began in earnest in 1904 (only one hundred pistols seeing production in 1903) with production varying from about 1,200 to 2,300 each year until 1917 when production curtailed sharply due to World War I. Up to late 1907, rounded stub hammers were used, but Colt, with the interest of the military and apparently the public now set on low profile spur hammers (due to that requirement on the Model 1907 US test pistols, these being modified Model 1905s with grip safeties), started phasing in low profile spur hammers on all their exposed hammer automatics that they were continuing in production: the 1903 Pocket Hammer Model, the 1902 Military Model, and the 1905 Model .45 ACP. Therefore, the rounded hammer Colt 1903 Pocket Hammers can help date those pistols at a glance to 1903-1907. Unlike the Sporting Model from which it was derived and the 1902 Military Model, that had milled slide grooves and checkered slides respectively, the 1903 Pocket Hammer featured slide grooves at the rear of the slide. The first pistols featured the milled pattern similar to the 1902 Sporting Models, but Colt transitioned to rear cut slides around the spring of 1905, apparently for all their automatics. This would indicate that only about 1,700 or so 1903 Pocket Hammers had the rear milled slides, making them the earliest and hardest to find of the type. Serial numbers of the 1903 Pocket Hammers started at 19999 in 1903 and went backward to 16000 into 1906. After that, serials resumed at 20000 and went up to 47227 ending in 1927 when production discontinued. An approximate total of 29,237 were produced which just about equaled the production of the Colt 1900 and 1902 .38 automatics. Prior to World War I, the pistol filled a niche by providing a relatively more powerful cartridge in a lighter and smaller pistol. However, the Colt 1903/08 Pocket Hammerless in .380 ACP (a lower power cartridge to the .38 ACP, but suitable to smaller simple blow-back pistols) appeared in 1909. The .380 Pocket Hammerless overwhelmed the Pocket Hammer model's sales but the 1903 persisted, possibly because the .38 ACP was still a more powerful cartridge than the .380 ACP. However, World War I clearly slowed production and after production surged to 3,200 in 1920 (probably to fill dealer back orders built up during the war), sales became very slow and the 1903 Pocket Hammer faded out of use, while the smaller 1903 .380 and .32 ACP Pocket Hammerless pistols thrived. Only a scant handful of 1903 Pocket Hammers were used by the military, and then only as secondary arms purchased not pursuant to contract. However, the Model did see significant sales in Mexico prior to and possibly during the chaos of the Mexican Revolution (1910‚Äì1920) so many of these found their way into military and para-military hands. Additionally, some were purchased for the Philippine Constabulary in the 1920s.

The station has two low-level side platforms and is not accessible. Wyoming Hill, in addition to the two other commuter rail stops in Melrose, was originally intended to be an extension of the Orange Line further north to Reading, Massachusetts. History Early-20th-century postcard of the station The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) opened its line from Wilmington Junction to Boston on July 1, 1845. Boardman's Crossing station opened on Wyoming Avenue in North Malden then or soon thereafter. Melrose split from Malden in 1850 due to development around the rail line. In the 1850s, the station was renamed Wyoming. The station building was located on the west side of the tracks just south of Wyoming Avenue. The MBTA, formed in 1964 to subsidize suburban commuter rail service, began funding Reading Line service on January 18, 1965. Around 1978, the MBTA modified the names of several stations for clarity, with Wyoming station becoming Wyoming Hill.

The fate of its three-man crew remains unknown, and the mysterious circumstances in which they disappeared have been compared to that of the Mary Celeste. Crew The Kaz II had a three-man crew, all of whom were residents of Perth, Western Australia: Derek Batten (56), Peter Tunstead (69) and James Tunstead (63). Disappearance of crew Kaz II undergoing forensic examination in Townsville According to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, Kaz II departed from Airlie Beach on 15 April 2007, and was heading for Townsville, Queensland on the first leg of a journey that was to take it around Northern Australia to Western Australia. The first indication that there was a problem came on 18 April, when a helicopter reported spotting Kaz II adrift in the vicinity of the Great Barrier Reef, and that its crew were potentially in distress. On 20 April, maritime authorities caught up with the boat and boarded it. They found the three-man crew missing in circumstances which they described as being \\"strange\\". :\\"What they found was a bit strange in that everything was normal; there was just no sign of the crew.\\" ‚Äì Jon Hall, Queensland's Emergency Management office. In a statement delivered on the day of the boarding, officials with the Queensland Emergency Management Office revealed that the boat was in serviceable condition and was laid out as if the crew were still on board. Food and flatware were set out on the table, a laptop computer was set up and turned on, and the engine was still running. Officials also confirmed that the boat's emergency systems, including its radio and GPS, were fully functional, and that it still had its full complement of life jackets. There was even a small boat still hoisted on the stern of the boat, and the anchor was up. The only signs that were out of the ordinary, other than the disappearance of the crew, was one of the boat's sails had been badly shredded, and that there was no life raft on board (it is unknown whether there ever was one aboard). Forensic examination On Friday, 20 April, Kaz II was towed into the Townsville port for forensic examination. On 21 April, Sergeants Bardell and Molloy of the Queensland Police searched the ship for signs of foul play or third-party involvement; no evidence for this was found. They found the cabin to be neat and tidy apart from some magazines, a piece of newspaper, and a wine cask which were lying on the floor. It was later determined that these items ended up on the floor while the ship was being towed to shore. In the sink were a few butter knives and, on a bench in the galley, a plastic sheath of fishing knives was found. They did not appear to have been used recently. Under Batten's bed, in a sealed container, the investigators found a firearm and some ammunition, none of which was apparently missing. In a drawer they found an additional single bullet of the same calibre. After analyzing data about Kaz II course from the ship's GPS system, police say that, on the morning of its departure from Airlie Beach, the ship was steered in northeast direction into an area where squalls and rough seas were building. On that same day, late in the afternoon, the GPS data showed it to be adrift. The investigators also recovered a video recording that showed footage taken by the crew during their trip, which revealed some clues as to the men's last day. The last footage, filmed by James Tunstead on 15 April at 10:05 AM, shortly before the men disappeared, showed, among other things: *Batten was at the helm. *Peter Tunstead is sitting on the aft stairway of the boat; he is fishing. *A long white rope can be seen trailing behind the boat. *The engine is not running. *Fenders can be seen hanging from safety rails on both sides of the boat. *The camera is panned 360 degrees and shows islands and surroundings; this helped investigators pinpoint the exact location of the ship. *The sea is choppy and none of the men are wearing life jackets. *Tunstead's shirt and glasses are not in the place where they were later found. Search Search and rescue efforts began on Wednesday, 18 April, and Australian search and rescue AusSAR sent a Navy aircraft to search in the vicinity of the vessel in an effort to locate the missing men. At the same time, Bowen Voluntary Marine Rescue launched a coastal and island search. At night, an aircraft with infrared capability was used to search the reefs and cays. The next day, a full scale search-and-rescue effort was launched involving Volunteer Rescue Units from several towns as well as the Townville's coast guard, two rescue helicopters, nine airplanes, and two commercial vessels. Data from Kaz II's GPS system was also retrieved and analyzed in order to help narrow the search area. Dr. Paul Luckin, a survival-time expert, was consulted. He concluded that it was unlikely that the men were still alive if they were still in the water as they had probably gone overboard three to four days earlier. The teams still had hope that the men could have reached land and continued searching until 4:00 P.M. on 21 April, when the air and sea search for the three crew members was called off. Another coastline search was launched on Monday 23 April after some new information had come in but the search proved fruitless and was called off on 25 April. Official investigation On 4 August 2008, an inquest into the men's disappearance began in the Townsville Coroner's Court.http://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/86733/cif- tunstead-p-tunstead-j-batten-d-20080808.pdf The inquest was led by Queensland state coroner Michael Barnes and focused on whether the men were dead, the circumstances surrounding their disappearance, and if the search for the missing men was adequate. In total 27 witnesses were called to testify. Some of them had seen the ship on its fateful voyage and helped authorities to reconstruct the chain of events. =Hearings= In one of the hearings, Jennifer Batten testified that her husband Derek was an experienced and careful yachtsman, had been around boats for 25 years, and that he was acutely aware of the need for safety. He had earned his recreational skipper's ticket and a qualification in marine radio. Every summer they travelled together to Rottnest Island on various motorboats, although Kaz II was their first sailboat. After they bought it, the couple took a six-week sailing course and then sailed Kaz II around the Whitsundays twice. Apart from a minor problem with a propeller, the trips were without problems. Batten's wife also stated that the original plan was to sail Kaz II to Fremantle as a couple, but that Batten was worried that just two people aboard might not be safe. He decided to take his neighbours, brothers Peter and James Tunstead, with him instead. The trip was planned over several months and discussed daily as they plotted routes with the help of a computer. \\"They allowed themselves six to eight weeks to get back to Fremantle, but because Des and Peter were retired, it didn't really matter how long they took ‚Ä¶ They didn't want to sail at night for safety [reasons]\\", Jennifer Batten said, and they planned to stay reasonably close to the shore. Although Batten was taking medications for high cholesterol, mild diabetes, and had suffered a heart attack at age 50, she believed that he was well enough and fit for the journey. Also heard was Graeme Douglas, the previous owner of Kaz II, who had sold the boat to Batten. He stated the boat was in good condition when it was sold and that he had met the men on the night before they set sail. He also helped the men plan part of their route and was surprised to see that, according to the police, the men had deviated from their planned route that was programmed in their GPS system. Gavin Howland, the skipper of a commercial fishing vessel called the Jillian, testified that on 16 April 2007, while fishing on a reef off Bowen, he and his crew saw a white yacht with a torn sail drifting sideways between the reefs through a narrow passage, at up to , in north-northeastern direction along with the current. He came within 50 metres of the boat but was unable to spot anyone on board. This was two days before the coast guard spotted Kaz II adrift off the coast of Townsville and the day after authorities believe the men went missing. Howland found it odd that a sailboat was in an area noted for its shallow water and rocks. He did not attempt to contact the boat or the authorities. Howland told the inquest that it did not occur to him that the crew of the yacht might be in distress and went on to say: \\"It did seem a bit strange to me but I just have this rule that no one goes near another vessel\\". Sergeant Paul Molloy, one of the three forensic police officers who examined Kaz II after she was towed back to shore in April 2007, told the inquest that he did not believe the men had met with foul play. He spent several hours combing the ship for signs of a struggle but found no evidence that anyone beside the three-man crew of the vessel had been aboard. \\"We came to the conclusion the boat itself was not a crime scene,\\" he told the inquest. After questions by Peter Tunstead's widow Frances as to why the police did not check for fingerprints, Sgt. Molloy said his years of experience told him it was not necessary. \\"We were there for a long time; we pulled the boat apart and found nothing untoward... If there was any indication [of foul play] we would have taken every measure we could to examine that boat.\\" Detective Sergeant Graham Patch said that the police found a video recorder inside the boat. On it was footage taken by the three crew members on the morning they went missing. As the video was played in the courtroom, Patch explained that land masses on the video helped officials narrow the search area for the missing crewmen. =Conclusions= State coroner Barnes admits in his official report that he \\"cannot be so definitive about the circumstances under which the deaths occurred.\\" However, based on the eyewitness accounts, the video found on board, and the state of the yacht in which it was found, the report proposes the following scenario: \\"On Sunday, 15 April 2007, at 10:05 A.M., the Kaz II was sailing in the vicinity of George Point. Up to that moment everything was going as planned but, in the following hour, their situation changed dramatically. The men hauled in the white rope that was trailing behind the boat and bundled it up on the foredeck, possibly to dry, next to the locker it was normally kept in. For unknown reasons, James Tunstead then took off his T-shirt and glasses and placed them on the backseat. The report says that since the men's fishing lure was found entangled in the ship's port side rudder, an obvious explanation would be that one of them tried to free the lure and fell overboard while doing so. Standing on the boat's 'sugar scoop' platform (a platform at the back of the ship close to the waterline) while the boat is moving is perilous and falling in the water is easy, but getting back aboard is almost impossible. One of the other men then came to the rescue of his brother, while Batten, still on board, started the motor and realized he had to drop the sails before he could go back for his friends. As he left the helm to drop the sails, a deviation of the ship's course or wind direction could have easily caused a jibe, swinging the boom across the deck and knocking Batten overboard. This could even have happened before Batten was able to untie and throw out the life ring to his friends. A blue coffee mug found near the life ring may support this. Since the boat was travelling before wind and at a speed of , it would be out of reach of the men within seconds. The report states: \\"From that point, the end would have been swift. None of them were good swimmers, the seas were choppy; the men would have quickly become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves.\\" The report rules out foul play and staged disappearance. Other explanations Interior of the Kaz II showing laundry hung up to dry Several alternative explanations have been put forward for the crew's disappearance. According to authorities in Townsville, the weather had been windy and the sea had been rough between the time that Kaz II departed and was found drifting. This led authorities to speculate that the crew may have experienced some form of sudden difficulty during rough weather and gone overboard. However, one issue with this theory is that contents of the cabin, including a table, did not seem to have been disrupted in any way. Relatives of the missing men say that the boat's condition make this unlikely and point to discrepancies such as the fact that the men's fishing lines and laundry were set out, and that their life jackets were still stowed, which indicated that they were not experiencing rough weather at the time of their disappearance. Also noted was the fact that Kaz II was found with its fenders out, leading to speculation that the boat may have docked with another as-yet-unknown vessel to which the crew might have willingly, or unwillingly, transferred. ::\\"The fenders were out on their yacht, and the only reason you ever put them out is when another boat comes aside or if you come to rest against a wharf.\\" ‚Äì Hope Himing, niece of boat owner Derek Batten. In answer to speculation, Townsville police stated that small craft commonly leave their fenders out at all times, making it impossible to draw any definitive conclusions about this feature. Batten was said to have bought Kaz II a year before and sailed it a couple of times since then. The Tunsteads were not nautical novices either, since they sailed together from the time they were 18 years old, and even worked in the radio rooms of the Volunteer Sea Rescue. The last known contact of the family members with any of the crew was made one-and-a-half hours after it left port, when one crew member was contacted by his wife. Volunteer radio operator Ivan Ormes recorded that Kaz II radioed in at 6:45 P.M. on 15 April, the evening of their departure, giving its position as George Point. This is the last known contact with Kaz II. Ms. Grey says that it should have taken them only 2 hours to go to George Point and that it is unclear what took them so long to arrive there. One explanation is that they were just fishing the whole day. But another explanation is that they had problems with their GPS, since they already tried to set off on 14 April, but were forced to return because of the non-functional GPS. That incident was because of a user error and it was easily fixed, so Kaz II set off early the next day. Other hypotheses include that the boat became stuck on a sandbar near George Point, where the boat's last radio message was made. When the men jumped overboard to push it free, a gust of wind blew and the boat drifted away, leaving them stranded. This would explain why towels were left out on the deck. Another hypothesis is that one crew member may have been washed over by a freak wave and that the others were lost trying to rescue him.

The plan includes discrediting union leaders, frightening the public with the threat of violence, using local police and vigilantes to intimidate strikers, forming associations of \\"loyal employees\\" to influence public debate, fortifying workplaces, employing large numbers of replacement workers, and threatening to close the plant if work is not resumed. The authenticity of the written plan has never been clearly established. Although it was allegedly published in the National Association of Manufacturers Labor Relations Bulletin, no original copy has been found, nor does NAM list it among its pamphlets from that era. Parts of the plan use language sympathetic to the views of labor organizers. The Remington Rand company did indeed ruthlessly suppress the strikes, as documented in a ruling by the National Labor Relations Board, and the plan has been accepted as a guide to the methods that were used. At least one source names the strikebreaker Pearl Bergoff and his so-called \\"Bergoff Technique\\" as the origin of the formula.From Aristotelian to Reaganomics: A Dictionary of Eponyms With Biographies ... by R. C. S. Trahair, page 54 Rand and Bergoff were both indicted by the same federal grand jury for their roles in the Remington Rand strike. Noam Chomsky has described the formula as the result of business owners' trend away from violent strikebreaking to a \\"scientific\\" approach based on propaganda. An essential feature of this approach is the identification of the management's interests with \\"Americanism,\\" while labor activism is portrayed as the work of un-American outsiders. Workers are thus persuaded to turn against the activists and toward management to demonstrate their patriotism. Elements of the formula The following is the text of the Mohawk Valley formula as quoted in the labor press: #When a strike is threatened, label the union leaders as \\"agitators\\" to discredit them with the public and their own followers. Conduct balloting under the foremen to ascertain the strength of the union and to make possible misrepresentation of the strikers as a small minority. Exert economic pressure through threats to move the plant, align bankers, real estate owners and businessmen into a \\"Citizens' Committee\\". #Raise high the banner of \\"law and order\\", thereby causing the community to mass legal and police weapons against imagined violence and to forget that employees have equal rights with others in the community. #Call a \\"mass meeting\\" to coordinate public sentiment against the strike and strengthen the Citizens' Committee. #Form a large police force to intimidate the strikers and exert a psychological effect. Utilize local police, state police, vigilantes and special deputies chosen, if possible, from other neighborhoods. #Convince the strikers their cause is hopeless with a \\"back-to-work\\" movement by a puppet association of so-called \\"loyal employees\\" secretly organized by the employer. #When enough applications are on hand, set a date for opening the plant by having such opening requested by the puppet \\"back-to-work\\" association. #Stage the \\"opening\\" theatrically by throwing open the gates and having the employees march in a mass protected by squads of armed police so as to dramatize and exaggerate the opening and heighten the demoralizing effect. #Demoralize the strikers with a continuing show of force. If necessary turn the locality into a warlike camp and barricade it from the outside world. #Close the publicity barrage on the theme that the plant is in full operation and the strikers are merely a minority attempting to interfere with the right to work. With this, the campaign is over‚Äîthe employer has broken the strike. A similar, although more nuanced and longer, version was published in The Nation in 1937.

Koga is regarded as having perhaps the greatest ippon seoi nage ever. Biography Koga was born in Kitashigeyasu, Saga, Japan. He began judo in elementary school. He traveled to Tokyo during junior-high school to enter Kodogakusha, a judo school later attended by Olympic gold medalists Hidehiko Yoshida and Makoto Takimoto. He continued his education at the Nippon Sport Science University, and captured several awards including five consecutive championships at the Kodokan Cup and six consecutive championships at the All- Japan Judo Championships (all in the 71 kg division). He placed 3rd in the 1987 World Judo Championships held in Essen, and was chosen to participate in the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he lost in the 3rd round of the competition. Koga returned to the Olympics in 1992 after winning the 1989 and 1991 World Judo Championships, but seriously injured his left knee during a randori (sparring) session against Hidehiko Yoshida, which prevented him from using his best technique; the Ippon Seoinage. He won the gold medal overcoming this injury, and was given the JOC Sports Award by the Japanese Olympic Committee. Koga briefly retired from competitive judo after his victory at the Olympics, but made his return with a gold medal at the 1995 World Judo Championships in Chiba, Japan. He suffered a surprising defeat by ippon in a qualification match for the 1996 Summer Olympics, but was chosen as the representative anyway because of his past experience in the Olympic games. He ended his third appearance at the Olympics with a silver medal in the -78 kg division. Koga announced his final retirement from competition in 2000, and became the head coach for the All-Japan women's judo team. In April 2003, he founded the Koga Juku, a judo school for young children, in Takatsu-ku, Kawasaki. One of his pupils, Ayumi Tanimoto, won the gold medal in the -63 kg division at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He became the head coach of the International Pacific University's judo team (located in Akaiwa, Okayama) in April 2007, and has enjoyed celebrity status in Japan as a 7th dan rank holder in judo, appearing on several national television shows.

History Shirley Windmill was built by Richard Alwen in 1854 to replace the former post mill destroyed by fire. The post mill had been built in 1809 by Richard Alwen (Sr) and passed to Alwen on the death of his father in 1846. The post mill burnt down in October 1854. The mill is thought to have been brought from Stratford and re-erected.This would be the machinery (possibly including the cap, sails and main floor beams) in the case of a tower mill, another example of this was Pratt's Mill, Crowborough where the machinery from Calverley Mill, Tunbridge Wells was installed. The mill in Stratford, assuming the London one is correct, has not been identified. A date of 1740 on a beam in the windmill is evidence of re-use of materials from elsewhere. The mill cost ¬£2,000 to build. More recent research has suggested that a post mill at West Ham, allegedly moved to Shirley c.1809, may have been the mill in question. Richard Alwen died in 1884,and the mill was taken by Thomas Dives, grandson of Richard Alwen Sr. The mill was abandoned in 1892 as unviable by Alfred Rayson, at the time being only used for grinding animal feed. The windmill was struck by lightning in 1899. and again in April 1906, when a sail was set on fire, but the local fire brigade managed to save the mill. The mill was restored in 1927 and in 1935 one of the sails was blown off. The mill was again renovated, and a new Great Spur Wheel fitted by Messrs Lister Bros, of Woolwich. New sails were fitted by Thomas Hunt, the Soham millwright. There was a Court case following the renovations, in which it was stated the windmill was \\"almost in working order\\". The windmill was listed in 1951. It was probably the last large windmill to be built in Surrey. In 1952 the mill and land were acquired by the Croydon Corporation. The mill was threatened with demolition when the new John Ruskin School was built but it was protected by its listed status and strong public interest. An inspection of the structure found that it was in generally good condition, but recommended that the first floor doorway be unblocked to allow better circulation of air to prevent rot. During excavations for the foundations of the new school, two trade tokens were found, relating to the smock mill at Appledore, Kent. On 1 April 1971, the mill was advertised for sale in The Times as an April Fool's Day joke by pupils at the school. The headmaster received four telephone calls as a result of the prank. The school moved to a new site, and the school buildings were demolished. In August 1996, it was announced that the London Borough of Croydon was to receive a grant of ¬£218,100 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to turn the mill into a museum. In September 2004, Croydon Borough Council agreed to fund external repairs to the windmill, the work being scheduled for the following spring. In October 2008 it was reported that the sails of the mill were being damaged by rose-ringed parakeets. The birds had also damaged the spire of the nearby St John's Church. The sails were repaired at a cost of ¬£45,000 by millwrights J Hole. Restoration was completed in May 2010. Description The mill c. 1910 Shirley Windmill is a five- storey brick tower mill. It has four double Patent sails carried on a cast- iron windshaft. The Kentish-style cap is winded by a fantail. The tower is diameter at the base and diameter at the curb. The mill is high to the top of the cap. The iron Brake Wheel is diameter and has 172 cogs. It drives an iron Wallower of diameter with 75 teeth. The cast iron Upright Shaft is long and has a dog clutch just below its midpoint, to allow the mill to be driven by engine without working the sails. The Great Spur Wheel is of iron, with wooden teeth, and drove two pairs of underdrift millstones.

The municiplatiy comprises the cadastral communities of Freundsam, Glantschach, Gradenegg, Hardegg, Liebenfels proper, Liemberg, Pflausach, Rosenbichl, Rottschaft Feistritz, S√∂rg, and S√∂rgerberg. History While the oldest archaeological findings in the area date back to the Neolithic, the foundation of an ancient temple were discovered on a hill near the village of Hohenstein. The building was erected in the 2nd century AD, when the area was part of the Roman Noricum province, and dedicated to the local Celtic goddess Noreia. The building of church in the village of Glantschach was documented between 958 and 991. Located near the central Zollfeld area in the Duchy of Carinthia, Liebenfels is the site of numerous medieval castles and residences, most notably Liebenfels Castle which was first mentioned as Liewenvelse in a 1312 deed.

Early life and education Cecil Chubb was born in Shrewton, a village west of Stonehenge, the eldest son of Alfred and Mary Chubb. His father, \\"Fred\\", was the village saddler and harness maker, as was his father before him. Cecil attended the local village school and then the Bishop Wordsworth's School in Salisbury, where from the age of 14 he worked for a time as a student teacher. Chubb met his future wife at a cricket game between his Bishop Wordsworth School and Fisherton House Asylum. He then attended Christ's College, Cambridge where he was awarded a double first in Science and Law, leaving with Master of Arts and Bachelor of Law degrees. Career Chubb became a barrister and amassed a considerable fortune. In 1902 he married Mary Bella Alice Finch, whose uncle, Dr W. Corbin Finch, owned Fisherton House, which was a mental asylum (later the Old Manor Hospital, now Fountain Way). Five years after her uncle's death in 1905, the business and buildings were transferred to her. Following financial difficulties, a limited company was formed to run the hospital in 1924, and Sir Cecil became chairman. Whilst he was in charge, the hospital became the largest private mental hospital in Europe. There is a plaque in the hospital commemorating his life and work. Sir Cecil also served on Salisbury City Council, was a Justice of the Peace and became a successful racehorse owner and breeder of Shorthorn cattle. Purchase of Stonehenge Stonehenge was put up for auction in 1915 by the Antrobus family following the death in World War I of the only surviving male heir. Cecil Chubb's interest in the local area led to him attending the sale, with him bidding and purchasing Lot 15 on a whim for ¬£6,600 (about ¬£/‚Ç¨/$ today), as he wished to avoid the stones being acquired by someone overseas. It is also speculated that he bought the stones as a present for his wife, only for her to be less than pleased with his new purchase. He gave Stonehenge to the nation on 26 October 1918. The deed of gift included the following conditions: A temporary image of Chubb's grave in the Devizes Road cemetery, Salisbury, UK showing the wreath laid to mark the centenary of his donation of Stonehenge to the nation > First that the public shall have free access to the premises hereby conveyed > and every part thereof on the payment of such reasonable sum per head not > exceeding one shilling for each visit and subject to such conditions as the > Commissioners of Works in the exercise and execution of their statutory > powers and duties may from time to time impose Secondly that the premises > shall so far as possible be maintained in their present condition Thirdly > that no building or erection other than a pay box similar to the Pay Box now > standing on the premises shall be erected on any part of the premises within > four hundred yards of The Milestone marked \\"Amesbury 2\\" on the northern > frontage of the premises and Fourthly that the Commissioners of Works will > at all times save harmless and keep indemnified the Donors and each of them > their and each of their estates and effects from and against all proceedings > costs claims and expenses on account of any breach or non-observance of the > covenants by the Donors to the like or similar effect contained in the > Conveyance of the premises to the Donors. Local residents are still entitled to free admission to Stonehenge because of a different agreement concerning the moving of a right of way. To mark his generosity he was made a baronet in 1919 by Lloyd George. Chubb's arms feature a trilithon representing Stonehenge. Death and legacy Chubb died of heart disease at his house (from 1930) in Bournemouth, Rothwell Dene, on 22 September 1934 aged 58, leaving behind his wife, son John, who succeeded him, and daughter Mary.Debretts Peerage 1955 edn A plaque commemorating his birth was erected in the late 1980s on the house in Shrewton where he was born. It was unveiled by his two surviving nephews.

Benach is the chair of the Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology. Benach's main area of research is the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi which is the causative agent of Lyme disease. Benach also has begun to investigate organisms that could be used as bioterrorism agents, specifically Francisella tularensis, the bacterial agent of tularemia. Benach graduated with a PhD from Rutgers University in 1972. Benach was named to a National Advisory Allergy and Infectious Diseases Council (NIAID) in 1998 and was named a 1992 Fulbright-Hays Fellow and Exchange Professor. Lyme Disease research Benach was one of the early researchers in Lyme disease. Benach and Edward Bosler, Ph.D. collaborated in the dogged and dangerous work of gathering and testing ticks for disease-causing pathogens at the Mashomack Preserve on Shelter Island, off the coast of New York. Benach and Bosler later co-authored the book Lyme Disease and Related Disease Disorders, New York Academy of Sciences (September 1988). In the fall of 1981, Benach, then at the New York State Health Department, provided NIH researcher Willy Burgdorfer with collections of I. dammini (scapularis) ticks from Shelter Island, as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mounted spotted fever on Long Island. It was in the midgut of two of those ticks that Burgdorfer, looking for RMSF rickettsiae, noticed the ‚Äúpoorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes‚Äù that he realized might be the cause of the erythema chronicum migrans rash of Lyme disease. Benach subsequently supplied Burgdorfer with more field-collected ticks from Shelter Island, along with sera from clinically diagnosed patients with Lyme disease. The collaborative effort enabled Burgdorfer to confirm his suspicions about the new spirochete. Benach and pathology colleague Marc Golightly developed the critical laboratory test to detect the presence of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, an ELISA test that became the original ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for Lyme diagnosis. Benach continues to work with borrelia organisms at the Center for Infectious Diseases, Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Stony Brook University.

In the specifications of operational amplifiers, the PSRR is defined as the ratio of the change in supply voltage to the equivalent (differential) output voltage it produces,Maxim Integrated's glossary definition of PSRR often expressed in decibels.Allen, Phillip; Holberg, Douglas, CMOS Analog Circuit Design, Oxford University Press, Inc, cc 1987.Franco, Design With Operational Amplifiers and Analog Integrated Circuits, McGraw-Hill, Inc, cc 1988.Jung, Walt; Op Amp Applications Handbook, Newnes, 2006, page 86 http://www.analog.com/library/analogdialogue/archives/39-05/Web_Ch1_final_R.pdf#page=93 An ideal op-amp would have infinite PSRR. The output voltage will depend on the feedback circuit, as is the case of regular input offset voltages. But testing is not confined to DC (zero frequency); often an operational amplifier will also have its PSRR given at various frequencies (in which case the ratio is one of RMS amplitudes of sinewaves present at a power supply compared with the output, with gain taken into account). Unwanted oscillation, including motorboating, can occur when an amplifying stage is too sensitive to signals fed via the power supply from a later power amplifier stage. Some manufacturers specify PSRR in terms of the offset voltage it causes at the amplifiers inputs; others specify it in terms of the output; there is no industry standard for this issue.Op Amp Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) and Supply Voltages. Analog Devices appnote/tutorial MT-043 The following formula assumes it is specified in terms of input: : \\\\text{PSRR} [\\\\text{dB}] = 10 \\\\log_{10} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta {V_\\\\text{supply}}^2 {A_v}^2}{{\\\\Delta {V_\\\\text{out}}^2}}\\\\right)\\\\text{dB} where A_v is the voltage gain. For example: an amplifier with a PSRR of 100 dB in a circuit to give 40 dB closed-loop gain would allow about 1 millivolt of power supply ripple to be superimposed on the output for every 1 volt of ripple in the supply. This is because : 100\\\\ \\\\text{dB} - 40\\\\ \\\\text{dB} = 60\\\\ \\\\text{dB}. And since that's 60 dB of rejection, the sign is negative so: : 1\\\\ \\\\text{V} \\\\cdot 10^\\\\frac{-60}{20} = 0.001\\\\ \\\\text{V} = 1\\\\ \\\\text{mV} Note: * The PSRR doesn't necessarily have the same poles as A(s), the open-loop gain of the op-amp, but generally tends to also worsen with increasing frequency (e.g. http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opa2277.pdf).Techniques for Output Ripple/Noise Measurement. * For amplifiers with both positive and negative power supplies (with respect to earth, as op-amps often have), the PSRR for each supply voltage may be separately specified (sometimes written: PSRR+ and PSRR‚àí), but normally the PSRR is tested with opposite polarity signals applied to both supply rails at the same time (otherwise the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) will affect the measurement of the PSRR). * For voltage regulators the PSRR is occasionally quoted (confusingly; to refer to output voltage change ratios), but often the concept is transferred to other terms relating changes in output voltage to input: Ripple rejection (RR) for low frequencies, line transient response for high frequencies, and line regulation for DC.

The three saints form a triad that is the focus of the annual Obando Fertility Rites held from 17th to 19th of May Legend The date of the image's finding is traditionally held to be 19 June 1763. Three fishermen, named Juan, Juli√°n, and Diego dela Cruz, were fishing at a place known as Hulingduong in the then town of Tambobong (today Malabon City). There, they caught the statue with their Salamb√°w, which is a type of Big fishing lift net made from bamboo crosspieces and mounted on a raft. When the fishermen intended to bring the Virgin's image to neighbouring Navotas, their salambaw suddenly grew heavy and immobile.

Korten examines the evolution of corporations in the United States and argues that \\"corporate libertarians\\" have 'twisted' the ideas of Adam Smith's view of the role of private companies. Korten critiques current methods of economic development led by the Bretton Woods institutions and asserts his desire to rebalance the power of multinational corporations with concern for environmental sustainability and what he terms ‚Äúpeople-centered development‚Äù. He advocates a 50% tax on advertising. Korten criticises consumerism, market deregulation, free trade, privatization and what he sees as the global consolidation of corporate power. Above all he rejects any focus on money as the purpose of economic life. His prescriptions include excluding corporations from political participation, increased state and global control of international corporations and finance, rendering financial speculation unprofitable and creating local economies that rely on local resources, rather than international trade.

They were introduced by Gregg Zuckerman (1978). The Bernstein functor is closely related. Notation and terminology *G is a connected reductive real affine algebraic group (for simplicity; the theory works for more general groups), and g is the Lie algebra of G. K is a maximal compact subgroup of G. *L is a Levi subgroup of G, the centralizer of a compact connected abelian subgroup, and *l is the Lie algebra of L. *A representation of K is called K-finite if every vector is contained in a finite-dimensional representation of K. Denote by WK the subspace of K-finite vectors of a representation W of K. *A (g,K)-module is a vector space with compatible actions of g and K, on which the action of K is K-finite. *R(g,K) is the Hecke algebra of G of all distributions on G with support in K that are left and right K finite. This is a ring which does not have an identity but has an approximate identity, and the approximately unital R(g,K)- modules are the same as (g,K) modules.

On the west side of the icefield is the valley of the Squamish River, while on its east is the Callaghan Valley, which is the setting for the Nordic facilities for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The icefield is studded by several volcanic formations, including the active Mount Cayley massif. Other summits are Powder Mountain, Brandywine Mountain and Mount Fee. Mount Callaghan, a dormant volcano, is just northeast of the icefield. Mount Brew is just to its south. Geology Numerous subglacial eruptions beneath the Powder Mountain Icefield have formed many distinctive subglacial volcanoes in the Mount Cayley volcanic field and contain abundant glass and fine-scale jointing from rapid cooling of lava, such as Ember Ridge and Slag Hill.Preliminary petrography and chemistry of the Mount Cayley volcanic field, British Columbia Mineralogically, the volcanics range from andesite to rhyodacite, and chemically, the rocks span a range from andesite to dacite. Glassy volcanic rocks are abundant, with glass contents as high as 70%. Volcanoes such as the Slag Hill tuya were formed when magma intruded into and melted a vertical pipe in the overlying Powder Mountain Icefield. The partially molten mass cooled as a large block, with gravity flattening its upper surface, forming its flat-topped, steep-sided subglacial volcanic edifice. The latest volcanic activity in the Powder Mountain Icefield has occurred in the past 10,000 years.Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Mount Cayley volcanic field Development proposal The icefield was one of several locations in the southern Coast Mountains that attracted ski resort development interest as a result of the success of the nearby ski resort town at Whistler, British Columbia. A proposal call in 1985 was won by Powder Mountain Resorts, who won approval in principle from the provincial government for its project design, which included a small basetown at Callaghan Lake. In 1987, Forests and Lands Minister Jack Kempf was instructed by then-Premier Bill Vander Zalm to \\"cease and desist\\" in favour of Callaghan Resorts Inc., which was backed by then-Attorney-General Les Peterson. Court action for breach of contract and abuse of office taken by Powder Mountain Resort promoters Nan and Dianne Hartwick was dismissed by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in 1999, though in 2000 the British Columbia Court of Appeal refused to overturn the lower court's ruling. An appeal at the Supreme Court of Canada is still pending. A special prosecutor was appointed but the investigation was halted for lack of evidence in 2003, three weeks before Vancouver and Whistler won the bid to host the 2010 Winter Olympics. In the meantime, a Nordic lodge was founded in the Callaghan Valley in 1998, just prior to the Canadian Olympic Committee's selection of Vancouver over Calgary and Quebec City as the site of the 2010 Olympics bid. The owner of the Nordic lodge was a promoter of using the Callaghan Valley for Olympic ski-jumping, cross-country, biathlon and other Nordic events. Powder Mountain promoters Nan and Dianne Hartwick continue to press for investigation of backroom dealing that led to the shunting-aside of their project and claim connections between members of VANOC, the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, and those in the provincial administration who helped quash their project. The province has also issued permits for other operations in the valley, such as cat-skiing and snowmobile tour operations, as well as pushed through permits for construction of the Whistler Olympic Park, which is the site of the games' Nordic events. The Hartwicks' position is that these developments violate the agreement-in-principle they had with the province, which the provincial government had claimed was without sufficient backing. In 2007, RCMP Commercial Crimes Unit head Kevin deBruyckere confirmed that a review is underway, and which the Hartwicks say is based on new evidence of conflict of interest. The Hartwicks emphasize that they are not anti-Olympics, but that their ultimate goal is only to re-establish their right to complete their resort proposal.

He was a member of the Democratic Party who served as a U.S. Representative from 1859 to 1865, 1867 to 1877, 1881 to 1895, and 1897, spanning sixteen Congresses. He is known for originating the Holman Rule, allowing amendments to appropriations bills to cut a specific program or federal employee salary. He died in office in 1897, a month after his last election.  Early life and career  Holman was born at \\"Veraestau\\", a son of Jesse Lynch Holman (1784-1842). He attended Franklin College from 1840 to 1842. In 1843, he was admitted to the Dearborn County bar association and served as probate judge from 1843 to 1846, followed by a two- year term as a prosecuting attorney from 1847 to 1849. Holman was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 1851 and 1852; from 1852 to 1856, he served as Judge for the Court of Common Pleas. In 1842, Holman married Abigail Knapp. They had one son named William S. Holman, Jr.  Congressional career  As congressman, Holman was most known for his opposition to government spending, especially in subsidies and aid to private enterprises, notably the transcontinental railroad lines. Throughout the 1880s, he did what he could to have the federal government take back the public lands given to some of the largest companies, which had failed to fulfill the work promised on time. Nor did he have patience with the cattle-barons that had fenced off nationally- owned land as if it were their own domain.\\"Brooklyn Eagle,\\" January 22, 1884. That made him the ideal choice to chair the Committee on Public Lands in the 1880s and his work at forcing railroad companies to disgorge probably restored millions of acres for actual settlers to take up. He hated any kind of government spending, from river and harbor improvements to salary increases for officeholders. \\"When Mr. Holman takes his walks abroad and sees Government clerks promenading the avenue in coachmen's coats and toothpick canes he 'objects,'\\" a Republican newspaper jeered.\\"Wheeling Intelligencer,\\" January 2, 1884. When a Republican proposed an appropriation to take observations on the transit of Venus, Holman objected. It would do no practical good, he insisted. That kind of learning was all humbug, anyhow.\\"Gath,\\" \\"New York Graphic,\\" February 26, 1876. But he also fought hard against congressmen raising their own pay, and in 1873 made himself one of the most active opponents of the so- called \\"back pay\\" grab, where lawmakers raised their salaries retrospectively. The following winter, he tried to bring the Democratic House caucus into line behind a resolution repudiating the grab and was so abused that, according to general reports, he went off on a several-day binge. (\\"Holman does go off on sprees & may be off now,\\" his friend and colleague, Congressman Samuel S. \\"Sunset\\" Cox wrote a friend; \\"but he is honest & just above all men I ever knew here. He will stay 6 months sober; & then break. Don't allow him to be abused or slandered.\\")Samuel S. Cox to Manton Marble, December 7, 1873, Manton Marble Papers, Library of Congress. The big-navy advocates knew in him an inveterate enemy, and when he found a place on the Select Committee on American Ship-Building, the Washington Post growled that Americans had \\"a great, unutterable yearning ... to behold a ship made on the Holman plan.\\" No doubt many such could be made, it thought‚Äîjust big enough to be hung on watch- chains \\"or otherwise employed as curios.\\"\\"Washington Post,\\" January 8, 1886. Admirers called him \\"the watchdog of the Treasury\\" and the \\"Treasury Cerberus,\\" though a few critics noticed that the watchdog sometimes seemed to be taking a well-deserved nap when a bill-paying one of his constituents came up.\\"Junot,\\" \\"Chicago Times,\\" April 1, 1876. His frugality became legendary. One story his friends loved to tell about him was how nefarious interests, realizing that their only chance lay while the congressman was absent from the floor, waited until he was being shaved in the Capitol's barber-shop before offering their bill. In vain: Holman rushed into the chamber, his face covered with lather, to shout his objection. In 1885, he went west on an inspection tour with other members of the Committee on Indian Affairs. Unlike the rest, he refused to go by sleeping car, because it would cost the government too much, and slept in his seat instead. When they reached Fort Yates, in Dakota Territory, he balked at paying five dollars for the steamer ride to Bismarck, pointing out that the post had army ambulances and mules. \\"The mules are not earning anything,\\" he argued. \\"They are idle; they will convey us.\\" And so they did, much to the annoyance of his fellow-traveller, Congressman Joseph Cannon of Illinois, who tipped the wagon-driver to run over every single stone in the road as a punishment. As he arrived at Fort Lincoln, the commander proposed that they fire a salute. \\"No! no! for God's sake, don't!\\" Cannon protested. \\"He will object to the useless waste of powder.\\"\\"Washington Post,\\" April 23, 1897. In 1876, the Holman Rule was adopted which \\"empowers any member of Congress to propose amending an appropriations bill to single out a government employee or cut a specific program\\". With the vote of a majority of the House and the Senate, the pay of an individual federal government employee could be reduced or a specific program eliminated. The rule originally targeted patronage jobs, particularly customs collectors, but the federal workforce shifted over time to a civil service insulated from politics. In 1983, the rule was suspended as then-House Speaker Thomas \\"Tip\\" O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) objected to spending cuts. The early-2017 revival of the rule was credited to Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.).Portnoy, Jenna, and Lisa Rein, \\"House Republicans revive obscure rule that allows them to slash the pay of individual federal workers to $1\\", Washington Post, January 5, 2017. Retrieved 2017-01-09. Holman's simplicity of life and lack of \\"swank,\\" as nineteenth- century parlance went, made him notable in his time. He never appeared in Washington society, and when Congress adjourned, took his vacation at home among his cattle, horses, books and flowers. Visitors described his homestead as the model for southern estates, located on a high bluff where the Ohio River bent, and with a good view of three states (the others being Ohio and Kentucky). There he would rhapsodize about his livestock or show off his flower gardens and transplanted shade trees, with anyone who would listen.\\"Washington Post,\\" April 23, 1897. He died a poor man, never tempted by wealth or, for that matter, notoriety. Taking his chewing tobacco from a leather pouch, sitting tipped back in his chair and toying with a jackknife, the Indiana congressman looked more and more like a throwback to Jacksonian days, as the Gilded Age wore on. \\"Wherever Holman sits, or stands, there is a red sea of tobacco-juice,\\" a reporter wrote in 1876. \\"Such tobacco chewing never was seen. He must get it by the wholesale. Standing in his place in the House his most energetic outbursts are suspended at the very climax by the necessity of disemboguing the red stream from his distended jaws. The ... cleaners of the congressional halls, declare that Holman requires a relay of spittoons three times a day, where other chewers are provided with one.\\"\\"Junot,\\" Chicago Times, April 1, 1876. He had a voice \\"pining, but not strong,\\" a fellow congressman wrote. \\"The speeches, however, are meaty and full of flavor. He can probably say more in fewer words than any man in the House.\\" Members found him kindly in personal life, and easy to approach. Taking pleasure in teaching first-termers the practical ways of getting things done, he gave advice freely, and, other Democrats agreed, his judgments were almost always sound. Many a member, unsure how to vote on a bill, would say, \\"Well, I'll vote with Holman. Then I'm dead sure to be right.\\" He was, wrote Amos Cummings, \\"as trusty as the best combination lock.\\"Amos Cummings, in \\"New York Sun,\\" February 10, 1889. Holman also made a dangerous adversary. His knowledge of the rules and routines of legislation surpassed that of anyone else, and he kept a close eye on the business of the day -- \\"something that not one man in fifty in Congress can say,\\" a reporter wrote‚Äîalways aware of what would be coming up next.\\"Junot,\\" \\"Chicago Times,\\" April 1, 1876. As of 1884, he boasted that he had missed just one vote in twenty years of service.\\"Indianapolis Sentinel,\\" May 22, 1884. During his time in office, one of Holman's hallmarks was his contribution to the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, which repealed the Timber Culture Act of 1873 and authorized the President to set aside timber reserves to be \\"managed for the people\\" in the future. It is unclear who was responsible for this provision, but Holman had put forth an 1888 bill which used similar language to call for protecting public forests. Defeated at last in 1894, Holman thought of staying in Washington and becoming a lawyer. There was good money to be made prosecuting claims; but when word got out to the press, the ex-congressman quickly changed his mind. He was afraid that people would think that he would be trading on his government experience and influence to act as a lobbyist. Instead, he went home to Indiana, where he ran for and won a final re-election, making him the longest- serving congressman in history. Holman is buried at the Holman family plot in River View Cemetery near Aurora, Indiana in Dearborn County. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs, site map, parcel map, and quad map.

The rupture initiated at a depth of and the duration was 1 to 2 minutes. The foreshock and aftershock sequence of this incident were major. Before the main shock, there was an earthquake swarm which persisted for three months, and the tremors afterwards lasted for more than two weeks. With hindsight, it is clear that this swarm and the mainshock were clear indicators of the awakening of the long-dormant Vulcan Santa Maria located to the Northwest, which led to the historic explosive eruption of 1902 which occurred 6 months later in October. A majority of churches in western Guatemala and eastern Chiapas were either severely devastated or abolished. The number of people killed was between 800 and 2,000. A strange occurrence of heavy rains, lightning, and thunder took place shortly before the earthquake. A few weeks before the earthquake there was rain every afternoon for several days straight. Guatemala City was instantly flooded when massive gaps opened in the streets, water pipes ruptured, and huts along with cathedrals disintegrated and collapsed, which also buried hundreds. In just one hour, approximately 80,000 people were made homeless. As soon as the earthquake took place the sky cleared up and there was no rain for approximately three weeks. It has been said that the earthquake had something to do with an atmospheric disturbance connected with an electrical nature. The reason for this is because the early storms were electrical storms.

Early years Butler Stevens Sturtevant, a ninth-generation Mayflower1 descendant, was born on September 1, 1899, in Delavan, Wisconsin2 to James Brown and Ada Belle Sturtevant. In 1918 he enrolled in the undergraduate horticulture program at the University of California, Southern Branch (now UCLA)3. He graduated in 1921. Concurrent with his studies, he gained practical construction experience working with several Southern California landscape architects including Florence Yoch, Charles Gibbs Adams , A E. Hansen , and the firm of Cook, Hall and Cornell (See Wilbur David Cook)4. In 1921, he sharpened his knowledge of plant materials and gained nursery experience working with Theodore Payne5, the well-known specialist in California native plants. Education and working experiences In 1922 he enrolled in the Harvard University Graduate School of Landscape Architecture and City Planning6. He completed all work but his thesis, and did not earn his graduate degree. His classmates included Thomas Dolliver Church and Charles Eliot. Immediately following Harvard, Sturtevant worked for a series of offices. Initially, he returned to the firm of Cook Hall & Cornell, in Los Angeles7, from 1924 to 1925, where he served as an office draftsman. This was followed by brief stints from 1925 to 1926 at Stiles & Van Kleek8, in their St. Petersburg, Florida office; office manager and head designer for Fletcher Steele9, in Boston, from 1926 to 1927; and as a designer with Gardner, Gardner & Fischer10, in Los Angeles, from 1927 to 1928. In 1928, he opened his own office in Seattle, Washington11, to participate with architects Charles Bebb & Carl Freylinghausen Gould in the design of the Normandy Park Subdivision Master Plan (1928 to 1929)12. Practice For the next decade Sturtevant‚Äôs practice flourished. A recommendation from architect Carl Gould led to Sturtevant‚Äôs design for the New Rose Garden13 at Butchart Gardens, in Victoria, British Columbia from 1928 to 1930; and a courtyard garden at the Children‚Äôs Orthopedic Hospital14, in Seattle from 1930 to 1931, (no longer extant). Gould, who was the key figure in the creation of the 1915 Regents Plan that forever shaped the University of Washington campus, also recommended Sturtevant for the campus landscape architect position, which he held from 1931 to 1939. Using Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds, Sturtevant directed nearly 900 laborers to re-work portions of the campus master plan and landscape around new construction projects, including the plantings around Anderson Hall from 1931 to 1932, the construction of a new 2-¬Ω acre herbal garden from 1934 to 1936, the reconstruction of Rainier Vista from 1935 to 1937, the renovation of Drumheller Fountain from 1935 to 1936, and the planting of cedar trees on Stevens Way in 193815. Beginning in 1931, Sturtevant served as the campus landscape architect16 for Principia College, a small Christian Science school in Elsah, Illinois, where he was responsible for both the planning and landscape architecture. Land for the campus was purchased from the previous owner, wealthy St. Louisan, Lucy V. Semple Ames. Notchcliff, the original Ames mansion, had burned in 1911, and in November 1930 the Principia Corporation purchased the spectacular bluff land along the Mississippi River. Bernard Maybeck and his successor, Henry Gutterson were the principal architects at Principia. The Sturtevant relationship with Maybeck was tumultuous, and the client had to beg Maybeck to continue working with Sturtevant, acknowledging that Sturtevant was ‚Äútactless and impulsive and has not always remembered that we began with the definite understanding that the architect was to have general supervision of the landscape plans,‚Äù but noting that Sturtevant was enthusiastic and ‚Äúunquestionably in love with his work here.17‚Äù Maybeck completed his portion of the commission, leaving Sturtevant to work on various campus projects until 1969. Sturtevant‚Äôs work at the Frederick Remington Green Garden18 in the Highlands neighborhood in Seattle from 1931 to 1933; and the William O. McKay Roof Garden19 in Seattle from 1931 to 1932 established his reputation as a residential landscape designer. His 1936-37 design for the Ambrose Patterson Garden20 in Seattle was shown as Seattle‚Äôs first modern garden, at the San Francisco Museum of Art‚Äôs exhibition, ‚ÄúContemporary Landscape Architecture and Its Sources.21‚Äù He collaborated with J. Lister Holmes on the Arnold Dessau house22 in the Highlands neighborhood in Seattle from 1937 to 1939, to ‚Äúbring the outdoors inside.‚Äù Across the road, another project, the Paul Piggott residence23 (formerly Norcliffe), from 1943 to 1945; included a cliffside pool; unique in the Northwest. Sturtevant, while working around the country, maintained an office in Elsah, Illinois. From 1931 to 1940, he kept a desk in Thomas Church‚Äôs San Francisco office24. When in the Bay Area, Sturtevant led the design of the 1935 and 1936 California Spring Garden Shows24. He also involved in the landscape design of the 1939 Golden Gate Exposition on Treasure Island25. In 1941, Sturtevant served as the first president of the San Francisco chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects26. Later that year he joined the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he served as a Major in the Army Air Force and Chief of their Airport Unit. During this time he formed a partnership with Edwin Grohs. This partnership allowed Sturtevant to work on wartime housing projects such as Yesler Terrance and Holly Park in Seattle27. He also contributed to Westpark, Eastpark, and Bremerton Gardens28, all in Bremerton while he was laying out military airfields throughout the southern United States. At the end of the war, Sturtevant opened a San Francisco office under succeeding names: Western Engineers from 1945 to 1946; and Sturtevant & French, from 1946 to 194729. The work during this time emphasized airport design, but only the Portland Airport in Portland, Oregon from 1945 to 1948 can be confirmed30. He also began to do larger land planning work, executing master plans for the Pope Estate31 in Burlingame, California from 1946 to 1947), and the Village of Hana32, on the Island of Maui, Hawaii from 1947 to 1949. Last Years In 1954, Sturtevant moved back to his native Midwest, settling in St. Louis to work on the design of the Principia School campus from 1948 to 1969 for grades K-1233. He also executed the American University Campus Master Plan, in Beirut, Lebanon, from 1961 to 1962; worked for John Brown University, in Siloam Springs, Arkansas from 1962 to 1963; and the Mason Woods Development, in St. Louis, Missouri from 1966 to 1969. He fell ill with colon cancer and died at the Christian Science Sanatorium in San Francisco on April 11, 197134.

Geography Ortenburg Castle The municipal area stretches west of Spittal an der Drau in the southern part of the Lurnfeld valley between the Drava river and the slopes of the Goldeck mountain, part of the Gailtal Alps. The municipality comprises the cadastral communities of Baldramsdorf and Gschie√ü. History Both Baldramsdorf and Gschie√ü were first mentioned in an 1166 deed. Ortenburg Castle, located on a rock above the Unterhaus settlement, was already documented in the 11th century; it was probably erected from about 1090 onwards and finished in 1140. The former seat of the Counts of Ortenburg, who also founded the neighbouring town of Spittal in 1191, decayed after the extinction of the line in 1418. Today only ruins remain. Unterhaus Castle The Habsburg emperor Frederick III, having seized the former Ortenburg estates, had Unterhaus Castle (Paternschloss) erected below the medieval fortress, it was rebuilt from 1710 onwards as a Hieronymite monastery at the behest of the local Porcia princes, in order to encounter crypto-protestant practises in the area. The convent was dissolved in the course of the Josephinist reforms; the building today houses the First Carinthian Handicraft Museum.

In 2015, this amounted to US$194.00 per person per month, or $6.37 per day. History CNN reporter Sean Callebs did an experiment where he spent the month of February 2009 eating only as much food as what a person could get with the maximum possible amount of food stamps. Since he was living in New Orleans, Louisiana, this amounted to $176. At the end of the experiment, he said that he had eaten pretty well, and that the biggest drawback was a social one, not a nutritional one, because he could not go out to eat at restaurants with friends. In St. Louis, Missouri, Food Outreach executive director Greg Lukeman has led a food stamp challenge since 2008, during September \\"Hunger Action Month\\" to bring awareness of the nonprofit organization's clients. Community members, Food Outreach staff and supporters, area politicians, and members of the local media have participated and blog about the experience. In October 2010, a new documentary Food Stamped, where a couple live on a food stamp budget for a week, premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival. In May 2013, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) took part in week-long SNAP Challenge during which he tweeted: \\"Living this wk on $4.80/day food budget. Got on scale this morning - lost 6 lbs in 4 days.\\" In June 2013, Donny Ferguson, the communications director for Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX), attempted to counter the popular opinion that food stamp funds were not enough to survive on. He spent $27.68 without a shopping list or coupons or discounts, and argued that at such rates, the government could afford cuts to the SNAP program as deep as 12%. He further argued that savings could be made by buying vegetables instead of rice and beans, advanced planning, and pooling of resources with a larger family stipend. Ferguson overperformed the challenge by buying enough food for and participating for 10 days instead of seven. In April 2015, actress Gwyneth Paltrow purchased $29 of food for one week, and posted a picture of the food on her Twitter account. Rebecca Vipond Brink, a nutrition writer for the Frisky, said of Paltrow's food choices, \\"Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. But people who live on SNAP benefits don‚Äôt just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.\\" Brink also suggested a completely different set of food items for the same amount of money, which would have yielded 2,530 calories per day: five pounds of potatoes, two dozen eggs, five pounds of flash-frozen chicken breasts, a block of cheese, a gallon of whole milk, four pounds of apples, three pounds of oatmeal, a bag of celery, 16 ounces of peanut butter, 15 ounces of raisins, one pound of carrots, and 28 ounces of rice. Brink also pointed out that such a shopping list was only realistic for someone who did not live in a food desert.What $29 A Week For Food Looks Like For Actual Low-Income People (And Not Gwyneth Paltrow), The Frisky, April 12, 2015 Criticism The Food Stamp Challenge ignores the supplemental portion of the SNAP program, which does not intend for SNAP benefits to be the only source of food. 75% of SNAP participants use their own money to purchase some of their food, and the remaining 25% would receive benefits larger than the average employed in the food stamp challenge. Only 20% of SNAP beneficiaries have no income; for those with income, families are expected to contribute 30% of income to their food budget. Therefore, SNAP benefits and the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) always equal the maximum benefit ($668 for a family of four). Food Stamp Challenges challenges therefore result in menus bearing little resemblance to the USDA official food plans calculated on the maximum benefit because they ignore the effect of the Expected Family Contribution.

In 1918‚Äì1920, he attended the Bucharest Fine Arts Academy, where he was taught by the sculptor Franz Storck, and then moved on to the Free Art Academy, founded by painter Arthur Verona. After 1921, Anestin became a theater and art gallery chronicler, while authoring various theater plays. It was during the period that he also became noted for his satirical cartoons and portraits, heavily influenced by the French school of drawing. Together with writer Mircea Eliade, Ion Valentin Anestin published the magazine Est-Vest, which was established in 1927 and ceased its existence after only a couple of issues.Mircea Eliade, Autobiography, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1990, , p.130 In 1928, he joined Vladimir Donescu on the staff of Vremea, editing its theater and art page between 1931 and 1943, while being responsible for the journal's graphic design.

Noted for his left-wing convictions, he drew individual and group satirical portraits of major figures of his day, both Romanian (Nicolae Titulescu, Alexandru Averescu, Lucian Blaga, Ion Incule»õ, Ion Mihalache, Iuliu Maniu, Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu, Octavian Goga) and foreign (Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Stalin). Additionally, Anestin was known for his original creation, the character Ion Ion, a staple of his work during the 1930s. Ion Ion was depicted as a young man with a top hat or a bowler hat, carrying an umbrella, but having no shirt and trousers. During World War II, beginning a month before the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and continuing throughout Romania's alliance with the Axis Powers (see Romania during World War II), Anestin's work centered on denouncing Stalin and the Soviet Union, in a series titled MƒÉcelarul din Pia»õa Ro»ôie (\\"The Red Square Butcher\\") published by the magazine Gluma.

The station facilitates the transition from mechanized transportation to pack animals, and necessarily includes a corral for the animals and sometimes a stock loading ramp. In some places there may also be a barn or other structure to house feed and tack, and a loading dock or shelter for the items to be transported. In locations on private land, there may be a business office on site. The term \\"pack station\\" is most often used in California in the Sierra Nevada mountains. In other parts of the USA, outfitters may simply refer to a permanent or semi-permanent trailhead or wilderness camp as a \\"station\\" or \\"outfitter camp.\\"  How packing works  One wrangler on horseback can usually handle up to five pack mules, who are tethered together in a line called a pack string. Many commercial outfitters today support recreation activities such as camping and fishing trips and hunting expeditions. Government agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service, as well as a few commercial outfitters have pack operations to transport construction materials, trail tools, and fire fighting equipment into wilderness areas. In either case, the process and techniques used are very similar to those developed prior to the era of motor vehicles. Customers arrange for a meeting time or a delivery time and drop their goods and supplies at the pack station. Packing services are charged by the pound or by the animal, typically with a minimum price depending on the distance from the pack station. Everything is weighed, sorted for each animal, then split 50/50 to get a balanced load on each side of the animal; an unbalanced load will cause the saddle to slide to the heavy side, causing discomfort to the animal, and potentially inviting disaster. The average mule can carry as much as . A mammoth donkey can carry up to and standard donkey limit is . However, most pack station mule loads are limited to  Permits  Outfitters generally operate within the boundaries of public land and are required to maintain an outfitters permit. USDA Forest Service calls this a special-use permit. A separate permit is required if the pack station or wilderness caches are located on public land.

The film stars Alexander Fu Sheng and Chen Kuan Tai.  Plot  Heroes Two begins with the burning of the Shaolin Temple, and chronicles the efforts of Fang Shi-yu (Alexander Fu Sheng) and Hung Si-kuan (Chen Kuan Tai) as they combat the forces of oppression, fighting alongside the Chinese revolutionaries. Manchurian General Che Kang (Zhu Mu) is a clever Warlord who capitalizes on the na√Øvet√© of Fang Shi-yu. Neither man realizes that they fight for the Shaolin cause, and General Che Kang tricks Fang Shi-yu into believing that Hung Si-kuan is a renegade bandit. With the help of the General's henchmen, Fang Shi-yu defeats a bloodied Hung Si-kuan. Then the tough rebel is put into shackles inside the General's castle. Word quickly spreads that Fang Shi-yu beat the unbeatable Shaolin hero, and the local faction of the rebellion attacks the unknowing Fang Shi-yu for his rash actions. When the rebel leader reveals the true nature of Hung Si-kuan, Fang Shi-yu is beside himself. The na√Øve martial artist initially intends to correct his mistake by sneaking into the General's dungeon and liberating his cohort from the grasp of the Manchurians. However, General Che Kang himself is a powerful Kung Fu practitioner who foils Fang Shi-yu's plans. Once Fang Shi-yu joins his Rebel brothers, they devise a plan to tunnel into the underground prison and rescue Hung Si-kuan.

After some time back in the US, he joined the Berlin bureau of the New York Times in 1933, where he chronicled the rise of Nazi Germany. Within two days of the secret signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact he had managed to get news of it for a page-one story called \\"Nazi Talks Secret\\" whose subtitle included \\"Soviet and Reich Agree on East.\\" On 26 August 1939, he filed a story that noted Nazi troops on the move near Gleiwitz (now Gliwice), which led to the Gleiwitz incident, a false flag operation, on 31 August 1939. (On 28 August 1939, the Times was still reporting on fears of a Gleiwitz raid.) In 1940, he was expelled from Germany. Tolischus was assigned to Tokyo in January 1941. A few hours after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that December, Tolischus was arrested and imprisoned for five months, where he was regularly beaten and tortured.

These congregations have used western liturgical forms such as the Sarum Rite, the Mozarabic Rite, and Gallican Rite. Some congregations use what has become known simply as the English Liturgy, which is derived from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, albeit with some modification to the text to emphasize Orthodox theological teaching. The Western Rite that exists today has been heavily influenced by the life and work of Julian Joseph Overbeck. Western Rite missions, parishes and monasteries exist within certain jurisdictions of the mainstream Orthodox Church, predominantly within the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. In addition, the Western Rite is practiced within religious communities outside the mainstream Eastern Orthodox Church. The Communion of the Western Orthodox Churches and the Orthodox Church of France are entirely Western Rite. Furthermore, there is a small number of Western Rite communities among the Old Calendarists, such as the former Western Rite Exarchate of the Holy Synod of Milan and the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles; within independent Orthodoxy, the American Orthodox Catholic Church's successors have Western Rite metropolitan jurisdictions. In the past, there have also been Western Rite communities within Oriental Orthodoxy. There also are a number of independent Western Orthodox churches and monasteries that are neither part of the Oriental Orthodox Church nor the Eastern Orthodox Church. Western Rite parishes are found almost exclusively in countries with large Roman Catholic or Protestant populations. There are also numerous devotional societies and publishing ventures related to the Western Rite. Western Rite Orthodoxy remains a contentious issue for some; however, the movement continues to grow in numbers and in acceptance. Origins Territorial extent of Byzantine (southern) Italy during the early 11th century. Modern city names (in English) are provided alongside the medieval Greek names. In the times prior to theological disputes that arose between 9th and 11 century, Byzantine Rite churches of the East and Latin Rite churches of the West were in full communion, confessing the same Orthodox, Catholic Christian faith. In the East, the Byzantine Rite was the predominant liturgical rite. In the West, the Latin Rite was the dominant rite. In the time of the final East‚ÄìWest Schism of 1054, most of the Churches that remained in communion with four Eastern Patriarchates used the Byzantine Rite, though there were still regions where other liturgies, including the Roman Rite, were used. One of such regions was Byzantine (southern) Italy. In the time of the final split (1054) much of the southern Italy was still under Byzantine rule and was organized as the Catepanate of Italy. For centuries, church life in Byzantine regions of Italy was developing under dual influence of Latin and Byzantine traditions. During the 11th century, Latin rite churches in Byzantine Italy still did not use the interpolated Nicene Creed (Filioque) and were in full communion with Eastern Orthodoxy. During the Byzantine‚ÄìNorman wars, Byzantine Empire finally lost its last positions in the West. The Norman conquest of southern Italy was completed with the Conquest of Bari in 1071. One of the main consequences of the political change was the establishment of the supremacy of the Church of Rome over the church life in former Byzantine Italy. The main theological challenge was resolved at the Council of Bari in 1098. From that point, all churches in southern Italy were obligated to accept the Filioque clause into the Creed. Implementation of that decision soon marked the end of Latin rite Orthodoxy in southern Italy. After the 11th century, the Byzantine Rite was gradually becoming dominant in the Eastern Orthodox world, almost to the point of exclusion of any other liturgy. Traditions of old Western Orthodoxy were still regarded with high reverence by Eastern Orthodox theologians, but for centuries no organized attempt was made to preserve or revive the Latin branch of Orthodoxy. This changed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when some Western Christians converted to Orthodoxy but retained some of their Western liturgical forms of worship. = Nineteenth century = During the 1840s, William Palmer, a Church of England priest, corresponded with Russian Orthodox Church and Metropolitan Philaret Drozdov of Moscow, and Aleksey Khomyakov. From 1864, Julian Joseph Overbeck, a former Roman Catholic priest, worked to establish a modern Orthodox Western Rite. Overbeck converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism and married. He then emigrated to England in 1863 to become professor of German at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he also undertook studies of the Church of England and Orthodoxy. In 1865 Overbeck was received as a layman into the Russian Orthodox Church (because he had married following his ordination as a Roman Catholic priest), by Father Eugene Poppoff, at the Russian Embassy in London. As a part of his conversion into the , Overbeck requested permission from the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church to begin a Western Orthodox church in England. Initially, Philaret was hesitant about Overbeck's request, but did not rule out the idea entirely. Overbeck outlined his rationale for a Western Orthodox Church in his 1866 book Catholic Orthodoxy and Anglo-Catholicism, a largely polemical work describing why the established Western churches should be rejected.Parry, Ken et al. (editors). The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity. Malden, Massachusetts: 1999. Blackwell Publishing, p. 364 In 1867 Overbeck began to edit The Orthodox Catholic Review, a periodical for the advancement of Western Orthodoxy. Overbeck convinced others about the feasibility of a Western Orthodox church and in 1869 submitted a petition containing 122 signatures, including many in the Oxford Movement, to the Holy Synod asking for the creation of a Western liturgical rite within the .Parry, Ken et al., The Blackwell Dictionary, p. 365. A synodical commission investigated Overbeck's petition, in 1870 he stated his case before the commission in St. Petersburg. The commission approved the petition and he was instructed to present a revised Western liturgy for evaluation by the commission. He presented a revised Western liturgy in December. That liturgy was subsequently approved for use - specifically in the British Isles.Sobranio mnenii i otzyvov Filareta, mitropolita moskovskago i kolomenskago, po uchebnym i tserkovno- gosudarstvennym voprosam, ed. Archbishop Savva, Tome V, Part II (Moscow, 1888), 711-713. Over the next several years, Overbeck developed liturgies for administering other sacraments and for praying a Divine Office. Overbeck attempted to reach Old Catholics to his scheme since they had recently schismed from the Roman Catholic Church over First Vatican Council's dogmatic definition of Papal infallibility, though to little avail. During this time, he continued to criticize Roman Catholics and Anglicans as well as those Western converts to Orthodoxy who utilized the Byzantine Rite. By 1876, Overbeck appealed to other Orthodox Churches for their recognition of his plan. In 1879 he was received in audience by the Patriarch Joachim III of Constantinople, who recognized the theoretical right of Western Christians to have a Western Orthodox Church. Three years later, Joachim III and the Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate conditionally approved Overbeck's Western rite and Benedictine offices. However, Overbeck's efforts ultimately did not result in the establishment of a Western Orthodoxy. He was especially suspicious of the role which the Greeks in London (and the Church of Greece generally) played in the stagnation of his ambitions, directly blaming the Greek Church's protest against the plan in 1892. The Orthodox Catholic Review ended publication in 1885 and Overbeck died in 1905 without seeing a Western Orthodox Church. Georges Florovsky summed up Overbeck's experience in this way: \\"it was not just a fantastic dream. The question raised by Overbeck was pertinent, even if his own answer to it was confusedly conceived. And probably the vision of Overbeck was greater than his personal interpretation.\\" = Twentieth century = While Overbeck did not live to see his dream successful, the idea of a Western Orthodox church did not disappear. The early part of the twentieth century was characterized by a series of false starts. In 1911, Arnold Harris Matthew (a former Roman Catholic priest, later consecrated an Old Catholic bishop), entered into union with the Oriental Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch under Metropolitan Gerasimos (Messarah) of Beirut and, in 1912, with the Eastern Orthodox Pope Photios of Alexandria. Some speculate Bishop Mathew's 1909 Old Catholic Missal And Ritual may have been approved as a Western Rite liturgy by Pope Photios of Alexandria, who wrote: \\"...We have thanked God...that you omit the Filioque clause, and that you do not accept money for celebrating Masses. We agree with you as to the observance of your autonomy, and of the Latin Rite in actual use, so long and so far as they agree with the Holy Dogmas and with the canonical ordinances of the Seven Oecumenical Synods, which form the basis of the Orthodox Faith.\\"John Kersey, Arnold Harris Mathew And The Old Catholic Movement, pp. 108-110, European- American University: London, 2010. Both unions were contracted in quick succession and only lasted for an effective period of a few months. Though the union was protested by the Archbishop of Canterbury to Photios and the Patriarch of Antioch, Matthew's group claimed that communion was never formally broken off.Peter F. Anson. Bishops at Large, pp. 186-188\\\\. Berkeley: Apocryphile Press, 2006. In 1890, the first Western Rite Orthodox community in North America, an Episcopal parish in Green Bay, Wisconsin, pastored by Fr. Ren√© Vilatte, was received by Bishop Vladimir Sokolovsky. However, Vilatte was soon ordained a bishop in the Jacobite Church, an Oriental Orthodox Church not in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church. Other small groups using the Western Rite have been received, but usually have either had little impact or have declared their independence soon after their reception. Western rite parishes were established in Poland in 1926 when a half-dozen congregations were received into Eastern Orthodoxy; however, the movement dwindled during World War II.Parry, Ken et al., The Blackwell Dictionary, p. 515. Orthodox Church of France In 1936, the received a small group led by a former Liberal Catholic bishop, Louis-Charles Winnaert (1880‚Äì1937), as ' (EOO).Parry, Ken et al., The Blackwell Dictionary, p. 514 Winnaert was received as an archimandrite, took the religious name Ir√©n√©e, and soon died. Winnaert's work was continued, with occasional conflict, by one of his priests, Eugraph Kovalevsky (1905‚Äì1970) and Lucien Chambault, the latter of which oversaw a small Orthodox Benedictine community in Paris. After 1946, Kovalevsky began to recreate a Gallican Rite based on the letters of Germain of Paris, a sixth- century bishop of Paris, numerous early Western missals and sacramentaries, and some Byzantine modifications; his development was The divine liturgy of Saint Germanus of Paris.Fr√©d√©ric Luz. Le Soufre & L'encens. Paris: Claire Vigne, 1995. pp. 34-36\\\\. Archimandrite Alexis van der Mensbrugghe, a former Roman Catholic monk, who taught at the Western Church's St. Denys Theological Institute but remained in the Eastern rite, attempted to restore the ancient Roman rite, replacing medieval accretions with Gallican and Byzantine forms. Eventually, Alexis was consecrated as an bishop in 1960, continuing his Western Rite work under the auspices of the Moscow Patriarchate.W. Jardine Grisbrooke, \\"Obituaries: Archbishop Alexis van der Mensbrugghe\\" in Sobornost 4.2 (1981), 212-216. In 1953, pressured by the to adopt the Eastern rite, the Western Orthodox Church went its own way, changing its name to the Orthodox Church of France. After several years of isolation, the church was recognized as an autonomous Church by Metropolitan Anastasy Gribanovsky of and was in communion with from 1959 to 1966. Archbishop John Maximovich, ('s representative in Western Europe at the time), became the archpastor of the Church of France. At this time, Maximovich had the church change its name to ' (ECOF). Maximovich also consecrated Kovalevsky in 1964 as a bishop. Kovalevsky took the religious name Jean-Nectaire. Maximovich's death in 1966 was a serious blow to the Western Orthodox Christians in France. While the 's Western Rite mission withered and ended, thrived; however, after Maximovich died, Kovalevsky was left without canonical protection until his death in 1970. In 1972, the church found a new canonical superior in the Romanian Orthodox Church. Gilles Bertrand-Hardy was then consecrated as bishop and took the religious name Germain of Saint-Denis. In 1993, after long conflict with the Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church about alleged canonical irregularities within , the Romanian Orthodox Church withdrew its blessing of and broke off communion. The Romanian Orthodox Church decided, which is contested by , to depose Bertrand-Hardy from all sacerdotal functions. This decision (which was never accepted by ) is applied by the canonical dioceses of the AEOF (Assembl√©e des Ev√™ques Orthodoxes de France). The sanction was confirmed and explained in 2001 by another document, \\"Avis d'expertise canonique\\" from the Secretary of the Romanian Synod (a document which the considers to have no value). The Romanian Orthodox Church established a deanery under Bertrand-Hardy's brother, Archpriest Gregoire Bertrand-Hardy, to minister to those parishes which chose to remain in communion with the Romanian Orthodox Church. In 2001, scandalized by the revelation within of Bertrand-Hardy's 1995 marriage and subsequent annulment, ten parishes separated from , formed the ' (UACORO), and began negotiations in 2004 with the Serbian Orthodox Church to be canonically recognized, with the intention of the entering the Diocese of France and Western Europe. The laity and clergy of were received individually into the French diocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 2006. These parishes are now predominantly Byzantine Rite, with the Gallican Liturgy served a few times a year. Of the communities that left the only ones which now retain the Western Rite are those that went on to form the Orthodox Church of the Gauls.  North America  Saint Tikhon of Moscow's contribution to the Western Rite has been more enduring. While he was bishop of the 's diocese in America, some Episcopalians were interested in joining Orthodoxy while retaining Anglican liturgical practices. Tikhon, sent the 1892 Book of Common Prayer, enquired about the viability of Orthodox parishes composed of former Anglicans using Anglican liturgical practices. In 1904, the Holy Synod concluded that such parishes were possible and provided a list of doctrinal corrections to the Book of Common Prayer text of the prayers and rites that were necessary to profess in Orthodox worship. The Holy Synod also concluded that detailed changes in the Book of Common Prayer and in Anglican liturgical practices, together with compilations of new prayers, and entire rites, can only be carried out on location in America and not from Moscow. While Tikhon did not receive any Episcopalians as none approached him for reception into the , his efforts laid the groundwork for the later reception of Episcopalians into the following the 1975 revision of the Book of Common Prayer. The most successful and stable group of Western Rite parishes originated within the Orthodox Church under Bishop Aftimios Ofiesh in the 1930s as part of the American Orthodox Catholic Church. In 1932, Bishop Aftimios consecrated an Episcopal priest, Ignatius Nichols, as auxiliary Bishop of Washington and assigned him to the Western Rite parishes. However, due to complaints from Episcopalians that the Episcopal Church was the \\"American\\" Orthodox Church,Gary L. Ward, Bertil Persson, and Alan Bain. Independent Bishops: An International Directory, xi. Apogee Books, 1990. the American Orthodox Church that Aftimios and Nicholas were a part of became estranged from what would become the Orthodox Church in America (OCA). The subsequent marriages of both Aftimios and Nichols violated Orthodox canon law, and left the church and its subsidiaries without canonical recognition.Gary L. Ward et al., Independent Bishops, 295-96, 301-02. In 1932, Nichols founded the Society of Clerks Secular of Saint Basil as a devotional society for clergy and laity dedicated to the celebration of the Western Rite. Nichols also consecrated Alexander Turner as a bishop in 1939. Turner pastored a small parish in Mount Vernon until Nichols' death in 1947, when he assumed leadership of the Society and concluded that there was no future for the Society of Saint Basil outside of canonical Orthodoxy. Turner described the situation the Society found itself in by saying: Through Father Paul Schneirla, he began unofficial dialogue with Metropolitan Antony Bashir. Even before this, Turner had been promoting Western Rite Orthodoxy through his periodical Orthodoxy. In 1961, the Society (consisting of three parishes) was received into the Syrian Antiochian Archdiocese on the basis of Metropolitan Antony's 1958 edict. Upon reception, Bishop Alexander Turner became a canonical priest of the Antiochian Orthodox Church, guiding the group as Vicar-General until his death in 1971, thereafter he was succeeded by Schneirla. However, after Turner's death, the sole surviving Basilian, William Francis Forbes, returned to the American Orthodox Catholic Church and was consecrated a bishop in October 1974.Gary L. Ward et al., Independent Bishops, 143-44. Besides the original communities associated with the Society, a number of other parishes have been received into the Western Rite Vicariate of the Antiochian Archdiocese, particularly as elements within the Episcopal Church became dissatisfied with liturgical change and the ordination of women. The first Episcopal parish to be received into the was the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in Detroit, Michigan.Benjamin J. Andersen, \\"An Anglican Liturgy in the Orthodox Church: The Origins and Development of the Antiochian Orthodox Liturgy of Saint Tikhon\\", Unpublished M.Div. Thesis, St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, 2005, p. 7. Additionally, several Western Rite missions have been founded within the , some growing into full parish status. Furthermore, when parishes of the Evangelical Orthodox Church joined the Antiochian Archdiocese in 1987, a few parishes joined as Western Rite congregations. However, many of these former EOC congregations subsequently switched to the Byzantine Rite. Among Old Calendarist groups, the sole jurisdiction utilizing a Western Rite is the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles, with approximately two dozen parishes. Due to their generally stricter stance, only older rites such as the Sarum are permitted. The Russian and Antiochian jurisdictions in North America operate under a structure known as a \\"vicariate\\" within their respective patriarchates. The Antiochian structure covers Western Rite parishes primarily in the United States while the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia has established parishes, missions and monasteries in the United Kingdom, Germany and Norway.  Elsewhere  In 1995, though none of these congregations is now Western Rite. Translated from Western Rite Orthodoxy, in Australia and New Zealand, emerged mostly from Anglican and Continuing Anglican communities. Some communities were received into the by Archbishop Hilarion (Kapral) of the Diocese of Sydney, Australia and New Zealand. Other were received into the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch by Bishop Gibran (Ramlawi) and Metropolitan Archbishop Paul (Saliba), of the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand, and All Oceania. Saliba has recently received around 30 Western Rite parishes in the Philippines. The Syrian patriarchate of Antioch consecrated Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares as Archbishop of Ceylon, Goa and India in 1889, authorizing a Roman rite diocese under his supervision. Additionally, in 1891 the Syrians consecrated Vilatte as archbishop for the American Old Catholics. Current status in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia On July 10, 2013, the recognition and status of Western Rite parishes within seemed to significantly change. The Synod of Bishops of , presided over by its First Hierarch, decreed that: * would no longer ordain clergy for Western Rite parishes. *Bishop Jerome Shaw of Manhattan would be censured for unapproved ecclesial services and forcibly retired without the right to perform ordinations. *Some ordinations performed by Shaw would not be recognized, and those candidates would be thoroughly examined before regularization. *A commission would examine how to integrate Western Rite clergy and communities into the Russian Orthodox Church. *Western Rite clergy and communities need to adopt the order of divine services of the Eastern Orthodox Church, but may preserve \\"certain particularities of the Western Rite\\". *Adherence to the rules and traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church in particular is required. The Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia established a working commission to deal with the peculiarities that led to decision of July of 2013. Within the following year there was established a new leadership structure that eventually led to the establishment of a revitalized Western Rite Vicariate under the Omophorion of His Eminence Metropolitan Hilarion. New Western Rite parishes and monasteries continue to be founded by ROCOR and priests, deacons and subdeacons within the Western Rite continue to be ordained from 2014 to the present, including in Sweden and the United States.http://orthochristian.com/100459.html; http://orthochristian.com/115386.html Orthodox Church in America Mention of the Western Rite was often made in the , the most prominent being a mention during a speech by the primate of the , Metropolitan Jonah Paffhausen, in April 2009. On September 8, 2018, the Orthodox Church of America established a Western Rite mission parish in Alberta, Canada. However, the OCA has not yet officially established an organizational structure for future Western Rite parishes. Independent Western Orthodox churches and monasteries There are a number of independent Western Orthodox congregations and monasteries. Liturgy An altar prepared according to the rubrics for the Tridentine Mass. Many Western Rite Orthodox congregations celebrate a revised version of the Tridentine Mass under the name Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory. Western Rite parishes do not all utilize the same liturgy, but often use a particular liturgy depending upon their individual affiliations prior to entering Orthodoxy. At present, there are nine different uses available to Western Rite parishes: * The Divine Liturgy of Saint Tikhon ‚Äì This liturgy is currently used by approximately two-thirds of congregations in the . The Rite of St Tikhon was developed utilizing the 1928 American Book of Common Prayer and the Anglican Missal. The Book of Common Prayer was altered by removing the filioque from the text of the Nicene Creed, adding prayers for the dead, the invocation of the saints, and strengthening the epiclesis within the Eucharistic prayer, and by adding the pre-communion prayers from the Byzantine Rite. It is utilized primarily by former Anglican and Episcopalian background parishes. * The Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory ‚Äì Utilized by the remainder of the as well as some communities in . As of 2016, The ROCOR Western Rite Communities use a Restored Gregorian Mass which is derived from texts that had been discovered and translated that are pre- Tridentine in origin and have no byzantine inclusions. * The Sarum Liturgy ‚Äì A British use of the Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory, which retained many local Anglo-Saxon, Gallican, and Celtic elements. It is celebrated within by the St Bride Hermitage and by the Hermitage of the Holy Cross. The text is based upon a nineteenth-century Pearson English translation of the Sarum Missal, corrected of post-Schism insertions. An epiclesis from the Gothic Missal is included. St Hilarion Press and St Gregory's Press editions of Sarum services were blessed for canonical use, in September 2008 and December 2008, respectively. * The English Liturgy ‚Äì The Russian adaptation of the 1549 English Book of Common Prayer according to the criteria set forth by the Holy Synod of Russia in 1907. This liturgy has been augmented with material from the Sarum Missal, Gothic Missal, York rite, and 1718 Scottish Non-Juror liturgy. An epiclesis from the Gothic Missal is included. This liturgy is not the same rite as the Liturgy of Saint Tikhon, and the two rites differ in many respects. * The Liturgy of Saint Germanus ‚Äì Utilized by the French Orthodox Church, the Orthodox Church of the Gauls, and the Orthodox Church of France, as well as some parishes of and the Serbian and Romanian Patriarchates. The liturgy of St Germanus is a reconstructed version of the Gallican mass, supplemented with elements from the Byzantine, Celtic and Mozarabic rites. * The Liturgy of Saint John the Divine ‚Äì Utilized by a monastery of the Moscow Patriarchate, and in publication within . It is a reconstructed version of the first millennium Celtic rite of the British Isles, from the Stowe Missal and other sources, and intended for modern use. The name is from the origin asserted by the Church in the British Isles before the Great Schism. * The Mozarabic Rite ‚Äì The Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles as well as the Holy Synod of Milan permit use of the Mozarabic Rite and the Sarum use. * The Ambrosian Rite ‚Äì The Ambrosian rite may be used in Western rite parishes of . In 2018, a discovery was made of a very ancient missal which included a nearly complete Ambrosian Rite Liturgy that is in the process of being translated into English. * The Glastonbury Rite ‚Äì The Glastonbury Rite was at one time used in the Celtic Orthodox Church. In France, Bishop Alexis van der Mensbrugghe, of the , published a missal in 1962 which contained his restored Gallican rite and his restored pre-Celestinian Italic rite.Vincent Bourne, La Divine Contradiction. Le chant et la lutte de l'Orthodoxie, Paris, Ed. Pr√©sence Orthodoxe, 1978 Neither of Mensbrugghe's restored rites are used by Orthodox groups. = Liturgical development = Most of the present Western Rite liturgies have been developed along the guidelines given to Saint Tikhon by the Holy Synod in 1904/07. As noted above, Tikhon's request to the Holy Synod concerned accepting Episcopal parishes into the Orthodox Church while permitting them to retain the liturgies of the Book of Common Prayer. While Saint Tikhon's request was specifically concerned with Anglicans converting, its recommendations came to be implemented for those parishes who did not have a specifically Anglican background. The two most important required changes included the removal of the filioque from the Nicene Creed and the addition of an epiclesis which specifically invokes the Holy Spirit and a petition for the Spirit to change the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ. When the Antiochian Western Rite Edict was issued, it became necessary to determine what additions or corrections to western liturgies would need to be made to bring those rites into conformity with the 1904 Russian Synodal decree as well as the Ukase of 1936. To that end, the Antiochian Western Rite Commission was convened in 1958 composed of Fr Paul Schneirla, Stephen Upson, Alexander Schmemann and John Meyendorff for the purpose of determining \\"the mode of reception of groups desiring to employ the Western Rite, and the character of the rites to be used, as well as the authorization of official liturgical texts.\\"Benjamin Andersen, Western Rite History, Part 8, September 18, 2004. Last accessed March 16, 2007. Meyendorff, Schmemann, and Schneirla were already familiar with the Western Rite both from having been in contact with members of the ECOF while teaching at Saint Sergius Theological Institute. Schmemann actively followed the Liturgical Movement in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Church and was an advocate for renewal of the Orthodox liturgy.Alexander Schmemann, \\"Notes and Comments: The Western Rite\\" in St. Vladimir's Seminary Quarterly, 2.4 (1958), 37-38. In January 1962, the official Western Rite Directory was issued, \\"establishing liturgical usages and customs and discipline\\", drawing on principles of the 1904 Moscow Synodal response to Saint Tikhon, the authorization of Western Rite offices by Metropolitan Gerassimos (Messarah) of Beirut, and the 1932 Russian Ukase of Metropolitan Sergius.Western Rite History, Part 8, September 18, 2004. Last accessed March 16, 2007. = Liturgical books = Officially, the provides one liturgical book, The Orthodox Missal, which contains both the Liturgy of Saint Tikhon and the Liturgy of Saint Gregory, with appropriate propers for seasons, feasts, saints, and prayers before and after Mass. The Antiochian Archdiocese publishes the Saint Andrew Service Book (SASB), also known as The Western Rite Service Book, which was developed by Saint Michael's Church in California under the leadership of the late Father Michael Trigg; the 1996 second and 2005 third editions of the SASB received official sanction from Metropolitan Philip Saliba, with the latter containing explicit reference to the authorized nature of all previous editions of the SASB. In addition to duplicating the contents of The Orthodox Missal, the SASB also includes forms for Matins and Vespers, the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and the threefold Amen common to the Byzantine epiclesis but absent in The Orthodox Missal. The SASB was produced by the Antiochian Archdiocese without the participation of the . The Orthodox Missal is an official publication of the and is the Vicariate's standard and approved text with the SASB authorized by the Archdiocese as an approved text. Parishes within the are permitted to use either the Liturgy of Saint Tikhon or that of Saint Gregory. While most parishes use the Tikhonite liturgy, several use the Gregorian liturgy on weekdays or on specific Sundays of the year. Presently, there is no breviary specifically designed for the Orthodox Western Rite, though priests of the who celebrate the Liturgy of Saint Gregory are expected to pray as much of the Breviarium Monasticum as possible, in the Anglican Breviary. The same hours, in English or Latin, are approved for Christ the Savior Monastery under the . However, priests who celebrate the Liturgy of Saint Tikhon pray a form of Morning Prayer and Evensong approved by the . Also in common use within the , though not officially approved, are St. Dunstans's Plainsong Psalter, The English Office Noted, and the St. Ambrose Hymnal. The St. Dunstans's Plainsong Psalter sets the Psalter and selected canticles to Gregorian and British Chant and includes orders for Morning Prayer, Evensong, and Compline. The English Office Noted includes Morning, Noonday and Evening Prayers, Compline and the Psalter set in modern notation. The St. Ambrose Hymnal provides musical settings of classic Western hymns as well as post-schism and modern hymns which are judged \\"not to contradict the Orthodox faith.\\" In 2017, it was decided that the Restored Gregorian Liturgy and the English Liturgy were to be the main liturgies celebrated by ROCOR Western Rite parishes going forward. Parishes that were using the Ambrosian or other forms were approved on a case-by-case basis. Within , on a limited basis, the Saint Colman Prayer Book has been authorized by Metropolitan Hilarion Kapral for use within the Diocese of Sydney, Australia and New Zealand. It has since received permission for limited use within other dioceses. The Book includes the Sarum rite, English rite, and Gregorian rite liturgies, together with a simplified version of the monastic hours. Most of the occasional services required by a Parish Priest through the course of the year are there, as well as the Rites of Holy Week and a Lectionary. originally under the auspices of the Holy Synod of Milan and edited by Hieromonk Aidan Keller,E.g.: for liturgical use. They contain complete forms for celebration of the Liturgy or Mass, the Divine Office, the Mysteries or Sacraments, and many other services, with full chant notation. In December 2008, the St. Gregory's Press edition was also blessed for actual usage; these contains full forms, with complete chant notation, for the celebration of the Liturgy or Mass and of the Divine Office, i.e., the Canonical Hours.  Church calendar  Among those Western Rite parishes that are within the Eastern Orthodox Church, some use the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar with the Byzantine Paschal cycle, while others use other calendars. The Communion of the Western Orthodox Churches uses the Gregorian Calendar to determine the dates of the holy days and Pascha, while each member church has its own liturgical calendar. The Luxeuil Lectionary, Missale Gothicum, Missale Gallicum, and the Gallican adaptations of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum are the chief authorities for the Liturgical year of the Gallican Rite. The Western Rite parishes of the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles follow the Julian calendar.  Vestments  Priests of the Western Rite utilize standard Western vestments as a part of their liturgy, whether celebrating one of the Western liturgies or (as far as Antiochians are concerned) when concelebrating a Byzantine liturgy, with some exceptions (See Criticisms below). Antiochian Byzantine Rite Orthodox priests who concelebrate Antiochian Western Rite liturgies wear Byzantine style vestments and hierarchs wear Byzantine vestments when participating in Western liturgies. Clergy using the Sarum or English liturgies use the vestments commonly known as Sarum but which were actually used throughout north-western Europe and the British Isles. These are typified by apparels' of the seasonal colour, added to the alb and amice for priest, deacon, subdeacon, clerk and servers in certain groups, although there is no evidence this was done before the thirteenth century. Organizations Unlike the 23 sui iuris Eastern Catholic Churches, which are autonomous ritual churches with separate hierarchies and canon laws, Western Rite Orthodox congregations of the Antiochian jurisdiction fall under the jurisdiction of their local Orthodox bishop. In North America, the Antiochian Church has established the and the Western Rite Commission to coordinate the activities of Western Rite congregations and to provide a single point of contact for persons and groups concerning Western Rite Orthodoxy. However, all the Western Rite congregations remain under the direct supervision of their normal diocesan bishop, with Bishop Basil (Essey) of Wichita being the \\"hierarch of reference\\" and advocate for Western Rite issues within the synod of Bishops. In the , as of November 2009, all Western Rite Orthodox congregations and monastic houses fall under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan. The Old Calendarists have two hierarchies which consider themselves Western jurisdictions and therefore have no liaison, citing the canonical responsibility of bishops to their local territories, opting to simply treat all parishes of Western and Eastern Rite equally. Of these, the larger Western Rite organization is the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles, with the presiding hierarch, Metropolitan John LoBue of New York and New Jersey, the only Orthodox bishop in North America who regularly employs Western usage in his monastery. =Publishing houses= The official publishing arm of the is St. Luke's Priory Press in Stanton, New Jersey. Among their publications are The Orthodox Missal, the official service book of the ; The Orthodox Ritual, the official source for the administration of all the sacraments in the vicariate; and the annual Ordo Kalendar. They also publish several apologetic works concerning the Western Rite. Lancelot Andrewes Press is the publishing arm of the Fellowship of Saint Dunstan and publishes material which is utilized by congregations and individuals in Western rites. The primary mission of Lancelot Andrewes Press is to publish material for the \\"advancement of historic Christian orthodoxy, as expressed by the liturgical and devotional usages of traditional English Christianity.\\" Among their publications are the Monastic Diurnal and St. Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter. While not official publishing houses, St Petroc Monastery, Christminster, and St. John Cassian Press have published copies of liturgies for use by Western Rite congregations. St. John Cassian Press distributes former St. Hilarion Press publications (see \\"Organizations\\" above) blessed for use, including Orthodox Prayers of Old England (omnibus service book), The Holy Psalter (core of the divine office), Old Sarum Rite Missal, The Companion (epistle and gospel book), Chant Ordinarium (a kyriale), and Westminster Benedictional (a book of blessings), in all some 2,500 pages of approved texts, with chant. This body of work includes several apologetic works concerning Western rites and Orthodoxy in general. The most voluminous texts of the Western Rite in English, however, have been produced by Old Calendarists: recently 10,000 pages of text of the Western monastic psalter in traditional English were placed online for free download and use. =Devotional societies= There are also devotional societies within the : *The Orthodox Christian Society of Our Lady of Walsingham ‚Äì dedicated to encouragement of devotion to the Theotokos, particularly under the title of Our Lady of Walsingham (and the preservation of the replica of the shrine of Walsingham). *The Fellowship of Saint Dunstan ‚Äì dedicated to historic Christian Orthodoxy particularly traditional English Christianity. =Parishes and missions= Parishes and missions belonging to the Western Rite can be found in a number of Orthodox jurisdictions. The single largest group of such communities is to be found within the Orthodox Church of France, followed by jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church,http://www.rocor-wr.org/parishes and the Communion of Western Orthodox Churches. There are also parishes and missions belonging to the Old Calendarist tradition. =Canonical missionary societies= These groups are Canonical missionary societies with a core of canonical Orthodox laity served by canonical Orthodox clergy within the Orthodox Church with the goal of future reception of converts into the Western Rite of Orthodoxy. The societies themselves were formed inside the Orthodox Church for reception of converts, and not for the reception of the societies themselves. The Orthodox Church they are currently under the guidance of is also listed. *Saint Brendan OSS - Panama City Florida - ROCOR Criticisms Metropolitan Kallistos Ware says that the Western Rite is inherently divisive; following different liturgical traditions than their neighboring Byzantine Rite Orthodox Christians, those using the Western Rite do not share liturgical unity with them and present an unfamiliar face to the majority of Orthodox Christians. Ware is particularly concerned about the further fragmentation of Orthodoxy in non-Orthodox countries, in this case in Britain.Bishop Kallistos. \\"Some Thoughts on the 'Western Rite' in Orthodoxy\\" in The Priest: A Newsletter for the Clergy of the Diocese of San Francisco, 5, May 1996.

The gunman, William Phillips, an employee for Jacobs Engineering who worked at Building 44, shot and killed one person and took a hostage for over three hours before committing suicide. Police said Phillips was under review for poor job performance and he feared being dismissed. Timeline of events The situation began at 1:00 p.m. (UTC-5) when gunman William Phillips entered a conference room, pointed a .38 or .357-caliber snub-nosed revolver at one person, and ordered everyone else to leave. He immediately confronted David Beverly about his job review, saying \\"You're the one who's going to get me fired.\\" The two talked for several minutes. Then, at approximately 1:40 p.m., three gunshots were heard. Police said Beverly was initially shot twice, but he was still alive. Phillips left and then returned seconds later to shoot Beverly twice more.Nasa killer 'had bad job review' BBC News Phillips then took Fran Crenshaw, who happened to be in the area, hostage and bound her to a chair with duct tape. Phillips barricaded himself and Crenshaw inside the second floor of Building 44 for the next three hours. During this, Crenshaw attempted to calm Phillips, with whom she was reported to have had a positive relationship. Later, Crenshaw was able to get herself out of the tape and alert authorities about what was happening. Meanwhile, SWAT teams surrounded the building. Building 44 as well as four other nearby buildings were evacuated and NASA employees in other buildings were ordered to remain inside their buildings, but were later told they were free to go at the end of the workday. A nearby school, Space Center Intermediate School, was temporarily placed on lockdown. The incident ended at 5:00 p.m. as the SWAT teams attempted to communicate with Phillips when the gunman committed suicide with a single shot to the head. Crenshaw was taken to St. John Hospital by ambulance and then released for questioning by the Houston Police Department. She was physically unharmed and walked out of the hospital on her own. =Victims= A person identified as David Beverly was shot four times to the chest and killed.

It is south of the town of Harrogate, and forms part of the civil parish of Pannal and Burn Bridge. Burn Bridge is set largely on the side of a hill. The Crimple Beck runs through the lower area of the village. Burn Bridge plays host to Pannal Cricket Club and the Black Swan pub.  History  The name was first recorded in 1666 (as Burne Bridge), and appears to mean \\"burnt bridge\\". There has been speculation that the place may have been named after a fire destroyed the bridge.Information from Postcards from Pannal by Anne Smith (Self-published by Anne Smith, Harrogate. Undated; c. 2000).Ancestry.com: historical photos of the previous Black Swan building. It has also been suggested that the bridge was named after the burn, or beck which runs along its southern edge. Burn Bridge was historically in the township of North Rigton in the ancient parish of Kirkby Overblow in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1938 it was part of the area transferred to the municipal borough and civil parish of Harrogate.Vision of Britain. North Rigton CP boundary map In 1974 it was transferred with the rest of the municipal borough to the new Borough of Harrogate in North Yorkshire, and became part of the unparished area of Harrogate. In 2016 it became part of the new civil parish of Pannal and Burn Bridge.Pannal and Burn Bridge Parish Council website The village today View of bridge from Crimple Beck, looking west. The village is now mainly a dormitory for commuters to Harrogate and Leeds, a few Menwith Hill employees and many retired people. To the west is mostly pasture land with sheep and cattle. There are two riding stables in the area. To the east is Pannal which expanded, when Crimple Meadows was built in the 1970s, to the point at which it would have joined with Burn Bridge. A condition on building permission for Crimple Meadows was that there would be only a footpath and no roads, between the two villages, to maintain their separate identities. The nearest shop, school and church are at the adjacent village of Pannal. The village's only community centre is the Black Swan pub, so its Fifth of November gatherings and other annual celebrations tend to take place in the pub garden,York Press: Mention of Bonfire Night at Black Swan. apart from the August bank holiday gala which takes place at Pannal Cricket Ground. A mobile library visits Westminster Drive for 10 minutes and Spring Lane for 20 minutes every few weeks. = The Black Swan pub = The Black Swan pub on Burn Bridge Road. Its local name is the Mucky Duck. Apparently there has been a hostelry on the site since charcoal burners used it in c. 1650. Opposite the pub on Burn Bridge Road was the smithy, later a grocer's shop until the 1960s and now converted to an office.  Public transport  The only public transport serving the village is the 110 Harrogate Bus Company village bus to Harrogate at two-hourly intervals on weekdays; fewer on Saturdays. Otherwise the nearest bus route is the 36 between Leeds and Ripon, via Pannal and Harrogate. Pannal railway station is the nearest rail link, providing trains to Leeds, and to York via Harrogate, at half-hourly intervals Monday to Saturday; less frequently on Sundays.  The Westminster estate  This estate, known locally as the Westminsters, contains some houses built in the 1920s. It was expanded by 147 houses in the 1950s, and c65 more were added by George Wimpey by 1961Broadbank, Philip (2003). 20th Century Housing Development in Harrogate. on a slope where there were once drystone-walled pastures and a small wood. In Westminster Drive there are the two last remaining thatched houses in the area, and a Victorian house built before 1860, which was once called The Horst.  Allan Wood  This little bluebell wood forms the boundary between Burn Bridge and Pannal Recreation Ground. Originally a commercial planting of softwood, it is now owned by Harrogate Borough Council which maintains it as a local amenity, and is in the process of gradually re-planting it with indigenous trees.Information from Council parks department.  Malthouse Lane  Stonework on the bridge at the end of Malthouse Lane. This marks the southern edge of the Burn Bridge settlement, and runs alongside Crimple Beck. = Malthouse Lane courtyard and milldam = There were mills on the site next to Malthouse Lane bridge from the 14th century. The corn mill nearest to the bridge backed onto the milldam, and housed the water wheel. Now converted to housing, it still contains the original wooden bevel gears which were driven by the water wheel. The milldam was fed from Crimple Beck via a goit upstream, and the water ran off via a culvert under the corn mill and returned to the stream near Malthouse Lane bridge. The milldam was drained c. 1975 and is now a wildlife preserve under a woodland preservation order. Fauna such as woodpeckers and willow warblers are colonising this site. The Victorian house between the courtyard and Pannal Cricket Ground is Bridge House, which was once the farm house of Thomas Hudson, who owned much of the local land to the south of Crimple Beck. His barn stands on the other side of the cricket ground, and is now converted to housing. The barn had cow byres and stables behind. The attached semicircular gin gang,For image, see :File:Wheelhouse at Hudsons Barn, Burn Bridge 016b.jpg where a horse turned the grinding mill for the corn, existed until the winter of 2010‚Äì2011, when it was demolished to be rebuilt as domestic accommodation.For image, see :File:Wheelhouse at Hudsons Barn, Burn Bridge 016c.jpg = The malthouse = The malthouse was built on farmland nearby, in what is now Malthouse Lane. The malthouse was built c. 1876 by farmer Thomas Hudson, who bought the land for the purpose in that year from landowner Eliza Penelope Bentley of Pannal Hall.Information from UK Land Registry. NB: The information in Postcards from Pannal is incorrect here. Wagons brought coal and barley from a railway siding whose remaining containing wall for the coal can still be seen by the Harrogate Line. The malthouse was demolished in 1975, but the malthouse manager's house remains. The cobbled yard of that house was the malthouse coalyard, and steps once led down from the coalyard to the boiler room and river. Four houses, built in 1975, now stand on the malthouse site. = Rose Cottage = Crimple Beck Cottage, the two-storey house opposite the malthouse which was previously called Rose Cottage, was built before 1840.It is marked on the 1840 inch map of the area. A copy of the map is held at the Victoria Library in Harrogate. An early 20th-century photograph of the malthouse shows Rose Cottage as a much smaller single-storey building.  Crimple Beck  Some reaches of the Crimple Beck which passes through Burn Bridge are protected with associated SSSIs and SINCs, and freshwater fish and crayfish are protected under various Acts. The river does have a history of mink preying on other animals, but there are still mallards, moorhens, herons, kingfishers and grey wagtails, besides more common birds. View of Crimple Beck, looking east from under the bridge. = Flooding history = Around the Crimple Beck area, at the bottom of the hill, there have been several floods in living memory. The 1940s flood rose to about a yard deep in Malthouse Lane due to a river-wall collapse downstream.Information and photographs from former malthouse foreman. The July 1968 flood rose to about a yard deep in Malthouse Lane due to a culvert collapse downstream,eye witnesses after which the culvert under the Leeds Road was repaired and significantly enlarged. Later there were two very shallow floods: the first in December 1983 when a householder's building works temporarily dammed the beck downstream; as a consequence of this, Yorkshire Water built a low flood defence wall along part of Malthouse Lane and between some properties and the beck. The second shallow flood was in 2004 when the storm drain carrying water from the Westminster estate became blocked where it ran under a house in Malthouse Lane, and the water had to find other routes to the beck.Information from residents. These faults were corrected. Finally in June 2007 there was a one-foot-deep flood in the area after a major but temporary National Grid gas-pipeline-laying operation. Very wide paths of earth were exposed and compacted for the pipelaying further upstream during the works, encouraging sudden, fast drainage across acres of bare earth into the river after heavy storms, and the beck ran too full for the first time.Youtube: 2007 flood at Burn Bridge.Floods.co.uk: Flood video from Burn Bridge. In a similar situation at Peckham in 2003, some residents suggested that the process of laying a pipeline had encouraged flooding; however this was denied by the pipelaying company Weeks, and by the Council which had responsibility for overseeing the works. According to the Natural Gas Forum, the proper procedure when pipelaying is to erect barriers to prevent massive, sudden storm water runoff into streams, when swathes of bare earth are exposed. Compacted soil from large-scale works can lead to increased runoff and higher peak storm flows into streams. Therefore, all of the above flooding was apparently due to human agency; no evidence has been discovered so far of the existence of a floodplain here.  Brackenthwaite Lane  Close to where Brackenthwaite Lane joins Burn Bridge Road was a long, narrow thatched house in which the Dennison family of farmworkers brought up their 21 children. The site is now part of the garden of Norfolk House.  Town planning  In Westminster Drive: the last thatched houses in the area = Future building development = This village is bordered on the south and west sides by pasture, which has been at intervals identified as a greenfield sitei.e. a potential site for housing developments. by town planners. This is possibly because there is Burn Bridge or Pannal on one side of these fields and, in the distance, a main road on the other side. So far, the Pannal Village Society, local residents and certain town councillors have successfully argued against these plans, on the grounds that the village is already too much urbanised for a rural area with no official community centre of its own. It has also been suggested that Burn Bridge Road is already heavily used by commuters to and from Harrogate, such that speed-control measures have been built into the road. Already it is unsafe to walk from Burn Bridge via Burn Bridge Road to the bus stop on the Leeds-Harrogate road during the rush hour, as Burn Bridge Road is narrow and has many corners, roadside ditches and no footpath. Recent official suggestions about sites, given by town planners, are here. It was suggested in the Harrogate Advertiser in February 2008 that Harrogate Council had conceded that development in this area would impact negatively on the environment. = Consultation process for conservation area = Harrogate Borough Council has published a consultation booklet entitled: Pannal Conservation Area Character Appraisal ‚Äì Draft for consultation (March 2009). This brings a small part of Burn Bridge into the proposed Pannal conservation area, while leaving most of Burn Bridge unappraised, and Burn Bridge itself is not being appraised as an independent unit. Please see Talk:Burn Bridge for further comments on this matter, which is currently under local discussion with the Council. It is not known whether there are any listed buildings in Burn Bridge as there are no Burn Bridge items on English Heritage's Images of England site.

Geography The settlement stretches in the upper Drava Valley (Drautal) between the Kreuzeck mountain range in the north, part of the High Tauern, and the Gailtal Alps in the south. From Greifenburg, a mountain road leads southwards up to the Weissensee lake and Kreuzberg Saddle pass. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Bruggen, Greifenburg proper, and Kerschbaum. History The present-day settlement may have arisen from a mansio called Bilachium on the Roman road from Sanctium (Villach) along the Drava River up to Littamum (Innichen), at the strategically important branch-off to Kreuzberg Pass. Greifenburg Castle Greifenburg Castle was first mentioned in an 1166 deed, then located within the lands held by the House of Gorizia (Meinhardiner); it was acquired by the Carinthian duke Bernhard von Spanheim about 1230. Duke Bernhard maintained Greifenburg, defeating the united troops of Count Meinhard I of G√∂rz and his father-in-law Count Albert IV of Tyrol with the support from his son Archbishop Philip of Salzburg in 1252. Vested with market rights in 1267, Greifenburg nevertheless fell to the Meinhardiner dynasty, when upon the extinction of the Sponheim dynasty the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany enfeoffed Count Meinhard's son, Meinhard II, with the Carinthian duchy in 1286. Duke Meinhard II died at Greifenburg Castle in 1295. Upon the death of Meinhard's heir Duke Henry in 1335, Greifenburg, with the Carinthian lands, passed to the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1335. In 1460, Count John II of G√∂rz officially relinquished all claims to the town in favour of Emperor Frederick III. In 1537 the Habsburgs enfeoffed their treasurer Count Gabriel von Salamanca-Ortenburg with the estates; his heirs held Greifenburg Castle until 1626.

With the exception of blends containing honey and beeswax and CO2 Butter Extract, the oils are vegan- friendly. Influences and inspirations The blends are inspired by works of art, mythology, folk superstitions, voodoo, classical literature, historical figures, pirates, and carnivals. Themes include aromatherapy, locations both real and fictional, devilish garden plantings, role playing games, fairy tales, vampire lore, gothic and pagan themes, Lovecraftian mythos, Japanese \\"Shunga\\" artwork and deities and concepts from a variety of pantheons.

In April 2017, BPAL revisited its collaboration with Neil Gaiman (see Social Causes below) in celebration of the premiere of the American Gods (TV series) on Starz Channel, ten years after they first released fragrances based on his novel of the same name. The newly launched products include perfume oils, atmosphere sprays, and nail polishes. Proceeds once again will go to the CBLDF. Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab maintains a gothic aesthetic of its website, framing product descriptions with snippets of poetry and category art (monochrome drawings or etchings) by Aubrey Beardsley, Beresford Egan, Felicien Rops, Harry Clarke, Albrecht D√ºrer, John Tenniel, Andreas Vesalius, Jennifer Williamson, Julie Dillon, Sarah Coleman, Alicia Dabney, Madame Talbot, and others. Lilith, Elizabeth Barrial's daughter with her husband, Ted Barrial (who runs BPAL's sister company, Black Phoenix Trading Post) has also been an inspiration for scents since her birth in 2008. Elizabeth has said that the scents inspired by her daughter are some of her favorites to create, and there is an annual Lilith update that coincides with her birthday. Social causes and compassionate consumerism Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab practices compassionate consumerism, with a goal to give back to the community through charitable contributions, volunteer work, and by supporting fair trade and self-sustaining growers whenever possible. They have participated in fundraisers for many organizations, including the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund (\\"CBLDF\\"), Hero Initiative, the Orangutan Foundation UK, AIDS Project Los Angeles, Covenant House, the Red Cross, UNICEF, the SPCA, and the Humane Society. Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab also participates in the Green Power For A Green L.A. program. In 2007, Black Phoenix announced a series of perfumes based on the works of Neil Gaiman inspired by, among others, the novels American Gods, Stardust, The Graveyard Book, Coraline and Anansi Boys. All profits from the Neil Gaiman-inspired scents go to the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. Black Phoenix also released a collection of perfumes based on Good Omens (co-authored by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett) and sales went to benefit the CBLDF and the Orangutan Foundation UK. By the end of the first week of July 2007, Neil Gaiman announced on his blog that they had raised $1,500 for the Orangutan Foundation UK and the year-to-date fundraising for the CBLDF had raised over $15,000. By 2010, the CBLDF reported that BPAL's Neil Gaiman line of fragrances had raised over $50,000 for the organization. In 2012, Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab became a corporate member of the CBLDF and they continue to sponsor the CBLDF's Welcome Party each year at the San Diego Comic Con. In July 2015, a line called The Collected Poetic Works of Antonin Scalia debuted, based on the Supreme Court Justice's \\"colorfully vitriolic superlatives.\\" A portion from the sale of every bottle is donated to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Trevor Project and the National Center for Transgender Equality. In November 2015, BPAL released a scent called Palmyra. All proceeds after the cost of manufacture went to benefit the UNHCR‚Äôs efforts to aid refugees and meet humanitarian needs. In October 2016, BPAL released a scent based on Donald Trump's unprecedented remark directed at Hillary Clinton during the third Presidential debate, Nasty Woman. Proceeds from this fragrance were split between Planned Parenthood and Emily's list. Products Scents are unique to Black Phoenix and are created and hand blended in-house by Elizabeth Barrial or Brian Constantine. Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab currently produces and sells perfume oils in two sizes: 1/32 oz sample vials called Imp's Ears (or \\"Imps\\"), and 5-mL glass bottles. They have an extensive General Catalog of scents and several times a year they release themed Limited Edition oils to coincide with Halloween, Yule, Lupercalia, and other calendar-based holidays and events. BPAL also releases one new monthly scent which coincides with the full moon. These scents are different each month, following themes established by various mythological and lunar calendars, and they are only available for a few days. While most selling is done online, The Lab does host monthly \\"Lunacy\\" (Will Call) events in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Vermont to allow people to purchase oils in person and interact with the staff and owners. Additionally, they often make scents available for giveaway as part of food drives or other charitable events at these times. BPAL has two sister companies which focus more specifically on certain customer needs: Twilight Alchemy Lab offers ritual oils for spiritual purposes, and Black Phoenix Trading Post sells officially licensed BPAL-related garments, jewelry, home items, and bath and beauty products, as well as offering limited edition and special release oils. In addition to their retail products, BPAL has also created unique scents for companies in the creative field to use as event gifts, such as the bottles of Nocturnus given out by Thrillbent Comics at the 2012 San Diego ComicCon. Collaborations and use by other artists In 2013, BPAL created a perfume called The Gatekeeper which was inspired by The Maze of Games, an interactive puzzle novel written by Mike Selinker and illustrated by Pete Venters. The scent was offered as a Kickstarter perk and then became part of the catalog. Erin Morgenstern, author of The Night Circus, named \\"the olfactory geniuses of Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab\\" in the book's acknowledgments. In April 2007, Weird Tales published a piece of original fiction entitled \\"Six Scents\\" by Lisa Mantchev, which drew its inspiration from six BPAL fragrances. In 2005, the Lab was named as The Village Voice's Best of New York: Best Scent Indulgence for Your Inner Goth.

He was Director of Chancery and a Lord of Session.http://www.scotsconnection.com/clan_crests/Scott.htm His surname is often spelt as Scott, and Scotstarvit is also spelt as Scotstarvet or Scotstarver. Life He was the only son of Robert Scot the younger of Knights-Spottie in Perthshire, representative in the male line of the Scots of Buccleuch. Robert Scot succeeded to the office of director of chancery on the resignation of his father, Robert Scot the elder of Knights-Spottie, but, falling into bad health, resigned the office in 1582 in favour of his father, its former holder. Robert Scot the elder in 1592 again resigned the office to a kinsman, William Scot of Ardross, on condition that his grandson, John Scott (the subject of this article) should succeed to it on attaining majority, which he did in 1606. The Scottish chancery framed and issued crown charters, brieves, and other crown writs. The possession, loss, and efforts to regain this office played a large part in the career of Sir John. He was educated at St. Leonard's College, St. Andrews, which he appears to have entered in 1600: he describes himself in the register of 1603 as in his third year. After leaving St. Andrews he went abroad to study, and on his return was called to the bar in 1606. In 1611 he acquired Tarvet and other lands in Fife, to which he gave the name of Scotstarvet, and six years later he was knighted then made a privy councillor in 1622 by James VI, in whose honour he published a Latin poem, Hod≈ìporicon in serenissimi et invictissimi Principis Jacobi Sexti ex Scoti√¢ su√¢ discessum. In 1619 Scot had a license to go for a year to Flanders and elsewhere. He did not practise much, if at all, at the bar, but recommended himself to Charles I by a suggestion for increasing the revenue by altering the law of feudal tenure. He became in 1629 an extraordinary, and in 1632 an ordinary, lord of session under the title of Scotstarvet. He was one of many Scottish lawyers and lairds who accepted the covenant, which he subscribed at his parish kirk of Ceres, Fife on 30 April 1638, and in the following November he declined to sign the king's confession. In 1640 he served on the committee of the estates for the defence of the country. In 1641 he was, with consent of the estates, reappointed judge by a new commission. During the war between England and Scotland he served on the war committee in 1648 and 1649. He bought the Mill of Kinghorn and Inchkeith Island for 20,000 merks in 1649.http://www.oldandnewedinburgh.co.uk/volume6/page109.htm Under the Commonwealth he lost the office both of judge and director of chancery. He made many appeals to be restored to the latter as an administrative, and not a judicial, office; but, although he obtained an opinion in his favour by the commissioners of the great seal, Oliver Cromwell gave it in 1652 to Jeffrey the quaker, who held it till the Restoration. Scott, through George Monck, again appealed to Cromwell for the reversion of the office if Jeffrey died. Cromwell fined him ¬£1,500 in 1654 for his part in the war. But his later correspondence with Cromwell did not improve his character with the royalists, and on the Restoration he was fined ¬£500, and was not restored to the office of judge or that of director of chancery, which was conferred on Sir William Ker, who, he indignantly said, ‚Äòdanced him out of it, being a dextrous dancer.‚Äô Sir James Balfour described Scott's public character in a few words: ‚ÄòHe was a busy man in troubled times.‚Äô But in spite of his misfortunes, Scot did not cease to be busy when peace came. He returned to Scotstarvet, where he engaged in literary work and correspondence. There he died in 1670. Works and legacy Scott is characterized by James Grant in Old and New Scotland as \\"eccentric and sarcastic\\". He consoled himself for his disappointment in losing office by composing The Staggering State of Scottish Statesmen, not published until a hundred years after his death.The Staggering State of the Scots Statesmen, for one hundred years, viz. from 1550 to 1650. By Sir John Scot, of Scotstarvet, Director of the Chancery [and edited by Walter Goodal]. Edinburgh : W. Ruddiman, 1754, 12mo.Republished as The Staggering State of Scottish Statesmen : from 1550 to 1650. By Sir John Scot, of Scotstarvet, with a Memoir of the Author and Historical Illustrations by the Rev. Charles Rogers, Historiographer to the Historical Society. Edinburgh : William Paterson, 1872 (printed in a limited edition of 100 copies). See also Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 1, pp 389-414. Scotstarvit Tower, which Sir John rebuilt, still stands, and the inscription, with his initials and those of his first wife, Anne Drummond, as the builders, and its date (1627) are carved on a stone over the door. The tower became a kind of college, where he attracted round him the learned Scotsmen of the time, and corresponded with the scholars of Holland, Caspar Barl√¶us, Isaac Gruterus, and others. In it his brother-in-law William Drummond composed his History of the Jameses and the macaronic comic poem Polemo-Middinia, which had its occasion in a dispute of long standing as to a right of way between the tenants of Scotstarvet and of Barns, the estate of Sir Alexander Cunningham, whose sister was Drummond's betrothed. In 1620 he endowed the professorship of humanity or Latin in his old college, St. Leonard's, at the university of St. Andrews, in spite of the opposition of the regents of St. Salvator. At the same time he organised a substantial collective gift of classical texts to the library of St. Leonard's for the use of the Humanity regent. Fellow donors included Scott's brother-in-law, Drummond, and other distinguished men of the time.R V Pringle: \\"An early humanity class library: the gift of Sir John Scot and friends to St Leonard's College (1620)\\" Scott's intimacy with Joan Blaeu of Amsterdam led to the inclusion of a Scottish volume in the series of Deliti√¶ Poetarum then being issued by that enterprising publisher. The Scottish volume, edited by Arthur Johnston, and printed at the sole cost of Scott in two closely printed duodecimo volumes, has preserved the last fruits of Scottish latinity. A more important work was the publication of detailed maps of Scotland in the great atlas of Blaeu. Scot interested himself in the survey of Scotland begun in 1608 by Timothy Pont. Pont's drawings, after his death about 1614, were purchased by the crown. Scott caused them to be revised by Sir Robert Gordon of Straloch and his son, James Gordon, parson of Rothiemay, and then went in 1645 to Amsterdam to superintend their publication, dictating from memory the description of several districts. The work was not issued till 1654, when it appeared as ‚ÄòGeographi√¶ Blaeuani√¶ volumen quintum,‚Äô with dedicatory epistles to Scot both by Blaeu and Gordon of Straloch. Other examples of Scott's public spirit were the establishment of the St. Andrews professorship of Latin and his endowment of a charity for apprenticing poor boys from Glasgow at the estate of Peskie near St. Andrews. Family Scot was three times married: first, to Anne, sister of William Drummond of Hawthornden, the poet, by whom he had two sons and seven daughters; secondly, to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Melville, 2nd of Hallhill; and thirdly, to Margaret Monpenny of Pitmilly, widow of Rigg of Aitherny, by each of whom he had one son. The son by his second wife, George Scott (died 1685), is known as a writer on America.

Geography View from Glockner road At the northwestern edge of Carinthia and bordering East Tyrol and the state of Salzburg state, Heiligenblut is located in a high valley of the High Tauern range within the Central Eastern Alps. It is situated at the foot of the Grossglockner, the highest mountain in Austria, and of the Pasterze Glacier. Neighbouring peaks include the Johannisberg and the Fuscherkarkopf in the north, both part of the Alpine divide marking the Carinthia-Salzburg border. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Apriach, Rojach, and Zlapp und Hof. The municipality is also the southern starting point of the scenic Grossglockner High Alpine Road to Bruck in the state of Salzburg, the former Hochtor Pass, today the continuation of the B107 highway from Lienz in East Tyrol. Nearby attractions include the Heiligenblut-Ro√übach-Schareck cable car up to , an open-air museum, the Stockm√ºhlen mills in Apriach with nine flume mills, Lake Kachelsee to the west, the M√∂ll, G√∂√ünitz and Leiter waterfalls, the Margaritzen reservoir, and Lake Sandersee. The construction of the nearby railway tunnel to the Flei√üalm mountain area at is unique in Europe. The 1.6 km-long (1-mile) tunnel is filled with water during the summer but serves as a railway tunnel leading to the Flei√üalm winter sports region in winter. History E.T. Compton A chapel at Heiligenblut in the Duchy of Carinthia was first mentioned in 1271, containing a relic of the Blood of Christ. According to legend, a flask of the Holy Blood, which is today kept in a sacrament house, was brought here in 914 AD from the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople by a Danish knight called Briccius (Frederick, not to be confused with Saint Brice), once in the service of Emperor Constantine VII. On his way home across the Alps, he was buried by an avalanche and in the face of death hid the relic in an open wound at his calf. His corpse was later found by local peasants at a place where three ears of wheat broke through the snow‚Äîas rendered in the Heiligenblut coat of arms. The Gothic pilgrimage church dedicated to Saint Vincent of Saragossa, with its prominent spire, was built between 1460‚Äì1491. The church also houses a late-Gothic winged altarpiece from 1520, and a crypt and tomb containing Briccius' mortal remains. A transhumance agricultural as well as a gold mining from ancient history to the Middle Ages, Heiligenblut was a stop on the bridle path and later Roman road leading to the Hochtor Pass across the Alps, probably already in use during the Hallstatt culture which followed on from the Late Bronze Age. In 1834 Archduke John of Austria had a first mountain hut built beneath the pass, and a driveway was constructed from 1875. The opening of the Grossglockner Road in 1935 decisively promoted the economy of Heiligenblut as a tourism and mountaineering resort.

He previously served as head coach of Lehigh University, UNC Greensboro, and Siena. McCaffery played college basketball for one season at Wake Forest before transferring to Penn. In his playing days, he acquired the nickname of \\"White Magic\\".SI's 2009 Top 20 Scouting Reports, Sports Illustrated, November 23, 2009.

Tatum is best known for his appearances with the Texas-based promotion World Class Championship Wrestling in the 1980s. Early life Frankel was born in Mobile, Alabama, but was raised in Pensacola, Florida. He was a childhood friend of wrestlers Robert Gibson, Percy Pringle and Michael Hayes. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1983)= Frankel was trained to wrestle by Michael Hayes, debuting in 1983. He initially performed under the ring name \\"Franklin Hayes\\", the storyline cousin of Michael Hayes. Tatum wrestled on the independent circuit before being recruited by the Charlotte, North Carolina-based Jim Crockett Promotions. During the early days of his career, Tatum began a relationship with Missy Hyatt. =World Class Championship Wrestling (1983‚Äì1986)= Tatum was recruited to the Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling promotion by his friend Rick Hazzard. Hyatt came with him to Texas and eventually became his valet. In 1986, Tatum began a feud with Chris Adams, mocking him for being temporarily \\"blinded\\" (in reality, Adams wore an eye patch over his left eye while involved in a separate feud with Gino Hernandez earlier in the year). After the feud with Adams ended, he and Hyatt would feud with Scott Casey and his valet Sunshine, which resulted in several cat fights between Hyatt and Sunshine. =Universal Wrestling Federation (1986‚Äì1987)= Leaving WCCW in May 1986, Tatum and Hyatt joined Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation and teamed with Jack Victory against The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers), before eventually joining Eddie Gilbert's stable \\"Hot Stuff Inc.\\" (later renamed \\"Hyatt & Hot Stuff International\\"). In 1987, Tatum and Hyatt began a storyline in which Tatum lost a \\"Valet For A Day Match\\" to The Missing Link after interference by Gilbert (on behalf of Tatum). Shortly thereafter, Tatum began feuding with Gilbert with Hyatt siding with Gilbert after hitting him from behind with a \\"loaded\\" Gucci handbag (considered to be one of the more unusual \\"heel turns\\" in wrestling at the time Conner, Floyd. Wrestling's Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of Pro Wrestling's Outrageous Performers, Punishing Piledrivers and Other Oddities. Dulles, Virginia: Brassey's, 2001. (pg. 91)). However, as a result of a real life affair between Hyatt and Gilbert, Tatum left the promotion with Victory at the end of year. =World Class Championship Wrestling (1987‚Äì1990)= Returning to Dallas in December 1987, Tatum and Victory feuded over the World Class Wrestling Association Texas Tag Team and Wild West Wrestling Tag Team Championships with Steve and Shaun Simpson during the next year. =United States Wrestling Association (1990‚Äì1991)= In 1990, Tatum wrestled in the United States Wrestling Association. He was involved in a brief angle with Kevin Von Erich in the Texas end of the USWA and later began an angle involving Bill Dundee both in Dallas and Memphis. Tatum introduced a new valet, known as \\"Tessa\\". However, unlike Missy Hyatt, Tessa was reluctant to interfere in his matches; and eventually she became a babyface manager, very similar to Sunshine. In addition, Tatum began using a thrust kick (similar to Chris Adams' superkick), which he called the California Kick. Tatum drew huge controversy in a July 6, 1990 match at the Dallas Sportatorium, whereas Tatum was slapped by Tessa, who became Dundee's valet. As Tessa turned away, Tatum knocked her unconscious with a superkick, resulting in her being carried out of the Sportatorium on a stretcher. This incident and another controversial incident involving Steve Austin and Toni Adams (which led to Toni also being carried out on a stretcher), resulted in several TV stations cancelling its USWA broadcasts. =Global Wrestling Federation (1991‚Äì1993)= In 1991, Tatum reunited with Rod Price as the \\"California Connection\\" / the \\"Coast to Coast. Connection\\" in the Global Wrestling Federation winning the GWF Tag Team Championship twice and competed in the GWF North American Heavyweight Championship tournament, before leaving the promotion in November 1993. During his stint in the GWF, Tatum founded his own promotion in Dallas called Big D Pro Wrestling. In June 1992, Tatum replaced Skandor Akbar as booker, until being replaced by Gary Hart a month later. Retirement After leaving the GWF, Tatum continued wrestling on the Texas independent circuit for two years until his retirement in 1995 to take over his family's business at the Pensacola Interstate Fair in Pensacola, Florida. Personal life On November 26, 1986, Tatum was involved in a head- on car accident. The driver of the other vehicle died, while Tatum suffered various injuries and was charged with drug possession. His passenger, his girlfriend, was pregnant, and suffered a miscarriage. On July 12, 2019, it was announced that Tatum had suffered multiple heart attacks.

Detail of one of the buildings constructed by Antonin Raymond In 1961, Czech architect Antonin Raymond was commissioned to design most buildings on the Nagoya campus. It was one of the largest projects that he would undertake. The campus was orientated on a north‚Äìsouth axis across rolling hills and the eight buildings were arranged to suit the typography and harmonise with the landscape. In-situ concrete is used throughout the scheme and each building has its own concrete form, some with pilotis, others with shells.Japan Architect (2005), p124 Located to the east of the campus is the Divine Word Seminary Chapel, constructed in 1962. This is a building that exploits the plastic capacity of concrete, with two intersecting shells forming a bell tower.

The idea of a museum was proposed by Naim G√ºlery√ºz who is now its curator and the foundation was financed by the prominent Jewish Kamhi family. The building In September 1856 a ceremony was held at the Z√ºlfaris Synagogue commemorating Jewish soldiers in the French army who fought and fell alongside the Ottomans against the Russians during the Crimean war. A military unit under the command of Staff Colonel Garbi Bey was present at this ceremony. The museum building, formerly known as Z√ºlfaris Synagogue, was restored and remodelled to suit a museum. There is evidence that this synagogue existed in 1671, and its foundations suggest that another structure was built during the colony of the Republic of Genoa..

He is sometimes credited as \\"Lanny DiJay\\" on jazz recordings. DiGirolamo collaborated frequently with legendary jazz producer Teo Macero, and played on Macero's first commercial release, Explorations, also featuring Charles Mingus. He was described by Metronome magazine as an \\"extraordinary accordionist of the modern persuasion.\\"Ulanov, B & Simon, G (eds): Metronome: Modern Music And Its Makers, page 33, Metronome Corp., 1954. Biography =Early life and education= DiGirolamo's parents emigrated to the United States from the Abruzzo region of Italy, and settled in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, where DiGirolamo was born in 1924. Musically inclined from a young age, he was first introduced to the accordion by his grandfather, and began studying accordion and piano. He was writing original compositions by age 10, and joined the local orchestra at 14. After finishing high school in 1942, he traveled to New York City to begin pursuing music, and performed on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour. In early 1943, at age 18, he was drafted into the army, and spent two years fighting in World War II. He participated in the invasion at Normandy, fought at the Battle of the Bulge, earned five Battle Stars, and was awarded the Bronze Star for helping to save a companion platoon from enemy capture. He was also a member of the Army jazz band, The Four Sharps.United States World War II Memorial. When DiGirolamo returned from Europe, he moved to New York City to attend New York University (NYU). There, DiGirolamo joined the exclusive Alpha Phi Delta fraternity, whose membership also includes Frank Sinatra. In 1951, DiGirolamo transferred to the Juilliard School, and later to Columbia University, where he went on to receive a Master's degree, and a Doctorate in Musical Improvisation. =Music career= DiGirolamo's jazz career started in Europe after the end of the war. He remained in France until 1946, performing live, and recording for the recently liberated Radio Monte Carlo. In mid-1946, he returned to the United States, and spent the next three years touring during the Bebop jazz scene. It was also during this time that he was given the nickname, \\"Lanny DiJay,\\" by which he was sometimes credited on his recordings. Explorations (reissue) front cover After several years of touring, DiGirolamo decided in 1949 to begin his formal education in New York. Although he started at NYU, it was his fortuitous transfer to Juilliard which would lead to his encounter with Teo Macero. After meeting at Juilliard, DiGirolamo and Macero became friends and collaborators, and began to work together on Macero's experimental jazz recordings. Their first commercial recording was the 1954 Debut Records LP, Explorations (DLP-6).White, T: \\"A History of Debut Records\\", 1999. The album featured six tracks, including \\"Yesterdays,\\" arranged by DiGirolamo. Charles Mingus also played on the recording, and one reviewer noted that despite its conceptual nature, \\"Mingus and DiGirolamo rescue the music when it gets too heady.\\"Boisen, M: \\"Best of Teo Macero\\", CD Review, October, 1993. The Explorations recording was part of Mingus's Jazz Composers Workshop. At the time, the Workshop recordings were considered \\"too complex\\" and \\"abstract,\\" but are now credited with opening up \\"all kind of musical doors.\\"Release notes, Fresh Sounds, May 9, 2006. In 1993, Explorations was archived by the Library of Congress as part of the Charles Mingus Collection.Press Release, United States Library of Congress, 1993. It was reissued on CD in 2006, with additional tracks. During a career spanning several decades of recordings and performances, DiGirolamo worked with numerous respected jazz figures including Macero, Mingus, Ed Shaughnessy, Maynard Ferguson, Art Farmer, Cecil McBee, Wendell Marshall, Mal Waldron, Pepper Adams, Carla Bley, Larry Coryell, and Kip Hanrahan, among others. He performed throughout New York City, including gigs at historic venues The Hickory House, The Town Hall, Birdland, and The Blue Note. Through his playing, and pioneering collaborations with Macero, DiGirolamo helped take the accordion, largely considered an \\"uncool\\" instrument, and build its foundation as a respected part of the avant-garde jazz ensemble.Tommasini, A: \\"Some Attention and Respect For the Humble Accordion\\", New York Times, September 2, 1996.Guilliatt, R: \\"The Main Squeeze\\", Sydney Morning Herald, February 28, 1998. DiGirolamo was \\"fervently determined to show that the accordion needn't be a merely imitative instrument,\\" and developed a unique style of playing. While the accordion is traditionally played with one hand on melody, and one hand on rhythm chords, DiGirolamo used the rhythm hand melodically as well, creating a different sound, and elevating the instrument's potential. Bill Coss, editor of Metronome magazine, described this technique as using \\"both the left and right hand in a linear style.\\"Coss, B: Liner Notes, The Best of Teo Macero, Stash Records ST-CD-527, 1990. DiGirolamo was immortalized by American writer and jazz critic Harvey Pekar, in an illustrated piece on Teo Macero published in the Village Voice in 1994.

The script was adapted from the 1958 novel of the same name by William Humphrey. The film was entered into the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. The film's title is from the last line of Robert Louis Stevenson's short poem \\"Requiem\\". This film was originally intended for actors Clark Gable and Bette Davis, but the roles then went to Robert Mitchum and Eleanor Parker. As of 2018 the film's only surviving credited cast member is George Hamilton. Plot In the beginning, Captain Wade Hunnicutt (Robert Mitchum), the wealthiest and most powerful person in his East Texas town, is wounded by a jealous husband. Wade is a notorious womanizer, who lives with his beautiful wife Hannah (Eleanor Parker) who scorns him. She has raised their son Theron (George Hamilton) to be dependent upon her, but as he reaches adulthood Theron seeks his father's help in becoming a man. Wade initiates Theron in hunting and other masculine pursuits under the watchful eye of Rafe (George Peppard), Hunnicutt's loyal employee. Theron admires the slightly older and more worldly Rafe, and rapidly develops into a marksman and skilled hunter; he also learns about women from Rafe. Theron's new lifestyle leads him into a love affair with Libby Halstead (Luana Patten), a local girl from a proper family, but her father, Albert's (Everett Sloane) animosity forces a secret relationship. Theron learns from his mother that the reason for Libby's father's scorn is Wade's reputation as a womanizer. In this conversation he learns things about his parents that were previously hidden from him, including that Rafe is his illegitimate half- brother. We learn that Rafe's mother is the root of Hannah's anger at Wade, although the affair and Rafe's birth preceded Hannah, and that Wade became unfaithful to her after Hannah turned him out. While Wade respects Rafe, his position is staunch that a bastard is not to be included or acknowledged. Theron becomes disturbed by his parents' dysfunctional relationship and his father's treatment of Rafe. A disillusioned Theron rejects both his parents along with the concept of family, and thus Libby, his true love. Unbeknownst to Theron, Libby is pregnant, but she does not want this to be the reason for their marriage. However, a confused and despondent Libby turns to Rafe, who out of passion and compassion agrees to marry her. This devastates Theron who then realized his error. All seems resolved until on the day of Libby's newborn son's christening, her father overhears gossip that his daughter was impregnated by Captain Hunnicutt, and goes into a rage. We then see Wade and Hannah reconcile, at home, after seventeen years. After Hannah leaves the room, Wade is then shot down by an unknown murderer who escapes. Theron tracks down his father's killer and sees he is Halstead. Theron kills Halstead in self-defense and soon after Rafe catches up. Though Rafe objects, Theron decides to leave town never to return. In the end, several months later, Rafe encounters Hannah at Wade's grave. He offers to include her in the life of her grandson, and she shows him that she has acknowledged him as Wade's son on the headstone. Cast * Robert Mitchum as Capt. Wade Hunnicutt * Eleanor Parker as Hannah Hunnicutt * George Peppard as Raphael 'Rafe' Copley * George Hamilton as Theron Hunnicutt * Everett Sloane as Albert Halstead * Luana Patten as Elizabeth 'Libby' Halstead * Anne Seymour as Sarah Halstead * Constance Ford as Opal Bixby * Ken Renard as Chauncey (Hunnicutt butler) * Ray Teal as Dr. Reuben Carson Production George Hamilton was cast after MGM executives were impressed by his performance in Crime and Punishment U.S.A.. He later said \\"What Vincente later told me he saw in me was not my tortured soul but that I had the quality of a privileged but sensitive mama's boy.\\"George Hamilton & William Stadiem, Don't Mind If I Do, Simon & Schuster 2008 p 130 Hamilton and Peppard were signed to long-term contracts with the studio. The lead role was intended for Clark Gable. Husband-and-wife team Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch wrote the script, making some key changes in Humphrey's story to play up the core conflicts. They created the role of Mitchum's illegitimate son and made his wife a still desirable if bitter woman instead of the aging crone from the book. The writers also knew how to capture the cadence of Southern speech and had even written another family drama located in the South, The Long, Hot Summer. Minnelli would later call it \\"one of the few film scripts in which I didn't change a word.\\" Filming location Despite being set in Clarksville, Texas, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer filmed the movie at Oxford, Mississippi, near the University of Mississippi campus. Other locations were in and around Paris, Texas. The homes used in the movie, particularly the interior shots, are in Oxford. The downtown area is Oxford. Some hunting scenes were filmed near Lake Crook, the Paris, Texas, water supply. Other scenes, including \\"Sulfur Bottom\\", were filmed south of the Cuthand, Texas community in Red River County. Remnants of the steel truss bridge seen in the movie still exist and are near the Sulfur River crossing between Titus and Red River Counties on RR CR 1412 33¬∞23'25.5\\"N 95¬∞03'44.4\\"W. Reception =Critical= Home from the Hill opened to strong reviews, and by year's end Mitchum would win his only major acting award when the National Board of Review named him Best Actor for his work in Home from the Hill and The Sundowners. Peppard was also named Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Home from the Hill as well. The film is often recognized as one of the great melodramas directed by Minnelli late in his career. Dave Kehr cited Home from the Hill as a \\"superb example\\" of these celebrated melodramas, where \\"Minnelli's characters don‚Äôt simply act out their discomfort with the roles they‚Äôve been thrust into or the relationships they‚Äôve chosen to endure, but project their feelings onto the visual and aural fabric of the film. Where Minnelli's musicals express emotions through song and dance, his melodramas express feeling through color (of which he was one of the medium's great masters) and set design.\\" =Box office= According to MGM records the film earned $3,275,000 in the US and Canada and $1.8 million elsewhere but because of its high production cost incurred a loss of $122,000.

The car was built on the chassis of a DB4 GT, but featured a streamlined body specifically designed to handle the high speeds of Le Mans. It also featured a 4.0-litre Inline-6-cylinder engine, based on the DB4 GT's 3.7-litre Tadek Marek unit. Following its participation at Le Mans, the car was slightly modified to feature a Kamm tail design, which would later be used on the Aston Martin DB6.  Racing History  = Le Mans 24 Hour = At the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans, in the hands of Graham Hill and Richie Ginther the DP212 showed great speed, snatching the lead briefly at the start with Hill driving, completing first lap clear of the field. It then held second place for a while, until delayed by an armature failure. It dropped down the order to retire from 9th place, in the sixth hour (after 79 laps) with a number-six piston failure, caused when an oil pump pipe fractured. The car however, was having high-end stability problems and could not cope with the high speeds at Le Mans. Soon after, the car underwent wind tunnel tests at M.I.R.A. (Motor Industry Research Association) at Nuneaton, and a rear spoiler was devised. After development the car would return once more, in testing for the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans, featuring its new Kamm tail, developed to cope with the high speeds. The car practiced for the race, driven by Lucien Bianchi, Jo Schlesser, Richie Ginther and Bill Kimberley but the car would not compete. Its place would be taken by the newer DP214 and DP215, which effectively replaced DP212. = After Le Mans 24 Hour = In 1964 DP212 was rebuilt and converted into a road car with registration 'AYN 212B'. The factory fitted the car with a engine with bore, giving at 6,000rpm. DP212 was entered in a few minor speed and sprint events, driven by Hon. John Dawnay (later Viscount Downe), and Mike Salmon. = During the 1970s = Aston Martin DP212 had many successful races during the 1970s in the hands of Mike Salmon. In 1973 the project car returned to motor racing and won twice at Silverstone, and once at Castle Combe, all with Salmon at the wheel. Salmon also won the Classic Car Championship in 1974; with five class wins, one overall win and two second places. In 1975 Mike Ottway acquired the car, however Mike Salmon still continued to race the car. From 1975 to 1979 the car won many races, most significantly at Silverstone, with one first place overall (1975), two first in class results (1977/78) and a third in class (1976). The car also won many times at Brands Hatch, with a first and second overall in 1977 and 1976 respectively and two first places (1977/78). The car also recorded a 2nd place, in the Group 4 historic Race at the Houbigant meeting at Brands Hatch on 15 May 1977. When Salmon and DP212 demonstrated a wet-weather sure- footedness not matched by the later Ford GT40s and Chevron B8s (amongst others) it was up against, being beaten only by a Lola T70. The last significant result of the car in the late 1970s was a second place in class at F.O.C. Goodwood in 1978. = During the 1980s = In 1981 Mike Salmon won first in class at Brands Hatch, a fifth place at Silverstone and a significant win, against an all Aston Martins field in Dubai again in 1981. = During the 1990s = It is believed the registration (which it still holds today) of '212 DP' was acquired in the early 1990s. In 1995 DP212 appeared as a static exhibit at the Silverstone Coys meeting, with the car returning to the meeting in 1999 in the Pre '64 GT race. Where the car, driven by Mike Salmon and Gary Pearson, was in second place in 'Part 1' of the event. But during the first lap of 'Part 2', after taking the lead the car retired with Pearson at the wheel. In 1997 Lord Downe entered DP212 in a Concours event at Pebble Beach, Concours d'Elegance in California. In 1998 the car took part in the first R.A.C. TT Revival race at Goodwood, however it retired when in 2nd place. The car came back to the Goodwood TT Revival in 1999, with the car put on pole by Martin Brundle in a time of 1.27.635 (not bettered until 2006 after track had been resurfaced) but then crashed in practice by Pearson and therefore did not start (DNS). The crash heavily damaging the front end. =During the 2000s= In 2000 the car went under a major rebuild due to the crash at Goodwood in 1999, and the car was acquired by Nicolaus Springer. During the restoration, the car was stripped and thoroughly checked. However, there was no chassis damaged, but needed major panel work repair. R S Williams asked Lawrence Kett of G&A; fabrications to perform the restoration of the body shell. The repair was difficult as the car was not symmetrical, having been hand built and already showing signs of previous, body damage. It was also noted that the shell was becoming very brittle, being made of thin alloy and being over 40 years old. To add to that, the rear offside wing had been made from a different material, so may have already had some restoration completed on the shell. The restorers retained as much of the original bodywork as possible, reworking it if necessary. They worked from large blown up photographs to set about creating the old shape, complete with the original inaccuracies, asymmetrical dimensions and distortions. After the rebuild was completed the car has been raced many more times at the Goodwood TT Revival races. In 2000 DP212 finished in fifth place with drivers Tony Dron and Tiff Needell. Averaging , which was only behind Carroll Shelby's special Cobra Daytona. The car competed again in the 1 hour TT event in 2001. In 2002 its present owner Wolfgang Friedrichs bought the car. He continued the Goodwood Revival trend, competing in the R.A.C. TT event in 2002, finishing 12th, with drivers Friedrichs and David Clark. Friedrichs and Clark again competed in the same event in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Finishing, with one DNF (2004) and two 10th- place results in 2005 and 2006. Friedrichs and Clark returned to the Goodwood Revival Tourist Trophy (TT) in September 2009, finishing 9th overall, completing 39 laps within the hour of racing. DP212 recorded an average speed of , with their fastest lap being 1m 31.083s on lap 18. In 2013 the car, driven by Friedrichs and Simon Hadfield, finally finished 1st in the Revival TT race. Going at a blistering pace through the pack in the second, rain- soaked part of the race. Although, being extremely valuable, the car has been the most actively campaigned of the original surviving 'project cars' in recent years.

He searches for a girl online making it seem as if he is attractive and strong, although he is sweet and unassuming. He soon meets \\"Ms. Tasty\\" and agrees to meet her in person. She lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, while he lives in Bartlett, Illinois. With his best friends Lance Nesbitt and Felicia Alpine, he goes to Knoxville in a 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge borrowed without permission from Ian's arrogant, homophobic and machismo older brother Rex. On the way to Knoxville, they come across a hitchhiker, as the radiator in the Judge overheats. They attempt urinating in the radiator, which only works briefly as they try to leave the hitchhiker in the dust. The hitchhiker, frustrated at Ian's lack of concern for his well being, leaves, but not before urinating on the car window. As Ian and Felicia wander to find help, Lance is waiting with the car as Ezekiel happens to pass by in his horse-drawn buggy. Ezekiel and his Amish buddies repair the car while they join a Rumspringa party where Fall Out Boy are playing a concert, and at which Lance meets an attractive Amish girl named Mary. The three promise to come again on the way back to do some work in return for fixing the car. They go to jail due to Ian throwing a tire iron into a state trooper car, due to his increasing frustration after trying to put a possum he hit out of its misery, and are released after Mary pays the bail.

Lance and Mary arrive after having sex, as well as a redneck named Rick, whose girlfriend Brandy slept with Lance earlier. Felicia, however, is hiding in the car when Bobby Jo tries to steal it. Soon, a green car that has been continuously drag- racing with the Judge throughout the movie arrives. Ian manages to save Felicia, who then is able to run off and report to the police. Ms. Tasty tries to escape, but is stopped by the green car, whose drivers turn out to be Andy and Randy, two dim-witted self-declared \\"womanizers\\" from Ian's school, whom Ms. Tasty tried to manipulate into giving her the car. Bobby Jo is treated after being shot by Ian in self-defense. Felicia tells the police about the chop shop location and the couple is arrested. Upon finding out that if Mary leaves the Amish community, she will be shunned, Lance refuses to come back home and stays behind to marry Mary, while Ian and Felicia realize their love for each other. Ian and Felicia drive to a tree where Ian throws his shoes up into the tree. A few weeks later Ian is Felicia's date to her cousin's wedding. At Thanksgiving dinner, Rex tells his family that he is gay. On New Year's Eve Ian and Felicia finally have sex, in Ian's basement under a blanket on the sofa. In the final frame of the film, a picture is shown of Lance and Mary getting married, accompanied by Ian. Lance is shown sporting a beard exactly like Ezekiel's. During the credits, a short scene shows Ezekiel and Fall Out Boy arguing over the fact that the Amish fixed Fall Out Boy's tour bus for just \\"a five song set\\" in form for compensation, referring to a running gag throughout the movie.

The three were coached by Lloyd Tucker. Cowan reached the semi-finals of the Ontario Amateur Championship at age 17 in 1956, a record for a player so young. He won the 1956 Canadian Junior Championship. His first national championship victory at men's level was the 1961 Canadian Amateur Championship, which was to be his only win, but he reached the finals on four other occasions (1959, 1960, 1964, 1968), and finished second at stroke play twice more (1974, 1978). Cowan finished as the low individual scorer at the 1962 Eisenhower Trophy, an international amateur team event, in Japan. Cowan went on to win the United States Amateur Championship on two occasions. In 1966, he was victorious at the Merion Golf Club in suburban Philadelphia, after defeating Deane Beman in an 18-hole playoff. Then in 1971, he won at the Wilmington Country Club in Wilmington, Delaware, by sinking his approach shot on the final hole with a nine-iron for an eagle two. Cowan remains the only player to win the U.S. Amateur twice at stroke play, and he remains one of only two Canadians (the first was Sandy Somerville in 1932) to win the U.S. Amateur. Cowan also won the Sunnehanna Amateur in 1964 and the Porter Cup in 1969. Cowan has captured nine Ontario Amateur Championships, a record. Cowan turned professional at age 52 and played on the Senior PGA Tour (now Champions Tour) for a couple of years with three top-10 finishes.

Booth Library, named after University Librarian Mary Josephine Booth, serves the students, faculty and staff of Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. History = Beginning of library services = The first library at Eastern Illinois University opened in 1899 and was located in two rooms on the first floor of Old Main. This first library covered and contained 2,500 volumes. By 1920, the Library had expanded to include a storage area on the fifth floor and the reading room covered part of a hallway. Two additional rooms were added in 1934. = Booth Library= Mary Josephine Booth, who became University Librarian in 1904, lobbied for a free- standing library building for many years. In the early 1940s, the new building was approved and architect Joseph Booton drew up the plans. In 1948, three years after her retirement, Miss Booth turned the first shovel full of earth to begin the construction of Booth Library. The $2.1 million building was dedicated in 1950. Spread across four floors, of space was available with seating for 500 people and shelf space for 150,000 volumes. By 1965, the collection had grown to 114,000 volumes. Construction began for an annex in 1967, which extended shelving capacity to 475,000 volumes and expanded seating areas to hold 1,300 people. The annex opened to the public in 1968. = The Renovation = In 1999, work began on a $22.5 million renovation and expansion project. Total available space was increased to and shelving capacity was expanded to 1,500,000 volumes. The Chicago-based firm Holabird & Root worked closely with people from the library, the University, and the Illinois Capital Development Board to ensure that the renovated building would preserve the best features of the original architecture while improving the 1968 annex and unifying the original building, annex, and new addition to the south end of the building. The original 1948 south facade was exposed, restored, and now makes up one wall of the atrium connecting the north and south portions of the building. The 30-month renovation project was completed in 2002.  Visiting the Library  Booth Library is open to the public and residents of the state of Illinois may apply for a library card to check out materials. Metered parking is available in the lot at the south end of the building. The library collection consists of more than 978,209 cataloged volumes, approximately 1.2 million microtexts, as well as maps, music scores, and pamphlets selected to support the University's educational mission. The government documents collection includes United States and Illinois State publications. Booth Library is also home to the Ballenger Teachers Center housing K-12 curriculum materials, an extensive juvenile collection, and a variety of non-print materials related to teachers and teaching. Leisure reading interests are served through materials from the general book, serial, and newspaper collections, as well as the latest best sellers, films, and popular materials. The general book collection and the periodicals collection are arranged according to the Library of Congress classification scheme. Booth Library's public catalog is part of I-Share, the statewide network of 76 Illinois academic and research libraries. Additional electronic systems provide online access to a variety of periodical and subject databases. For the university community, interlibrary loan services supplement Booth Library's resources by making available materials that are owned by other libraries.

This disorder is not recognized in any of the medical manuals for mental disorders, such as the ICD-10 or the DSM-5. Richard Louv claims that causes for Nature-deficit disorder include parental fears, restricted access to natural areas, and the lure of electronic devices. The idea has been criticized as a misdiagnosis that obscures and mistreats the root problems of how and why children do not spend enough time outdoors and in nature. Research Nature deficit disorder is unrecognized by medical and research communities.  Causes  *Parents are keeping children indoors in order to keep them safe from danger. Richard Louv believes we may be protecting children to such an extent that it has become a problem and disrupts the child's ability to connect to nature. Dr. Rhonda Clements, from Manhattanville College, surveyed 800 mothers who grew up in the 2000s and asked about how much time they spent in nature as children; 76% of the mothers said they were outdoors every day Monday-Sunday, but when the same question was asked about their children only 26% said their children spent time outside every day (Clements, 2004). When asked why their children weren't enjoying the outdoors as often, the parents said that safety, injury, and fear of crime were the reasons that restricted their children from more outdoor play (Clements, 2004). Even though the majority of this generation, along with the generation before played outside when they were kids, their impacts on the environment were the most detrimental and significant. This is likely due to the fact that they grew up in a time when environmental degradation, conservation, and/or climate change didn‚Äôt exist. The parent's growing fear of \\"stranger danger\\" that is heavily fueled by the media,Outside Agitators by Bill O'Driscoll, Pittsburgh City Paper keeps children indoors and on the computer rather than outdoors exploring. Louv believes this may be the leading cause in nature deficit disorder, as parents have a large amount of control and influence in their children's lives. *Loss of natural surroundings in a child's neighborhood and city. Many parks and nature preserves have restricted access and \\"do not walk off the trail\\" signs. Environmentalists and educators add to the restriction telling children \\"look don't touch\\". While they are protecting the natural environment Louv questions the cost of that protection on our children's relationship with nature. *Increased draw to spend more time inside. With the advent of the computer, video games, and television children have more and more reasons to stay inside‚Äîthe average American child now spends 44 hours a week with electronic media.  Effects  right Because nature deficit disorder is not meant to be a medical diagnosis (and is not recognized as one), researchers have not assessed the effects of nature deficit disorder. However, Richard Louv uses the term to point to some negative effects of spending less time in nature: *Children have limited respect for their immediate natural surroundings. Louv believes that the effects of nature deficit disorder on our children will be an even bigger problem in the future. \\"An increasing pace in the last three decades, approximately, of a rapid disengagement between children and direct experiences in nature‚Ä¶has profound implications, not only for the health of future generations but for the health of the Earth itself\\".Last Child In The Woods Interview by Claus von Zastrow, Public School Insights The effects from nature deficit disorder could lead to the first generation being at risk of having a shorter lifespan than their parents. National Environmental Education Foundation *Attention disorders and depression may develop. \\"It's a problem because kids who don't get nature-time seem more prone to anxiety, depression and attention-deficit problems\\". Louv suggests that going outside and being in the quiet and calm place can help greatly. According to a University of Illinois study, interaction with nature reduces symptoms of ADD in children. According to this study, \\"exposure to ordinary natural settings in the course of common after-school and weekend activities may be widely effective in reducing attention deficit symptoms in children\\".Jim Barlow, \\"\\", News Bureau Attention Restoration Theory develops this idea further, both in short term restoration of one's abilities, and the long term ability to cope with stress and adversity. *Louv claims that \\"studies of students in California and nationwide show that schools that use outdoor classrooms and other forms of experiential education produce significant student gains in social studies, science, language arts, and math\\".Richard Louv, \\"\\", Orion Magazine. *In an interview on Public School Insight, Louv stated some positive effects of treating nature deficit disorder, \\"everything from a positive effect on the attention span to stress reduction to creativity, cognitive development, and their sense of wonder and connection to the earth\\". Researchers and medical practitioners have not confirmed these effects. *A relationship between the length of time of exposure to sunlight (by being outdoors) and a lesser incidence of myopia has been observed. Organizations The Children & Nature Network was created to encourage and support the people and organizations working to reconnect children with nature. Richard Louv is a co-founder of the Children & Nature Network. The No Child Left Inside Coalition works to get children outside and actively learning. They hope to address the problem of nature deficit disorder. They are now working on the No Child Left Inside Act, which would increase environmental education in schools. The coalition claims the problem of nature deficit disorder could be helped by \\"igniting student's interest in the outdoors\\" and encouraging them to explore the natural world in their own lives.Nature Deficit Disorder, No Child Left Inside In Colombia, OpEPA (Organizaci√≥n para la Educaci√≥n y Protecci√≥n Ambiental) has been working to increase time spent outdoors since 1998. OpEPA's mission is to reconnect children and youth to the Earth so they can act with environmental responsibility. OpEPA works by linking three levels of education: intellectual, experiencial and emotional/spiritual into outdoor experiences. Developing and training educators in the use of inquiry based learning, learning by play and experiential education is a key component to empower educators to engage in nature education.  Critique  Elizabeth Dickinson, a business communication professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, studied nature deficit disorder through a case study at the North Carolina Educational State Forest system (NCESF), a forest conservation education program. Dickinson argues that it is what Louv's narrative is missing that prevents nature deficit disorder from effecting meaningful change. She attributes the problems described by nature deficit disorder as coming not from a lack of children outside or in nature, but from adults' own \\"psyche and dysfunctional cultural practices\\". According to Dickinson, \\"in the absence of deeper cultural examination and alternative practices, [nature deficit disorder] is a misdiagnosis‚Äîa problematic contemporary environmental discourse that can obscure and mistreat the problem.\\" Dickinson analyzed the language and discourses used at the NCESF (educators' messages, education and curriculum materials, forest service messages and literature, and the forests themselves) and compared them to Louv's discussion of nature deficit disorder in his writings. She concluded that both Louv and the NCESF (both who loosely support each other) perpetuate the problematic idea that humans are outside of nature, and they use techniques that appear to get children more connected to nature but that may not. right She suggests making it clear that modern culture's disassociation with nature has occurred gradually over time, rather than very recently. Dickinson thinks that many people idealize their own childhoods without seeing the dysfunction that has existed for multiple generations. She warns against viewing the cure to nature deficit disorder as an outward entity: \\"nature\\". Instead, Dickinson states that a path of inward self-assessment \\"with nature\\" (rather than \\"in nature\\") and alongside meaningful time spent in nature is the key to solving the social and environmental problems of which nature deficit disorder is a symptom. In addition, she advocates allowing nature education to take on an emotional pedagogy rather than a mainly scientific one, as well as experiencing nature as it is before ascribing names to everything.

The station goes by the name 104.9 Bob FM and its current slogan is \\"We Play Anything\\". Its studios are located on the U.S. 17 Bypass in Myrtle Beach, and its transmitter is located north of Atlantic Beach, South Carolina. History WYNA began as WTAB-FM on September 1, 1965 as the sister station to 1370 WTAB at Tabor City, North Carolina. When licensed to & located in Tabor City, North Carolina, this station played country music for most of the 1980s and 1990s, except for a brief time when the station played adult contemporary music starting in 1986 (this was preceded by stunting with marching band music). The WYNA call letters were chosen because the station was originally imaged as \\"Winner 104.9\\". In 1998, Pamplico Broadcasting bought the station, which played country music at that time, and increased its power from 3,000 to 25,000 Watts. After stunting with classical music in October and November 1998, and Christmas music in December, WYNA went off the air in preparation for a move that included changing its community of license to Calabash, North Carolina. In January 1999, Coastline Communications was buying WYNA from Pamplico Broadcasting. The studios moved to Wesley Street near Waccamaw Pottery in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, former home to WBPR. WYNA became \\"Cool 104.9\\", a \\"groovin' oldies\\" station. Artists included Sam & Dave, Aretha Franklin, Earth, Wind & Fire, The O'Jays, Donna Summer, Kool & the Gang, Barry White, K.C. and the Sunshine Band, James Brown, The Three Degrees, The Trammps, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations and Stevie Wonder.Toby Eddings, \\"Billy Smith's coming back to your radio,\\" The Sun News, Jan. 10, 1999. \\"Billy Smith's Beach Party\\", hosted by WYNA's morning DJ, returned to the Grand Strand on Easter weekend after being gone for a decade.Toby Eddings, \\"WYAK changes its lineup and image,\\" The Sun News, Apr. 25, 1999.

Biography Steven Fromholz was born in Temple, Texas and attended the University of North Texas where he was president of the Folk Music Club. Fromholz began performing while he was serving in the United States Navy during the 1960s. After leaving the Navy, he teamed with Dan McCrimmon to create the group Frummox. Fromholz also played with Stephen Stills and Rick Roberts before going solo. He recorded with Willie Nelson, singing \\"I'd Have to be Crazy,\\" and Lyle Lovett covered \\"Texas Trilogy\\" and \\"Bears.\\" Other artists who have recorded his songs include Hoyt Axton, John Denver, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Sturgill Simpson. In addition to singing and songwriting, Fromholz dabbled in acting, playwriting, poetry, record producing, narrating, jingle-writing and whitewater river guiding. In 2007, he was named Poet Laureate of the State of Texas by the Texas State Legislature. His latest book is Steven Fromholz: New and Selected Works. He had two daughters; Darcie (to whom the song \\"Dear Darcie\\" is dedicated) and Felicity (for whom his record label Felicity Records is named).  Here to There Fromholz's first album, Here to There, has become a difficult-to-find Texas classic, as it has long been out of print. It was recorded with music partner Dan McCrimmon as the duo \\"Frummox\\" in 1969 on ABC Probe Records, CPLP 4511. This album is a seminal work, pre-dating and foreshadowing the Texas Music scene-to-come, when Willie Nelson relocated from Nashville to Austin and became the icon of \\"Outlaw\\" music. This album has never been officially released on CD. Notable on the album is his \\"Texas Trilogy,\\" a set of three songs meant to be played as one long work: \\"Daybreak,\\" \\"Trainride,\\" and \\"Bosque County Romance,\\" portraying life in rural Texas in the 1950s, set in the town of Kopperl, in Bosque County, Texas.

Jordan, Texas Trilogy: Life in a Small Texas Town, in which the authors accompanied and illustrated the trilogy's lyrics, set in the town of Kopperl, Texas, with photographs of the surrounding landscape. It also contains interviews with principal characters within the town. The book was praised for its photographs, though not for its text. In addition, Fromholz himself published a book called Texas Trilogy. Death In the early afternoon of January 19, 2014 Fromholz was fatally injured when a rifle fell from its case and discharged. He died en route to the hospital. The accident occurred as Fromholz was making preparations to hunt feral hogs who were killing the baby goats on a ranch near his residence outside Eldorado, Texas.

The center of Hillsboro Village is located along Hillsboro Road, a major thoroughfare dating from before the Civil War. It is a former streetcar suburb, and shopping and entertainment district, containing vintage clothing stores, a used bookstore, art galleries, the non-profit Belcourt Theatre, and independent restaurants. The heart of Hillsboro Village is home to the Acklen Avenue Post Office, noted for its wall of autographed photos of country music stars. It is also home to local musicians Ben Folds and Mat Kearney. Hillsboro Village is adjacent to Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and close to Belmont University, and Music Row. The village is popular with college students.http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/vandybloggers/2012/04/know-your- city-hillsboro-village/ Hillsboro Road also divides the area into two neighborhoods: Hillsboro-West End to the West, and Belmont-Hillsboro to the East. Through the 19th century, the neighborhood now known as Hillsboro- Belmont was then part of a single estate containing the Belmont Mansion. Much of the land between Hillsboro Pike and Granny White Pike was farmland during this time. Hillsboro Village began to take shape in 1920, when two groceries and a pharmacy opened alongside the trolley line that ran down Hillsboro Road (21st Avenue). Residential houses were primarily built between 1910 and 1940.  Architecture  The Acklen Estate was established by Joseph and Adelicia Acklen and originally consisted of the Belmont Mansion built in an Italian architectural style (built in 1853,) a zoo, a greenhouse, and grounds that were all open to the public. This space helped remedy the fact that there were no public parks in the area at the time. Residential development in the area began in 1890 after the sale of the Acklen Estate. In the same year, the Belmont Mansion became the central building of Belmont University. In 1865, Roger Williams University was founded. Its campus ran from the stream south towards Belmont Avenue. The most notable building on campus was the Social- Religious Building, constructed in 1920 on 20th Ave South, which was later renamed the Wyatt Center when the university was acquired by Peabody College and then Vanderbilt University. The building is visible from blocks away and is easily recognizable by its is columned exterior and its large domed roof.

The acetabulum is the socket that receives the femoral head to make the hip joint. The hip bone of the pelvic bone/girdle is composed of three bones, the ilium, the ischium and the pubis. In protrusio deformity, there is medial displacement of the femoral head in that the medial aspect of the femoral cortex is medial to the ilioischial line. The socket is too deep and may protrude into the pelvis. Signs and symptoms Protrusio acetabuli may be asymptomatic. Limitation of joint range of movement is the earliest sign, along with pain. Classification Protrusio acetabuli is divided into two types, primary and secondary. Primary protrusio acetabuli are characterized by progressive protrusio in middle aged women, and may be associated with osteoarthritis. They may be familial. Secondary protrusio acetabuli's causes include femoral head prosthesis, cup arthroplasty, septic arthritis, central fracture dislocation, or total hip replacement surgery Protrusio acetabuli may also be thought of as unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral protrusio acetabuli may be caused by tuberculous arthritis, trauma, or fibrous dysplasia. Bilateral protrusio acetabuli may be caused by rheumatoid arthritis, Paget's disease, or osteomalacia.Dahnert's Radiology In addition, protrusio acetabuli may be present bilaterally in Paget's disease, Marfan syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteomalacia; Prognosis The protrusio may progress until the femoral neck impinges against the pelvis. Treatment Arthroscopic surgery (or open joint surgery) is an effective treatment. Joint replacement surgery may be necessary in the case of severe pain or substantial joint restriction.

The station is broadcast from Junction City, Kansas, broadcasting on 97.5 MHz with an ERP of 100,000 watts. The station serves the Junction City- Manhattan-Fort Riley area, as well as some portions of Northern and Central Kansas. KJCK-FM is one of the most powerful stations in Kansas, due to its ERP. KJCK is also one of the oldest stations in Kansas. KJCK-FM is currently the most listened to radio station in the market. History KJCK-FM first went on the air in July 1965 as a simulcast of KJCK. This simulcast continued until the mid-1970s, when the formats split. The FM side continued with a Top 40 format, while the AM eventually flipped to country. The station was known as \\"Power 94.5\\" through the 1990s and aired a Rhythmic contemporary format competing against (now sister station) KQLA. After that station was acquired by Power 94.5's owners (Platinum Broadcasting) in 1997, the station moved to its current Contemporary hit radio format, while KQLA moved to a satellite-fed Hot Adult Contemporary format. The station kept leaning rhythmic during this time. In 2000, the moniker was changed to \\"The Big Kat 94.5\\". A year later, the station gained a competitor when KACZ signed on the air with the same Top 40 format, albeit with a more adult-oriented direction. The station moved from 94.5 to 97.5 in September 2002 due to moving the 97.3 frequency to Kansas City, which cost several other stations across Kansas to change frequencies (Topeka country music station WIBW-FM currently occupies the 94.5 frequency), but retained \\"The Big Kat\\" moniker after the move. On April 1, 2005, the station changed its name to \\"Power Hits 97-5\\", which was partially intended as an April Fool's Day joke. The music direction was changed, as it started day- parting by playing more adult-friendly content (which capitalized on current mainstream pop, punk-rock and modern rock tracks (even leaning towards modern adult contemporary at times), as well as 1990s tracks) during the day, while relegating harder-edged content (such as Hip hop and R&B; tracks) after 6 PM. This was done to compete against KACZ, who also had an adult-leaning Top 40 format. A new morning show, Stooks In The Morning, debuted in May 2005. This show targeted people in the 18-34 demographic and was well respected across the area as it discussed edgy content and being very listener interactive. In August 2007, the station started leaning rhythmic again, as most of the adult- friendly content was removed. This was done due to a new program director being hired, as former PD and morning show host Matt Stooks quit in June. As of 2009, the station shifted towards a more mainstream direction. On October 6, 2011, Platinum Broadcasting announced it was ceasing operations, and that the station, along with its sister stations, will be sold to Hays, Kansas- based Eagle Communications, pending FCC approval. The sale was approved on December 15, 2011. Transmitter fire On March 25, 2007, at around 11 pm, KJCK went off the air due to a fire in the transmitter. The transmitter went back on a few hours later; however, the coverage area was reduced down to at least a 6-mile radius. Manhattan residents and some residents in Fort Riley were not able to pick up the station. Stooks In The Morning did a web-only show for part of the week, while on 97.5, it was a \\"best-of\\" show. Everyone else took the day off. That Thursday afternoon/evening, the station went back to its original coverage area. Some criticized that the days they were off the air were Justin Carson's last days before moving to KZCH in Wichita the following week. Justin's last day was on Friday, March 30 (he returned in August 2008, but left by September 2009). During the early morning hours of Saturday, May 19, 2007 the secondhand transformer which replaced the original transformer that had caused the fire ceased to function correctly. KJCK-FM again operated at extremely low power until the following Monday afternoon when a new transformer was installed. On January 11, 2008, the station put in a new transmitter which includes the most up to date technology. Programming Currently, Power Hits airs the Power Morning Show with Rodney & Sarina. The show airs from 5 am to 10 am. Cyndee Campbell does the midday shift from 10 am to 3 pm. Afternoons are hosted by Stooks from 3 pm to 7 pm. The Power Hour Mix show from 5 to 6 pm. Nights are hosted by Karina and Overnights with Adam Bomb. Former DJs *Joe Liberty (1971) *JR Greely (1975-1977 PD) *Chris Favor (1974-1977 MD) *J.

Ling, though, is also a ruthless constable who never spares the fleeing suspects he pursues and even earns a reprimand by his own brother for this grim determination. When two million taels are stolen from the royal vaults, Ling is hired to find the thieves within ten days and administer his own justice. Ling's first task is to pick a team of men from his loyal band of assistants and then sort through the clues. After finding a link with a local villager and using his own harsh methods to get results, Ling is attacked by two of the thieves and only just fends them off. More hardships occur when his men are ambushed by a significant group of the enemy and their number is severely reduced by the assault. However, the constable is used to facing tremendous odds and, after battling through a number of his foes, slowly pieces together the events of the theft. Only when he meets one of the ringleaders does Ling finally discover who was behind the robbery; the answer comes as a definite surprise.

It was printed using the facilities of the Daily Mirror, of which Maxwell was the owner. Private Eye, meanwhile, was trying to sell a Christmas edition (at ¬£1 rather than the then-usual 45p) in order to cover the costs of the libel case, estimated at ¬£255,000. W H Smith was refusing to stock it.Magforum During this time Peter Cook led a \\"raid\\" on the Mirror offices which, according to Ian Hislop, he began by sending a crate of whisky to the people working on Not Private Eye, guessing that it was a task they would prefer not to be doing. The group then successfully entered the Mirror offices, removed the proof copy of Not Private Eye, drank champagne in Maxwell's office and were eventually removed by security after they phoned up Maxwell in New York City. Parkinson interview of Ian Hislop, 25 March 2002 Private Eye: The First 50 Years, Adam Macqueen  Content  The spoof edition largely copied the style of Private Eye but attacked its editorial team, including a cover which portrayed the editor Richard Ingrams in a Nazi uniform talking to Adolf Hitler. The speech bubble said \\"And if anyone objects, we say we were only doing it for a laugh\\". Another example of such anti-Private Eye humour was included in the cartoon strips, one of which, entitled \\"Carlisle St, an everyday tale of libelling folk\\", featured caricatures of the Private Eye team making attacks against others as a means of making money.

According to an interview with Goldberg on a bonus feature of the DVD release, he was inspired to write the screenplay by his own experience battling depersonalization disorder and clinical depression. Plot When modestly successful screenwriter Hudson Milbank descends into a strange mood in which he feels detached from the world around him and unable to connect with his surroundings, either physically or emotionally, he initially attributes it to a night of excessive cannabis use. His writing partner Tom is disturbed by the sudden change in Hudson's demeanor and urges him to seek psychiatric help. Dr. Townsend diagnoses his condition as depersonalization disorder and prescribes various medications including Clonazepam, and when nothing seems to help Hudson consults Dr. Richmond, who also sees drugs, albeit divalproex sodium and others rather than Clonazepam, as the solution. Hudson meets Sara, a beautiful young woman who finds him attractive and appealing and decides to introduce him to as many positive and compelling experiences as possible. Also trying to help him is yet another psychiatrist, Dr. Blaine, who initially resists his advances but ultimately has an affair with him before revealing she has serious issues of her own that require professional attention.

She was born on 5 December 1981. She was ranked 33 in May 2011 and reached a career high of no. 11 in July 2010. Engy came to the fore in 1999 when she, Omneya Abdel Kawy and Eman El Amir captured the World Junior Team title, herself having been a semi finalist in the Individual event. By 2002 she had broken into the World Top 30, but it was not until 2005 when she began to move forward more steadily than occasional match wins. Engy, who is from Alexandria, won three events that year, including an emotional Alexandria Open when she beat Abdel Kawy in the semis. The surge continued in 2006 with another win over Abdel Kawy in the Apawamis Open and reaching the final of the Texas Open by continuing her hold over Abdel Kawy and beating Natalie Grainger, together with a semi final berth in the Hurghada International. These results propelled her into the Top 20. A noted encounter was between Engy and Nour El Sherbini, the 13 year old Egyptian who then made history by becoming the youngest player ever to reach the final of a WISPA World Tour squash event, in June 2009 at Cairo. Kheirallah was then ranked 22 in the world and was the top seed of the ATCO Miro Classic No1 tournament at Cairo. The final score was a dramatic encounter of 11-8, 11-9, 7-11, 7-11, 11-7 which lasted well over one hour. The rivalry between Engy and Abdel Kawy continued in the following years when they faced in the first all-Egyptian final of Women's Hurghada International in 2010. Before this final, Abdel Kawy had lost to Kheirallah in all their previous five Tour meetings since 2005, despite being ranked ahead of Engy throughout Kawy's career. In that final, Kawy managed to bolster a dominating win of 11-4, 11-8, 14-12 over Engy. She is known to have used a Head racquet for most part of her career. Engy is now married to Egyptian squash player Karim Darwish.

It was Wilder's first book published and it inaugurated her Little House series. It is based on memories of her early childhood in the Big Woods near Pepin, Wisconsin, in the early 1870s. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed the novel as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\". In 2012, it was ranked number 19 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal ‚Äì the first of three Little House books in the Top 100. Plot summary Original front cover (see dust jacket above) The novel describes the homesteading skills Laura observed and began to practice during her fifth year. It does not contain the more mature (yet real) themes addressed in later books of the series (danger from American Indians, serious illness, death, drought, and crop destruction). Hard work is the rule, though fun is often made in the midst of it. Laura gathers wood chips, and helps Ma and Pa when they butcher animals and preserve the meat. This is all in preparation for the upcoming winter. Fall is a very busy time, because the harvest from the garden and fields must be brought in as well. The cousins come for Christmas that year, and Laura receives a rag doll, which she names Charlotte. Later that winter, the Ingalls go to Grandma Ingalls‚Äô house and have a ‚Äúsugaring off,‚Äù when they harvest sap and make maple syrup. They return home with buckets of syrup, enough to last the year. Laura remembered that sugaring off, and the dance that followed, for the rest of her life. Each season has its work, which Laura makes attractive by the good things that result. In the spring, the cow has a calf, so there is milk, butter and cheese. Everyday housework is also described in detail. That summer and fall, the Ingalls again plant a garden and fields, and store food for the winter. Pa trades labor with other farmers so that his own crops will be harvested faster when it is time. Not all work was farming. Hunting and gathering were important parts of providing for the Ingalls as well. When Pa went into the woods to hunt, he usually came home with a deer and then smoked the meat for the coming winter. One day he noticed a bee tree and returned early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the honey. When he returned in winter evenings, Laura and Mary always begged him to play his fiddle; he was too tired from farm work to play during summer.Each book contains lyrics to folk or patriotic songs. See The Laura Ingalls Wilder Songbook reference below for full lyrics and music. In the winter, they enjoyed the comforts of their home and danced to Pa‚Äôs fiddle playing.  Reception  The novel (price two dollars) was reviewed at length for the New York Herald Tribune in its June 12 issue. Jessie Hirsohl advised, \\"It should be read by all Middle Border children‚Äîand by many others to whom its experiences will not be even an echo of word-of-mouth inheritance. Too few, nowadays, can tell as real and treasurable a story... Moreover, this story is delightfully told.\\" In conclusion, \\"The book's make-up is entirely in character‚Äîa homespun-color linen jacket, and inner boards calicoed with tiny strawberry leaves and blossoms. The illustrations are by Helen Sewell, and are pleasantly reminiscent of woodcuts and daguerreotypes.\\"  Related books  In addition to the Little House series, four series of books expand them to include five generations of Wilder's family. The success of the Little House series has produced many related books including two series (\\"Little House Chapter Books\\" and \\"My First Little House Books\\") that present the original stories in condensed and simplified form for younger readers. There are also Little House themed craft, music, and cookbooks. References Bibliography *Anderson, William. Laura‚Äôs Album: a remembrance scrapbook of Laura Ingalls Wilder.

Named for Broadwater County, Montana, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Broadwater was laid down on 1 September 1944 at Wilmington, California by the California Shipbuilding Corporation under a Maritime Commission contract (MCV hull 55); launched on 5 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. A. E. Florer; delivered to the Navy on 31 December 1944; and commissioned at Terminal Island, California on 2 January 1945 with Captain George G. Herring, Jr., in command. Service history After fitting out and underway tests, Broadwater began shakedown training out of San Pedro, California on 12 January. On the 26th, she commenced amphibious training in the San Diego area. At the conclusion of that assignment on 12 February, the attack transport arrived at the Craig Shipbuilding Company in Long Beach for a post-shakedown availability. On 23 February she put to sea and, the following day, arrived in San Francisco. There, she loaded cargo until 2 March at which time the ship shaped a course for Hawaii. By the 8th, she was in Hawaiian waters conducting further amphibious training. On 28 March she embarked elements of several construction battalions and, on the 29th, got underway from Pearl Harbor. On 6 and 7 April, Broadwater stopped at Eniwetok then continued west. She spent from 13 to 15 April at Kossol Roads in the Palau Islands. On 17 April the attack transport anchored in Guiuan harbor at Samar in the Philippine Islands. She remained in the Samar-Leyte area for almost two weeks before getting underway for the Marianas on 30 April. The ship arrived at Apra Harbor, Guam on 4 May but put to sea again on the 7th. She arrived back in San Francisco on 22 May. After loading cargo and embarking passengers, Broadwater departed San Francisco on 29 May. She made stops at Eniwetok and Ulithi before arriving at Manila in the Philippines on 22 June. There, she unloaded cargo and disembarked troops. On 28 June the ship stood out of Manila Bay bound for New Guinea. She arrived at Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea on 3 July and began taking on cargo and passengers. Departing Hollandia on 6 July, the attack cargo ship arrived back in Manila Bay on 10 July. After unloading cargo and disembarking passengers, Broadwater moved to Subic Bay on the 18th and began loading cargo. On 20 July the ship set sail for the United States. She dropped anchor at San Pedro on 8 August. After almost two weeks of voyage repairs at the California Shipbuilding Corporation, Broadwater began loading occupation troops on 24 August. She started across the Pacific on the 25th, made an overnight stop at Eniwetok on 7 and 8 September, and arrived in Manila on 15 September. Her passengers went ashore at Manila, and Broadwater got underway for Leyte. She reached San Pedro Bay on the 19th and stayed there until the 23rd. On the 24th, the attack transport anchored in Legaspi harbor, Luzon. She remained at Legaspi until 4 October when she weighed anchor for Japan. She arrived in Tokyo on the 13th. Later that month, the ship headed back to the United States, stopping at Guam on October 27th to embark the personnel of the U.S. Marine Twelfth 155mm Gun BattalionUS Marine Corps Muster Rolls, 1893-1958, Roll 1069, Muster of Twelfth 155mm Gun Battalion, October 1946, arriving in early November, 1945. By late January, 1946 Broadwater had moved to the east coast at Norfolk to prepare for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 28 February 1946 and was turned over to the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration for disposal on 1 March 1946. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 March 1946, and she was berthed with the Maritime Commission's National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia. She was sold for scrapping in late 1974 or early 1975.

It was built alongside the similar DP214, both of which replaced the previous DP212. Only a single example was built, which survives today. Again using a DB4GT chassis, the DP215 was stylistically similar to the DP214, but had the advantage of not only being slightly lighter, but also using the larger 4.0-litre Tadek Marek Inline-6-cylinder engine which had previously powered DP212. Even though the car was also intended to carry the Tadek Marek designed 5-litre V8 engine, which later appeared in the Lola Aston T70 MkIII. Even so, with this increased power and decreased weight, the DP215 was seen as better suited to Le Mans' Mulsannes straight than the DP214. The DP215 was sold at RM Sotheby's 2018 Monterey auction for $21,455,000 including buyer's fee.  Racing History  = Early history = The car never had the ‚Äòplanned‚Äô V8 fitted and it made do with a dry sump 4-litre version of the well-proven 6-cylinder, with twin plug head. More contentiously, it was also fitted with the weakest link from the older and lower-powered DBR1, its CG537 5-speed transaxle; clearly a big mistake and one admitted by John Wyer. Visually, and dimensionally, the body was the same as the DP214s but the bonnet line was 1.5 inches lower, enabled by the dry sump engine. The car was initially fitted with engine no. 400/215/1. = Le Mans 24 Hour 1963 = Debuting at the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans, the lone DP215, driven by Lucien Bianchi and Phil Hill, started alongside the two DP214s. During practice the DP215 set a time of 3m 57.2s with Hill. During the race the DP215 was intended to be the ‚Äòhare‚Äô for the DP214s, trying to break the Ferraris, lapping at 4m 05s. Hill led away at the start but was passed by a Maserati on the Mulsanne Straight. On the sixth lap Hill was in fifth place, but unavoidably ran over debris from an accident of a car, who was about to be lapped. Hill pitted so the mechanics could see if any damage had been caused to the under carriage, but no damage was found and Hill was sent out again. However, during the third hour (2hr 12m) after 29 laps, DP215 retired from the race whilst running ninth. The transmission had broken and the teeth on the input bevel failed; it was assumed that the extra torque of the 4-litre engine was responsible, as this had never happened to the DBR cars. Both DP214 cars would also suffer problems and be forced to retire. However, both DP214 and DP215, were the first cars officially recorded as exceeding 300 km/h (186 mph) down the Mulsanne. But, DP215 was the quickest of all. Phil Hill, in practice had been recorded at 319.6 km/h (198.6 mph) and Ted Cutting, the Aston Martin designer, is certain that DP215 had, in fact, exceeded , since the timing was recorded before the cars had reached their maximum speed or the braking area. The car still remains the fastest front engined Aston Martin ever made, with Phil Hill describing the car as light and controllable at such speeds down the straight. = After Le Mans 24 Hour = DP215's front profile, showing triangular NACA ducts and large air intakes Following Le Mans, the DP215 appeared at the 12 Hours of Reims (a race accompanying the French GP), driven by Jo Schlesser. The car should have won easily, due to no serious opposition in the field. But after leading, Schlesser was having more trouble with the repaired CG537 transmission. Having difficulty changing gear, and missing gears, which caused over-revving of the engine, leading to bending all the valves, forcing the car to retire on lap 4. At the Guards Trophy at Brands Hatch, the car only completed a demonstration lap (driven by Bill Kimberley), due to financial/tax reasons. Shortly after the DP215 was rebuilt with more conventional transmission which allowed the fitting of the David Brown S532 5-speed box, which was also in the DP212. The car was soon retired from factory use as the DP214's proved more reliable. In 1966, whilst being driven/tested on the M1 Motorway, DP215 was involved in an accident which badly damaged the car (at this time it carried the reg. no 'ENP 246B'). Whilst travelling at about on the motorway a slower Dormobile wandered out into the outside lane, with the Aston Martin unable to avoid a collision. Both vehicles were severely damaged but all occupants were unhurt. Aston Martin, not wishing to gain publicity over the accident, quickly sold the damaged engine and the remains of the car. The engine-less car was bought for scrap value, by Malcolm Calvert, from the Isle of Wight, who then began restoring it. = During the 1960s = The car was rebuilt using a spare DP214/DP215 body and a dash, bought from the factory, with a DB6 engine planned to be installed, as the original engine had by then been fitted to DP214 (DB4GT/0194/R). The rare S532 gearbox had gone missing (possibly back as a spare to DP212) so, at this time a ZF gearbox, similar to those fitted to the V8 road cars was used to keep the car running. However the car was badly constructed, with the chassis still bent and the body shell being fitted to match this bent chassis. More inaccuracies were that the headlight openings were incorrect and the dry sump system was put in the wrong place. Finally, the car was fitted with Cobra wire wheels (not original Borrani) and not to mention the DB6 engine used. = Restoration period = The repaired car was then acquired by Nigel Dawes at a Sotheby's auction at Donington Park in April 1978. Dawes left the car as it was for several years, but hoped to get hold of the original engine which was sold on after the crash, but this had ended up being a spare for DP214 and converted to wet sump. Dawes then bought a 12 plug head, like the original and by luck obtained a 4.2-litre engine (engine no. 1293/420/2) taken from the Indianapolis Cooper-Aston in America. Forward Engineering then restored the engine remaking the dry sump system close to the original. Rubery Owen repaired the chassis based on the original drawings. Both the chassis and engine were then sent to Andy Chapman of Chapman Spooner who restored the engine to its former glory. With the engine producing at 5,750 rpm (330 lbs/ft of torque) and three 50 DCO Weber carburettors were sourced and added at great expense. Also, a lighter version of a 5-speed gearbox was fitted in the place of the ZF gearbox. The body shell was restored by Dawes with help of the original designer of the Le Mans series of cars, Ted Cutting. With a new roll cage being incorporated and a new fuel tank made as a copy of the original. The interior was restored similar to the original, but this time there were a few differences. The gearbox was insulated and covered in leather, pockets had been built into the doors and a speedometer and electric fan was added for legality. Also Dawes bought another set of seats from the DP215 and matched the faded original cloth; he was none the wiser about where the second set of seats came from. = During the 1990s = DP215 XMO 88's side profile The 11 year restoration was completed in May 1991 and the car reappeared at a number of public events, but not raced. It was then that the car acquired the registration number‚Äô XMO 88‚Äô. Soon after the car took part in the Ecurie Eccosse Tour. The car was then entered into the Louis Vuitton Concours at the Hurlingham Club, in London by Dawes and won first in class and was second overall. In June the car went to Le Mans and took part in the Historic Parade. The car was then paraded around the Goodwood circuit by Roy Salvadori and Willie Green. DP215 then went to Italy and took part in the Motoring Tour with 40 other exotic cars. Later the project car was on the Aston Martin Owners Club (AMOC) exhibit at the NEC in Birmingham at the Classic Car Show. In 1995 Dawes entered DP215 in the Goodwood Festival of Speed, which was the last outing of the car with Nigel Dawes. In 1996 the car was acquired by Anthony (Tony) J . Smith and again appeared at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. In 1997 Smith then entered at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in California. DP215 was entered again at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, this time with the Earl of Arundel at the wheel, and the car recorded the fastest time in the 24 Hour Heroes Part 2. Later that year DP215 went to the Silverstone Coy‚Äôs Festival but crashed during the practice session with Smith driving. = During the 2000s = In 2000 at the Goodwood TT Revival the car finished 15th in the R.A.C. 1hr event with drivers of Tony Smith and Joachim Folch. Around 2002, the project was acquired by Neil Corner, who swapped a precious F1 car in a deal for DP215. Corner then went to the great expense of having a brand new S532 gearbox built from scratch by Crosthwaite and Gardner, using the box from DP212 as the basis. As only 6 of the original S532 were ever made, with two going into the DBR2‚Äôs, two into the works racing Lagonda‚Äôs, one to DP212 and the missing one, which miraculously disappeared after the crash on the M1. Corner consulted Ted Cutting throughout and with the help of Richard Williams, who also looks after DP212. Williams got consent from the owner of DP212 to clone the gearbox, but with over 1000 parts in the gearbox it was not an easy task for Crosthwaite and Gardner. However, the task was quickly completed and the gearbox was fitted with some alteration to the car, as this had been altered to accommodate the ZF gearbox. There were a few problems with the box, with the synchromesh not being perfect, sometimes dropping out of third gear on the overrun and once locking in fifth gear. But these problems were not serious and the cloning of the box was a success. In 2006 DP215 reappeared at the Goodwood Revival as part of the tribute to Phil Hill, in the Phil Hill Commemoration demonstration driven by Nigel Corner.

Early years The steamed cheeseburger, also referred to as a \\"steamer\\"Edge, J.T. (2005). Hamburgers & Fries: An American Story. G.P. Putnam's Sons. p. 67. . or \\"cheeseburg\\", is believed to have been invented at a restaurant called \\"Jack's Lunch\\" in Middletown, Connecticut, in the 1930s.\\"Images of America: Middletown\\" by Robert Hubbard, Kathleen Hubbard, and The Middlesex County Historical Society, Copyright 2009, Arcadia Publishing, page 94 However like many restaurant food icons the origin is somewhat unclear, but despite this it is undisputed that Ted Duberek opened his namesake restaurant serving the steamed burgers in 1959 in Meriden, catering to the then significant local factory worker population. Early on, as the local factories were working around the clock, Ted's would stay open until 4:00 A.M. Steamed cheeseburger preparation Instead of being fried in a pan or grilled on a grill like typical cheeseburgers, the steamed cheeseburgers at Ted's Restaurant are cooked via steaming in a stainless-steel cabinet which contains small trays that hold either an individual hamburger patty or a chunk of cheese. This method of cooking causes the fats in the meat to melt away and they are then drained from the tray once the patty is fully cooked. The end result is a moist, juicy burger which is then served by scooping the meat onto a bun and then pouring the melted cheese over the meat. The burger comes with a choice of customary toppings. Changes in ownership Over the years the local factories began moving their manufacturing overseas, yet Ted's remained in business, though with shorter hours. After Ted Duberek died in the early 1970s, his son Paul Duberek took over, running the business until 2007. That year, Paul sold the business to his nephew Bill Foreman who had worked at Ted's while he attended high school and college. Bill has continued running the business with few changes and the steamed cheeseburger remains the featured menu item. Expansion attempt Ted's expanded in the 2010s with the addition of two more restaurant locations in Cromwell, Connecticut and North Haven, Connecticut but by 2018 they had both been closed. In the media Ted's was featured on a second-season episode of the Travel Channel's Man v. Food in December 2009. \\"Steam Machine\\" food truck Ted's operates a food truck named the \\"Steam Machine\\" and it sells steamed cheeseburgers at Bushnell Park in downtown Hartford, Connecticut, at the Xfinity Theatre amphitheatre also in Hartford, and at UConn Huskies football games at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Connecticut. XL Center concession stand Ted's sells steamed cheeseburgers at a concession stand located behind section 101 in the XL Center arena in Hartford, Connecticut.

Dam√ºls also holds the European record as the village with the highest annual snowfall ‚Äì the average is 9.30 meters per year. In 2006, Dam√ºls was awarded the honorary title \\"the snowiest village in the world\\". Population  Geography  Dam√ºls has an area of 20.92 km¬≤. It borders on the Bregenz Forest, the Biosphere Reserve Gro√ües Walsertal, the Laternsertal, and all other Vorarlberg districts (Bludenz, Feldkirch and Dornbirn). The most famous mountain peak in the area, a popular hiking destination from Dam√ºls, is the Dam√ºlser Mittagsspitze (2095 m).  History  In the late Middle Ages, around 1300, the Walser ethnic folk group fled from the Swiss Kanton Wallis to this area seeking a better way of life and agricultural land. They were allowed to settle in Vorarlberg, in the west of Tyrol and in Graub√ºnden. From 1313 onwards, Dam√ºls was populated by Walsers. At the time, the Supreme Court (Dam√ºls and Fontanella) was independent - the inhabitants of Dam√ºls, in return, joined the Montfort House to serve with \\"spear and shield\\" in the event of war.  Culture  The Vorarlberger FIS Skimuseum Dam√ºls offers a journey through the 100-year history of skiing in Vorarlberg. In addition to historic and rare Alpine skis, ski jump-related objects are also on display. The Church of St. Nikolaus occupies a prominent place in the mountain village of Dam√ºls. In the region, many old traditions are still alive and well, including the typical dialect that is still spoken here. Wearing traditional folk costumes (\\"Tracht\\") on festive occasions also contributes to an authentic yesteryear atmosphere. Dam√ºls in summer Alpine Transhumance, or mountain mobile meadow culture, is still practiced in Dam√ºls. This means that farmers bring their cattle to wherever food is available in the mountains. Depending on the season, cattle will change stables several times a year. Alpine transhumance is also called \\"Dreistufenwirtschaft\\" (literally \\"three stage economy\\") in German because the mountain pastures are managed in three stages ‚Äì lower, middle, and upper mountain altitudes. This transhumance is one of the prime factors preserving the natural and cultural landscape of the region, along with the strong tradition of cheese production in Vorarlberg. In 2011 UNESCO declared the ‚ÄúDreistufenwirtschaft‚Äù in the Bregenz Forest to be an intangible cultural heritage. View of the Dam√ºlser Mittagsspitze and the ski area of Dam√ºls/Mellau  Tourism  Thanks to the merging of the two ski areas of Dam√ºls and Mellau in 2010, the largest ski area in the Bregenz Forest, and one of the largest ski regions in the state of Vorarlberg, was created: The ski area Dam√ºls- Mellau.

With three different keyboard options Korg explains the system like this: > The 61-key model lets you mount a RADIAS-R analog modeling synthesizer > instead of the M3-M sound generator, the 73-key model lets you mount the > M3-M together with a RADIAS-R analog modeling synthesizer, and the 88-key > model supports the combination of M3-M and RADIAS-R or even mounting two > M3-M units simultaneously. Of course you can detach the M3-M sound generator > and use it as a sound module, giving you great flexibility for constructing > the system you need whenever you want.Korg Webpage, Accessed on: January 4, > 2008 The largest criticisms of the Komponent system are: # Korg seems to have abandoned the idea as only 2 modules (M3 and Radias) were Komponent compatible. # Korg will not sell the keybeds separately. If you bought the M3 as a module, you cannot buy a 61, 73, or 88 key keybed except for on the used market. Korg has released keyboards since the M3 and none take advantage of the Komponent system.

Life Rinalducci became an Augustinian friar in 1280. By that time he was already notable for his theological studies. He was a lector, prior of several houses, rumored miracle worker, and in his time, a famous preacher. He was eventually raised to the position of Augustinian provincial prior in Umbria. An episode in his life involves a general chapter conference in 1318, during which he was unjustly accused of several serious charges. Simon chose to keep silence rather than incite scandal among his brothers, and he was eventually acquitted. Contemporary chronicler Jordan of Saxony writes about this episode in his Life of the Brethren: In May 1311, it is recorded that the bishop of Terni gave the Augustinians of his episcopal see a church in the diocese chiefly at the request of Rinalducci, whom he held as a very close friend. Rinalducci died at Bologna in the monastery of Saint James the Great on 20 April 1322. Veneration Blessed Simon's relics are venerated at the monastery in Bologna where he died. His feast day is celebrated 20 April, especially in the Augustinian Order. Blessed Simon's cultus was confirmed by Pope Gregory XVI on 19 March 1833.

Life Born in Saugus, Massachusetts, Henry Newhall came to California, like many others, in search of gold during the California Gold Rush. He had been working as an auctioneer when news of the gold rush reached the East Coast. He left by ship, arriving on the West Coast in 1850. However, he had been forced to stop in the Isthmus of Panama for six months to recover from an illness he contracted. Upon his arrival in San Francisco, many of the good mining sites had already been claimed, so he opened an auction house instead. H.M. Newhall & Company became extremely successful. Newhall's next business interest was railroads. He invested in rail companies that would connect San Francisco to other cities and became president of the San Francisco and San Jose Rail Road. In 1870, when he and his partners sold the company to Southern Pacific Railroad, he joined its board of directors. After railroads, Newhall turned his eye to auctioneering, real estate and ranching. He purchased of Mexican land grants, including Rancho Todos Santos y San Antonio, and Rancho Suey in Santa Barbara County, and Rancho El Piojo and Rancho San Miguelito de Trinidad in Monterey County. The most significant acquisition was the historic land grant Rancho San Francisco in the Santa Clarita Valley of northern Los Angeles County, which he purchased for $2/acre. It included portions of the Santa Clara River and the Santa Susana Mountains, the former homeland of the Tataviam Native Americans. The ranch became known as Newhall Ranch after Newhall's death. Within this territory, he granted a right-of-way to Southern Pacific Railroad through what is now Newhall Pass, and he also sold them a portion of the land, upon which the company built a town they named after him: Newhall. The first station built on the line he named for his hometown, Saugus. Newhall split his time between his ranch in the Santa Clarita Valley and his auction house and residence in San Francisco, but after a bout of food poisoning in 1880, he retired to his ranch. In March 1882, while horseback riding around his property, he was thrown from the horse. Taken back to San Francisco for treatment, he died a few days later on March 13, 1882. Henry Newhall's heirs incorporated the Newhall Land and Farming Company, which oversaw the latter 20th century development of urban sprawl in towns on its land as planned communities. Henry Mayo Newhall is memorialized by the Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital,Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital several street names in the area once part of the Newhall Ranch (including the portion of California State Route 126 west of Interstate 5 known as Henry Mayo Drive), and the Henry Mayo Newhall Foundation.Henry Mayo Newhall Foundation References External links *Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society website *Newhall Foundation Category:1825 births Category:1882 deaths Category:People from Greater Los Angeles Category:People from Saugus, Massachusetts Category:Deaths by horse-riding accident Category:Accidental deaths in California Category:Santa Susana Mountains Category:People from Santa Clarita, California Category:American auctioneers ","title":"Henry Newhall"},{"id":"10802482","text":"Down St Mary is a small village and civil parish off the A377 in Mid Devon in the English county of Devon.

Ph.D. thesis, Universite des Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc, Montpellier, France. 2 volumes. 1-265 Extinction Evidence suggests that the palaeotheriidae went extinct in Eurasia during the Early Oligocene, approximately 33 Ma, as part of a faunal turnover event known as the Grande Coupure. The Eocene-Oligocene transition marked a significant global cooling event caused by the onset of Antarctic glaciation. This resulted in drier and more open habitats dominating the early Oligocene, and the loss of the dense forests that characterised the Eocene epoch. This environmental change, coupled with the arrival of new and better-adapted mammalian groups from Asia, triggered a decline in endemic European mammals such as the palaeotheriidae and anoplotheridae. In the Hampshire Basin of southern England the last record of the paleotheriidae is from the Lower Hamstead Mbr. of the Bouldnor Formation, dating to approximately 33.6 Ma.

The picture was taken a day before the Fall of Saigon. Van Es was variously known in his working life as \\"Hu\\", the anglicized \\"Hugh\\" and the nickname \\"Vanes,\\" to rhyme with \\"planes\\". Early life Hubert van Es was born in Hilversum, the Netherlands. He moved to Hong Kong in 1967, where he initially worked as a freelancer, before joining the South China Morning Post as chief photographer. Career in Vietnam Hubert van Es went to Vietnam in 1968, where he worked for NBC News as a sound man. He later joined the Associated Press photo staff in Saigon from 1969 to 1972 and then covered the last three years of the Vietnam War, from 1972 to 1975, for United Press International (UPI). In 1975 he was working in Saigon for UPI. He remained in the city for as long as possible before its occupation by North Vietnamese troops. On 29 April 1975 he had taken pictures of Saigonese burning documents that could associate them with the United States as well as a picture of a Marine confronting a Vietnamese mother and her little boy. Later that day he took his famous picture: When North Vietnamese troops arrived, Van Es wore a camouflage hat bearing a small plastic Dutch flag printed with the Vietnamese words B√°o ch√≠ H√† Lan (\\"Dutch Press\\"). The building in the photo, which has been incorrectly identified as the US Embassy, Saigon since the 1970s, was not labeled as such by Van Es. He has stated that he wrote, for the caption of his photograph, that the helicopter was taking evacuees off the roof of a CIA building in downtown Saigon (22 Gia Long Street). The current address is 22 L√Ω T·ª± Tr·ªçng Street (named after L√Ω T·ª± Tr·ªçng, a 17-year-old communist executed by the French) and visitors are allowed access to the roof by taking the elevator to the 9th floor. Later career Van Es covered the Insurgency in the Philippines and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He attempted to return to Vietnam but was not able to do so until 1990. Upon his return to Vietnam, while visiting the countryside, he was quoted as remarking: \\"It [Vietnam] hasn't really changed since I was last here; but our photos changed the views of those who were lucky enough not to witness this terrible war.\\" Death On 15 May 2009, Van Es died in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, at the age of 67 from a haemorrhagic stroke. He had lived in Hong Kong since the end of the Vietnam War.

It is located in the northwest corner of the county. Evidently the mountain was named for Elbridge Trask who settled west of the peak in Tillamook County in 1852.  Geology  The mountain is composed of mainly volcanic rock with some sedimentary rocks. Like much of the northern section of the Oregon Coast Range, the origins began around 40 million years ago during the Eocene period. During this era, sandstone and siltstone formed in the area. Additionally, igneous rocks and basalt flows combined with basaltic sandstone to create many of the mountainous formations. The volcanic rocks come from basalt flows that originated from fissures in the central portion of Oregon and covered much of the state. Additional sedimentary rock was formed more recently, around 20 million years ago. All of the coast range lies over a convergent tectonic margin interacting with the Juan de Fuca Plate that is subducting beneath North America tectonic plate in the Cascadia subduction zone. The mountains are created by the plunging structural arch of sedimentary and Tertiary volcanic strata that is being uplifted.  Flora and fauna  Vegetation in the area includes Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, salmonberry, red alder, western sword fern, and vine maple among many others. Other plant life native to the mountains are Coptis laciniata, salal, Oregon-grape, and bracken fern. Different insects can include spiders, beetles, and various centipedes. Mammals include weasels, chipmunks, black bears, hares and deer. Birds include kinglets, chickadees, woodpeckers, and jays.  Other  In the northwest part of the county, the mountain is in private forest land owned by Weyerhaeuser. Trask Mountain makes up a portion of the North Yamhill River headwaters that drain to the Willamette River. On its north side, drainage is to the Trask River which flows west to the Pacific Ocean. The mountain receives over of precipitation each year. The mountain is home to a U.S. Geologic Survey seismograph station that was installed in 1991. Previously, the peak was home to a fire lookout station that was abandoned in the 1970s. There are plans to construct a 50 Megawatt wind power facility atop the mountain beginning in 2009. In 1997, Dundee, Oregon, resident Lee John Knoch beat Robert Allen Holliday nearly to death and buried him alive on Trask Mountain.

This event continued through the years until 1913, when the International Dry Farming Congress was established in Tulsa that allowed agriculturalists from all over the world a more appropriate place to gather. In 1913, with the enactment of the Oklahoma Free Fair Act and with Tulsa's ability to attract the International Dry Farming Congress, a tract of land north of Archer Street and Lewis Avenue was purchased and would be the home of the Tulsa State Fair for the next 13 years. In 1923, the Tulsa Fairgrounds were moved to a 240-acre lot, donated by Tulsa oilman J. E. Crosbie, between Fifteenth and Twenty-first Streets in midtown Tulsa. The donation of the land was just the beginning of what would grow into one of the most premier fairs in the country. In 1926, it was decided that a group needed to be established in order to make decisions over the new location that is now the present-day fairgrounds and Expo Square. The $500,000 bond issue in 1931 provided funds to construct the art deco-style Tulsa Fairgrounds Pavilion and make other necessary improvements, which led to the 1935 legislation that elevated the small local free fair to state fair status. In 1949, the Tulsa State Fair merged with a spring livestock show to bring livestock events to the fair.\\"Tulsa State Fair.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Krehbiel, Randy. Retrieved September 26, 2014. In 1966, The International Petroleum Exposition (IPE) Center, now known as the River Spirit Expo, was built and made into a major part of the fair. During the 1970s, updates were made and year-round marketing began around the complex. It was at this time the fairgrounds were renamed Expo Square. Updates were made throughout the Pavilion, and a 13,000-seat grandstand was built. The Tulsa County Public Facilities Authority has administered the fair since 1983. The authority consists of three Tulsa County commissioners and two at-large delegates. Expo Square now holds hundreds of events each year, with the Tulsa State Fair being one of the only events that it produces internally. The annual Tulsa State Fair opens on the fourth Tuesday after Labor Day. No fair was held in 1917‚Äì18, 1942‚Äì45 nor 2020.

United States, 550 U.S. 192 (2007), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that attempted burglary could serve as a predicate felony under the federal Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), which provided that a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm with three prior convictions for either serious drug offenses or violent felonies must be sentenced to a mandatory minimum 15-year prison term.  Background  Alphonso James pleaded guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and admitted having three prior felony convictions, including one for attempted burglary of a dwelling under Florida law. The Government argued for the mandatory 15-year sentence available under the Armed Career Criminal Act because the attempted burglary count is a \\"violent felony\\" under the ACCA. The district court and the Eleventh Circuit agreed. James asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, and it agreed to do so. Majority opinion =The statutory scheme= Under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), > In the case of a person who [is convicted of being a felon in possession of > a firearm] and has three previous convictions by any court... for a violent > felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different > from one another, such person shall be... imprisoned not less than fifteen > years. A \\"violent felony\\" is > any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or any > act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm, > knife, or destructive device that would be punishable by imprisonment for > such term if committed by an adult, that‚Äî # has as an element the use, > attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of > another; or # is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, > or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of > physical injury to another. At the time of James's crime, Florida law defined \\"burglary\\" as \\"entering or remaining in a structure or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter or remain.\\" Florida law also defined an \\"attempt\\" as requiring the defendant to commit \\"any act toward the commission of\\" the target offense. The attempted burglary did not qualify under the first prong of the definition of \\"violent felony\\", since it did not involve the use of force against any person. And it was not any of the enumerated offenses in the second prong--it was not robbery or extortion, and it did not involve the use of explosives. Attempted burglary did not satisfy the categorical definition of burglary set forth in Taylor v. United States, , because it did not involve an actual entry into or remaining in a building. (If it did, it would not be attempted burglary; the crime of burglary would be complete.) The question in this case was therefore very narrow: Was attempted burglary a crime that \\"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\\"? =Attempt is not categorically excluded= James first argued that no attempt crime at all could qualify as posing a serious potential risk of injury. Because the first prong of the definition included the word \\"attempt\\", if Congress had meant for the catch- all provision in the second prong to include attempts it would have said so expressly. But the Court pointed out that the second prong had a catchall prong, whereas the first did not, and thus it was necessary to determine which crimes fit inside that catchall group. An expansive phrasing could not be specific and limited. James also argued that, by the statutory canon of ejusdem generis, the catchall phrase should be read to include only completed crimes because the other crimes listed were completed crimes. This was not so, the Court reasoned, because the category of crimes involving explosives was not limited to completed crimes. \\"In any event, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives is not 'completion'. Rather, it is that all of these offenses, while not technically crimes against the person, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury\\". The broad residual provision was meant to sweep up other crimes that, like burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives offenses, posed a serious risk of physical injury to others. =Legislative history= When Congress was debating in 1984 the bill that became ACCA, it considered expressly including attempt as a predicate offense that would trigger the 15-year sentence. But when it ultimately passed the bill in 1986, Congress had dropped the word \\"attempt\\", opting to define \\"violent felony\\" as either \\"robbery or burglary, or both\\". The Court did not find this history probative, because Congress intended to expand the predicate crimes in its 1986 enactment, and it used broad language in order to achieve this goal. =Attempted burglary under the residual clause= The Court next considered the crucial question--whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, involved conduct that presented a serious risk of physical injury to another person. Under the categorical approach of Taylor, the Court could only look to the elements of the crime to answer the question. Although, on the face of Florida's attempt statute, it appeared that \\"any act toward the commission\\" of the burglary would render the defendant guilty of attempted burglary, the Florida Supreme Court had narrowed the scope of the statute to require that the defendant take some \\"overt act directed toward entering or remaining in a structure or conveyance\\". \\"The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another's property, but rather from the face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party-- whether an occupant, a police officer, or a bystander--who comes to investigate. That is, the risk arises not from the completion of the burglary, but from the possibility that an innocent person might appear while the crime is in progress\\". Viewed from this perspective, the only difference between completed burglary and attempted burglary under Florida law was the fact that, in an attempted burglary, the would-be burglar was caught before entering the building he sought to invade. To be sure, some attempted burglaries might not pose a realistic risk of confrontation to anyone, as when the target of the attempted burglary was an unoccupied building. But the definition of \\"violent felony\\" in ACCA was couched in terms of probabilities, and those probabilities had to be measured against the probability of harm entailed in a completed burglary, because that crime was explicitly included in the definition of \\"violent felony\\". And in any event, the categorical approach of Taylor does not require that every conceivable factual pattern covered by a statute must present a serious risk of physical injury before the offense is a \\"violent felony\\". It is enough that the conduct described by the elements of the offense would, in the ordinary case, present a serious risk of injury. Dissenting opinions =Justice Scalia's dissent= Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg, faulted the Court's opinion for failing to \\"provide guidance concrete enough to ensure that the ACCA residual provision will be applied with an acceptable degree of consistency by the hundreds of district judges that impose sentences every day\\". How should these judges know whether burglary, arson, or extortion is the most analogous to the crime of which the defendant had been previously convicted? What if none of these three was most analogous, as would be the case for a prior conviction for driving under the influence? Such vagueness could not be tolerated, Scalia argued. Scalia argued that a better way to determine whether a prior conviction qualified as a \\"crime of violence\\" under the residual provision would be to see whether it posed at least as much risk of injury as the enumerated crime that posed the least such risk. That crime could not be arson or the explosives crime, and so Scalia was left with burglary or extortion. In Taylor the Court ruled that \\"burglary\\" in the ACCA's definition of \\"violent felony\\" had a generic meaning--unlawful or unprivileged entry into or remaining in a building or structure with the intent to commit a crime. Scalia posited a generic definition of extortion: obtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force. As between the two, burglary posed less of an inherent risk of harm because it did not, by definition, in its generic sense, involve the use of force. \\"The burglar may be prepared to flee at the first sign of human presence\\", after all. Having concluded that burglary was the least dangerous of the four crimes, Scalia contended that attempted burglary was less risky than completed burglary. By definition, in a completed burglary, the burglar has entered the building, where the closer proximity of prowler and victim increases the likelihood that injury will result from any confrontation between the two. \\"The so-called 'confrontation' the Court envisions between a would-be burglar and a third party while the burglar is still outside the home is likely to consist of nothing more than the occupant's yelling 'Who's there?' from his window, and the burglar's running away\\". The danger posed by burglary arises from the fact that the burglar has entered the building, and thus attempted burglary is categorically less dangerous than completed burglary. =Justice Thomas's dissent= Justice Thomas reiterated his view that the Sixth Amendment required a jury to determine the facts of the prior convictions that supported the ACCA sentence beyond a reasonable doubt.

The law, developed with colleague Gianfranco Fini, restricted the use of recreational drugs, especially cannabis, and greatly increased punishments for consumers of them. In May 2008, in an interview at the website of the Club of Freedom, Giovanardi said, \\"We say enough to the drug culture, and in order to do that, we want to introduce a rule preventing propaganda, even indirect, to all drugs, including so-called 'light drugs' [‚Ä¶] In addition, to insist on prevention and education and to have asked prefects and Quaestors to monitor and act with determination against these irresponsible initiatives, we are committed to find the most appropriate regulatory tools aimed to avoid that propaganda events, such as three days in Bologna on hemp can be held freely.\\"GIOVANARDI: \\"TOLLERANZA ZERO CONTRO LA CULTURA DELLA DROGA\\" ‚Äì Associazione Nazionale Circolo della Libert√† ‚Äì PDL ‚Äì Il Popolo della Libert√† ‚Äì Popolo delle libert√† ‚Äì PDL ‚Äì parti... =LGBT rights= Carlo Giovanardi has become famous for his positions against LGBT people; he has been accused of being a homophobe. On 20 September 2010, Giovanardi stated that countries that have legalized adoptions of children by gay couples have \\"exploded the sale of boys and girls\\". On 23 April 2011, Giovanardi argued against gay-friendly advertising by the Swedish company IKEA, declaring: \\"The term 'family' is used by multinational detrimental to the Italian Constitution, because it is meant only one formed by the marriage between man and woman.\\" Ikea replies: \\"That founded on marriage is one of the families. We appeal to all types.\\" On February 2012, during an interview with Radio 24, he likened a kiss between women in the audience to a person who \\"pees on the street\\". This elicited immediate reactions by some politicians, such as Rosy Bindi, who said \\"Giovanardi never ceases to amaze for his lack of modesty and balance and for its smallness\\" and Paola Concia, who launched a mail bomb, suggesting: \\"Write to him that homophobia is a disease.\\" Giovanardi say in a 25 January 2013 interview that during World War II there were a few discriminations against gay people, not a real Holocaust\\". On 21 January 2014, he introduced an amendment to protect any sexual orientation, not only homosexual and bisexual but also heterosexual, and also included pedophilia. The Five Star Movement announced its intention to report the matter to the Council of Europe. He later said that he mistakenly entered the term \\"pedophilia\\" in the text, and meant to use \\"pedofobia.\\" In an episode of Porta a Porta on 25 January 2014, in response to a request made to him by Bruno Vespa, he tells how his daughter went to South Africa and became engaged to a black man, a rasta, perhaps gay, and in addition, married to another man. Giovanardi says he was shocked by this news from his daughter. =Italy anti- mafia= On 21 April 2016, Giovanardi said (roughly translated): \\"I claim the right and the duty, as a parliamentarian, to have done in the past and continue to play a role in the Parliament in the future, as part of my critical position on Emilia-Romagna's management of the white list and the interdittal anti-mafia .....\\". =Dutch euthanasia laws= In a radio program aired on Rai Radio 1 on 17 March 2006, he said: \\"Nazi legislation and Hitler's ideas are re-emerging in Europe via Dutch euthanasia laws and the debate on how to kill ill children\\". He added that it is eugenics to debate killing children \\"who are ill or have Down Syndrome\\", and that \\"we could just as easily apply this to senior citizens\\".Prodi seizes on 'boiled babies' claim, by Tony Barber, Financial Times, 30 March 2006.

The use of this technique was initiated in the middle 1970s in the United States when rising interest rates in 1975-1976 and again from 1979 onward triggered a banking crisis that later resulted in more than $1 trillion in losses when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation were forced to liquidate hundreds of failed institutions who had typically lent for long maturities at fixed interest rates (such as 30 year fixed rate mortgages) and borrowed for much shorter maturities. The interest rate sensitivity gap classifies all assets, liabilities and off balance sheet transactions by effective maturity from an interest rate reset perspective. A thirty-year fixed rate mortgage would be classified as a 30-year instrument. A 15-year mortgage with a rate fixed only for the first year would be classified as a one-year instrument. The interest rate sensitivity gap compares the amount of assets and liabilities in each time period in the interest rate sensitivity gap table. This comparison gives an approximate view of the interest rate risk of the balance sheet being analyzed. The interest rate sensitivity gap is much less accurate than modern interest rate risk management technology where the impact of a change in the yield curve can be analyzed using the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework based on the work of researchers such as John Hull, Alan White, Robert C.

Les Chiefs follows the Laval Chiefs, a semi-pro team that plays in the LHSPQ, from the beginning of the 2001-2002 season until the start of the 2002-2003 season.  Plot The film opens with \\"The Super Fan\\", an avid Chiefs fan, making his 3rd belt. The film depicts the lives of 5 Chiefs players: Mike Bajurny (brother of producer David Bajurny), Brady Austin, Mike Henderson and Cory Holland. With the exception of Henderson, all of these players live in an abandoned storage area on the second story of Colis√©e de Laval, affectionately known as \\"The Rat's Nest\\".East Hill Productions - Les Chiefs Synopsis Page Several players discuss the living conditions. Some don't mind it, while other say that since the room is near an exit, the apartments will not be used for a fire exit. Henderson mentions that the living situation isn't bad for a young single guy. Henderson discusses his role with the team. He doesn't think he is limited to being a fighter, but considers himself to have an Owen Nolan-type of role with the team, where he could be tough as needed. The Super Fan shows how he prepares for a big game: which involves the shining of one of his championship belts. A shot of the arena is shown with fans mock-fighting each other with security surrounding the ice. Craig Martin discusses a line brawl and how it originated. At the end of the second, the team was trailing 3-0, but the Chiefs would score 7 goals to come back and win. Families of the players discuss their son's and boyfriend's role with the team. Bajurny's mother does not approve of her son's role as a fighter. Henderson's fianc√© discusses how they met and how she feels about him playing professional hockey. A 6'5\\", 265 lbs ex-military strong man by the name of Tim Leveque comes to play for the Chiefs. The players discuss Tim coming to the team, and some players are concerned about not knowing his background. He immediately establishes himself as an enforcer. He is shown fighting 6'7\\", 320 lb Dominic \\"The Giant\\" Forcier and beats him. Near the end of the film a boxing promoter comes to town and tries to get Bajurny and Holland to fight. Bajurny and Holland at first accept it. But after an inspiring talk from his grandfather, Bajurny says no, but Holland still goes through with it. Holland loses his fight. In the playoffs Bajurny is benched for fighting and Austin and Holland aren't even dressing for games anymore. Everyone looks depressed and they want to go home. The Chiefs win the championship and all is forgiven and forgotten. Conclusion The closing credits shows what has become of several Chiefs players the following season. * Austin was not invited back to the Laval Chiefs. * Bajurny returned to Laval the following year * Holland returned, but was traded to last place Granby Pr√©dateurs. * Henderson returned, but was suspended for the entire season for fighting in the stands. * Leveque is shown moving into a rented basement and talks about his past while a video of a kid learning how to skate is shown. Since the film was released, the Laval Chiefs would relocate to Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu in 2006; they have since moved to Saguenay, playing today as the Jonqui√®re Marquis.

Morphology When alive, protoceratids would have probably resembled deer, though they were not directly related. Protoceratids ranged from 1 to 2 m in length, from about the size of a roe deer to an elk. Unlike many modern ungulates, they lacked cannon bones in their legs. Their dentition was similar to that of modern deer and cattle, suggesting they fed on tough grasses and similar foods, with a complex stomach similar to that of camels. At least some forms are believed to have lived in herds. The most dramatic feature of the protoceratids, however, were the horns of the males. In addition to having horns in the more usual place, protoceratids had additional, rostral horns above their noses. These horns were either paired, as in Syndyoceras, or fused at the base, and branching into two near the tip, as in Synthetoceras. In life, the horns were probably covered with skin, much like the ossicones of a giraffe. The females were either hornless, or had far smaller horns than the males. Horns were therefore probably used in sexual display or competition for mates. In later forms, the horns were large enough to have been used in sparring between males, much as with the antlers of some modern deer.

Throughout this period, the country was ruled by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania. They ruled Albania by establishing a Stalinist style of state administration and adhering to policies which stressed national unity and self-reliance. Travel and visa restrictions made Albania one of the most difficult countries to visit or travel from. In 1967, it declared itself the world's first atheist state. But after the end of its communist regime in 1991, the practice of religion slowly increased.Majeska, George P. (1976). \\"Religion and Atheism in the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe, Review\\". The Slavic and East European Journal. 20(2). pp. 204‚Äì206. It was the only Warsaw Pact member to formally withdraw from the alliance before 1990, an action which was occasioned by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. The government implemented reforms which were aimed at modernizing Albania and they resulted in significant gains in the areas of industry, agriculture, education, the arts, and culture, which contributed to a general increase in the Albanian population's standard of living. However, these developments coincided with political repression by the secret police, the Sigurimi, for the purposes of preventing a counter-revolution, which included dismissal from employment, imprisonment in forced labor camps and executions. The first multi-party elections in Socialist Albania took place on 31 March 1991 ‚Äì the Communists gained a majority in an interim government. The Republic of Albania was proclaimed on 29 April 1991 and the country's first parliamentary elections were held on 22 March 1992. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania was officially dissolved on 28 November 1998 upon the adoption of the new Constitution of Albania. History =Consolidation of power and initial reforms= On 29 November 1944, Albania was liberated by the National Liberation Movement (In Albanian: L√´vizja Nacional-√álirimtare LNC). The Anti- Fascist National Liberation Council, formed in May, became the country's provisional government. The government, like the LNC, was dominated by the two-year-old Communist Party of Albania, and the party's first secretary, Enver Hoxha, became Albania's prime minister. From the start, the LNC government was an undisguised Communist regime. Having sidelined the nationalist Balli Komb√´tar after their collaboration with the Nazis, the LNC quickly moved to consolidate its power, liberate the country's tenants and workers, and fraternally link Albania with other socialist countries. King Zog I was permanently barred from returning to Albania. Partisans entering Tirana on 29 November 1944 The internal affairs minister, Ko√ßi Xoxe, \\"an erstwhile pro-Yugoslavia tinsmith\\", presided over the trial of many non-communist politicians who were condemned as \\"enemies of the people\\" and \\"war criminals\\". Many were sentenced to death. Those spared were imprisoned for years in work camps and jails and later settled on state farms built on reclaimed marshlands. In December 1944, the provisional government adopted laws allowing the state to regulate foreign and domestic trade, commercial enterprises, and the few industries the country possessed. The laws sanctioned confiscation of property belonging to political exiles and \\"enemies of the people.\\" The state also expropriated all German- and Italian-owned property, nationalized transportation enterprises, and canceled all concessions granted by previous Albanian governments to foreign companies. In August 1945, the provisional government adopted the first sweeping agricultural reforms in Albania's history. The country's 100 largest landowners, who controlled close to a third of Albania's arable land, had frustrated all agricultural reform proposals before the war. The communists' reforms were aimed at squeezing large landowners out of business, winning peasant support, and increasing farm output to avert famine. The government annulled outstanding agricultural debts, granted peasants access to inexpensive water for irrigation, and nationalized forest and pastureland. Under the Agrarian Reform Law, which redistributed about half of Albania's arable land, the government confiscated property belonging to absentee landlords and people not dependent on agriculture for a living. The few peasants with agricultural machinery were permitted to keep up to of land. Landholdings of religious institutions and peasants without agricultural machinery were limited to . Finally, landless peasants and peasants with tiny landholdings were given up to , although they had to pay nominal compensation. In December 1945, Albanians elected a new People's Assembly, but voters were presented with a single list from the Communist-dominated Democratic Front (previously the National Liberation Movement). Official ballot tallies showed that 92% of the electorate voted and that 93% of the voters chose the Democratic Front ticket. The assembly convened in January 1946. Its first act was to formally abolish the monarchy and to declare Albania a \\"people's republic.\\" However, as mentioned above, the country had already been under out-and-out Communist rule for just over two years. After months of angry debate, the assembly adopted a constitution that mirrored the Yugoslav and Soviet constitutions. A couple of months later, the assembly members chose a new government, which was emblematic of Hoxha's continuing consolidation of power: Hoxha became simultaneously prime minister, foreign minister, defense minister, and the army's commander in chief. Xoxe remained both internal affairs minister and the party's organizational secretary. In late 1945 and early 1946, Xoxe and other party hard-liners purged moderates who had pressed for close contacts with the West, a modicum of political pluralism, and a delay in the introduction of strict communist economic measures until Albania's economy had more time to develop. Hoxha remained in control despite the fact that he had once advocated restoring relations with Italy and even allowing Albanians to study in Italy. The government took major steps to introduce a Stalinist-style centrally planned economy in 1946.Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity; by Miranda Vickers & James Pettifer, 1999 ; p. 222 \\"the French Communist Party, then ultra- Stalinist in orientation. He may have owed some aspects of his political thought and general psychology to that\\" It nationalized all industries, transformed foreign trade into a government monopoly, brought almost all domestic trade under state control, and banned land sales and transfers. Planners at the newly founded Economic Planning Commission emphasized industrial development and in 1947 the government introduced the Soviet cost- accounting system. =Albanian‚ÄìYugoslav tensions= Until Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Cominform in 1948, Albania was effectively a Yugoslav satellite. In repudiating the 1943 Albanian internal Mukaj agreement under pressure from the Yugoslavs, Albania's communists had given up on their demands for a Yugoslav cession of Kosovo to Albania after the war. In January 1945, the two governments signed a treaty establishing Kosovo as a Yugoslav autonomous province. Shortly thereafter, Yugoslavia became the first country to recognize Albania's provisional government. In July 1946, Yugoslavia and Albania signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation that was quickly followed by a series of technical and economic agreements laying the groundwork for integrating the Albanian and Yugoslav economies. The pacts provided for coordinating the economic plans of both states, standardizing their monetary systems, and creating a common pricing system and a customs union. So close was the Yugoslav-Albanian relationship that Serbo-Croatian became a required subject in Albanian high schools. Yugoslavia signed a similar friendship treaty with the Bulgarian People's Republic, and Marshal Josip Broz Tito and Bulgaria's Georgi Dimitrov talked of plans to establish a Balkan Federation to include Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. Yugoslav advisers poured into Albania's government offices and its army headquarters. Tirana was desperate for outside aid, and about 20,000 tons of Yugoslav grain helped stave off famine. Albania also received US$26.3 million from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration immediately after the war but had to rely on Yugoslavia for investment and development aid. Joint Albanian‚ÄìYugoslav companies were created for mining, railroad construction, the production of petroleum and electricity, and international trade. Yugoslav investments led to the construction of a sugar refinery in Kor√ß√´, a food- processing plant in Elbasan, a hemp factory at Rrogozhin√´, a fish cannery in Vlor√´, and a printing press, telephone exchange, and textile mill in Tirana. The Yugoslavs also bolstered the Albanian economy by paying three times the international price for Albanian copper and other materials. Relations between Albania and Yugoslavia declined, however, when the Albanians began complaining that the Yugoslavs were paying too little for Albanian raw materials and exploiting Albania through the joint stock companies. In addition, the Albanians sought investment funds to develop light industries and an oil refinery, while the Yugoslavs wanted the Albanians to concentrate on agriculture and raw-material extraction. The head of Albania's Economic Planning Commission, and Hoxha's right-hand man,Owen Pearson: Albania As Dictatorship And Democracy. London 2006, S. 238. Nako Spiru, became the leading critic of Yugoslavia's efforts to exert economic control over Albania. Tito distrusted the intellectuals (Hoxha and his allies) of the Albanian Party and, through Xoxe and his loyalists, attempted to unseat them. In 1947, Yugoslavia acted against anti-Yugoslav Albanian communists, including Hoxha and Spiru. In May, Tirana announced the arrest, trial, and conviction of nine People's Assembly members, all of whom were known for opposing Yugoslavia, on charges of antistate activities. A month later, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia's Central Committee accused Hoxha of following \\"independent\\" policies and turning the Albanian people against Yugoslavia. This was the closest Hoxha ever came to being removed from power. Apparently attempting to buy support inside the Albanian Communist Party, Belgrade extended Tirana credits which were worth 40 million USD, an amount which was equivalent to 58% of Albania's 1947 state budget. A year later, Yugoslavia's credits accounted for nearly half of Albania's 1948 state budget. Relations worsened in the fall, however, when Spiru's commission developed an economic plan that stressed self-sufficiency, light industry, and agriculture. The Yugoslavs complained bitterly. Subsequently, at a November 1947 meeting of the Albanian Economic Central Committee, Spiru came under intense criticism, which was spearheaded by Xoxe. Failure to win support from anyone within the party (he was effectively a fall guy for Hoxha) he committed suicide the very next day.Zitat nach: G. H. Hodos: Schauprozesse. Berlin 2001, S. 34. The insignificance of Albania's standing in the communist world was clearly highlighted when the emerging Eastern European nations did not invite the Party of Labour of Albania to the September 1947 founding meeting of the Cominform. Rather, Yugoslavia represented Albania at Cominform meetings. Although the Soviet Union gave Albania a pledge to build textile and sugar mills and other factories and provide agricultural and industrial machinery to Albania, Joseph Stalin told Milovan Djilas, at the time a high-ranking member of Yugoslavia's communist hierarchy, that Yugoslavia should \\"swallow\\" Albania. The pro-Yugoslav faction wielded decisive political power in Albania well into 1948. At a party plenum in February and March, the communist leadership voted to merge the Albanian and Yugoslav economies and militaries. Hoxha even denounced Spiru for attempting to ruin Albanian-Yugoslav relations. During a party Political Bureau (Politburo) meeting a month later, Xoxe proposed appealing to Belgrade to admit Albania as a seventh Yugoslav republic. However, When the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia on 28 June, Albania made a rapid about-face in its policy towards Yugoslavia. Three days later, Tirana gave the Yugoslav advisers in Albania 48 hours to leave the country, rescinded all bilateral economic agreements with its neighbor, and launched a virulent anti-Yugoslav propaganda blitz that transformed Stalin into an Albanian national hero, Hoxha into a warrior against foreign aggression, and Tito into an imperialist monster. Albania entered an orbit around the Soviet Union, and in September 1948 Moscow stepped in to compensate for Albania's loss of Yugoslav aid. The shift proved to be a boon for Albania because Moscow had far more to offer Albania than hard-strapped Belgrade had. The fact that the Soviet Union had no common border with Albania also appealed to the Albanian regime because it made it more difficult for Moscow to exert pressure on Tirana. In November at the First Party Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor (APL), the former Albanian Communist Party which renamed itself at Stalin's suggestion, Hoxha pinned the blame for the country's woes on Yugoslavia and Xoxe. Hoxha had Xoxe sacked as Albania's internal affairs minister in October, and he was replaced with Mehmet Shehu. After a secret trial in May 1949, Xoxe was executed. The subsequent anti-Titoist purges in Albania brought the liquidation of 14 members of the party's 31 person Central Committee and 32 of the 109 People's Assembly deputies. Overall, the party expelled about 25% of its members. Yugoslavia responded by launching a propaganda counterattack and canceling its treaty of friendship with Albania and in 1950, it withdrew its diplomatic mission from Tirana. =Deteriorating relations with the West= Albania's relations with the West soured after the Communist regime's refusal to allow free elections in December 1945. Albania restricted the movement of United States and British personnel in the country, charging that they had instigated anti-Communist uprisings in the northern mountains. Britain announced in April that it would not send a diplomatic mission to Tirana; the United States withdrew its mission in November; and both the United States and Britain opposed admitting Albania to the United Nations (UN). The Albanian regime feared that the United States and Britain, which were supporting anti- Communist forces in the ongoing civil war in Greece, would back Greek demands for territory in southern Albania; and anxieties grew in July when a United States Senate resolution backed the Greek demands.Congressional record, 66th Congress, 2nd session, Volume 59, Part 7 (May 4, 1920 to May 24, 1920), p. 7160 A major incident between Albania and Britain erupted in 1946 after Tirana claimed jurisdiction over the channel between the Albanian mainland and the Greek island of Corfu. Britain challenged Albania by sailing four destroyers into the channel. Two of the ships struck mines on 22 October 1946, and 44 crew members died. Britain complained to the UN and the International Court of Justice which, in its first case ever, ruled against Tirana. After 1946 the United States and the United Kingdom began implementing an elaborate covert plan to overthrow Albania's Communist regime by backing anti-Communist and royalist forces within the country. By 1949 the United States and British intelligence organizations were working with King Zog and the mountainmen of his personal guard. They recruited Albanian refugees and √©migr√©s from Egypt, Italy, and Greece; trained them in Cyprus, Malta, and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany); and infiltrated them into Albania. Guerrilla units entered Albania in 1950 and 1952, but Albanian security forces killed or captured all of them. Kim Philby, a Soviet double agent working as a liaison officer between the British intelligence service and the United States Central Intelligence Agency, had leaked details of the infiltration plan to Moscow, and the security breach claimed the lives of about 300 infiltrators. Following a wave of subversive activity, including the failed infiltration and the March 1951 bombing of the Soviet embassy in Tirana, the Albanian regime implemented harsh internal security measures. In September 1952, the assembly enacted a penal code that required the death penalty for anyone over eleven years old who was found guilty of conspiring against the state, damaging state property, or committing economic sabotage. Political executions were common and between 5,000 and 25,000 people were killed in total under the period of the Communist regime.15 Feb 1994 Washington Times\\"WHPSI\\": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor8 July 1997 NY Times =In the Soviet sphere= Albania became dependent on Soviet aid and know-how after it broke with Yugoslavia in 1948. In February 1949, Albania gained membership in the communist bloc's organization for coordinating economic planning, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon). Tirana soon entered into trade agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and the Soviet Union. Soviet and East European technical advisers took up residence in Albania, and the Soviet Union also sent Albania military advisers and built a submarine installation on Sazan Island. After the Soviet-Yugoslav split, Albania and Bulgaria remained the only countries that the Soviet Union could use to funnel war material to the communists fighting in Greece. What little strategic value Albania offered the Soviet Union, however, gradually shrank as nuclear-arms technology developed. Anxious to pay homage to Stalin, Albania's rulers implemented elements of the Stalinist economic system. In 1949 Albania adopted the basic elements of the Soviet fiscal system, under which state enterprises paid direct contributions to the treasury from their profits and kept only a share authorized for self-financed investments and other purposes. In 1951 the Albanian government launched its first five-year plan, which emphasized exploiting the country's oil, chromite, copper, nickel, asphalt, and coal resources; expanding electricity production and the power grid; increasing agricultural output; and improving transportation. The government began a program of rapid industrialization after the APL's Second Party Congress and a campaign of forced collectivization of farmland in 1955. At the time, private farms still produced about 87% of Albania's agricultural output, but by 1960 the same percentage came from collective or state farms. Soviet- Albanian relations remained warm during the last years of Stalin's life, although Albania was an economic liability for the Soviet Union. Albania conducted all its foreign trade with Soviet European countries in 1949, 1950, and 1951 ‚Äì and over half its trade with the Soviet Union itself. Together with its satellites, the Soviet Union underwrote shortfalls in Albania's balance- of-payments with long-term grants. Although far behind Western practice, health care and education improved dramatically for Albania's 1.2 million people in the early 1950s. The number of Albanian doctors increased by a third to about 150 early in the decade (although the doctor-patient ratio remained unacceptable by most standards), and the state opened new medical-training facilities. The number of hospital beds rose from 1,765 in 1945 to about 5,500 in 1953. Better health-care and living conditions produced an improvement in Albania's dismal infant-mortality rate, lowering it from 112.2 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1945 to 99.5 deaths per 1,000 births in 1953. The education system, a tool for propagating communism and creating the academic and technical cadres necessary for construction of a socialist state and society, also improved dramatically. The number of schools, teachers, and students doubled between 1945 and 1950. Illiteracy declined from perhaps 85% in 1946 to 31% in 1950. The Soviet Union provided scholarships for Albanian students and supplied specialists and study materials to improve instruction in Albania. The State University of Tirana (later the University of Tirana) was founded in 1957 and the Albanian Academy of Sciences opened 15 years later. Stalin died in March 1953, and apparently fearing that the Soviet ruler's demise might encourage rivals within the Albanian party's ranks, neither Hoxha nor Shehu risked traveling to Moscow to attend his funeral. The Soviet Union's subsequent movement toward rapprochement with the hated Yugoslavs rankled the two Albanian leaders. Tirana soon came under pressure from Moscow to copy, at least formally, the new Soviet model for collective leadership. In July 1953, Hoxha handed over the foreign affairs and defense portfolios to loyal followers, but he kept both the top party post and the premiership until 1954, when Shehu became Albania's prime minister. The Soviet Union, responding with an effort to raise the Albanian leaders' morale, elevated diplomatic relations between the two countries to the ambassadorial level. Despite some initial expressions of enthusiasm, Hoxha and Shehu mistrusted Nikita Khrushchev's programs of \\"peaceful coexistence\\" and \\"different roads to socialism\\" because they appeared to pose the threat that Yugoslavia might again try to take control of Albania. It also concerned Hoxha and Shehu that Moscow might prefer less dogmatic rulers in Albania. Tirana and Belgrade renewed diplomatic relations in December 1953, but Hoxha refused Khrushchev's repeated appeals to rehabilitate posthumously the pro-Yugoslav Xoxe as a gesture to Tito. The Albanian duo instead tightened their grip on their country's domestic life and let the propaganda war with the Yugoslavs grind on. In 1955 Albania became a founding member of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, better known as the Warsaw Pact, the only military alliance the nation ever joined. Although the pact represented the first promise Albania had obtained from any of the communist countries to defend its borders, the treaty did nothing to assuage the Albanian leaders' deep mistrust of Yugoslavia. Hoxha and Shehu tapped the Albanians' deep-seated fear of Yugoslav domination to remain in power during the thaw following the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956, when Khrushchev denounced Stalin's crimes in his \\"secret speech\\". Hoxha defended Stalin and blamed the Titoist heresy for the troubles vexing world Communism, including the disturbances in Poland and the rebellion in Hungary in 1956. Hoxha mercilessly purged party moderates with pro-Soviet and pro-Yugoslav leanings, but he toned down his anti-Yugoslav rhetoric after an April 1957 trip to Moscow, where he won cancellation of about US$105 million in outstanding loans and about US$7.8 million in additional food assistance. By 1958, however, Hoxha was again complaining about Tito's \\"fascism\\" and \\"genocide\\" against Albanians in Kosovo. He also grumbled about a Comecon plan for integrating the East European economies, which called for Albania to produce agricultural goods and minerals instead of emphasizing the development of heavy industry. On a twelve-day visit to Albania in 1959, Khrushchev reportedly tried to convince Hoxha and Shehu that their country should aspire to become \\"socialism's orchard\\". =In the Chinese sphere= Enver Hoxha in 1971 Bunkers in Albania built during Hoxha's rule to avert the possibility of external invasions. By 1983 approximately 173,371 concrete bunkers were scattered throughout the country. Albania played a role in the Sino-Soviet split which far outweighed its size or importance in the Communist world. By 1958 Albania stood with the People's Republic of China (PRC)Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity; by Miranda Vickers & James Pettifer, 1999 ; p. 210 \\"with the split in the world communist movement it moved into a close relationship with China\\" in opposing Moscow on issues of peaceful coexistence, de-Stalinization, and Yugoslavia's \\"separate road to socialism\\" through decentralization of economic life. The Soviet Union, other Eastern European countries, and China all offered Albania large amounts of aid. Soviet leaders also promised to build a large Palace of Culture in Tirana as a symbol of the Soviet people's \\"love and friendship\\" for the Albanians. But despite these gestures, Tirana was dissatisfied with Moscow's economic policy towards Albania. Hoxha and Shehu apparently decided in either May or June 1960 that Albania was assured of Chinese support, and when sharp polemics erupted between the PRC and the Soviet Union, they openly sided with the former. Ramiz Alia, at the time a candidate-member of the Politburo and Hoxha's adviser on ideological questions, played a prominent role in the rhetoric. The Sino-Soviet split burst into the open in June 1960 at a Romanian Workers' Party congress, at which Khrushchev attempted to secure condemnation of Beijing. Albania's delegation, alone among the European delegations, supported the Chinese. The Soviet Union immediately retaliated by organizing a campaign to oust Hoxha and Shehu in the summer of 1960. Moscow cut promised grain deliveries to Albania during a drought, and the Soviet embassy in Tirana overtly encouraged a pro- Soviet faction in the Party of Labour of Albania (APL) to speak out against the party's pro-Chinese stance. Moscow also apparently involved itself in a plot within the APL to unseat Hoxha and Shehu by force. But given their tight control of the party machinery, army, and Shehu's secret police, the Directorate of State Security (Drejtorija e Sigurimit t√´ Shtetit‚ÄîSigurimi), the two Albanian leaders easily parried the threat. Four pro-Soviet Albanian leaders, including Teme Sejko and Tahir Demi, were eventually tried and executed. The PRC immediately began making up for the cancellation of Soviet wheat shipments despite a paucity of foreign currency and its own economic hardships. Albania again sided with the People's Republic of China when it launched an attack on the Soviet Union's leadership of the international communist movement at the November 1960 Moscow conference of the world's 81 communist parties. Hoxha inveighed against Khrushchev for encouraging Greek claims to southern Albania, sowing discord within the APL and army, and using economic blackmail. \\"Soviet rats were able to eat while the Albanian people were dying of hunger,\\" Hoxha railed, referring to purposely delayed Soviet grain deliveries. Communist leaders loyal to Moscow described Hoxha's performance as \\"gangsterish\\" and \\"infantile,\\" and the speech extinguished any chance of an agreement between Moscow and Tirana. For the next year, Albania played proxy for China. Pro-Soviet Communist parties, reluctant to confront China directly, criticized Beijing by castigating Albania. China, for its part, frequently gave prominence to the Albanians' fulminations against the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, which Tirana referred to as a \\"socialist hell.\\" Mao Zedong and Hoxha in 1956 Hoxha and Shehu continued their harangue against the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia at the APL's Fourth Party Congress in February 1961. During the congress, the Albanian government announced the broad outlines of the country's Third Five-Year Plan (1961‚Äì65), which allocated 54% of all investment to industry, thereby rejecting Khrushchev's wish to make Albania primarily an agricultural producer. Moscow responded by canceling aid programs and lines of credit for Albania, but China again came to the rescue. After additional sharp exchanges between Soviet and Chinese delegates over Albania at the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Twenty-Second Party Congress in October 1961, Khrushchev lambasted the Albanians for executing a pregnant, pro-Soviet member of the Albanian party Politburo Liri Gega, and the Soviet Union finally broke diplomatic relations with Albania in December. Moscow then withdrew all Soviet economic advisers and technicians from the country, including those at work on the Palace of Culture, and halted shipments of supplies and spare parts for equipment already in place in Albania. In addition, the Soviet Union continued to dismantle its naval installations on Sazan Island, a process that had begun even before the break in relations. China again compensated Albania for the loss of Soviet economic support, supplying about 90% of the parts, foodstuffs, and other goods the Soviet Union had promised. China lent Albania money on more favorable terms than Moscow, and, unlike Soviet advisers, Chinese technicians earned the same low pay as Albanian workers and lived in similar housing. China also presented Albania with a powerful radio transmission station from which Tirana sang the praises of Stalin, Hoxha, and Mao Zedong for decades. For its part, Albania offered China a beachhead in Europe and acted as China's chief spokesman at the United Nations. To Albania's dismay, however, Chinese equipment and technicians were not nearly as sophisticated as the Soviet goods and advisers they replaced. Ironically, a language barrier even forced the Chinese and Albanian technicians to communicate in Russian. Albanians no longer took part in Warsaw Pact activities or Comecon agreements. The other East European communist nations, however, did not break diplomatic or trade links with Albania. In 1964, the Albanians went so far as to seize the empty Soviet embassy in Tirana, and Albanian workers pressed on with construction of the Palace of Culture on their own. The shift away from the Soviet Union wreaked havoc on Albania's economy. Half of its imports and exports had been geared toward Soviet suppliers and markets, so the souring of Tirana's relations with Moscow brought Albania's foreign trade to near collapse as China proved incapable of delivering promised machinery and equipment on time. The low productivity, flawed planning, poor workmanship, and inefficient management at Albanian enterprises became clear when Soviet and Eastern European aid and advisers were withdrawn. In 1962, the Albanian government introduced an austerity program, appealing to the people to conserve resources, cut production costs, and abandon unnecessary investment. Withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact In October 1964, Hoxha hailed Khrushchev's fall from power, and the Soviet Union's new leaders made overtures to Tirana. It soon became clear, however, that the new Soviet leadership had no intention of changing its basic policies to suit Albania, and relations failed to improve. For decades, Tirana's propaganda continued to refer to Soviet officials as \\"treacherous revisionists\\" and \\"traitors to Communism,\\" and in 1964, Hoxha said that Albania's terms for reconciliation were a Soviet apology to Albania and reparations for damages which it had inflicted on the country. Albania had also been feuding with Moscow over suggestions that Albania should focus on agriculture to the detriment of industrial development. Soviet-Albanian relations dipped to new lows after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and Albania felt that the Soviet Union had become too liberal since the death of Joseph Stalin. The invasion served as the tipping point, and within one month (September 1968) Albania formally withdrew from the Warsaw Pact. Leonid Brezhnev made no attempt to force Albania to remain. Cultural and Ideological Revolution Albanian poster in 1978: Marxism-Leninism: Victorious flag Mount Shpiragu as seen from Berat showing the name of Hoxha written on its side In the mid-1960s, Albania's leaders grew wary of a threat to their power by a burgeoning bureaucracy. Party discipline had eroded. People complained about malfeasance, inflation, and low-quality goods. Writers strayed from the orthodoxy of socialist realism, which demanded that art and literature serve as instruments of government and party policy. As a result, after Mao Zedong unleashed the Cultural Revolution in China in 1966, Hoxha launched his own Cultural and Ideological Revolution. The Albanian leader concentrated on reforming the military, government bureaucracy, and economy as well as on creating new support for his system. The regime abolished military ranks, reintroduced political commissars into the military, and renounced professionalism in the army. Railing against a \\"white-collar mentality,\\" the authorities also slashed the salaries of mid- and high-level officials, ousted administrators and specialists from their desk jobs, and sent such persons to toil in the factories and fields. Six ministries, including the Ministry of Justice, were eliminated. Farm collectivization even spread to the remote mountains. In addition, the government attacked dissident writers and artists, reformed its educational system, and generally reinforced Albania's isolation from European culture in an effort to keep out foreign influences. After the 5th Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania and Enver Hoxha's speech on 6 February 1967, the authorities launched a violent campaign to extinguish religious life in Albania, claiming that religion had divided the Albanian nation and kept it mired in backwardness. Student agitators combed the countryside, forcing Albanians to quit practicing their faith. Despite complaints, even by APL members, all churches, mosques, monasteries, and other religious institutions were closed or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, and workshops by year's end. A special decree abrogated the charters by which the country's main religious communities had operated. The campaign culminated in an announcement that Albania had become the world's first atheistic state, a feat which was trumpeted as one of Enver Hoxha's greatest achievements. While the Albanian Constitution had formally guaranteed freedom of religion to the Albanian people right up until that time, religious freedom was virtually non-existent after 1967. The 1976 Constitution of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania later stipulated in Article 37 that \\"The state recognizes no religion whatever and supports atheist propaganda for the purpose of inculcating the scientific materialist world outlook in people\\" and Article 55 explicitly forbade the formation of \\"any type of organization of a fascist, anti-democratic, religious, and anti-socialist character\\" and stated that \\"Fascist, anti-democratic, religious, war-mongering, and anti-socialist activities and propaganda, as well as the incitement of national and racial hatred are prohibited.\\" On November 1, 1977, Enver Hoxha claimed in his Report submitted to the 7th Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania on the activity of the Party's Central Committee that the 1976 Constitution was an embodiment of the free will of the Albanian people, because genuine democracy was necessary in order for socialism to actually exist. He said that, \\"the broad masses of the working people freely aired their views on the new Fundamental Law of our state of the dictatorship of the proletariat. About 1,500,000 people, practically the entire adult population of the country, participated in the meetings which were held, and about 300,000 people contributed to the discussion... The great popular discussion, characterized by a free and fruitful thrashing out of opinions, by lively and constructive debate, was a clear expression of our socialist democracy in action and the genuine sovereignty of the people. It demonstrated in practice that in socialist Albania the people are the masters, that nothing is done against their will.\\" The numerous testimonies of those who suffered under the religious persecution of this era, however, casts serious doubts into how \\"free and fruitful\\" the thrashing out of opinions in this grand debate were, and consequently as critics of the regime would argue, the genuinely socialist character of Albania's socialist democracy. During the Cultural and Ideological Revolution, traditional kinship links in Albania, which were centered on the patriarchal family, were shattered by the postwar repression of clan leaders, collectivization of agriculture, industrialization, migration from the countryside to urban areas, and suppression of religion.Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity; by Miranda Vickers & James Pettifer, 1999 ; p. 138 \\"Because of its association with the years of repression under communism, Albanians have developed an aversion to collective life in any form, even where it\\"Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity; by Miranda Vickers & James Pettifer, 1999 ; p. 2 \\"Enver Hoxha's regime was haunted by fears of external intervention and internal subversion. Albania thus became a fortress state\\"The Greek Minority in Albania ‚Äì In the Aftermath of Communism \\"Onset in 1967 of the campaign by Albania's communist party, the Albanian Party of Labour (PLA), to eradicate organised religion, a prime target of which was the Orthodox Church. Many churches were damaged or destroyed during this period, and many Greek-language books were banned because of their religious themes or orientation. Yet, as in other communist states, particularly in the Balkans, where measures which were putatively geared towards the consolidation of political control intersected with the pursuit of national integration, it is often impossible to draw sharp distinctions between the ideological and ethno- cultural bases of repression. This is all the more true in the case of Albania's anti-religious campaign because it was merely one element of the broader \\"Ideological and Cultural Revolution\\" which was begun by Hoxha in 1966 but whose main features he outlined at the PLA's Fourth Congress in 1961\\" The postwar regime brought a radical change in the status of Albania's women. Considered second-class citizens in traditional Albanian society, women did most of the work at home and they also did most of the work in the fields. Before World War II, about 90% of Albania's women were illiterate, and in many areas, they were regarded as chattel under ancient tribal laws and customs. During the Cultural and Ideological Revolution, the party encouraged women to take jobs outside the home in an effort to compensate for labor shortages and overcome their conservatism. Hoxha himself proclaimed that anyone who trampled on the party's edict on women's rights should be \\"hurled into the fire.\\" =Self-reliance= Durr√´s in 1978 Albanian-Chinese relations had stagnated by 1970, and when China began to reemerge from isolation and the Cultural Revolution in the early 1970s, Mao and the other Chinese leaders reassessed their commitment to Albania. In response, Albania began to broaden its contacts with the outside world. Albania opened trade negotiations with France, Italy, and the recently independent Asian and African states, and in 1971 it normalised relations with Yugoslavia and Greece. Albania's leaders abhorred the contacts of China with the United States in the early 1970s, and its press and radio ignored President Richard Nixon's trip to Beijing in 1972. Albania actively worked to reduce its dependence on China by diversifying trade and improving diplomatic and cultural relations, especially with Western Europe. But Albania shunned the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and it was the only European country that refused to take part in the Helsinki Conference of July 1975. Soon after Mao's death in 1976, Hoxha criticized the new leadership as well as Beijing's pragmatic policy towards the United States and Western Europe. China retorted by inviting Tito to visit Beijing in 1977 and ending assistance programs for Albania in 1978. Center of Tirana in 1978, with slogans and propaganda on all of the main buildings The Sino-Albanian split left Albania with no foreign benefactor. Albania ignored calls to normalize relations by the United States and the Soviet Union. Instead, Albania expanded its diplomatic ties with Western Europe and the developing nations and it also began to stress the principle of self-reliance as the keystone of the country's strategy for economic development. Albania, however, did not have many resources of its own, and Hoxha's cautious opening to the outside world was not enough to bolster Albania's economy, and nascent movements for change stirred up inside Albania. Without Chinese or Soviet aid, the country began to experience widespread shortages of everything from machine parts to wheat and animal feed. Infrastructure and living standards began to collapse. According to the World bank, Albania netted around US$750 in gross national product per capita throughout much of the 1980s. As Hoxha's health slipped, muted calls arose for the relaxation of party controls and greater openness. In response, Hoxha launched a fresh series of purges that removed the defense minister and many top military officials. A year later, Hoxha purged ministers who were responsible for the country's economy and replaced them with younger people. As Hoxha began to experience more health problems, he progressively withdrew from state affairs and took longer and more frequent leaves of absence. Meanwhile, he began to plan an orderly succession. He worked to institutionalize his policies, hoping to frustrate any attempt which his successors might make to venture from the Stalinist path which he had blazed for Albania. In December 1976, Albania adopted its second Stalinist constitution of the postwar era. The document guaranteed Albanians freedom of speech, the press, organization, association, and assembly but subordinated these rights to the individual's duties to society as a whole. The constitution continued to emphasize national pride and unity, the idea of autarky was enshrined in law and the government was prohibited from seeking financial aid or credits or forming joint companies with partners from capitalist or revisionist communist countries. The constitution's preamble also boasted that the foundations of religious belief had been abolished in Albania. In 1980, Hoxha tapped Ramiz Alia to succeed him as Albania's communist patriarch, overlooking his long-standing comrade-in-arms, Mehmet Shehu. Hoxha first tried to convince Shehu to voluntarily step aside, but when this move failed, Hoxha arranged for all of the members of the Politburo to rebuke him for allowing his son to become engaged to the daughter of a former bourgeois family. Shehu allegedly committed suicide on 17 December 1981. Some suspect that Hoxha had him killed. Hoxha had Shehu's wife and three sons arrested, one of whom killed himself in prison. In November 1982, Hoxha announced that Shehu had been simultaneously working as a foreign spy for the United States, British, Soviet, and Yugoslav intelligence agencies in planning the assassination of Hoxha himself. \\"He was buried like a dog,\\" Hoxha wrote in the Albanian edition of his book, The Titoites. In 1983 Hoxha relinquished many of his duties due to poor health, and Alia assumed responsibility for Albania's administration. Alia traveled around Albania extensively, standing in for Hoxha at major events and delivering addresses laying down new policies and intoning litanies to the enfeebled president. Hoxha died on 11 April 1985. Alia succeeded Hoxha to the presidency and became the legal secretary of the APL two days later. In due course, he became a dominant figure in the Albanian media, and his slogans were painted in crimson letters on signboards across the country. =Transition= After Hoxha's death, Ramiz Alia maintained firm control of the country and its security apparatus, but Albania's desperate economic situation required Alia to introduce some reforms. Continuing a policy set by Hoxha, Alia reestablished diplomatic relations with West Germany in return for development aid and he also courted Italy and France. The very gradual and slight reforms intensified as Mikhail Gorbachev introduced his new policies of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union, culminating in the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the collapse of communist governments across Central and Eastern Europe. After Nicolae Ceau≈üescu (the leader of Communist Romania) was executed in a revolution in December 1989, Alia expedited his reforms, apparently concerned about violence and his own fate if radical changes were not made. He signed the Helsinki Agreement (which was signed by other countries in 1975) which respected some human rights. On 11 December 1990, under enormous pressure from students and workers, Alia announced that the Party of Labor had abandoned its guaranteed right to rule, that other parties could be formed, and free elections would be held in the spring of 1991. Alia's party won the elections on 31 March 1991‚Äîthe first free elections held in decades. Nevertheless, it was clear that the change would not be stopped. The position of the communists was confirmed in the first round of elections under a 1991 interim law, but two months later, it fell during a general strike. A committee of \\"national salvation\\" took over but it also collapsed within six months. On 22 March 1992, the Communists were trumped by the Democratic Party in national elections. The change from dictatorship to democracy came with many challenges. The Democratic Party had to implement the reforms it had promised, but they were either too slow or did not solve the country's problems, so people were disappointed when their hopes for fast prosperity went unfulfilled. In the general elections of June 1996 the Democratic Party tried to win an absolute majority by manipulating the results. This government collapsed in 1997 in the wake of additional collapses of pyramid schemes and widespread corruption, which caused chaos and rebellion throughout the country. The government attempted to suppress the rebellion by military force but the attempt failed, due to long-term corruption of the armed forces, forcing other nations to intervene. Pursuant to the 1991 interim basic law, Albanians ratified a constitution in 1998, establishing a democratic system of government based upon the rule of law and guaranteeing the protection of fundamental human rights. Legacy The policies which were pursued by Enver Hoxha and his followers influenced political and economic thought around the world. Thus, Hoxhaist parties were founded in many countries and they based their ideology on Enver Hoxha's ideas as to how a communist state should be constructed and embraced his strict adherence to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. Following the fall of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania in 1991, the Hoxhaist parties regrouped as an International conference and the publication Unity and Struggle.

It was developed in the 14th century C.E. during the rule of the Bahamani Sultans. The term \\"bidriware\\" originates from the township of Bidar, which is still the chief centre for the manufacture of the unique metalware. Due to its striking inlay artwork, bidriware is an important export handicraft of India and is prized as a symbol of wealth. The metal used is a blackened alloy of zinc and copper inlaid with thin sheets of pure silver. This native art form has obtained Geographical Indications (GI) registry.  Origins  A end 17th century, Bidriware Hookah base at Louvre The origin of bidriware is usually attributed to the Bahamani sultans who ruled Bidar in the 14th‚Äì15th centuries. Bidriware techniques and style are influenced by Persian art. It was first brought to India by noted Sufi Khwaja Moinuddin Hasan Chisti in the form of utensils. The art form developed in the kingdom that was a mix of Turkish, Persian and Arabic influences which were intermingled with the local styles and thus a unique style of its own was born. Abdullah bin Kaiser, a craftsman from Iran was invited by the Sultan Ahmed Shah Bahmani to work on decorating the royal palaces and courts. According to some accounts, Kaiser joined hands with local craftsmen and gave birth to Bidriware under the rule of Ahmed Shah and his son Second Alauddin Bahmani. Along with local artisans, the art ware spread far and wide and was handed over to generations as time passed.  Bidri artisans  Bidri art researcher Rehaman Patel shares that the awardees also had shown their skills by exhibiting varieties of Bidri art in foreign countries. Among them is internationally renowned national awardee Bidri artist Shah Rasheed Ahmed Quadri. On behalf of Karnataka Tableau Shah Rasheed Ahmed Quadri represented a live demonstration of Bidri art in the year 2011 on the occasion of the Republic day at Rajpath in New Delhi. The Govt. of India awarded him with Shilpguru award in 2015. According to the census of India in 1961, Syed Tassaduq Hussain- a first National awardee (1969) was the Head of the Gulistan Cooperative Society, Bidar. The other notable national awardees are Abdul Hakeem, Mohammed Najeeb Khan, Shah Majeed Quadri, Mohammed Moizuddin, Mohammed Abdul Rauf and Md. Saleemuddin  Process of making bidriware  Cup with lid, Bidriware, ca 1850 V&A; Museum The Bidriware undergoes an eight-stage process. The eight stages are moulding, smoothening by file, designing by chisels, engraving by chisel and hammer, pure silver inlaying, smoothening again, buffing and finally oxidising by soil and ammonium chloride. Bidriware is manufactured from an alloy of copper and zinc (in the ratio 1:16) by casting. The zinc content gives the alloy a deep black color. First, a mould is formed from soil made malleable by the addition of castor oil and resin. The molten metal is then poured into it to obtain a cast piece which is later smoothened by filing. The casting is now coated with a strong solution of copper sulphate to obtain a temporary black coating over which designs are etched freehand with the help of a metal stylus. This is then secured in a vise and the craftsman uses small chisels to engrave the design over the freehand etching. Fine wire or flattened strips of pure silver are then carefully hammered into these grooves. The article then is filed, buffed and smoothed to get rid of the temporary black coating. This results in rendering the silver inlay hardly distinguishable from the gleaming metallic surface which is now all silvery- white. The bidriware is now ready for the final blackening process. Here, a special variety of soil which is available only in the unlit portions of the Bidar fort is used. It is mixed with ammonium chloride and water to produce a paste which is then rubbed onto a heated bidri surface. The paste selectively darkens the body while it has no effect on the silver inlay. The paste is then rinsed off to reveal a shiny silver design resplendent against the black surface. As a finishing touch, oil is applied to the finished product to deepen the matt coating. The finished product appears black with brilliant silver inlay.  Soil speciality  It is said that the soil of Bidar is very special. No one knows exactly what is special about it. Some artisans feel that the soil is away from the sunlight and rain for years and therefore it has great oxidizing properties. Others believe that the part of the fort from where soil is brought was a mine and therefore metal extracts in the soil make it unique. The artisans say that the quality of the Bidri earth is very important and the real art lies in testing the mud which is necessary for making the articles. It is tasted by the artisans by their tongues and then decided whether to use it or not. This knack comes from experience and is passed on to the next generation. Another important thing is that all the process of making the Bidriware starting from casting to oxidation is done by hand and therefore it is time-consuming and hence costlier too.  Patterns  Traditionally, various flowers (known as Asharfi-ki-booti), leaves (vine creepers), geometric designs, human figures, stylized poppy plants with flowers, etc. are commonly found on the items. Demand for the patterns of Persian roses and passages from the Quran in Arabic script are also in great demand in the West. Earlier, Bidriware were used for making hookahs, paan- holders, and vases but now keepsakes, bowls, earrings, trays, ornament boxes, other jewelry and showpiece items are made from it. There are craftsmen in this art practice who took this practice to national and international recognition. One of them is Shah Rasheed Ahmed Quadri is a recipient of several awards like National award which he received in 1988, Karnataka state award in 1984, Rajyostava award in 2006, Great Indian Achievement award in 2004, and District Rajyotsava award in 1996. In Aurangabad, artisans also make patterns of motifs from Ajanta Caves especially Ajanta Padmapani which have become very popular among foreign tourists.  Innovations  This world- famous artistic metallic work is on the revival path after the introduction of innovative designs and a variety of new patterns. The designs range from Indian to international themes with the latest in home and lifestyle accessories. Innovative designs are developed by the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT). Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation Limited is keen on promoting the Bidri art form. The traditional art which is identified with a limited set of designs is now trying to diversify and find a foothold in the present-day market and appeal to younger patrons. New items include USB drive covers, office stationeries such as paper clips, key bunches, lockets, envelope openers, pen stands, lampshades and even floor tiles. National Institute of Design has come up with novel & lighter items that uses less silver and therefore costs lesser.  Bidriware in other places  A Bidriware wine decanter While Bidar in Karnataka and Hyderabad in Telangana are the most vibrant centers, this art is also practiced in few other parts of the country like Purnia in Bihar, Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh and Murshidabad in West Bengal. The designs are mostly conventional ranging from creepers, flowers and sometimes human figures. In Bellori, a village near Purnia, local craftsmen known as the Kansaris are engaged in molding and turning bidri vessels. The sonars (goldsmith) then do the engraving and polishing. Also found here is the gharki, a less sophisticated variant of the Bidri. Another variant of the bidriwork can be seen in Lucknow's Zar Buland, where the ornamental designs are raised above the surface. In Aurangabad, the Bidri art was introduced by the Nizam of Hyderabad as it was a part of Nizam's empire then. As Aurangabad has its own rich legacy of art and craft, the Bidri work mingled into the local arts soon.  Research in Bidri art  Gulbarga- based artist Rehaman Patel has done extensive research on Bidri art collecting all evidence of the historical background of Bidri, methods of making Bidri, critical review of Bidri items collection in India and non-Indian museums, the introduction of Bidri artisans and so on. His research on \\"Bidri Art of Karnataka\\" was submitted to Gulbarga University and the same was awarded in the year 2010. The Indian Royal Academy of Art and Culture has published a book in Kannada title \\"Karnatakada Bidri Kale\\" (Bidri Art of Karnataka) under the financial assistance of the Department of Kannada and Culture, Govt. of Karnataka in the year 2012. English version on Bidri Art published by Karnataka Historical Research Publication in 2017. Dr. Patel is a fellow of Karnataka Shilpakala Academy Bangalore for the year 2014‚Äì15. He submitted documentation on \\"International collection of Bidri Art\\". Attended as a resource person and delivered a PPT at the bidriware workshop organised by Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath at its campus in Bangalore in 2017. He has many articles to his credit on Bidri Art.

The following is a list of characters that first appeared in the BBC soap opera EastEnders in 1985, by order of first appearance. They were all introduced by executive producer Julia Smith. The first episode of EastEnders was broadcast on 19 February 1985, and twenty- three main characters were already created for their first appearance. The first character to be seen was Den Watts, followed by Ali Osman and then Arthur Fowler, all of whom find Reg Cox dying in his flat. Ethel Skinner, Harold Legg and Pauline Fowler appear, after Den alerts them of Reg's death. With Ethel is her pug Willy along with Lou Beale. Saeed and Naima Jeffery are seen working in the local shop whilst Angie Watts is seen in The Queen Victoria, Walford's local pub. Nick Cotton and Sue Osman are next seen, whilst Pete and Kathy Beale work at the fruit and veg stall and Hassan Osman is seen with his parents in the caf√©. Sharon Watts, Ian Beale and Michelle Fowler are next seen and Mark Fowler is seen going into the bookies. Lastly, Roly the dog is seen in the pub when a fight breaks out. Lofty Holloway is introduced on 26 February along with Terry Rich, and Tony Carpenter is introduced on 28 February. Mary Smith and her daughter Annie are introduced on 5 March. Tony's son Kelvin is introduced on 12 March. Andy O'Brien is introduced on 21 March along with Debbie Wilkins. Chris Smith was introduced on 7 May and Mehmet Osman was introduced on 13 June as a recurring character. Hannah Carpenter arrived on 25 June as Tony's wife and Dot Cotton was introduced on 4 July followed by Ernie Mears on 16 July. Detective Sergeant Roy Quick was introduced on 20 August as Walford's detective. Martin Fowler was born on 30 July and Simon Wicks arrived on 5 October. Lastly, the wife of Mehmet, Guizin Osman arrived on 22 October, and Cassie Carpenter arrived as the daughter of Hannah and Tony. Den Watts Den Watts, played by actor Leslie Grantham, is the original landlord of The Queen Victoria. He became well known for his tabloid nickname, \\"Dirty Den\\". He is perhaps best remembered for his stormy love-hate relationship with his alcoholic first wife Angie (Anita Dobson), as well as his devoted interaction with their adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean). After nearly 20 years of marriage, he hands divorce papers to Angie in the 1986 Christmas Day episode that was watched by a record-breaking 30.15 million viewers, more than half of the UK population at the time. The character soon departed from the show after getting involved with his local's criminal organization, The Firm ‚Äì which sparked the events of an attempt on Den's life. For 14 years, it was believed that he had been killed, but he returns to Walford in September 2003. Seventeen months later, his character is killed off again ‚Äì this time for good ‚Äì at the hands of his manipulative second wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman), on the show's 20th anniversary episode that was watched by over 1/3 of the UK population at the time. Den was described by EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge as being arguably one of the most iconic soap characters ever. Ali Osman Ali Osman, played by Nejdet Salih, is a happy-go-lucky, easy going chap, which is in stark contrast to his highly strung wife, Sue (Sandy Ratcliff). He has a compulsive addiction to gambling, which gets him into trouble on more than one occasion and his marriage ends in disaster after he has his wife sectioned. He is a member of the original EastEnders cast, appearing in the first episode on 19 February 1985. He remains with the show for nearly five years afterwards, making his final appearance on 10 October 1989. Ali Osman was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Ali, a Turkish Cypriot, was originally intended to be named Chris. His name was changed to Ali when it dawned on Holland that he had given a Christian name to a Muslim. Ali was a well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Arthur Fowler Arthur Fowler, played by Bill Treacher, is the father of the Fowler family. Arthur is essentially a good man, but makes some foolish choices and always ends up paying dearly for them. Bossed to the brink of insanity by his wife Pauline (Wendy Richard) and mother-in-law Lou Beale (Anna Wing), Arthur falls into the arms of another woman. During his time in Albert Square he suffers with a mental disorder, is sent to prison twice and eventually dies of a brain haemorrhage in 1996. Arthur Fowler was one of the original twenty- three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Arthur is a member of the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers, and Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Arthur's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. Reg Cox Reg Cox, played by Johnnie Clayton, is a resident of Albert Square. The first episode of EastEnders on 19 February 1985 centres upon pensioner Reg's death. According to scriptwriter Colin Brake, the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, wanted to start the serial \\"with a bang, throwing the audience into the middle of life in [the fictional setting of] Walford\\". The Reg Cox storyline was deemed as a good starting point, allowing various members of the community to be involved with or comment on the circumstances of the old man's murder. In the first ever scene of the programme, the characters of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), and Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih) are shown breaking down the door of Reg's flat. In Holland and Smith's book, The Inside Story, the authors have outlined their original interpretation of the scene: \\"[EastEnders] starts with a bang, as a size ten boot kicks down the door that's locked from the inside. The tiny, dirty and foul-smelling council- flat behind the battered door belongs to Reg Cox (known locally as \\"the-old- boy\\", and a cantankerous bastard at the best of times) who hasn't been seen around [Albert Square] for days.... Once the door's down, three men rush into the gloomy main-room.... They find the old boy sitting in his favourite armchair beside the gas fire (which isn't on) ‚Äì and he's very nearly dead.... By the end of the episode the old boy will have been removed from the square and taken to Intensive Care, and the entire community will be rife with gossip, which spreads round the houses like the plague. Via the gossip we're able to piece together the events leading up to the discovery of Reg.\\" Reg lived alone at 23b Albert Square. On the morning of 19 February 1985, Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh), who runs the shop on Bridge Street, became concerned about Reg after he had failed to make his daily milk purchase for the past three days and her husband, Saeed Jeffery (Andrew Johnson), mentions this to Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), publican of the pub next door. Den and Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) roused Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), who lived downstairs from Reg, to let them into the house and the three of them kick in the door to Reg's room when he fails to answer their knocking. Den speaks the opening lines of the first episode, \\"Stinks in here, dunnit?\\", followed by the discovery of an unconscious Reg slumped in his armchair in the lounge of his neglected house. Den runs to get the local doctor, Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton), and calls for an ambulance. On 21 February 1985, they learn that Reg had been severely beaten and died from injuries which had gone unnoticed when he was found. It is eventually revealed that Nick Cotton (John Altman) was behind the beating when he was attempting to steal Reg's war medals. Reg, who was 59 years old when he died, was not a popular figure in Albert Square. He is referred to as a 'cantankerous old git' by Arthur, called a 'miserable so and so' by Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and a 'nasty old man' by his downstairs neighbour, Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff). But despite this, Lou Beale (Anna Wing) causes havoc around the Square, accusing Sue of neglect for allowing him to lie dying in his flat for days, without checking up on him. The character also appears in the Christmas special \\"CivvyStreet\\", set during World War II, shown on 22 December 1988. The teenage Reg is played by Marc Tufano. He has gone AWOL and sells dodgy gear during the Second World War. In 2014, Reg's murderer, Nick, used the name 'Reg Cox' as an alias after he faked his death. In 2015, Nick died in the same place that Reg died exactly 30 years earlier after admitting to his mother, Dot Branning (June Brown), that he killed Reg. Ethel Skinner Ethel Skinner played by Gretchen Franklin, is an elderly resident of Walford. Ethel Skinner also features in a 1988 EastEnders special, entitled CivvyStreet, set on Albert Square during the Second World War, where the character is played by Alison Bettles. Ethel is an EastEnders original character and in the early years she can often be found wandering the square with her adored pug Willy. She and Dot Cotton (June Brown) are lifelong friends and although they wind each other up, they are completely dependent on each other. In fact Ethel trusts Dot so much that she even asks her to help her die in 2000, after she is diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Ethel's original character outline states that she was born in 1920. However, during the series this was altered to 1916 and for many years her birthday fell on 19 February. When Ethel comes back to Walford to die in 2000, she reveals to Dot that she had lied about her age for many years. Pauline Fowler Pauline Fowler played by Wendy Richard between 1985 and 2006 is the wife of Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher). Pauline was created by scriptwriter Tony Holland and producer Julia Smith as one of EastEnders original characters. She makes her debut in the soap's first episode on 19 February 1985, and remains for twenty- one years and ten months, making her the second longest-running original character, surpassed only by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Pauline was a staple in the UK press during her time in EastEnders, representative of the symbiosis between Britain's soaps and tabloid newspapers. Widely read tabloids, such as The Sun and Daily Mirror, would routinely publish articles about forthcoming developments in Pauline's storylines.\\"Britain's tabloids and Britain's soaps feed off each other: newspapers publish articles about forthcoming developments in shows like \\"EastEnders\\" and viewers tune in to watch the prophecies come true.\\" Critical opinion on the character differs. She has been described as a \\"legend\\" and a television icon, but was also voted the 35th \\"most annoying person of 2006\\" (being the only fictional character to appear on the list). The character is well known even outside the show's viewer-base, and away from the on-screen serial, Pauline has been the subject of television documentaries, behind-the-scenes books, tie-in novels and comedy sketch shows. Harold Legg Dr Harold Legg, played by Leonard Fenton, is Walford's original GP. He is widely trusted within the community, and is always on hand to dish out advice. Dr Legg appears as a regular character between 1985 and 1989, but continues to appear in a recurring role until 1997. He was officially retired in 1999 by executive producer Matthew Robinson, though he has made cameos since this time in 2000, 2004 and 2007 and returned one final time in late 2018, before the character was killed off in early 2019. Dr. Harold Legg is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Dr. Legg is an attempt to represent the successive wave of Jewish immigrants that had settled in the East End of London between 1881 and 1914 in order avoid the persecution that they were being subjected to in Europe. The second generation of East End born Jews (as Dr. Legg was meant to represent) prospered in the area until the 1930s when Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists was formed, and used violence to instil fear in the Jewish population.\\"East End Jews\\", BBC. Retrieved 23 September 2006. As the Jewish community grew wealthier, many moved out of the East End to more affluent areas of London, just as the character of Dr. Legg had done on-screen when the show began; living in Islington, but commuting to his practice in Walford. Saeed Jeffery Saeed Jeffery, played by Andrew Johnson, is the original owner of the First til Last grocery store. He is never truly accepted in Walford, and his arranged marriage ends in divorce after it is discovered that he had been making obscene phone calls to women. He leaves Walford in disgrace, leaving his business to his wife. Saeed Jeffery is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Saeed and his wife Naima (Shreela Ghosh) are the first Asian characters to appear in the soap. Black and Asian characters were two ethnic minorities that had previously been under-represented in British soap before EastEnders aired. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Pete Beale Pete Beale, played by Peter Dean, makes his first appearance in the programme's first episode, on 19 February 1985. The character was created by Tony Holland, one of the creators of EasEnders; he was based on a member of Holland's family. Pete features in the soap for eight years as the local fruit and veg trader of Albert Square; he is a member of the original focal clan in the serial, the Beales and Fowlers. Pete is portrayed as a macho and somewhat insensitive individual who struggles to cope with emotion. Pete was axed from the soap in 1993 and departed in May that year after over eight years on-screen. The character was killed off-screen later that year following Peter Dean's public criticism of the BBC. Lou Beale Lou Beale played by Anna Wing, is the matriarch of the Beale family. The character is played by Karen Meagher in the 1988 EastEnders special, CivvyStreet, set during the Second World War. Lou Beale was the first EastEnders character to be created by series co-creator Tony Holland, taking the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Lou is the archetypal East End matriarch throughout EastEnders first three years. An intimidating force within the local community, she is the dowager of Albert Square's central family, the Beales and Fowlers. Never afraid to speak her mind, and woe betide anyone who manages to get on her wrong side, Lou has the respect of her friends and family, even if they do find her a bit of a nuisance at times. Born in the East End, Lou lived in Walford all her life. Albert and Lou came to their house on the corner of Albert Square, number forty-five, on getting married during the 1930s. Lou remained in the house throughout the Second World War and brought up her children there. Her affinity and ties with the area mean that she tends to view Albert Square as her own and that gives her an excuse to intrude into people's business as she sees fit. Naima Jeffery Naima Jeffery, played by Shreela Ghosh, is the wife of Saeed Jeffery (Andrew Johnson). Naima tries to embrace Western culture, but this is not easy since her family constantly try to force her to adhere to their ancient customs. Sick of being forced to live in an arranged marriage with a husband she loathes, Naima makes a stand and shames her family by filing for a divorce. Naima Jeffery is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Naima and her husband are the first Asian characters to appear in the soap. Black and Asian characters were two ethnic minorities that had previously been under- represented in British soap before EastEnders aired. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Angie Watts Angie Watts played by Anita Dobson, appears from the first episode of the show until 1988 when the actress decided to quit and the character was written out. Angie is well known for her cheeky banter, her huge shaggy perm and turning to alcohol during her stormy marriage to cheating Den (Leslie Grantham) which ends when he hands her divorce papers on Christmas Day, in an episode watched by a record-breaking 30.1 million viewers. Despite being the loud and feisty lady of Walford, and having a close relationship with her beloved adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean), she has little real happiness during her time in Albert Square and alcoholism finally claims her life in 2002 when she dies of cirrhosis of the liver. Angie Watts is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. The character of Angie was originally going to be named Pearl and she, her husband and adopted daughter were to be the occupants of the soap's local pub, now famously known as The Queen Vic. Holland, who had worked as a barman in his youth, called upon his own personal experiences to invent the Watts family and the pub they lived in. Holland and Smith had always been critical of the way pubs had been portrayed on television feeling they lacked vitality and life, so they were determined that their pub and occupants were going to be more 'real'. The Watts were seen by Holland as integral to the show's success, partly because he had already guessed that the pub was going to be a monstrous battleground where emotions would run high on a regular basis, and also because the occupants would be providing the majority of the drama. Willy Willy is a Pug, who appears in the first episode of the programme and remained in the show until 1992. Willy was cast less than a week before the filming of EastEnders began. From the beginning it was decided that the pensioner Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) was to have a Yorkshire Terrier named Willy (after her dead husband). The company Janimals, who specialised in providing and training animals for television and films, was contacted by EastEnders co-creator/producer Julia Smith, and informed her that they could provide an experienced Pug for the part (he had previously starred in an adaptation of Swallows and Amazons). The dog was brought to the studio to meet Gretchen Franklin, the actress who played Ethel. She took a shine to him straight away and so the pug was cast as Willy. Willy and Roly the poodle shared a dressing room at Elstree Studios. Roly Roly is an apricot coloured Standard Poodle, who appears in the first episode of the programme and remains in the show until 1993. Roly was cast less than a week before the filming of EastEnders began. From the beginning it was decided that the occupants of The Queen Victoria pub, Den, Angie and Sharon Watts, were to have an Alsatian named Prince. However, finding an Alsatian that was light enough in colour not to merge into the background of the set proved to be difficult. Eventually, the co-creator/producer of the show, Julia Smith, was contacted by a company named Janimals, who specialised in providing and training animals for television and films. They had found a seven-month-old Poodle, called Roly, who might still be young enough to be trained. Training was said to take three weeks, and as the Poodle was a similar size to an Alsatian, Roly got the part. Roly was made the property of the BBC, given an ID card, and taken to live with Julia Smith at her home in London. Roly and Willy the pug shared a dressing room at Elstree studios. Tracey Tracey (known to fans as Tracey the barmaid) is played by Jane Slaughter. She has appeared as a background character since the first episode on 19 February 1985, when she was seen working on the flower stall in Bridge Street Market. Slaughter was not credited in the role until episode 126 (1 May 1986), which was the first episode in which she spoke. She is the longest- serving female member of the cast in terms of continuous appearances, as other original female cast members who are still in the cast have taken long-term breaks from the show. Tracey starts working as a barmaid at The Queen Victoria (The Queen Vic) public house in 1989. Her existence is largely to provide somebody to man the bar while one of the main characters resolves disputes, arguments or disagreements, or tends to the main plot of the episode. Despite featuring on the television programme frequently and occasionally having a line to say, her surname and most of her background is unknown. She has also featured in a few minor storylines. As well as being a barmaid, Tracey owns a flower stall on Bridge Street market. Her stall is regularly robbed by new characters who steal flowers for people they are meeting. She employs workers whilst she does shifts in the pub, including Ina Foot (Ina Clare) and Jean Slater (Gillian Wright). Tracey becomes good friends with Debbie Bates (Nicola Duffett), and is godmother to her daughter Clare Bates (Gemma Bissix). Tracey is often seen to be pleased at the prospect of additional overtime in The Queen Victoria when a Mitchell family wedding or other event is planned, as she can always do with extra money. On 25 May 1993, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) told Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) that she will be late for his birthday party as she would be attending a hen party, which Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) confirmed was because Tracey was getting married. After Nigel met and kissed Debbie during his birthday party, he asked Tracey where Debbie was: she replied that she left in a cab, but really liked Nigel and thought he was sweet. On 14 April 2003, Tracey has a one-night stand with Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), the adoptive half-brother of former pub owner Sharon Watts, when he arrives in Albert Square, despite the fact that she is married. The next day, he returns her underwear to her publicly over the bar. In 2005, Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) breaks into the pub with a crowbar, and Tracey discovers her, asking her to leave. Sam knocks Tracey out with the crowbar and drags her, unconscious, into the bathroom, locking her in. Sam goes downstairs to unearth the body of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), who is buried in the basement, and when the police arrive, Tracey is comforted by Little Mo Mitchell (Kacey Ainsworth). After Sam is released from prison on bail, she apologises to Tracey, but Tracey appears shaken by the ordeal and scared of Sam. On 7 August 2008, Tracey opens up when Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) questions why she is so quiet. She says she wants to keep herself to herself because she thinks that the Mitchells are all \\"stark raving mad\\" and that she does not fear any new barmaids, as she has seen them come and go, but knows that she will always be behind the bar. She goes on to say that whoever lives in the pub is \\"cursed\\" in her opinion, and that they will never be able to live happily together. In March 2009, Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) makes Tracey a cleaner at The Queen Vic, and she is pleased with the extra money. She attends Peggy Mitchell's (Barbara Windsor) hen party, and Peggy and Archie's wedding on 2 April. On 16 April 2009, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) accuses Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) of drinking again. However, Phil denies this, saying that he had broken a bottle of alcohol earlier, and Tracey backs him up. On 28 April 2009, Tracey answers the phone to Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) questioning Phil's whereabouts from the night before. Tracey tells Phil about having to talk to the bank regarding some money issues. Following that, Phil pressures Tracey into talking about her feelings, supposedly for him, and mentioning her husband in the process. Finally, she appears again towards the end of the episode, wanting to help Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones) get to school as Phil is too drunk to assist him. Phil, flirting with Tracey, tells her that her husband will not mind. On 30 April 2009, she finds Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) lost inhaler. On 30 July, she phones in sick with a back injury, and Peggy says it was unlike her to miss a shift, so it must be serious. Dot Branning (June Brown) describes Tracey as the person who \\"sees everything but says very little\\". On 8 September, Peggy tells Sam (now played by Danniella Westbrook) that Tracey still holds a grudge against her. On 26 November, Tracey covers for both Peggy and Phil when bailiffs ask for them, by pretending she is just a barmaid from an agency and does not know them. She then informs Ben he needs to tell Phil that the bailiffs are looking for him and want to repossess his car. On 24 December, Archie Mitchell and Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) take over the pub, ousting Peggy and her family. Tracey is unhappy with the way Archie and Janine treated Peggy and the rest of the Mitchell family, and when Janine tells Tracey to put some tinsel in her hair and to keep an eye on the Christmas dinner, Tracey leaves a note saying \\"Gone fishing\\", implying that she has resigned. The next day, Tracey is present when Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) is arrested on suspicion of Archie's murder, and looks shocked. She also attends Jean Slater's birthday party on 11 January 2010. When Mo Harris (Laila Morse) opens a betting circle on the identity of Archie's killer, she lists Tracey as the rank outsider, giving her the nickname \\"Silent Assassin\\". On 18 January 2010, Tracey appears behind the bar in a non-speaking capacity for The Queen Vic's reopening. On 22 January, the pub's new owner, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), gives Tracey a warning for arriving two hours late, but Peggy explains that she asked her to come in late as she has done a lot of unpaid overtime recently. Later, Roxy sacks Tracey because she wants the pub to have younger bar staff. Peggy demands that Roxy beg Tracey to come back for the evening shift as workers like Tracey are \\"gold dust\\". Peggy tells Tracey on the phone that she is not sacked but Tracey hangs up. Tracey decides to take Roxy to an unfair dismissal tribunal, so Roxy says she will audition a new barmaid, giving Tracey a chance but making sure she loses. However, when Roxy realises she does not know how to run a pub, she gives Tracey her job back. Tracey suggests a curry night, and Roxy is happy to leave Tracey in charge of it, saying it is the most she has ever heard her speak. On that same day, viewers find out that Tracey and Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) are good friends. In March 2010, Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson) holds up The Queen Vic, asking Tracey for cash and saying he has a gun. She fills his bag with cash but Phil takes it off her. In September 2010, following a fire at The Queen Vic, Tracey starts working at Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) fish and chip shop. The next month, Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) offers Tracey her old job back at The Queen Vic, along with Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner), after he reopens the pub. In January 2011, during a conversation with Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace), it is revealed that Tracey has a son who lives with his father. When Kat asks for her opinion on herself on a down day, Tracey replies that she thinks Kat is scary. When David Wicks (Michael French) returned for his mother Pat Evans' (Pam St. Clement), funeral, he comments to his daughter Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) that he was amazed Tracey was still working in The Queen Vic, which prompted Bianca to say that Tracey was one of the few things in the world that was reliable. On 14 June 2012, Tracey gives Jean her job back on the flower stall. However, Tracey later sacks Jean after she rows with customers Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) and Janine Butcher. In August 2012, after Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) announces to the customers in The Queen Vic that Sharon has returned, only Tracey greets her and meets her son Dennis Rickman Jr (Harry Hickles). In December 2013, Phil sells the pub to Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and when Tracey arrives to work her shift, Mick's wife, Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) tells her that she is not wanted any more. Shirley witnesses this and tells Linda that Tracey is \\"part of the furniture\\" at The Queen Vic. Tracey is then later seen when she and Linda become friends, and she resumes her job at The Queen Vic. In April 2014, the market merges with Spring Lane Market, and this brings in a new florist, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley); however, when discussing the competition with Alfie, Pam states she has no competition, implying that Tracey no longer runs a flower stall. In September 2015, Tracey is shocked when she answers The Queen Vic telephone to Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), who is believed to be dead. Kathy asks Tracey to pass on an address to Phil. After being confronted by Mick, she finds Phil. Phil tries to persuade her it was a joke, but Tracey is not convinced, and knows it was Kathy; she gives him Kathy's whereabouts. The following month, Tracey finally meets Kathy again and welcomes her home. Eight months later, Tracey welcomes another old friend back to Walford, as she greets Peggy when she rides around the square in a milk float. In April 2017, the freehold of The Queen Vic is sold when the Carters get into debt. Business consultant Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner) advises that the pub is overstaffed, and suggests two members of staff need to go. The Carter family refuse to sack Tracey, who they describe as \\"an institution\\", but new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) insists Tracey has to go. An upset Tracey runs from the room after Woody sacks her. A farewell party for Tracey is thrown, but she decides not to show up for it and everyone decides to boycott The Queen Vic. Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) then offers Tracey a job at his bar, The Albert. When Linda returns from Watford, Fi is annoyed when Linda gives Tracey her job back without consulting her. In February 2020, Tracey attends the Queen Vic boat party and tells Mo about the time she and Phil had sex. =Development= Being one of the only remaining original cast members in the show, Slaughter said that when she joined the show \\"she recognised that EastEnders could run and be something very exciting\\" and that she \\"never dreamed [that it would last] 25 years\\" but she \\"certainly knew it was special.\\" When asked to pick her favourite storyline she said, \\"In terms of actually watching and seeing scenes, I've been lucky being in The Vic. I've seen so many good ones ‚Äì with the Mitchells, with Phil, with Peggy ‚Äì I've been very, very lucky to see so many, that it's nigh on impossible to single any out. They've all involved different people ‚Äì I could go on and on and on!\\" Slaughter noted that \\"She's always there whereas other cast members such as Adam [Woodyatt] ‚Äì who's been there as long as I have ‚Äì wouldn't necessarily have a storyline that puts him in The Vic at all.\\" She also added, \\"For me as a character, it has to be Tracey speaking to Sean Slater. It was hysterical. For someone who never says anything, she suddenly had an opinion about everything, which I just loved. It was written by Christopher Reason and done so well. To get someone who only occasionally says things like 'out the back' and make what she says make sense ‚Äì he did a fantastic job. That was very memorable because everyone was so supportive.\\" In 2010, Slaughter said that it would not make sense to make Tracey into \\"this talkative, all-singing, all-dancing person with a fully-fledged family and surname.\\" Slaughter described her character as \\"lovely\\", \\"clever\\", \\"loyal but strong\\" and \\"opinionated\\". Jane Simon from The Mirror described her as \\"silent\\". In May 2009, Digital Spy asked EastEnders producer Diederick Santer what was in store for Tracey. He said, \\"You just have to watch out for any script that Christopher Reason writes. Chris is obsessed with Tracey and with Jane Slaughter, who plays her. He gives her loads to do, which is fantastic. When we give her more to do, she absolutely delivers. We think she's fab.\\" Tracey was one of the 'outsiders' in the \\"Who Killed Archie?\\" storyline, with many viewers thinking the culprit could be her. In a poll run by Digital Spy, 7.9% of voters thought that Tracey had killed Archie Mitchell, and in a second poll, 7.1% thought that it was her. When asked if she thought Tracey could kill, she said, \\"I wouldn't think she's that dark but who knows ‚Äì she could be. I've heard there are odds at the bookies to be had for her but why? Why would she have killed him? Because he's threatening The Vic? Is it The Vic she protects or the family?\\" It was later revealed that bookmakers William Hill had slashed the odds on Tracey being the killer, with 7/1 thinking she killed Archie. The killer was later revealed to be Stacey Slater . =Reception= Dek Hogan from Digital Spy hailed Tracey when she had a line of dialogue, and said it was \\"such a rare event that it's always worthy of a celebration. Fair play, she did mumble it a bit and it was so unmemorable that I've forgotten what it was she actually said but it was a line nonetheless.\\" He also said that she, Winston (Ulric Browne) and other background characters should have a daytime soap, saying it would be a ratings winner. Kris Green, also from Digital Spy, said that he wanted to ask scriptwriters to give more lines to Tracey, in addition to calling Tracey's scenes with Sean Slater \\"iconic\\". Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror said that whenever Tracey speaks, \\"it's worth listening to\\". Nick Cotton Nick Cotton, played by John Altman, was a recurring character who appears in the soap's debut episode in February 1985, through to his last appearance where he died in 2015. Nick is the son of characters Charlie (Christopher Hancock) and Dot Cotton (June Brown), and the father of Charlie Cotton Ashley, and Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin). His storylines have seen him twice committed murder of Reg Cox and Eddie Royle respectively, succumb to a heroin addiction, and attempt to poison his own mother, causing the death of his son Ashley amongst numerous other misdemeanors. Nick is also the subject of a special spin-off episode, The Return of Nick Cotton, which aired in October 2000. He has been voted one of television's all-time most villainous characters in a Channel 4 poll. He is seen as the show's original villain. Nick died of a heroin overdose on 13 February 2015 in the house he killed Reg Cox 30 years previous. Sue Osman Sue Osman, played by Sandy Ratcliff, is the wife of Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih). Sue is one of the serial's original characters, appearing in its first episode on 19 February 1985 and departing on-screen in May 1989. Created by Tony Holland and Julia Smith, Sue is portrayed as argumentative, insecure and tragic. A pivotal storyline in the character's narrative is the cot-death of her son, which is one of the show's first controversial plots. During her four years on-screen, the character contends with a phantom pregnancy, marital breakdown and finally insanity. Kathy Beale Kathy Beale (also Mitchell and Sullivan),\\"13-JAN-94\\", walford.net. Retrieved 7 February 2007 played by Gillian Taylforth between 1985 and 2000, and then from 2015 onwards, is the mother of Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Though it was never used on screen, in 2010 the BBC website named the character as Kathy Sullivan due to a marriage after she left the show in 2000. Kathy Beale is one of the serial's original characters, appearing in the first episode of EastEnders on 19 February 1985. One of the longest-running original characters, Kathy remains in a prominent role, covering issues such as rape and domestic violence until April 1998, when Taylforth quit. A year later, in 1999, Taylforth returned for a temporary stint to aid the departure of actor Ross Kemp who played her brother-in-law Grant Mitchell, and later in December 1999 for the wedding of her screen son Ian. She made her final appearance in January 2000. Despite various rumours of a possible return for Kathy in the press, this did not occur and the character was supposedly killed off-screen in a road accident in late February 2006 in a storyline to facilitate the return of her son Ben to his father Phil (Steve McFadden). In tribute to the character, the soap's caf√© is named \\"Kathy's\\".\\"The Cafe\\", BBC. Retrieved 16 October 2006. Kathy returned for the 30th anniversary episode in February 2015, when it was revealed that Kathy never died in a surprise showdown with her ex-husband, Phil. Hassan Osman Hassan Osman, played by Michael Evangelou, is the first son of Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih) and Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), who is only a baby during his short time in EastEnders. Hassan dies in his sleep on 20 June 1985; no official causes of death are given. Sue is left in a state of shock after her son's death. She remains in a trance-like state for weeks and refuses to eat, sleep, cry or acknowledge her grief. She later begins blaming herself unfairly for her son's sudden death. Her mental health continues to deteriorate and she becomes despondent towards Ali and their marriage disintegrates in a welter of depression. Sue eventually manages to come to terms with Hassan's death with the help of Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton), who takes the drastic measure of placing Mary Smith's (Linda Davidson) baby, Annie Smith (Zara Posener), in her lap, finally allowing her to acknowledge her pent-up sadness. =Development= Before EastEnders initially aired, creators Tony Holland and Julia Smith had already decided that Sue and Ali Osman would be parents to a young baby named Hassan. However, as further characters were invented they realised that there would be a total of four babies in the show: Annie Smith (Zara Posener), Martin Fowler (Jon Peyton Price), Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry) and Hassan. It was decided that it would be impossible for the studios to cope with four babies and so they invented a storyline to eliminate one from the cast. During this time, the topic of sudden infant death syndrome was prominent in the British press, partly due to an increase in casualties, but also because a doctor had gone public with the accusation that parents were to blame for the tragic occurrence. Holland and Smith decided that covering this issue in the soap would be a good way of 'setting the record straight', and so it was decided that Sue and Ali's baby would die from cot death in the early months of the show. This was the first of many controversial storylines in EastEnders' history. After the storyline aired in June 1985, the show was praised by audience and press alike for the sensitive and unsensational way this harrowing subject was treated. The sudden tragedy came as a surprise to the audience, especially since the bereaved parents were a couple whose feuding, fighting ways had made them appear rather comic in the early episodes of the show. The British Cot Death Foundation initially feared that a soap opera would trivialise the subject and frighten new parents. They tried to stop the episodes from airing, but in the end they were pleased with the way the subject was handled, and provided back-up support after transmission to many viewers who wanted more information on the subject. Sharon Watts Sharon Mitchell (also Watts and Rickman), played by Letitia Dean, is the daughter of Den (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Sharon is a regular character in the first 10 years of the programme, after which she leaves and returns several times. Sharon is the adoptive daughter of the popular 'supercouple'; Den and Angie. She was known to Den as his \\"princess\\" and he made sure suitors watched their step around the teenage Sharon. Even though she disapproved of her father's dodgy deals and his constant fighting with binge-drinker Angie, she loved them both nonetheless. She made a permanent return to the show in 2012 and is married to Phil Mitchell. Ian Beale Ian Beale, played by Adam Woodyatt, is the longest-serving character and the only remaining original character to have appeared continuously since the first episode on 19 February 1985. The character appeared in his 2,000th episode in the show on 26 March 2007. Ian Beale is one of the original twenty- three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Ian is a member of the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers, and Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Ian's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. Michelle Fowler Michelle Fowler (also Holloway), played by Susan Tully from 1985 to 1995 and Jenna Russell since 2016, is the daughter of Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Although she is one of the brighter people in Walford, that does not stop Michelle making some huge mistakes during her time in Albert Square. Michelle has a habit of choosing the wrong men and her stubborn nature means that she rarely accepts anyone's help or listens to good advice. She is tough, feisty, determined, outspoken and never afraid to defend herself or her beliefs. Early on in the series, the character of Michelle becomes central to the programme and is the focus of a controversial storyline involving her teenage pregnancy. Press interest in the show escalated to \\"record levels\\" as journalists continuously tried to predict who had fathered Michelle's baby. In whodunnit fashion, the audience had been kept in the dark as to the real identity of the father and were given teasers implicating several residents on The Square. The audience finally discovered the culprit in episode 66 of the programme, October 1985. The episode was written by series co-creator/script editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, and was considered to be a landmark episode in the show's history. Four possible suspects are seen leaving the Square in the early half of the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). As Michelle waits by their rendezvous point a car pulls up and finally the fluffy white legs of Roly the poodle bound out of the car, and give it all away: Den Watts is the man meeting Michelle and it was he who had fathered her baby. The rest of the episode consists of just one long scene, where Den and Michelle discuss whether or not to keep the baby. Up to that time it was the longest scene ever done in a soap-opera, lasting fifteen minutes. Mark Fowler Mark Fowler is an original regular character in the series starting February 1985 but becomes a semi-regular after his original portrayer David Scarboro was written out of the role in April 1985. Scarboro made brief returns to the role in 1986 and 1987. Scarboro committed suicide in April 1988. The role was recast in 1990, with Todd Carty taking the role. From this point the character is a permanent fixture in the series and Carty remained in the role until the character was written out of the series in early 2003. Mark starts out as a delinquent teenager, but returns to Walford a changed man when he was 22. Contracting HIV forces him to grow up fast and accept his responsibilities. He frequently finds it difficult to accept the restrictions of the illness, which finally claims his life in April 2004. Lofty Holloway Lofty Holloway, played by Tom Watt, is one of the serial's original characters, making his first appearance in the third episode, 26 February 1985. Lofty is generally depicted as a meek, luckless and hapless victim. A long running storyline concerns his relationship with the character Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Their unhappy marriage finally disintegrates after Michelle has an abortion, and Lofty leaves Walford for a new start. The character's final appearance is in the episode first aired on 19 April 1988. Lofty was one of the original twenty- three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Both felt that to help complete the community there was a need for a character in his early twenties. He had to be someone a bit different. Not brash and confident like a lot of the older men, and not boisterous like the younger ones. A loner, maybe someone forced to be a loner. A person who \\"stuck out like a sore thumb\\". Someone that was happiest in a group but still could not find one that he fit in with. Tony Holland had previously been in the army and found that ex-soldiers had these problems when they tried to reintegrate as civilians. So they decided that Lofty would be an ex-soldier, forced to quit because of his asthma. He was happiest in the army and felt incomplete without the group setting, the all-male camaraderie and even the security of the uniformity that the army provides. Terry Rich DS Terry Rich, played by Gary Whelan, first appears in the series on 26 February 1985 and makes his last appearance on 14 May 1987. He investigates the death of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton), who died the previous week, and his death is believed to be a murder. Rich, of the Walford CID, arrives in Albert Square to conduct an inquiry. The following week, a badge that Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) is wearing on his jumper catches the eye of Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton), who recognises it as one that he saw in Reg's collection of Nazi badges from the war. A few hours later, Rich arrives at The Queen Victoria where Lofty is tending bar and questions him about how he got the badge. Lofty reluctantly admits that he bought it from Mark Fowler (David Scarboro) for five pounds. When questioned by Rich, Mark insists that he found the badge on the street. However, a month into the investigation, Rich learns that Mark had obtained the badge from Nick Cotton (John Altman) and ransacked Nick's home to find the remains of Reg's collection along with other incriminating evidence. Nick then flees Walford, but is arrested the following month for Reg's murder, although he is never charged. Rich returns in 1987 to investigate the case of the 'Walford attacker', who has assaulted several female inhabitants of Albert Square. In April of that year, Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton), averts an attack using self-defence, which leads to the attacker's arrest. Rich is impressed with the way Debbie conducted herself so he asks her if she would help him out on some police business. Rich asks Debbie to go to a French restaurant with him on an undercover operation to expose French restaurants using English waiters. Debbie agrees, but whilst on their mock date they bond and when they return to The Queen Victoria they make a dinner date for the next night to a Chinese restaurant and they are soon inseparable. Debbie's flatmate, Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh), seems to dislike Rich immensely, but this does not perturb Debbie, and when Rich asks her to marry him, she gleefully accepts. The following month Rich is transferred to another division in Crawley, so Debbie decides to leave Walford with him. Tony Carpenter Tony Carpenter, played by Oscar James, is a jovial character, who tries to establish a successful business and steady home for his family, but nothing he does is ever good enough for his nagging wife. Tony is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Tony was originally intended to be named Alan, and his son Kelvin Carpenter was originally named Kevin. They are the first black characters to appear in the soap. Black and Asian characters were two ethnic minorities that had previously been under-represented in British soap before EastEnders aired. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had been at the forefront of the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their contacts to relay information about their origins and lifestyles and were then able to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically. Mary Smith Mary Smith, played by Linda Davidson, is a punk, and is Walford's original wild child. She often makes life difficult for herself due to her stubborn, defensive nature and she tends to feel that everyone around her is out to get her. In fact, Mary is her own worst enemy and most of her misfortune is down to her irresponsible behaviour and her inability to heed good advice. Mary Smith is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mary's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. As Holland and Smith wanted a diverse cross- section from the East End community, it was decided that one of the main cast had to be a young, single mother, and as punk music was prominent in British culture at the time, they decided to use a punk image for the character. Holland and Smith decided to cast an unknown actress in the role. They chose Linda Davidson, who was the right age and had been brought up in northern England and therefore had an accent that would befit the character's background. Annie Smith Annie Smith, played by Zara Posener and Jenna Alembick from 1985 to 1986 and by Samantha Crown from 1986 to 1988, is the young daughter of punk Mary Smith (Linda Davidson). Her father was a member of a punk group of which Mary was a groupie, and had no contact with her. Annie returned in 2019, played by Marilyn O'Brien. Annie, who was born prematurely, is three months old when she arrives, along with Mary, on 5 March 1985 and initially resides with her mother at 23b Albert Square. Mary is an incredibly irresponsible mother and Annie is always getting lumbered on neighbours when Mary gets tired of looking after her. Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) are the usual victims, but almost everyone on Albert Square has a turn of looking after Annie. Sue, in particular, grows extremely fond of Annie following the death of her son, Hassan Osman. After bottling up her grief for months, she is forced to hold little Annie, which finally allows her to acknowledge her pent-up sadness. Annie is once left alone in the launderette by accident while Mary goes drinking in The Queen Victoria pub. Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton) finds her and returns her to her mother, along with a few choice words for Mary. Mary also has a tendency to leave Annie home alone whilst she goes out to prostitute herself at night. On one such occasion, Annie throws her blanket at the electric fan heater, causing a fire. Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) rescues her but as a result, Annie is removed from Mary's care and given to her grandparents, Chris Smith (Allan O'Keefe) and Edie Smith (Eileen O'Brien), who live in Stockport. With the help of Mary's boyfriend, Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem), and Carmel Jackson (Judith Jacob), Annie is eventually reunited with her mother, although it takes a lot of persuading to make Edie return her, as she feels that Mary is not capable of caring for a young child. Annie spends Christmas Day 1987 in hospital after Chris, who is drunk, abducts her in an attempt to take her back to Stockport and crashes his car into a wall, though Annie is unharmed. Eventually, Mary decides to leave Albert Square for good with Annie in May 1988. Nearly 31 years later, Mary returns to Walford with Annie who is now 34 years old to attend the funeral of Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton). Whilst reminiscing with Dot, Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) and Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), Mary states that Annie works for the police force. They later light a candle in Dr Legg's memory before leaving Walford again. Kelvin Carpenter Kelvin Carpenter, played by Paul J. Medford, is an original EastEnders character. A bright spark and full of initiative, he opens several businesses in Albert Square and even forms a band. He is a bit of a heartbreaker in EastEnders early years, but he eventually has his heart broken in return, when his middle-aged girlfriend jilts him. Always a bit too intelligent for Walford, Kelvin eventually leaves for university and has since married a model wife and has become a songwriter. Kelvin Carpenter was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Kelvin was originally intended to be named Kevin, and his father Tony Carpenter was originally named Alan. They are the first black characters to appear in the soap. Andy O'Brien Andy O'Brien, played by Ross Davidson, is one of the original characters created for the series. Andy makes his appearance one month after the show first broadcast in March 1985. Portrayed as altruistic and middle-classed, Andy and his partner Debbie (Shirley Cheriton) are an attempt to represent gentrification of the East End. Despite Davidson claiming that there had been plans for his character, Andy became the first regular character in EastEnders to be killed off. Davidson claims this was due to an altercation between himself and Executive Producer and show creator, Julia Smith. His death scene aired in August 1986. Debbie Wilkins Debbie Wilkins, played by Shirley Cheriton is Walford's first upwardly mobile character. She has an on/off relationship with her ill-fated boyfriend Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Andy and she tend to be a bit too pretentious for the working class locals of Albert Square. Debbie Wilkins is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. The character of Debbie along with her boyfriend Andy are an attempt by Holland and Smith to represent the influx of upwardly mobile people that were opting to move to the usually working- class areas of the East End of London. Gentrification of the East End was on the increase in the 1980s, and in Holland's experience, the new, wealthier residents were never welcomed or truly accepted within the community, and this was what he hoped to convey on-screen with these two characters. Big Ron Big Ron, played by Ron Tarr, works in Walford market and appears as a background character from 1985 to 1997. Ron's first line in the series is, \\"All right, Den?\\", said to Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), five months after Ron first appears. His first credited appearance is episode 177, dated 28 October 1986, when he witnesses Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih) and his brother, Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer), arguing and asks Ali's wife, Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), if she needs any help. He is credited in the episode as \\"stall holder\\" and this is also the first time he is named as Ron in dialogue. Ron is involved in a few storylines, including helping his friend Pete Beale (Peter Dean) to intimidate rapist James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) into leaving the area, and having a heart attack after he is pushed by a mugger in the market. Richard Cole (Ian Reddington) gives Ron's pitch away, leading the other stall holders to rebel against him, until his boss orders him to give it back to Ron. In August 1994, Ron sells cheap wallpaper to Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), which falls off the walls overnight, so Arthur makes Ron help him put up new wallpaper. Ron joins The Queen Victoria football team as goalkeeper. He makes three saves during their first match, which they go on to win 2‚Äì0. The actor Ron Tarr died of cancer in October 1997 and was appearing in pre-recorded episodes several weeks after his death. To explain the character's absence, he was given an off-screen storyline in early 1998 where he wins ¬£500,000 on the National Lottery and emigrates to Spain. In a report about Tarr's death in the Daily Mirror, journalist Chris Hughes stated the character had \\"a cult following\\". Ron could have appeared in a special episode of the popular science fiction series, Doctor Who, entitled Dimensions in Time (1993). The episode was specially created as part of BBC's annual fund-raising event, Children in Need. Viewers were asked to phone in and vote which EastEnders character, Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) or Ron, would appear in the show and save The Doctor from certain death. Two versions were filmed for each voting outcome, but the Mandy version won with 56% of the vote.\\"Doctor Who & Children In Need\\", Den of Geek. Retrieved 22 July 2009. Chris Smith Chris Smith (initially credited as 'Man', then as Mary's father), played by Allan O'Keefe, is the father of Mary Smith (Linda Davidson). A haulage driver from Stockport, he is first seen in Walford in May 1985 when he comes to visit his wayward daughter. Mary (or Theresa as she was known to Chris) had left Stockport to escape her family, so she is not pleased when Chris arrives and tries to persuade her to return with him so he can help bring up her young daughter. After several ill-fated attempts, Mary sends him away. In 1987, Mary begins prostituting herself. She leaves her young baby, Annie Smith, at home alone while she works. On one occasion, Annie throws a blanket out of her cot straight on to an electric fan heater, causing a fire. Annie is rescued but Mary's neighbour, Dot Cotton (June Brown), phones Chris, who returns to Walford and takes Annie to live with him and his wife, Edie Smith (Eileen O'Brien), in Stockport. Mary's boyfriend, Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem), tries to help Mary sort her life out so she can get her daughter back. Even though Mary seems to be better, Edie has grown so attached to Annie that she is unwilling to relinquish care. By December, Chris finally decides that Annie should be reunited with Mary. Edie is unhappy about this and tells Chris that he can only come home when he brings Annie back. On Christmas Eve 1987, after desperately trying to convince Mary to return to Stockport, a very drunk Chris abducts Annie and tries to drive her home, only to crash into a wall at the local bed and breakfast on Bridge Street. Mary is forced to spend Christmas Day in hospital so Annie can be monitored. Chris desperately tries to make amends for his mistake, but she cannot forgive him until Annie is given the all clear later that day, so a jubilant Mary accepts her father's apology. In early 1988, Chris makes plans to open up a haulage company at a disused tyre shop in Albert Square, but finds out that his driving licence is to be suspended for 18 months following his drink driving accident. Nevertheless, he contacts his friend, Harry Jameson (Anthony Dutton) to go into partnership and even manages to persuade Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih) to provide some capital. However, Ali pulls out of the deal and Chris turns to alcohol, regularly drinking himself into a stupor to drown his sorrows. A concerned Mary then decides to contact her mother, who returns to Walford to help her husband. By May, Chris succeeds in opening the haulage company open by borrowing money from Walford Investments ‚Äì the money lending organisation of The Firm ‚Äì but the antics of his daughter, who starts to use drugs again and neglect Annie, cause further family strife. In a bid to help Mary out, Chris offers her a job at the haulage company but Mary gets annoyed by her parents' interference, and after sabotaging her father's office with paint, she and Annie leave Walford. Chris stays in Walford to run his business, employing Rod as a bookkeeper and Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) as lorry driver, although he is extremely unreliable. However, Chris is still short of drivers, so he starts doing deliveries himself, despite having a suspended licence. Darren Roberts (Gary McDonald), who had had several run-ins with Chris regarding the theft of his JCB earlier that year, informs the police that he is driving illegally and Chris is fined ¬£1000. This severely cripples his business and he is unable to repay his loan. Gregory Mantel (Pavel Douglas), a member of The Firm, then arrives on the Square, looking for Chris and forces him to sign the business over to The Firm, leaving Chris no choice but to return to Stockport. His last appearance is in August 1988. The premises of the haulage company are eventually bought by Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), who converts it into the car lot. Mehmet Osman Mehmet Osman, played by Haluk Bilginer, is a recurring character appearing from 1985 to 1989. Mehmet is portrayed as a charmer, rogue and a serial womaniser. He was conceptualised by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mehmet, the brother of original character Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), is part of a well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had been at the forefront of the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their social contacts to relay information about their own origins and lifestyles, which they say allowed them to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically. Hannah Carpenter Hannah Carpenter, played by Sally Sagoe, is the former wife of Tony Carpenter (Oscar James). She is a religious woman who is active in the Pentecostal Church but lost all tolerance for her fun- loving husband. After they agreed to divorce, their son, Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), moves to the Square to live with his father in February 1985, while their daughter, Cassie Carpenter (Delanie Forbes), stays with her mother. Hannah's first appearance in Walford is in June 1985 and throughout the year she shows up occasionally to converse with Tony about issues concerning their children. Hannah constantly looks down on Tony's lifestyle and career, so their meetings are never pleasant. When Hannah meets the smooth talking corporate lawyer, Neville Agard (Gordon Case), she invites him to move into her house. Eventually, Neville buys the house and they announce their intention to wed. However, when she discovers that Neville has a violent temper and has beaten her daughter with a riding whip, she confronts him and after a row results in violence she leaves him and turns up on Tony's doorstep at number 3 Albert Square in April 1986. Tony is furious and goes to confront Neville, returning later covered in blood. Hannah is adamant that she will not return to Neville, so she and Cassie come to live with Tony and they decide to try to give their marriage another chance. Their reconciliation is not a happy one and it is not long before Hannah had returns to her nagging ways. She is unhappy to be living in a house that is in the throes of renovation and she constantly harangues Tony to do better and try harder. She also manages to upset her children by trying to put a stop to her son's relationship with Carmel Roberts (Judith Jacob) and forcing Cassie to go to boarding school. In 1987 Hannah begins to become disillusioned with Walford after getting accosted by both Rezaul Kabir (Tanveer Ghani) and Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer). She is also stalked one night by a man known as the Walford attacker, who is guilty of assaulting several female inhabitants of the Square. Hannah is shaken but unharmed. She later relays to Tony that she fears that Mehmet is the culprit, because he had made a pass at her previously. Tony is furious, and he along with Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Pete Beale (Peter Dean) go to track Mehmet down and teach him a lesson. After Hannah witnesses her husband attacking Mehmet, she takes the moral high-ground and denounces his barbaric actions (Despite previously being happy for Tony to resort to violence against Neville). Hannah then decides that their marriage is over and so she leaves Walford in February that year to go and live with her sister in another part of London. She is not seen again. Dot Cotton Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Cotton (later Branning), played by June Brown, is the mother of original character Nick Cotton (John Altman). In a special episode entitled \\"Dot's Story\\" (2003), a young Dot is played by Tallulah Pitt-Brown in flashbacks. Dot first appears in EastEnders in July 1985, and has worked as a launderette assistant for most of that time along with original character Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Dot moved away with her son and his family in 1993. In reality, June Brown left the show in 1993, unhappy with the direction of Dot's characterisation. Brown returned to the role in 1997, and Dot is shown moving back to Albert Square, and has continued since that time. However, in April 2012, Brown took a six- month break from the show to write her memoirs.EastEnders Dot Cotton actress June Brown to take six months off to write her autobiography Ernie Mears Ernie Mears, portrayed by Ken Wynne, wooed Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) during the Second World War but after she married his good friend William Skinner (Ian Brimble), he disappeared from their lives. Many years later, Ernie confesses to Ethel that he fled because he feared that he would either go insane being around an unobtainable Ethel, or that they would do something to hurt William if their association had continued. When Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) becomes interested in learning to box in July 1985, Ethel joins him on his first trip to the gym, as boxing is her favourite sport. Ian's boxing coach, a retired light heavyweight champion, turns out to be Ernie, who at first thinks Ethel was Ian's mother. Upon learning that it is Ethel and that she is now widowed, Ernie asks her on a date and a few weeks later asks her to marry him. However, the offer is conditional. Ernie is allergic to dogs and Willy the pug, Ethel's constant companion for the past 9 years, would have to go. Ethel seriously considers Ernie's offer but gently declines, after which Ernie departs broken hearted again. His last appearance is on 15 August 1985. Martin Fowler Martin Fowler, played by Jon Peyton Price from 1985 to 1996, James Alexandrou from 1996 to 2007 and James Bye since 2014, is the younger son of Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) and Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), born in July 1985. His considerably older siblings are Mark Fowler (David Scarboro and Todd Carty) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully and Jenna Russell). Martin is the first baby to be born in the serial. His grandmother Lou (Anna Wing) is extremely fond of him, and insists that he is named after her late husband Albert. Pauline and Arthur are against this, and for several months the baby remains unnamed, although Lou continues to refer to him as Albert. The baby's name is finally revealed as Martin Albert Fowler at his christening in October 1985, which satisfies Lou. Martin grows up facing numerous family upsets, including his father's mental breakdown and imprisonment and his parents' temporary separation in 1993, which Martin takes badly. As Martin ages he becomes surly and increasingly troublesome. Detective Sergeant Quick Detective Sergeant Roy Quick, played by Douglas Fielding, is a police detective who appears in 51 episodes from episode 53, first shown on 20 August 1985, to episode 146, originally broadcast on 10 July 1986.

He fails at this, but finds the woman he wants to marry, Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton), who is seeing Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson) in an open relationship. Quick tries to woo Debbie, sending her bouquets of flowers. Andy becomes jealous of their friendship and tries to make them feel as uncomfortable as possible. After a few months of platonic dating, Quick asks Debbie to marry him. Wanting to stay independent, Debbie turns the him down, but Quick continues to pester her, saying that if he was married, it would improve his career. Eventually, Debbie ends the relationship and reunites with Andy. Quick then investigates a burglary at Dr Legg's surgery, for which he blames the victim for leaving a window open, and he angers the locals when he appears to be accusing innocent people, especially teenagers, of taking drugs. Debbie's rejection adds to Quick's dissatisfaction with the course his life has taken. He feels he is in a dead-end career with the police force and so he decides to leave to work for a security firm. Dr Legg then questions Quick's priorities, pointing out that the crime rate never went down since he arrived, so Quick accuses them of not helping the police, and his parting remarks to the citizenry in The Queen Victoria pub are, \\"You lot deserve each other, and you deserve what you've got, and what you've got is only the start!\\" His last appearance is in July 1986. Simon Wicks Simon Wicks, played by Nick Berry, appears between 1985 and 1990. Wicksy was introduced to take on some of the more adult storylines that had been scripted for another character, Mark Fowler; Mark's actor David Scarboro had left the serial prematurely due to personal problems. Wicksy was the soap's first male, pin-up and proved extremely popular with female fans. An early storyline sees Wicksy perform a song in the serial, \\"Every Loser Wins\\", which was subsequently released as a single in 1986 and reached number one in the UK singles chart. One of Wicksy's most prominent storylines is his adultery with Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins), and a subsequent feud with Cindy's husband Ian (Adam Woodyatt). Nick Berry quit the role in 1990, fearful of typecasting, and after five years on-screen, Wicksy departed in December that year. Sheena Mennell Sheena Mennell, played by Dulice Liecier, first appears on 15 October 1985 when her taxicab breaks down in Bridge Street and she wanders into the caf√© and asks Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) where she might find another one. Sue tells her that her husband, Ali (Nejdet Salih), might be able to take her where she needs to go and so Mary Smith (Linda Davidson), who is in the caf√© at the time, offers to show her the way to Number 23 Albert Square in search of Ali. When Ali cannot be found, Mary invites Sheena to wait in her flat above and they quickly become friends. Sheena had once been in a similar situation to Mary when she found herself pregnant and alone, although she opted to abort the baby, which she had always regretted. Mary is impressed that Sheena earned ¬£150 per week as a stripper. Weary of trying to live on the DSS payments she receives, Mary eagerly accepts Sheena's offer to help her find work as a stripper. Sheena also gives Mary dancing lessons. Whilst out working, Mary leaves her daughter, Annie, in Sheena's care, but she is caught by Sue 'entertaining' a man in Mary's room with Annie in close proximity. Sheena then leaves Annie alone while she goes for a drink in The Queen Vic with her guest. When Mary finds out about Sheena's behaviour she calls her a \\"sluttish bitch\\" and tells her that Annie could end up in care because of her irresponsible actions. This is the last time Sheena was seen. Guizin Osman Guizin Osman, played by Ishia Bennison, is the long suffering wife of the philandering Turkish Cypriot, Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer). She first arrives in Albert Square in October 1985 when she comes to inform her sister-in-law, Sue (Sandy Ratcliff), that her husband, Ali (Nejdet Salih), had gambled away the mortgage money for the home they were planning to buy. Guizin and her three children, Emine (Pelin Ahmet), Rayif and Murat, later move in with her brother-in-law and his family in 1987, after her husband gambles away their home and deserts them. She works for Ali and Sue in the caf√© for a few months until her husband returns and she becomes a partner in the business. As part owner of the caf√©, she hires Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who later becomes the sole owner. Guizin and Mehmet's marriage is highly turbulent and they are always involved in intense arguments, mainly concerning money and gambling. Guizin is well aware of Mehmet's flaws and adultery, but unlike Sue, she is willing to turn a blind eye to most of her husband's dealings to keep the marriage together because, in her community, that's what a wife is expected to do. Guizin may put up with a lot from Mehmet, but she is certainly no pushover, and is more than willing to defend herself and her family if anyone should cross her. She has numerous rows with Sue over the years and she nearly comes to blows with Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) after she informs her that Mehmet had been trying to seduce her on New Year's Eve 1987. Yet more animosity arises when she discovers that Mehmet has been sleeping with prostitute Mary Smith (Linda Davidson), but although Guizin gets extremely angry, she ends up forgiving Mehmet for the sake of the family. However, there is one affair that Guizin is not willing to forgive Mehmet for, and it happens to be the only one that he did not actually have. After Sue discovers that Ali had slept with Donna Ludlow, she kisses Mehmet in front of Ali for revenge, causing a huge fight between the brothers. Ali tells Guizin about Sue and Mehmet's suspected affair, making Guizin furious. She viciously attacks Mehmet in the middle of the Square and leaves for Northern Cyprus, taking her children with her. Her last appearance is in March 1989. Mehmet leaves England soon after to attempt to patch up their relationship. Bennison has \\"mixed memories\\" about her role in EastEnders, commenting in 2003: \\"it was the start of the soap and the fame was very instant for everybody. You're in everybody's front room and everyone feels they own a bit of you. I'll never forget having to sign people's sickbags on the hovercraft to France. My daughter wouldn't walk down the street with me at the time. She would stay 10 paces behind. I still get recognised from EastEnders. I can't believe it.\\" Cassie Carpenter Cassie Carpenter, played by Delanie Forbes, made her first appearance on 14 November 1985. She is the daughter of Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe) and Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) and the younger sister of Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford). In an early episode, before Cassie appears, she is referred to as being 14 years old, but when Cassie is introduced, she is 11 years old. Cassie's parents are separated and she initially resides with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, a corporate lawyer named Neville Agard (Gordon Case). Cassie first appears in November 1985 when she comes to visit her father in Albert Square. Cassie loves her father and finds her parents' separation difficult, particularly as she does not get on with Neville. In April 1986, Hannah and Cassie arrive on Tony's doorstep with the disturbing news that Neville has been beating Cassie with a riding whip. After Tony fights with Neville, both Hannah and Cassie then come to live in Walford with Tony and Kelvin, and Cassie is delighted when her parents have decided to give their marriage another chance. Cassie is a mischievous youngster who, like her brother, is bright. In May 1986 she gets into trouble with her school for bullying another girl, and is in even more trouble with her parents for trying to hide it from them. Tony later catches her smoking cannabis, which she has stolen from Owen Hughes (Philip Brook), a friend of Mark Fowler's (David Scarboro). Tony is furious and the Carpenters refuse to speak to any of the Fowler family because of it. After a subsequent meeting with Cassie's headmaster, Hannah decides that the only solution is to send Cassie away to boarding school. Cassie is against the idea but nevertheless, she is sent away in September that year. A few weeks later the Carpenters hear news that Cassie has run away from school and is nowhere to be found. She is discovered the following day, stealing food from Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and Lofty Holloway's (Tom Watt) kitchen in Albert Square, and returns to the school. Cassie appears infrequently after this, and plays a Herald Angel in the Walford Nativity play on Christmas Eve 1986 and the following day when she, Kelvin and his friends play charades. This is her last appearance, but after her parents attempt at a reconciliation fails, Hannah leaves Walford and Cassie goes to live with her. Tony visits her occasionally, before leaving Walford, too, in 1987. Winston Winston is an extra character who is portrayed by Ulric Browne, with his first on-screen appearance being in episode 81, originally shown on 26 November 1985. However, he is not credited for his role until later on in the series. His first line is \\"Bloody pedestrians\\", said to Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), who gets in Winston's way when he is riding a bicycle. Winston owns the music stall in Walford's Bridge Street Market, and over the years he proves to be a great friend to his fellow long-standing stall-holder, Mark Fowler (Todd Carty). His highlights include shaving his tuft of hair off for charity and helping Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) arrive at her birthday party on the night she dies. He is angry when Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) car crashes into his stall in October 2006. Winston is always willing to help when other market traders are called away, for example, to appear in a key development of a current plot, e.g. when Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) needs someone to guard her clothing stall while she and Max Branning (Jake Wood) slip into an unguarded bedroom to continue the next episode in their illicit affair. Winston generally appears at events held by other Walford residents, such as weddings, funerals and parties or briefly in the background of a scene. He attends the funerals of Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) and Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb), stag parties for Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves), Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) and Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), Jean Slater's (Gillian Wright) birthday party and Ricky and Bianca Jackson's (Patsy Palmer) wedding. Sometimes characters steal DVDs or CDs from his stall, including Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick). In April 2008, Winston's niece Keisha (Suzie McGrath) arrives in Walford, and leaves a month later with Gus Smith (Mohammed George). Winston wins a Children in Need raffle in The Queen Victoria in November 2008, and in July 2009, Stacey Slater offers him a flower but he refuses. He also appears with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) getting drunk in Ian's chip shop in June 2009 and is seen drunk again in August 2009. He is seen with Tracey (Jane Slaughter) in August 2009 talking about Max and Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), and in November 2009 Ian invites him for drinks at The Queen Vic but he refuses. On 15 June 2010, Winston has a speaking role as he is seen engaging in a minor conversation with Max. On 2 November 2010, he has another minor speaking role asking for 3 drinks at the newly reopened Queen Vic. In April 2011, during the screening of the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in The Queen Vic, Winston accidentally rips the cord from the television electrical plug, much to the dismay of the patrons. In January 2012, Winston is distracted by Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) in a bright outfit and accidentally knocks over a ladder, which nearly hits her. In May 2012, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) buys a CD from Winston for her mother Tanya. However, Lauren's grandmother Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) misinterprets the exchange and believes that Lauren is buying alcohol from Winston. In July 2012, Winston is chosen as the defender in The Queen Vic's football team. In August 2013, he locks market inspector Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel) in a portable toilet as a joke, but Bianca and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) are blamed. He has another speaking role in April 2014 when he asks Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) for a black armband, as a mark of respect for the recently deceased Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) (see Who Killed Lucy Beale?).

Bacsik is particularly notable for having given up Barry Bonds' 756th career home run on August 7, 2007, which broke the all-time record formerly held by Hank Aaron. Bacsik is the son of Michael James Bacsik, who pitched in the majors from ‚Äì. Baseball career = Early years = Bacsik was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 18th round (543rd overall) in the Major League Baseball draft. He was in his sixth minor league season with the Indians organization before making his debut on August 5, . He was supposed to be serving mop-up duty, as the Seattle Mariners had opened up a huge lead on the Indians. He was knocked around at first and settled in. The Indians rallied from 12 runs down to win the game in extra innings. Bacsik had a 9.00 ERA in three relief appearances (9 innings) in 2001. On December 11, 2001, as part of a big trade, Bacsik was traded along with Roberto Alomar and Danny Peoples to the New York Mets for Matt Lawton, Alex Escobar, Jerrod Riggan, Earl Snyder, and Billy Traber. On July 5, , he got his first big league win when he made his debut with the Mets. He would later go on to have a 3-2 record with a 4.37 ERA in the season. He spent just two seasons with the Mets before becoming a free agent on October 15, 2003. Two months later, on December 23, 2003, Bacsik signed a contract with the Texas Rangers (incidentally, the team where his father was a member when he was born). He spent most of the season with the Oklahoma Redhawks, the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate. He made just three starts in 2004 for the big league club, going 1-1 with a 4.60 ERA. He became a free agent after the 2004 season and signed a contract on November 18, 2004, with the Philadelphia Phillies. However, he spent the whole season with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, the Phillies' Triple-A team. He opted for minor league free agency after the 2005 season. He signed a contract with the Washington Nationals on February 9, , with an invitation to spring training. He made just one start in spring training and gave up six runs in 0.2 innings before getting cut in April. Afterwards, he signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He had an impressive minor league season with the Diamondbacks' Triple-A team, the Tucson Sidewinders, in which he went a perfect 11-0 with a 2.79 ERA in 28 games (10 starts). =2007= Bacsik became a free agent after the 2006 season and later signed another minor league contract with the Washington Nationals on November 6, 2006. He did not make the major league team when the Nationals broke camp and started with the Columbus Clippers, the Nationals' Triple-A team. After the Nationals found themselves with four of their five starting pitchers on the disabled list, Bacsik and other pitchers were brought up from their farm system. Despite a record of 1-3 and a 4.00 ERA with Columbus (and an ERA of 5.26 as a starter), Bacsik made his debut with the Nationals on May 19, throwing six shutout innings in a game the Nats eventually lost. In his following start, he pitched 7.2 innings, his longest outing of the year including the minors, allowing three runs and earning his first win in the majors since August 4, 2004. He did not miss a start in the rotation after his last callup until he was sent to the bullpen and went 5-8 with a 5.11 ERA in 20 starts and nine relief appearances. On August 7, , Bacsik sealed his name in baseball history as he gave up career home run number 756 to Barry Bonds, who broke the 33-year-old record for total career home runs previously held by Hank Aaron. During the post-home run celebration, Bacsik tipped his cap to Bonds in a gesture of respect. He visited the Giants clubhouse to personally congratulate Bonds on his achievement, and Bonds gave Bacsik an autographed bat that read: \\"To Mike, God Bless. Barry Bonds.\\"The Official Site of The Washington Nationals: News: Nationals watch record with wonder Coincidentally, Bacsik's father had faced Aaron (as a pitcher for the Texas Rangers) after Aaron had hit his 755th home run. On August 23, , Michael James Bacsik held Aaron to a single and a fly out to right field. The younger Bacsik commented later, \\"If my dad had been gracious enough to let Hank Aaron hit a home run, we both would have given up 756.\\"Pitcher's father faced Hank, Associated Press August 8, 2007, Lexington Herald-Leader p B5. =Later years= On October 26, 2007, the Washington Nationals signed Bacsik to a non- guaranteed minor league contract with an invitation to spring training.The Official Site of The Washington Nationals: News: Nats sign Bacsik to Minors contract After spring training, on March 5, 2008, the Nationals reassigned Bacsik to minor league camp,The Official Site of The Washington Nationals: Team: Transactions and he was assigned to Triple-A Columbus. He became a free agent at the end of the season. In 2011, Bacsik pitched for the Fort Worth Cats, an independent club, in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball.  Media career  Following his playing career, Bacsik has had a long-running media career in sports. A former intern at Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) radio station KTCK (\\"Sportsradio 1310 The Ticket\\") for the BaD Radio Show prior to beginning his MLB career, Bacsik later served as the show producer on \\"The Ticket\\" for midday host Norm Hitzges and performed other fill-in on-air host duties. He gave the BaD Radio Show many interviews both before and after giving up Bonds' record breaking home run, at one point claiming he would \\"give up the home run to Bonds\\" to be immortalized in baseball history. Bacsik was fired by KTCK in late April 2010 for offensive comments he made on Twitter. During the 2007 MLB postseason, Bacsik worked as an analyst for ESPN. Bacsik currently serves as a color analyst for select college baseball games on Fox Sports Southwest and Fox College Sports. During the 2012 college baseball season, he served as the baseball analyst for broadcasts of TCU baseball on The Mountain, the official Mountain West Conference cable TV channel. He also carried that role into the 2013 season, serving as a color analyst for TCU games on Fox Sports Southwest and Fox College Sports. He currently serves as co-host on the K&C; Masterpiece show on DFW radio station KRLD (105.3 The Fan). Twitter controversy Bacsik made offensive comments on his Twitter account following the loss of the Dallas Mavericks to the San Antonio Spurs in game 4 of the first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs. The comments, most notably \\"Congratulations to all the dirty Mexicans in San Antonio,\\" quickly circulated on social networks online before Bacsik deleted the comments. The following Monday, on April 26, 2010, Bacsik was suspended indefinitely from his KTCK duties by owner Cumulus Media for \\"comments [that] were unacceptable and offensive, and are inconsistent with the core values of KTCK and Cumulus.\\" The next day, Bacsik was fired by The Ticket. Personal Bacsik married Sue Myers in February 2000. He has a daughter, Mary Grace, and a son, Jacob Ryan. Bacsik later announced on KTCK that he and his wife were expecting their third child.

Edwards Bridge , also referred to as the Wando River Bridge, is a pair of pre-cast post-tensioned concrete box girder bridges that span the Wando River between Mount Pleasant and Daniel Island on Interstate 526 (I-526) in South Carolina. The bridge was designed by Figg Bridge Engineers and is owned and maintained by the South Carolina Department of Transportation. The bridge is named for James B. Edwards, who was a governor of South Carolina, Secretary of Energy, and long-time president of the Medical University of South Carolina. Construction The bridge was constructed of pre-cast concrete segments using top-down construction. Segments were transported along already completed spans and put in place from above. This construction method was selected to reduce construction impacts on the marsh areas along the banks of the Wando River.Kohls, Amy R. and D. Brice Urquhart, Design Challenges and Construction Benefits of Precast Segmental Rail Bridges, Accessed April 20, 2007. The bridge is designed and built to accommodate six lanes of traffic with narrow shoulders, and has been used for four since opening. The construction contractor was T.L. James Associates of Louisiana. The bridge has a history of issues that arose during or from the construction. Allegations about the workmanship led to a year-long investigation which found no issues. The construction contract ended in countersuits with the SCDOT suing for delays and the contractor suing for design deficiencies. This resulted in a $4.9 million settlement paid to the contractor. Aluminum expansion joints installed on the bridge failed within four years, which required SCDOT to install replacements at a cost of $2 million. And the profile of the bridge deck would cause discomfort (vertical pitching of motorists). 2018 Post- tensioning failure A failure of post-tensioning cables, which are inside the box girder of the bridge, caused a closure of the westbound spans mid-day on May 14, 2018. Weekly inspections of the 92 cables inside the bridge had been occurring since a repair project in 2016.Knapp, Andrew and Jackson, Angie, May 14, 2018.

Archived version On Sunday May 20, 2018 the eastbound lanes were altered to allow two-way traffic while repairs to the westbound side take place. The westbound span reopened to traffic on June 2, 2018. A 2800-page November 28, 2018 engineering report provided fourteen recommendations which will be implemented to ensure the bridge meets its design life of 75 years. The recommendations include the installation of redundant post-tensioning cables.

The site was later used as a military command centre, and is now being converted into a museum. Stone was extracted from the quarry until 1914. During the Second World War, the Royal Air Force (RAF) built a Fighter Command operations room in the quarry. In 1952, during the Cold War, this facility was expanded into a central coordination facility for radar stations throughout Scotland. The military authorities closed the site and in 1983 and transferred ownership to the local council. The site was subsequently vandalized and damaged by fire. The site is now being cleaned and restored with the goal of creating a local Cold War museum and education centre. The project is being undertaken by volunteers, with funding from the owners of Scotland's Secret Bunker, another disused bunker now run as a tourist attraction. History Inside Barnton Quarry Bunker during restoration in 2018 Barnton Quarry produced stone until 1914. then in 1942 was used as a RAF fighter command operations room. A bunker was built in 1952 as the SOC (Sector Operations Centre) for correlating information from ROTOR radar stations throughout Scotland. The bunker comprises three underground levels and a large surface building which pre- dates the underground structure. The site was re-designated as a Regional Seat of Government in the early 1960s. The bunker was kept ready to accommodate 400 politicians and civil servants for up to 30 days. It remained operational until the early 1980s. Ownership was transferred to Lothian Regional Council in 1983. The Council sold the site in the late 1980s to a private property developer. The underground structure was damaged by fire in August 1991 and again in May 1993. The site was purchased by James Mitchell, Owner of Scotland's Secret Bunker. Since 2011, a team of volunteers has helped with renovation efforts. The aim is to create a museum and education centre with a view to restoring the R4 bunker to the original 1952 configuration.

The rituals and myths of this primitive rite of passage centered upon an ancient threat of cannibalism and the possibility of a werewolf transformation for the epheboi (adolescent males) who were the participants. The festival occurred yearly, probably at the beginning of May.Arthur Bernard Cook, Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion I (Cambridge: Cambridge UP) 1914 (on- line excerpt) citing P. Welzel, De Iove et Pane dis Arcadicis (Bratislava 1879) p. 23 n. 5, on the strength of Xen. 1. 2. 10 (at Peltai) and Walter Immerwahr, Die Kulte und Mythen Arkadiens (Leipzig 1891) pp. 20f. The epithet Lykaios (\\"wolf-Zeus\\") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the Lykaia, which was the main Arcadian festival. Zeus had only a formal connection as patron of the ritual. In the founding myth, of Lycaon's\\"He is related to the wolf even in his name, Lykaon.\\" (Burkert, 1983:86). banquet for the gods that included the flesh of a human sacrifice,Pseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheke, 3.98-3.99. perhaps one of his sons, NyctimusAccording to Lycophron and others. or his grandson, Arcas,According to Catasterismi, following a lost reference of Hesiod. Zeus overturned the table and struck the house of Lycaon with a thunderbolt;Some versions of the story of the Deluge were initiated by this episode, e.g. Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheke 3.98-3.99), Ovid (Metamorphoses, 1.240ff), Hyginus (Fabula, 176). his patronage at the Lykaia can have been little more than a formula.A morphological connection to lyke \\"brightness\\" may be merely fortuitous, but see Cook 1914:63-69 \\"Zeus L√Ωkaios: Wolf-god or Light-god?\\" Long afterward, in the late 3rd century CE, the philosopher Porphyry reportedPorphyry. On Abstinence that Theophrastus had compared the sacrifice \\"at the Lykaia in Arcadia\\" with Carthaginian sacrifices to Moloch. The ritual was nocturnal, to judge from the name of Nyctimus (nyx, \\"night\\") that was given to the son of Lycaeus who was killed and served up as part of the feast to Zeus. Rumors of the ceremony that circulated among other Greeks revolved around the theme of human sacrifice and cannibalism: according to Plato, a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to Zeus Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal's. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended.Plato, Republic, 565d-e. The traveller Pausanias told of an Olympic boxing champion Damarchus of Parrhasia, who had \\"turned into a wolf at the sacrifice to Zeus Lykaios, and changed back into a man again in the ninth year thereafter\\",Pausanias. Description of Greece, 6.8.2. from which Walter Burkert affirms that, for Damarchus to have successfully participated at least nine years later, the participants in the ritual feast must have been ephebes.Burkert, \\"Lykaia and Lykaion\\", Homo Necans, tr. by Peter Bing (University of California) 1983:86ff. There were several sites. At the summit on Mount Lykaion Pausanias saw the ash-pile altar to ZeusFor primitive ash mounds at sacrificial sites, see W. Kramer, \\"Pr√§historische Brandopferpl√§tze\\" Helvetica antiqua (1966) pp. 111-22, noted by Burkert 1983. but, as attending the rite was impossible, he was obliged to \\"let it be as it is and as it was from the beginning\\".Pausanias. Description of Greece, 8.38.7. Near the ancient ash-heap where the sacrifices took place was a forbidden precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast. Anyone who entered would have to be sacrificed.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 8.38.6. There was the cave of Rhea, the Kretaia, where, according to local legend, Zeus was born and was cared for by the nymphs. There were games associated with the satisfactory completion of the Lykaia,Inscription, IG 5.2.549 (Syll3.314) : English Translation which removed in the 4th century to Megalopolis; when it was founded in 371 BCE, Megalopolis was the first urbanization in rustic Arcadia; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios, though the Arcadians continued to sacrifice on the mountain-top to Pausanias' day (2nd century CE). Modern archaeologists have found no trace of human remains among the sacrificial detritus,Burkert 1983, p. 90; the recent archaeology has found many animal bones in the ash-heap altar, but still no human ones. but recent discoveries at the mountain-top ash-heap altar that Pausanias saw but was reluctant to pry into, reveal that it was much older than the Classical Greeks themselves realised. Early 20th century excavations at the site had revealed nothing earlier than ca. 700 BCE, but the Greek- American interdisciplinary Mt. Lykaion Excavation and Survey Project excavated a trench and detected ritual presence at the site at the beginning of the third millennium BCE,Early Helladic pottery sherds were recovered; finds showed the site was in unbroken use to the Hellenistic period. a thousand years before Zeus was worshiped in Greece.(Science Daily) \\"\\"New Discoveries At The Ash Altar Of Zeus Offer Insights Into Origins Of Ancient Greece's Most Powerful God\\", 28 January 2008 Accessed 16 July 2008. A Late Minoan rock crystal seal bearing the image of a bull was a notable surprise. Apollo Lykaios The god Apollo as worshipped in the cultic practices on Mount Lykaion was referred to as Apollo Lykaios. Much scholarly debate continues on the nature of the epithet \\"Lykaios\\" beyond its geographical and cultic significance. Assertions as to Apollo having an archaic wolf-form are speculative at best (and likely based on historically contested etymologies). The figure of Apollo Lykaios should not be confused, however, with the famous Apollo Lyceus, the distinctive statue type of the god that was displayed in the Lyceum in Athens where Aristotle taught. This figure is completely unrelated to Apollo Lykaios. Likewise, Lycian Apollo refers to the Apollo cult in the Anatolian kingdom of Lycia, across the Aegean, and not Lykaia. Lykaian Pan A sanctuary of Pan was also located upon the mountain.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 8.38.5. According to tradition, Euandros, son of Hermes, led a colony from Pallantion in Arkadia into Italy, where he built a town Pallantion on the Palatine, and introduced the cult of Pan L√Ωkaios and the festival of the Lykaia, which later became the major Roman festival of Lupercalia.Cook 1914, (on-line excerpt), citing Kourouniotes via Pauly-Wissowa Real-Enc. vi. 839ff. Modern Lykaia The lighting of the flame at Lykaia in August 2005 In 1973, the Ano Karyes Association \\"Lykaios Dias\\" established the modern Lykaia, which are held every four years on the same place as the ancient games. The motto of these games is \\"Stefanites and not Chrimatites\\" (Greek: \\"Œ£œÑŒµœÜŒ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒµœÇ\\" Œ∫Œ±Œπ œåœáŒπ \\"ŒßœÅŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒØœÑŒµœÇ\\"), meaning that the purpose of these games is solely the moral perfection of man and not rewarding the winners with pecuniary means. Modern Lykaia are usually held in the beginning of August. The games begin with the lighting of the flame on the Arcadian's sacred peak. The Estiades of Mount Lykaion, making their appearance from the north, bring the Arcadian's eternal flame. The first Estiada walks slowly towards the southern pillar base (where two golden eagles were placed in ancient times) and lights the torch. The head priestess recites the Lycean Ode by Pindarus and then gives the torch to an athlete named as torch-bearer. The torch-bearer then runs into the stadium and lights the altar which is placed there. The closing ceremony includes cultural events, the lowering of the flag and the playing of the Greece's national anthem. The winner of each athletic event is awarded with an olive branch, a cup, a tripod, a medal or a diploma. All the athletes who participated-regardless of their performance- receive a certificate of participation, thus justifying the Games' motto. The last Lykaia were held from the 29th of July to the 7th of August 2005. The next games took place in the summer of 2009.The next games will take place from 27 July to the 4th of August 2013.On the last day(4 August) the athletic events of track and field will take place at the mountain stadium.

In the film the British characters of the original book were changed into Americans in order to attract American audiences. Carl Foreman wrote, produced and directed the epic. He called it a \\"personal statement\\" about the futility of war. Both victor and vanquished are losers.Cinema: Up in Arms for Peace, Time Magazine, 20 December 1963 The film slips between Path√©- style newsreel footage showing the conquering heroes abroad for the audience at home, and the grim reality of battlefield brutality and post-conflict ennui. No battle scenes are depicted in the film. The story is told in a series of short vignettes, each having a beginning and an ending in itself, though all are connected to the others, as a series of short stories adding up to a longer one. Atypically of Hollywood interpretations of the Second World War at the time, the depiction of American GIs shows soldiers worn out by battle, weary of conflict and capable of casual cruelty towards outsiders and also to other Americans. In one vignette a group of white American soldiers attack and brutally beat two black American soldiers. Others show American military personnel (star George Peppard) becoming players in the \\"black market,\\" although Peppard goes back to his unit when he sees them leaving for the front, and Americans and Russians alike exploiting German women sexually. The hostility of German civilians towards their American and Soviet occupiers is also depicted. One of the cinematic high points is the detour of one truckload of GIs out of a convoy, for the express purpose of supplying witnesses to the execution by firing squad of a GI deserter (a scene inspired by the real-life 1945 execution of Pvt. Eddie Slovik). Depicted in a huge, otherwise empty, snow-covered field near a chateau at Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines on Christmas Eve, while the film audience first hears Frank Sinatra singing \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and then a chorus of \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\", after the fatal shots are fired. This scene is remarkable for its stark, visually extreme imagery, and the non-combat stress and anguish foisted on GIs during a lull in combat. The New York Times film review stated \\"it stands out in stark and sobering contrast to the other gaudier incidents in the film\\".The Grim Message of War: Foreman's 'The Victors' at Two Theaters, by Bosley Crowther, New York Times, 20 December 1963 The whole film is shot in black and white, and so the black regimented figures of the firing squad and witnesses face the lone man bound to a stake in the midst of a snow-covered plain. The addition of surreal accompanying Christmas music and absence of dialogue make this scene an often cited one. The juxtaposition of saccharine music with a frightful scene was emulated the following year by Stanley Kubrick in Dr. Strangelove, which was also shot in black and white. An anti- war message also unusual for the time period - and particularly regarding America's involvement in the Second World War - is found in the final vignette. An American soldier (co-star George Hamilton) stationed in post-war Berlin picks a fight with a drunken Soviet soldier (Albert Finney), possibly to avenge the rape of his German girlfriend by Soviet soldiers during the Battle of Berlin. The fight ends with each man killing the other and the camera slowly pulls back to show the bodies of the two one-time allies lying in the shape of a V for Victory in a seemingly limitless desert of rubble and ruins. Plot An American infantry squad is sent to Italy including Sergeant Craig, and Corporals Trower and Chase, and GI Baker. The squad take possession of a small town in Sicily. Craig has to stop his men from looting. Baker strikes up a relationship with Maria, a young mother whose soldier husband is missing. They talk to a Sikh soldier. At another stop, white American soldiers beat up black American soldiers in a bar. The squad then transfer to France. Craig spends the evening with a Frenchwoman who is terrified by bombing raids. The men help liberate a concentration camp. In Ostend Trower meets Regine, a violinist, and falls in love with her. However she leaves him for a sleazy pimp, Eldridge. The men observe an American soldier be executed for desertion. Chase has a relationship with Magda, who suggests he desert and join her in the black market. He refuses, rejoins his unit, and is wounded in the leg. A newcomer to the group, Weaver, adopts a dog. But when the unit pulls out, his fellow soldier, Grogan, shoots it dead. When Chase gets out of hospital in England he is stuck at a bus stop in the rain. A man, Dennis, invites him in to have tea with his family. He has a pleasant time but when he visits Craig in hospital, he discovers Craig has had most of his face blown off. The war in Europe ends. In 1946 Trower lives in the Russian zone of Berlin. He's in love with Helga whose parents he provides with imported goods. Helga's sister has been sleeping with Russians. Trower gets in a fight with a drunken Russian soldier. Neither understand each other, and the two men pull knives and stab each other to death.

Original novel The film was based on the book The Human Kind, which was published in 1953.'England's Chicago Tribune' Strout, Richard L. The Observer 4 March 1951: 5. It was the third in a trilogy of autobiographical war works from Alexander Baron, the first two being From the City, From the Plough and There's No Home.

Saul Bass created the opening montage and title sequence that covers European history from the First World War to the Battle of Britain in the Second World War. The end credit reads \\"Photographed on locations in Italy, France, England and Sweden, with the kind co-operation of the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps and at Shepperton Studios, England.\\" Release =Censorship= The Victors was cut by about 20 minutes within a few weeks of opening. The version in circulation (to the extent that it is circulating at all) is 154 minutes (see Leonard Maltin's Film & Video Guide). Among the sequences cut was one where an 11 year old boy, Jean Pierre, propositions the American soldiers to exchange sex for food money. The Hollywood Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, insisted that several scenes be deleted. While the Code had been gradually liberalised in the 1950s-early 1960s, homosexuality was still something that could only be, vaguely, implied in order to get approval from the Hollywood Production Code and the Catholic Legion of Decency. American film executives encouraged Foreman to include a nude scene with Elke Sommer, already in the version released in Europe and Britain, when he submitted it for a Production Code seal. This was to be used as a bargaining chip in case of any other objections. Foreman submitted the more modest version of the scene that had been shot for the American market and the film was passed without incident. =Box Office= The film was a box office disappointment. George Hamilton argued it \\"was way too dark, foreshadowing the great paranoid movies of the later sixties, ahead of the bad times that seemed to begin with the Kennedy assassination.\\"George Hamilton & William Stadiem, Don't Mind If I Do, Simon & Schuster 2008 p 177 Awards The film was nominated for a Golden Globe (Most Promising Newcomer, actor Peter Fonda). Paperback novelization In November 1963, Dell Publishing issued a novelization of the screenplay by critic, author and war veteran Milton Shulman. The book's presentation is idiosyncratic, as it is both unabashedly a tie-in edition, yet seems to cautiously sidestep labeling itself an adaptation of the script per se (though within Shulman's sensitively internalized retelling, it is quite faithful to the film's dialogue and structure). Both the cover and title page proclaim \\"Carl Foreman's The Victors\\" under which the byline is \\"by Milton Shulman, based on The Human Kind by Alexander Baron.\\" bypassing mention of the actual screenplay. It is unknown whether Dell bid for the publishing rights and commissioned the novelization, or if Foreman engineered its publication. The latter would seem the more likely, given Foreman's possessive over-the-title billing, and that the short story collection providing the source of the screenplay is itself an established work of fiction. What does seem clear is that Baron himself was approached to write the novelization, and that he declined‚Äîpossibly because, with the Americanization of the characters, he felt the novel's authorship should have a genuinely American voice‚Äîbut nonetheless wanted to select the author and supervise. That he did so can be extrapolated from the copyright registration: The copyright is assigned to Baron, with a notation that he engaged Shulman to write the book as a work for hire. The resultant novelization sold well enough to earn at least a second print run, indicated on that identical edition's copyright page, issued in January 1964.

Democratic Congressman Howard Berman introduced the House of Representatives bill on April 18, 2007. Democratic Party Senator Patrick Leahy introduced the Senate bill on April 18, 2007. The bill passed the house but died in the Senate. The bills broadly resembled the proposed Patent Reform Act of 2005 which would have enacted many of the proposals recommended by a 2003 report by the Federal Trade Commission Federal Trade Commission, To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy, A Report by the Federal Trade Commission, October 2003 (pdf) and a 2004 report by the National Academy of Sciences.National Research Council (U.S.).

Myers, editors, 2004, Similar acts were introduced as the Patent Reform Act of 2009 in the 111th Congress and as the America Invents Act in the 112th.  Proposed changes in U.S. patent law  In certain respects, H.R. 1908 and S. 1145 would have made American patent law more similar to patent laws of many other countries. H.R. 1908 proposed the following changes in U.S. patent law: = Switch from first to invent to first to file = In 2007, the United States was the only country in the world that gave priority to the application that claims the earliest invention date, regardless of which application arrives first. The first-to-invent system is thought to benefit small inventors, who may be less experienced with the patent application system.Coster, page 10 Critics of the first-to-file system also contend it would create a \\"race to the mailbox,\\" and would result in sloppier, last-minute patent applications. However, the first-to-invent system requires the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to undertake lengthy and complicated \\"interference\\" proceedings to try to determine who invented something first when claims conflict. The first-to-file system, supporters contend,Gholz, page 1 would inject much-needed certainty into the patent application process. Finally, because every other country is on a first-to-file system, supporters claim that the majority of patent applicants and attorneys are already operating on a first-to-file basis.Coster, page 9 =Damages= The version of the bill that passed the House contained dramatic changes to the way damages are determined when a court determines that an accused infringer has indeed infringed.Amy Landers for Patently-O. Apr 29, 2007 2007 Patent Reform: Proposed Amendments on Damages The bill specifically limited royalty recovery to the \\"economic value properly attributable to patent's specific contributions over the prior art,\\"‚Äîthat is, the inventive portion of the claim, as opposed to the whole claim. The bill additionally required a detailed record to be created of the basis for determining damages, presumably for use during appeal procedures, and finally, the bill created new limitations on when the whole market value of an infringing product was used as the royalty base. = Other proposed provisions = The bill would also have made the following changes: *Defining \\"inventor\\" to include a joint inventor and coinventor. *Revising procedures for patent interference disputes. *Revising requirements for an inventor's oath or declaration to allow substitute statements in specified circumstances (e.g., death or disability) and supplemental and corrected statements. *Allowing a third party assignee (other than the inventor) or a person with a proprietary interest to file a patent application. *Modifying provisions relating to damages for patent infringement to: *# require a court to conduct an analysis of a patent's specific contribution over prior art; *# allow increased damages for willful patent infringement; and *# expand the prior user defense. *Renaming the Board of Patent Appeals as the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. (Also, revising provisions relating to the Board's composition, duties, and authorities). *Establishing an administrative procedure at the USPTO allowing a person who is not the patent owner to challenge the validity of an issued patent (post-grant review). Would also set forth procedures for the consideration of such petitions, including provisions to prevent harassment of patent owners and abuse of process. *Allowing third parties to submit documents relevant to the examination of a patent application. *With respect to infringement litigation, revising venue requirements to allow actions to be brought in the judicial district where either party resides (in 2007, allowed only where the defendant resides) or where the corporation has its principal place of business or was incorporated. *Banning tax planning patents. *Preventing enforcement of patents covering digital check collection against financial institutions,Congressional Budget Office Cost Report, pages 2, 5 and 11 such as those owned by DataTreasury.Jeffrey H.

The pebbles are sometimes collected, cut and polished to resemble diamonds, then sold locally as souvenirs. Cape May diamonds are usually collected by beach combing and are most abundant at Higbee (sometimes, Higby's) and Sunset beaches in Cape May. Cape May diamonds range in size from the finest sand to a \\"Cape May diamond\\" found in New Castle, Delaware in 1866. In the 1960s a small intact quartz crystal was found at Sunset Beach which showed almost no signs of rounding by erosion. This dispelled some early myths of their source which included a large boulder of quartz offshore. Origin Cape May diamonds are actually pieces of quartz washed down, and worn smooth in the process, from the upper Delaware River. Apocryphally, the trip takes thousands of years. However, geologists suggest the pebbles are local in origin, washing out of nearby Pleistocene gravel deposits. Cape May diamonds are sometimes incorrectly described as river-smoothed glass discarded by the New Jersey's once-thriving glass manufacturing industry.  Historical relevance  The Native American tribe called the Kechemeche resided in what is now the southern portion of Cape May County, New Jersey.

The label, founded after World War II, was home to singers such as Hank Locklin, Maddox Brothers and Rose, Rose Maddox, Webb Pierce, Cousin Ford Lewis and T. Texas Tyler, who all regularly issued records on the label, mostly as 78rpm singles. Label History The label was founded in 1945 by William A. \\"Bill\\" McCall Jr., Clifford McDonald, and Richard A. Nelson. By November 1946, McCall was in complete control of 4 Star. Although record labels give a Hollywood, California address, the actual address was on 800 Western Avenue in Los Angeles until 1949, when operations were moved to Pasadena, California. Besides country music, 4 Star also recorded blues, jazz (Wingy Manone, Slim Gaillard, and Charles Mingus), rhythm and blues (Ivory Joe Hunter [including \\"Pretty Mamma Blues\\"], Cecil Gant [including a re-make of his big hit \\"I Wonder\\"], and Ed \\"The Great\\" Gates), and Latin music recordings. 4 Star re-released \\"hillbilly boogie\\" guitarist Porky Freeman's 1945 hit \\"Boogie Woogie On Strings\\" in 1948. Charlie Ryan re- recorded his 1955 hit \\"Hot Rod Lincoln\\" for the label in 1959. Smokey Rogers [as 'Buck Rogers & His Texans'] (1946-1947), Terry Fell [later of \\"Truck Drivin' Man\\" fame] (1947), Ferlin Husky [as 'Terry Preston'] (1949-1950), Billy Jack Wills [youngest brother of Bob Wills] (1951), Ramblin' Tommy Scott (1955), and Sammy Masters (1956) were also 4 Star recording artists. 4 Star released their music on 78rpm (later on 45rpm) discs in three numerical series... the main 1000-series: 1000 thru 1765; the X-series: 1 thru 100; and the P-series: 101 thru 112. In the late 1970s, producer Joe Johnson headed up an organization that purchased 4 Star Records and moved all of its operations to Nashville, Tennessee. Johnson insisted on building state-of-the-art studios and bringing in the best talent available to run them. 4 Star hired successful record producer Steve Clark, who in turn brought to 4 Star a stable of talented artist and writers, including Barbara South, Debi Bass, and Joe Nelson. Several chart records were produced, including Debi Bass' \\"Till I'm Strong Enough to Love Again\\" and \\"I Need a Hero\\", both written by Joe Nelson. 4 Star's financial problems continued to mount, and in the early 1980s the record company was closed and the catalog absorbed by its creditors.

In the game, players assume the role of a captain navigating a river patrol boat to rescue people from the crocodile-infested waters while avoiding obstacles along the way. Initially launched for the arcades, the title was later ported to other platforms, each one featuring various changes compared to the original release.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. River Patrol is an action game where players take the role of a captain navigating a river patrol boat across multiple levels to resuce drowning people who fell into the crocodile-infested river for points while avoiding incoming boulders, floating logs and other obstacles that threaten to sink the vessel.River Patrol Instructions (Atari 2600, US) The main objective is to reach a dam at the end of each level before the timer runs out and the boat sinks. Hitting a crocodile or crossing over a whirlpool causes the boat to sink rapidly, however crashing another boat, log, boulder or TNT instantly sinks the player's boat. Once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Development and release  River Patrol was the second game to be developed by Orca Corporation, a Japanese video game developer headed by Takeshi Tozu, after 1980's Shogun. (Translation by Gamengai. ). The game was first released for arcades in Japan by GGI on July 1981 and later in North America by Kersten. In 1982, Koichi Nakamura wrote a conversion for the PC-8001 titled River Rescue that was published in the Maikon Game Book 4 special edition of Japanese magazine I/O, which brought Nakamura's total high school earnings from submissions to I/O to over ¬•2 million. An Atari 2600 port, developed by Tigervision, was also released in 1984 and this version has since become one of the more expensive titles on the platform.  Reception and legacy  In Japan, River Patrol proved to be popular. In a retrospective review, Atari Gaming Headquarters Keita Iida gave the Atari 2600 port a six out of ten score. A bootleg version of the game developed by Falcon titled Silver Land was also released, changing the main premise to skiing. After the release of River Patrol into the market, Orca would go on to work on several projects: The Percussor, The Bounty, Looper, Springer, Funky Bee, Slalom and Sky Lancer, Vastar (published by Sesame Japan Corporation), (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). and Espial, among others. On June 20, 1983, Orca went bankrupt. Former members of the company later worked at Crux before forming Toaplan.

Bcfg2 aids in the infrastructure management lifecycle ‚Äì configuration analysis, service deployment, and configuration auditing. It includes tools for visualizing configuration information, as well as reporting tools that help administrators understand configuration patterns in their environments. Bcfg2 differs from similar configuration management tools due to its auditing capability. One of the stated design goals for Bcfg2 is to determine if interactive (direct) changes have been made to a machine and report on these extra changes. The client can optionally remove any additional configuration.  Overview  Bcfg2 is written in Python and enables system administrator to manage the configuration of a large number of computers using a central configuration model. Bcfg2 operates using a simple model of system configuration, modeling intuitive items like packages, services and configuration files (as well as the dependencies between them). This model of system configuration is used for verification and validation, allowing robust auditing of deployed systems. The Bcfg2 configuration specification is written using a declarative XML model. The entire specification can be validated using widely available XML schema validators along with the custom schemas included in Bcfg2. Built to be cross-platform, Bcfg2 works on most Unix-like operating systems.  Architecture  Bcfg2 is based on a client-server architecture. The client is responsible for interpreting (but not processing) the configuration served by the server. This configuration is literal, so no client-side processing of the configuration is required. After completion of the configuration process, the client uploads a set of statistics to the server. = The Bcfg2 Client = The Bcfg2 client performs all client configuration or reconfiguration operations. It renders a declarative configuration specification, provided by the Bcfg2 server, into a set of configuration operations which will attempt to change the client's state into that described by the configuration specification. The operation of the Bcfg2 client is intended to be as simple as possible. Conceptually, the sole purpose of the client is to reconcile the differences between the current client state and the state described in the specification received from the Bcfg2 server. = The Bcfg2 Server = The Bcfg2 server is responsible for taking a network description and turning it into a series of configuration specifications for particular clients. It also manages probed data and tracks statistics for clients.  Server operation  The Bcfg2 server takes information from two sources when generating client configuration specifications. The first is a pool of metadata that describes clients as members of an aspect-based classing system. That is, clients are defined in terms of aspects of their abstract behavior. The other is a file system repository that contains mappings from metadata to literal configuration. These are combined to form the literal configuration specifications for clients.

Legends associated with Singuttara =Tapussa and Bhallika= A painting depicting Tapussa and Bhallika receiving strands of hair from the Buddha. Two pious merchant brothers from the Mon country of Lower Burma, Tapussa and Bhallika (), met the Buddha in northern India soon after he had attained enlightenment, and were entrusted with eight sacred hair relics. The two brothers are recorded as the first lay disciples of the Buddha. The Buddha told them the relics should be enshrined in their own land on Singuttara hill, where relics of three previous Buddhas already rested. The Buddha then explained to them the origin of the hill's name: ages before, it was the home of a giant centipede who devoured elephants and piled their tusks (Pali singa) high (Pali uttara) on the peak. Tupassa and Bhallika would know they had found Singuttara when they found a tree trunk balancing on a peak in such a way that neither end touched the ground. =The Convention of Sule= The brothers returned to Lower Burma (Okkalapa) and presented the hairs to the pious King of Okkalapa. Although the King searched diligently for the hill for three years, he was unable to locate it. Eventually Sakra, a deity of Vedic origins, took pity on the king and cleared the jungle from the hill. Sakra could not, however, identify for Okkalapa the exact spot where the relics were to be enshrined. It was because he was only 36 million years old, and therefore did not remember the visits of the earlier Buddhas (which, according to Buddhist cosmology, happened eons in the past). Okkalapa therefore asked local nats (spirits) if they could remember. Fortunately the oldest of the nats, Sule, recalled once trying to eat one of the Buddhas. But he had learned the Dhamma and was no longer a cannibal. Ashamed of his earlier acts and eager to earn merit, Sule led the king and the brothers to the correct spot, the relics were recovered, and the first Shwedagon pagoda was built on the spot.John Strong, \\"Relics of the Buddha\\", (Princeton University Press, 2004) p.76ff. Description and history The hill is located on the last spur of the Pegu Yoma (Pegu Mountains), some three kilometers north from the centre of Yangon, and on the western shore of Kandawgyi Lake (Royal Lake). It is divided into three terraces, the Lower Terrace at road level (ascent of the hill must be made on foot from this point), the Middle Terrace (the beginning of the sacred precinct of the pagoda, beyond which footwear and head coverings are not permitted) and the Top Terrace (the terrace immediately surrounding the main stupa). There are four covered walkways from the road to the top of the hill, one for each cardinal direction. Those on the southern and eastern sides are the most popular entrances to the pagoda. Following the British capture of Rangoon in the Second Anglo-Burmese War, the hill became a military encampment, a status it retained until the 1920s.

The Kechemeche were first encountered in approximately the year 1600 by European colonists who found the natives to be generally friendly and cooperative. By 1735 the Kechemeche were no longer a viable population, through losses from illness and disease, from being absorbed into the occupying colonial population, and by settling elsewhere, including joining other tribes. Eventually, remaining Kechemeche were relocated to Oklahoma by the U.S. government, along with other Lenape tribes, where they remain to this day. Life The colonial settlers described the Kechemeche as a robust, healthy people, who hunted and grew crops, such as corn, squash, and beans. In Kechemeche society, women did the growing of crops, the cooking and other household and child-rearing chores, while the men were generally responsible for maintaining security and for providing meat for their families through hunting. Since the tribe was located so close to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware Bay, the netting and trapping of fish and clamming formed part of their occupation. Deer and small game were plentiful in the local pine forests, and the Kechemeche hunters would trap and kill the deer by setting fires to the underbrush to drive the deer into pre-arranged traps, where they would be killed and used as fresh meat or preserved through smoking or salting. Also, the deer carcass provided other products such as leather, horns, etc. The Kechemeche lived in villages consisting of wigwams, as opposed to teepees. If the village was large enough it could contain a wooden longhouse and even defensive palisades. During leisure hours, tribe members performed beading and weaving, creating products which could be used in trade with other tribes. They also created wampum out of white and purple shell beads, and used the wampum for trading. Since the Kechemeche had access to the Delaware River, they often traveled the river in their bark and dugout canoes in order to trade and communicate with other tribes. Trails led throughout the area, and in the northern part of what is now a county the Kechemeche gathered tuckahoe, a type of root, which they converted into a substance that served as flour. Visiting other tribes, some distant, was important for the Kechemeche, since story telling was an important element of entertainment in the Kechemeche lifestyle. Because of the tribe's isolation and lack of a written historical or contemporary record, news or gossip of happenings in other tribes, as well as tales of their own ancestors, was always welcomed by all members of the tribe. Kechemeche men wore minimal headdress, with perhaps some beads and only a feather or two. The women wore their hair in braids and wore knee-length skirts. Men wore deerskin breechcloth and leggings, but did not generally cover their chests, which, in many cases, were adorned with tattoos. In cold weather, men would cover their chests with deerskin capes. Both sexes wore deerskin moccasins. Warriors shaved their head or wore what would now be considered a \\"mohawk\\" haircut. In times of conflict, a warrior employed bow and arrow, war club, and often a shield. Since the Kechemeche lived close to the shores of Delaware Bay, they collected what are now known as \\"Cape May diamonds,\\" or tumbled quartz, along the beaches. These they considered to have supernatural powers and used them for trading with other tribes, as well as with European settlers. Colonial settlers were eager to trade with the Kechemeche, who provided valuable pelts of beaver, deer, bear and otter in exchange for common European products such as beads, bottles, cook ware, guns, and knives. The Kechemeche, like other members of the Lenni-Lenape, believed that land was to be used, not owned, which created a philosophical conflict, as well as misunderstandings, between the Kechemeche and the settlers. In addition, the Kechemeche generally required approximately one square mile for hunting and for providing meat for a family unit. As a result, growth of colonial area eventually caused sufficient conflict that various treaties were found necessary in order to come to final agreement on land use.  Lineage  The Kechemeche were a tribe in the Lenape group, later named the Delaware by some historians. The Lenape nation consisted of three major divisions, or clans: * the Took-seat, which meant Wolf, or Round Paw, also known as the Munsee, and which settled in North New Jersey and Southern New York. * the Pokekooungo, which meant Turtle, or Crawling, also known as the northern Unami, and populated Central New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania.http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/delaware/unamihist.htm * the Pullaook, which meant Turkey, or Non-Chewing, also known as the southern Unami,*Kraft, Herbert C. The Lenape-Delaware Indian Heritage: 10,000 B.C. to A.D. 2000. [Elizabeth, NJ?]: Lenape Books, 2001. which settled in South New Jersey. * A fourth clan evolved, but broke up and was absorbed by the other three. The Kechemeche were part of the Pullaook (Turkey) clan, which reported to the Lenape subchief, termed \\"sakima,\\" who resided in the Trenton area.  Language  The Kechemeche spoke the Unami dialect of Lenape. See also *Indigenous peoples of the Americas *Lenape * Cape May, New Jersey  Notes  Popular New Jersey web page accounts indicate that the 'Kechemeche' were neighbors of the Tuckahoes. This can not be substantiated. However, the northern part of the county did contain large quantities of tuckahoe, a root that grew near certain trees and, that when pounded into pulp, could be used by the natives, for cooking and baking, as flour, which served as an ingredient in their cornbread.

Their primary role is to bind MHC-I molecules to distinguish between self healthy cells and infected or altered cells. Ly49 family is coded by Klra gene cluster and include genes for both inhibitory and activating receptors, but most of them are inhibitory. Inhibitory Ly49 receptors play role in the recognition of self cells and thus maintain self-tolerance and prevent autoimmunity by suppressing NK cell activation. On the other hand, activating receptors recognise ligands from cancer or viral infected cells (induced-self hypothesis) and are used when cells lack or have abnormal expression of MHC-I molecules (missing-self hypothesis), which activate cytokine production and cytotoxic activity of NK and immune cells. Ly49 receptors are expressed in some mammals including rodents, cattle, some primates but not in humans. Only one human gene homologous to rodent Ly49 receptors is found in the human genome, KLRA1P (LY49L), however, it represents a non-functional pseudogene. However killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) have the same function in humans. They have different molecular structure but recognise HLA class I molecules as ligands and include both inhibitory (mainly) and activating receptors.  Function  = Role in NK cells = Function of NK cells is to kill viral infected or other way abnormal cells, therefore they must have precisely regulated system of recognising self-cells to prevent their destruction. They express several types of inhibitory and activating receptors on their surface including Ly49 receptor family, which have role in NK cell licensing, antiviral and antitumor immunity, each of them will be described below. NK cells are activated when signal from activating receptors outweighs inhibitory signals. This could happen when activating receptors recognise viral proteins presented on infected cell surface (induced-self theory). Some Ly49 receptors have evolved to recognise specific viral proteins, for exapmle Ly49H binds to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) glycoprotein m157. Mouse strains without Ly49H are more susceptible to MCMV infection. In addition these Ly49H positive NK cells have properties of MCMV specific memory NK cells and react better during secondary MCMV infections. Another example of NK cell activation is recognition of tumor cells, which stop expressing MHC I molecules in order to avoid killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Inhibitory receptors of NK cells don't obtain signal resulting in cell activation via activating receptors. This mechanism describes missing-self hypothesis. In order to be fully functional and have cytotoxic activity, NK cells need to get signals from self-MHC I molecules on inhibitory Ly49 receptors in rodents (KIR in humans) especially during their development. This educational process prevents generation of autoreactive NK cells and it was called \\"NK cell licensing\\" by Yokoyama and colleagues. If inhibitory Ly49 receptors miss the signal from MHCI during their development, they are unlicenced (un-educated) and they don't react to stimulation on activating receptors. But this hyporesponsive state isn't definite and they can be re-educated in certain conditions. Besides, it has been shown un-educated cells can be activated by certain acute viral infections or by some tumors and kill these cells more efficiently than educated cells.  Receptor types  = Inhibitory receptors = Inhibitory receptors play role in the NK cell licensing and are important for recognition and tolerance of self cells. Stimulation of inhibitory receptors leads to fosforylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine‚Äêbased inhibitory motif (ITIM), located in the cytoplasmic part of these receptors. Phosphorylated Ly49 molecule recruits the src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing protein phosphatase SHP-1, which defosforylates ITIM and thus prevents cell activation. Inhibitory receptors include Ly49A, B, C, E, G, Q. = Activating receptors = Activating receptors are involved in antiviral and antitumor immunity. They signal through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) which is part of an associated molecule DAP-12 attached to arginine in the transmembrane segment of Ly49. After stimulation of the receptor and phosphorylation of ITAM, SH2 domain with protein kinase is recruited and that starts kinase signaling cascade leading to activating cell effector functions. Activating receptors include Ly49D, H, L.

It is a 33-foot open-cockpit day sailer used for day racing, rather than for overnight or ocean races. Popularised prior to the Second World War, the International One Design class is considered a classic one today. Origin The International class sloop was created by the legendary American yachtsman, Cornelius Shields as he sought to create a new one design yacht for the Amorita Cup series of team races between Bermuda and Long Island Sound. While in Bermuda one spring, he looked out at the beautiful Bermudian 6-Meter, Saga, owned by Kenneth and Eldon Trimingham, and knew instantly that he had seen the prototype of a beautiful racing class that would stand the test of time. Inspired by the beauty of this Six Metre yacht, and its performance, Shields envisioned using it as the basis of a one design racing class that would have the advantages of both limiting the upwardly-spiraling costs of yacht racing, and putting competing crews on an equal footing as far as equipment was concerned. Shields commissioned Saga's designer-builder, Bjarne Aas of Fredrikstad, Norway, to develop plans for a one-design version of Saga. He negotiated with Aas to reduce the size of the Saga's design to produce a 33-foot (10 m) racer. The resulting design was smaller than the Saga, with less displacement, but greater beam of 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m). It measured 21 ft 5 in (6.53 m) in at the waterline, and had a draft of 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m), and displaced 7,120 lb (3,230 kg). The mast was 45 ft (13.72 m), carrying 426 square feet (40 m¬≤) of sail. The design of the boat is what is known as a Bermuda sloop, or a Marconi sloop, being single-masted, and Bermuda rigged. The result is a beautiful reminder of yachting's \\"golden age\\" with the traditional metre-boat's long overhangs, graceful sheer, deep, narrow hull and lofty rig. An IOD sloop and a 19th-century Bermudian working boat in Bermuda The cost of an IOD in 1936 was $2,670. Sails, spars, running rigging, cradle, insurance, and shipping charges from Norway were included in the price. With the backing of the enthusiastic Shields, the boat was quickly adopted by the top racers on Long Island Sound. The first of the initial order of 25 yachts was delivered at City Island, New York in December 1936. \\"I finally arranged to sail her the week after Christmas...the first time anyone had sailed an International,‚Äù recalled Shields, many years later. ‚ÄúI don't think I've ever had a more joyous day on the water. The wind was from the northeast, light in the morning and then stronger at mid-day, so we had a chance to try her out under a variety of conditions. The boat was a delight to handle, and balanced perfectly. I felt great satisfaction at this -- the planning and hope and care hadn't been in vain.\\" The Internationals quickly spread. Bermuda took delivery of seven in January 1937. The next year fleets were established in Marblehead, Massachusetts and Northeast Harbor, Maine, followed by fleets in Norway and Cowes. During the war, legend says that Aas buried the construction jigs to protect them during the Nazi occupation. After the liberation of Norway, construction resumed at Fredrikstad with boats going to San Francisco, Sweden, France, Oyster Bay, and Cowes. Fiberglass construction was introduced in the 1960s with great care taken by the class to ensure that the wood and glass yachts could race on an equal basis. Today, there are twelve fleets racing around the world‚Äî Bermuda, Norway (two fleets - (Fredrikstad and T√∏nsberg), the United Kingdom (St. Mawes, Falmouth), Sweden (Stenungsund), Canada (Chester, Nova Scotia), New York (three fleets -- Larchmont, Manhattan, and Fishers Island), Maine (Northeast Harbor), Massachusetts (two fleets -- Marblehead and Nantucket) and California (San Francisco Bay). Most recently, IODs were the first class awarded International Classic Yacht status by the International Sailing Federation (ISAF). Racing IOD Racing commenced on Long Island Sound during the summer of 1937. The very first trophy awarded for and IOD race was won by Allegra Knapp, sister to famed American sailor Arthur Knapp. Shields' determination to keep the competition on a man-to-man basis maintained the high quality of racing from the beginning. Soon there were thirty five IODs racing in Long Island Sound. The class took hold in and was used for the first ever competition for the Amorita Cup. In the next 28 matches, from then to 1964, held to compete for the cup (21 in Bermuda, and 8 on Long Island Sound), the Americans won 13 times, and the Bermudians 16. Today IODs are actively raced in twelve local fleets in North America and Europe. Representatives of those fleets annually compete in a World Championship (the venue of which rotates between the fleets), a North American Championship, Bermuda Race Week, the Nantucket Invitational, a European Championship and occasional Team-racing championships hosted by individual fleets. Yachts from the International One Design class are used for the annual Bermuda Gold Cup as part of the professional World Match Racing Circuit. The current (2019) World Champion is John Burnham, representing the Fishers Island Fleet. One-design principles Since its founding, the International Class has remained committed to the tradition of testing sailing skills in equally equipped yachts. The Class' extensive one- design rules endeavor to ensure that the hulls, rigs and sails of the racing yachts are near equal as possible. All International owners agree to honor this Class principle. With any racing yacht, the largest contributor to variable costs are the sails. A boat with newer sails will almost always have a greater speed potential than a boat with older sails of the same design. To keep costs low and ensure that each boat is racing with the most equal sails possible, the IOD class has evolved a very specific sail purchase program that is required to be implemented by each local fleet. The Class encourages each local fleet to develop sails for their boats that suit the specific characteristics of their local sailing area. Unlike many other one-design fleets, however, individual boats, are not granted free license on how frequently they replace their sails. Instead, each local fleet votes each year on what sail, if any, will be purchased before a given season. The chosen sail (mainsail, jib or spinnaker) is ordered in a single lot from the local fleet's official sailmaker, who pledges to make them as near equal as possible. No recutting, or use of alternate sails is permitted. Usually fleets adopt a sail purchase schedule that only requires the purchase of one sail per year. The result of this unique sail purchase program is a racing fleet of equally equipped boats that are maintained at a low cost to the individual owners. To further equalize the playing field during International and Interfleet regattas, a change-boat series is presented by the host fleet. Competitors do not bring their own boats to such an event, rather they are invited to sail in the boats of the host fleet. Boats are rotated after every race, or at some events, each day. To make sure that no competing team gain an advantage through this process, the boats are distributed by random drawing and any local representative is prohibited, by rule, from sailing their own boat. Class organization In 1946, Bill John, William S. Cox, George Hinman, Arthur Knapp Jr., A.E. \\"Bill\\" Luders Jr., Emil Mosbacher Jr. and Roderick Stephens Jr. codified the ethos of the class to prevent it moving away from its intended single design nature. This was achieved partly by ensuring only the original builder could produce boats for the class. Today, there are two authorised builders of boats for this class: Tjorns Yacht Service, in Sweden, and South Shore Marine in Chester Nova Scotia. The most recent all wooden IOD, built from the original 1936 drawings, was constructed in 2009 by Tern Boatworks, in Chester, Nova Scotia. The class was overseen by a five-man class committee (headed by Shields until 1960). The committee was as responsible for publicizing the class as regulating it. IODs were the first class awarded International Classic Yacht status by the International Sailing Federation (ISAF).

Development The war destroyed the whole Polish aviation industry. As soon as the Eastern part of Poland was liberated by the Red Army in October 1944 a group of designers gathered in Lublin, under the direction of Tadeusz So≈Çtyk, thus creating the first Polish post-war construction team. They designed a touring low-plane aircraft of a wooden construction called Szpak-1, with a M-11F radial engine. The plane was not built, nevertheless it gave the beginning to a Szpak family. In early 1945 the construction team moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and on April 1, 1945, created Lotnicze Warsztaty Do≈õwiadczalne (LWD, Aviation Experimental Workshops). On October 28, 1945, the prototype of the Szpak-2 was flown for the first time; first Polish post-war civilian plane in operation. It broke its landing gear during a landing, but was repaired. The official first flight took place on 10 November 1945. Szpak was a strutted monoplane low-wing utility/touring plane of wooden construction, powered by a radial engine Bramo Sh 14, left in the country by the retreating Germans. A crew of 4 sat in a closed cab under a multi-part canopy, in two rows. Szpak-2 was not built in series, the single aircraft was used by the factory, then in 1947-1948 by the Polish government as a utility and light transport aircraft. Being the first plane registered in Poland after the war (on 10 May 1946) it carried the registration SP-AAA. It completed some 500 flights and transported some 250 passengers in total and was retired on April 5, 1948. The Szpak-2 had a conventional fixed landing gear. On 17 December 1946, for the first time flew its improved experimental variant called Szpak-3 with a fixed tricycle landing gear (markings SP-AAB). It was not built in a series either, and the prototype was used as a courier plane by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during 1947, then by the factory. It was retired on March 6, 1950. The next variant, the Szpak-4A, was designed as an aerobatic aircraft. Only one prototype was built, flown on May 20, 1947. It had a steel fuselage frame rather than a wooden one, and a two-men side-by-side open cab. It was not certified as an aerobatic aircraft however, and was used by the factory as a utility plane in 1947‚Äì1948. The only variant produced in a series was the 4-seater utility plane called Szpak-4T, utilizing the steel fuselage frame with a conventional landing gear. Contrary to Szpak-2 and 3, its fuselage was lowered behind a canopy. It was ordered by the Ministry of Communication and ten planes were built in 1947-1948 by the PZL (later WSK) in Mielec as the first Polish post-war planes built in a series. The very first one was flown on January 5, 1948. The planes had markings: SP-AAF to SP-AAO, and SP-AAR. They were used by the Polish civilian aviation - regional aero clubs until 1952, except for the SP-AAG, which was retired in 1955. They are also known as WSK Szpak-4T.

Although many flightless birds have a history of extinction at the hands of humans, the Tasmanian native hen has actually benefited from the introduction of European-style agricultural practices in Tasmania.  Nomenclature  Originally described in 1840 as Tribonyx mortierii ‚Äî the mortierii being in honour of Barth√©lemy Charles Joseph Dumortier ‚Äî this species goes by various names. Perhaps the majority of academic and dictionary sources use Tasmanian native hen, while some specialist sources use Tasmanian nativehen. Other names include narkie, waterhen and turbo chook.Tasmanian Native Hen. University of Tasmania. Accessed 22-5-2009  Description  Tasmanian native hen The Tasmanian native hen is a stocky flightless bird between in length. The upperparts are olive brown with a white patch on the flank. The underparts are darker with a bluish grey tinge. The short tail is close to black and mostly held erect. The legs are thick and powerful, with a grey scaly appearance and sharp claws. The eyes are bright red. The bill has a small frontal shield and is a greenish yellow colour. The juvenile bird is similar in appearance to the adult, but the colours are more subdued on the body and the underparts have fine white spots. The bill is greenish yellow and the eyes are bright red. Male birds generally have longer bills and legs, though there is enough overlap that the sexes are indistinguishable, even in the hand.  Habitat and distribution  The Tasmanian native hen is a sedentary species, living around open grassy areas close to water. It is widespread in Tasmania apart from the west and south west regions. It is not found on King or Flinders Islands in Bass Strait,Thomas, D. 1979. Tasmanian Bird Atlas. Hobart: University of Tasmania. though Michael Sharland does record it as being on Flinders Island.Sharland, M. 1958. Tasmanian Birds: a field guide to the birds inhabiting Tasmania and adjacent islands, including the sea birds. Sydney: Angus and Robertson. A population introduced to Maria Island is now well established. It is generally common and easily seen around bodies of water that have grassy verges. Fossil records indicate that the Tasmanian native hen was found on the Australian mainland until around 4700 years ago. Suggested reasons for its extinction there have included the introduction of the dingo, or an extremely dry period.  Behaviour and social organisation  Flock on the run, Bruny Island The Tasmanian native hen's social organisation has been extensively studied. Tasmanian native hens live in groups of between two and five, plus the young birds from the previous breeding season, which tend to stay with the group and contribute to the care of the young until they move off to establish their own territories after approximately one year. The sedentary nature of the species means that groups hold sharply defined territories of up to , and repel transgression into their territory vigorously with calls and displays. Fights can also occur, where birds will jump, peck and kick at each other violently, sometimes drawing blood and pulling feathers. The breeding structure may be monogamous or polygamous, usually polyandrous. Each group contains a single breeding female who will mate with all the males of the group. The unusual social structure based on groups who stay together is not known to occur in many other species; the high ratio of male chicks to female chicks hatched is thought to be a possible explanation for this. The Tasmanian native hen has 14 separate calls, ranging from low grunts to high pitched alarm calls as well as a see-sawing duet performed in unison, rising to a crescendo of harsh screeching notes, It also calls at night. Although flightless, this bird is capable of running quickly and has been recorded running at speeds up to . It uses its wings when running fast to help it to balance.  Breeding  Tasmanian native hen eggs Tasmanian native hen chick The breeding season begins in the period from July to September, depending upon rainfall and the availability of food. Birds will usually breed once per year, however in good years, with high availability of food, two broods may be produced. The nest is a rough, flattened grass mattress, among taller grasses and is usually built close to water, or on damp ground. With a clutch size of five to eight, the oval eggs measure around and are a dull yellow or buff to brown with some spotting of reddish brown and lavender. As well as the primary nest, nursery nests are constructed with the purpose of roosting with chicks at night and as hiding places in case of predators. Chicks are covered in a dark brown fluffy down. Tasmanian native hen  Diet  The diet of the Tasmanian native hen is mostly made up of grass shoots and the leaves of low herbs which it grazes during daylight hours. Birds will also eat insects, seeds and orchard fruit. The species has a reputation among farmers as an agricultural pest. The damage to agriculture was extensively studied in the 1960s by M Ridpath and G Meldrum, who found that although there is some damage to crops, rabbits were responsible for more damage. Many beliefs held by farmers about damage to crops were found to be unlikely, with damage probably caused by other species.Ridpath, M.G. and Meldrum G.K. 1968. Damage done to pastures by the Tasmanian Native hen, Tribonyx mortierii, in CSIRO Wildlife Research, 1968, 13, 11‚Äì24. The Tasmanian native hen is a secondary grazer, meaning that it depends on other species to keep grass swards low and with fresh shoots. Before European settlement in Tasmania, the cleared spaces required for feeding would probably have been provided by Indigenous burning of grasslands to provide feeding grounds for mammals, which would be hunted for food. The expansion of these cleared grassy areas, and the introduction of rabbits, has provided greater food sources and consequently greater numbers of the species within its range.  Conservation status and threats  The Tasmanian native hen is currently classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN. Although there is a healthy population size and no significant falls have been measured, there is concern about the possible arrivalTasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service - Foxes in Tasmania Accessed 03-11-2011 of the red fox in Tasmania and the possible impact that it will have on this and other species.

There are 7 NKG2 types: A, B, C, D, E, F and H. NKG2D is an activating receptor on the NK cell surface. NKG2A dimerizes with CD94 to make an inhibitory receptor (CD94/NKG2). IPH2201 is a monoclonal antibody targeted at NKG2A.AstraZeneca Inks $1.8B in Immuno-Oncology Deals as Q1 Profit Dips  Gene expression  In both humans and mice, genes encoding the NKG2 family are clustered ‚Äì in human genome on chromosome 12, in mouse on chromosome 6. They are generally expressed on NK cells and a subset of CD8+ T cells, although the expression of NKG2D was also confirmed on Œ≥Œ¥ T cells, NKT cells, and even on some subsets of CD4+ T cells or myeloid cells. NKG2D expression can also be present on cancer cells and is proven to stimulate oncogenic bioenergetic metabolism, proliferation and metastases generation. On NK cells, NKG2 genes are expressed through the ontogeny as well as in adulthood. As about 90% of fetal NK cells express NKG2 genes, one of the proposed functions of the gene family is contribution to self-tolerance. The level of expression of NKG2 genes is not constant, rather it is affected by cytokine environment (mainly interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-7 and IL-15). For CD8+ T lymphocytes, NKG2 family expression is believed to be a marker of activated or memory T cells. The expression is triggered namely by IL-15, IL-12, IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤. CD94/NKG2 expression is shown to significantly increase the survival of T cells.  Structure  NKG2 are members of the C-type lectin-like receptor superfamily. NKG2A, -B, -C, -E and -H form heterodimers with CD94, linked by disulfide bonds, whereas NKG2D forms homodimers. Inhibitory molecules NKG2A and its splice variant NKG2B contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) in the intracellular part of the molecule. Activatory molecules NKG2C, NKG2E and its splice variant NKG2H do not have an activating immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their molecule. Rather, they contain a positively charged residue in their transmembrane regions by which they interact with adaptor molecules containing ITAMs, mainly DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP-12). NKG2D pairs with either DAP-12 or DAP-10, depending on the isoform. There are two isoforms in mice ‚Äì the long isoform (NKG2D-L) pairs only with DAP-10, whereas the short isoform (NKG2-S) can also pair with DAP-12. Only long isoform is present in humans. NKG2F also does not dimerize with CD94, rather it associates with DAP-12. It is only expressed on membranes of intracellular compartments.  Signalling  Inhibitory NKG2 molecules containing ITIMs recruite the Src homology 2 domain containing phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which leads to the inhibition of cytotoxicity. ITAMs, included in DAP-12, on the other hand, recruite the Src homology domain containing kinases Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) or Zap70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70). Kinase activation is followed by NK cell degranulation and transcription of cytokine and chemokine genes. DAP-10 connects to GRB2 or p85, leading to signalling through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and other molecules, leading to cytotoxicity.  Ligands  Ligands of CD94/NKG2 heterodimeric molecules are nonclassical MHC class I molecules ‚Äì Qa1b molecules in mice and HLA-E in humans. These molecules both present sequences from the digested leading peptides of classical MHC class I molecules. This enables the monitoring of classical MHC class I expression on target cells. NKG2D recognizes mostly stress-induced proteins, namely human MHC class-I-chain related protein (MIC-A) and MIC-B, and also other stress- induced proteins common to humans and mice ‚Äì retinoic acid early transcript 1 (Rae1) and RAET1 in humans, H60 and UL16-binding protein-like transcript 1 (Mult1) in mice, and the UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs) in humans.  Function  = CD94/NKG2 = NKG2A was documented to promote survival in T cells. Along with its splice variant NKG2B, these molecules are inhibitory and lead to a decrease in cytotoxicity. NKG2C and NKG2E (and its splice variant NKG2H) recognize the same ligand with different (usually lower in physiological conditions) affinity. However, the affinity for HLA-E (or Qa1b) can drastically change after a small change in the presented peptide, which can lead to NK cell activation. CD94/NKG2 and their ligands can also play a role in certain diseases, where their expression can be modified on different cell types. These include viral and bacterial infections by HCMV, HIV-1 and Hepatitis virus type C (HCV) in humans, or LCMV, HSV-1, Influenza and Listeria monocytogenes infections in mice. In cancers, a role of CD94/NKG2 was demonstrated for melanoma, cervical cancer, lymphoma/leukemia and more. NKG2 match can also prevent graft versus leukemia effect (GvL) as well as the graft versus host disease (GvHD). = NKG2D = NKG2D is an activating receptor playing a role in the cell-mediated control of some cancers. Many tumors avoid the cytotoxicity by excreting soluble NKG2D ligands or secreting TGF-Œ≤, leading to the downregulation of the NKG2D expression. NKG2D ligands are also upregulated by cells infected with viral pathogens. Certain viruses can produce proteins that block the expression of NKG2D ligands on the cell surface to decrease the recognition by NK cells, increasing virus pathogenicity.

Ryan (born 1937/38) is an American billionaire insurance businessman. He is the founder and retired chairman and CEO of Aon Corporation. In 2010, he founded Ryan Specialty Group (RSG) as a holding company aimed at providing specialty services to insurance brokers, agents and carriers. RSG's first subsidiary, ThinkRisk, began business in December 2009 to provide underwriting and claims management services for media, technology, advertising and network security. Ryan was the chairman and CEO of the Chicago 2016 Olympic bid committee and is chairman of World Sport Chicago, an organization that formed out of Chicago's Olympic bid. Ryan is a philanthropist in Chicago. He is married to Shirley Welsh Ryan, with whom he runs the Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Foundation. He is also a benefactor of the Art Institute of Chicago Building's modern wing addition. Ryan is a member and former chairman of the board of trustees at Northwestern University, where both major athletic facilities, Welsh-Ryan Arena and Ryan Field, are named after him. Ryan owns a large minority interest in the Chicago Bears. Early life Ryan is the son of an Irish-American father who ran a Ford dealership in suburban Milwaukee. Ryan spent his summers shoveling concrete to help build Milwaukee's freeway system. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University's School of Business (now Kellogg School of Management) in 1959 with a degree in Finance and Literature. During his senior year, Ryan earned $8,000 selling personalized scrapbooks to dorm residents, an experience that \\"kindled his entrepreneurial spirit\\". Career Ryan in 2008 After graduating from Northwestern University, Ryan immediately joined Penn Mutual's Chicago office as a life insurance agent. In 1962, Ryan founded the first Finance and Insurance (F&I;) department at Dick Fencl Chevrolet in suburban Chicago, selling insurance products on behalf of Continental Casualty Company, now the primary subsidiary of CNA Financial. This move \\"forever changed how auto dealerships operate\\" and in 1964, Ryan founded Pat Ryan & Associates, a brokerage and underwriting agency. At Pat Ryan & Associates, a rigorous training program was developed to train licensed agents and place them in auto dealerships. This business model was successful for Pat Ryan & Associates, and by 1968, the firm was selling $15 million in premiums a year. Ryan borrowed money to buy a dormant insurance company, enabling him to underwrite the products his company was selling. This move transformed Pat Ryan & Associates into a nationwide business, and in 1971, with $25 million in annual sales, he took the firm public. The stock offering helped raise capital to meet Ryan's long term goal: \\"diversification from a single line of insurance to multiple insurance products\\". In 1976, Ryan changed the firm's name to Ryan Insurance Group and in 1977, he bought the retail brokerage units from Esmark Inc, \\"expanding into risk management services for commercial and industrial clients\\". In 1981, Ryan further expanded by purchasing the James S. Kemper agencies. In 1982, Ryan Insurance Group merged with Combined International, and Ryan became CEO. The company continued to expand through organic growth and acquisitions, and in 1987, Ryan changed Combined's name to Aon Corporation. He served as the company's chairman and CEO for 41 years. At Ryan's retirement in 2008, Aon operated with more than 500 offices in 120 countries generating revenues in excess of $7 billion. Aon is the largest reinsurance broker and 2nd largest insurance broker in the world, and a leader in risk management and human capital consulting. In 2010, Ryan formed Ryan Specialty Group (RSG), a global specialty insurance holding company with offices in North America and Europe. RSG's wholesale operation, RT Specialty, is the 3rd largest wholesale broker in the US. To date, there are 16 underwriting facilities within RSG Underwriting Managers (RSGUM). In 2018, Ryan Fieldhouse was unveiled.  Alma mater  Ryan has been a member of Northwestern University's board of trustees for 37 years, 14 of which he was chairman. In 2009, Ryan was inducted into the Northwestern Athletic Hall of Fame. That year, Northwestern also awarded Ryan an honorary doctorate. In 2013, he received the Northwestern Alumni Association Medal of Honor, their highest award, given to alumni who combines superior professional distinction and/or exemplary volunteer service to society, with an outstanding record of service to Northwestern. Pat Ryan and his wife, Shirley Welsh Ryan, have been donors for many of Northwestern University's facilities and programs, both academic and athletic. Over the years, the couple has supported Northwestern University by funding fellowships for graduate students in nanotechnology and scholarships for low-income students, contributing to the Feinberg School of Medicine's priorities, and endowing chairs. The music and communications building, which opened in 2015, was named after the Ryans for their longtime support of the arts at Northwestern. Ryan is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Awards and honors Ryan has received a number of awards and honors throughout his career. These include, among others: * Horatio Alger Award (1987) - honors those who are dedicated to the principles of integrity, hard work, perseverance and compassion for others. * Academy of Arts and Sciences Inductee (2008) - one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious honorary societies and independent research centers, founded in 1780. * International Insurance Society Hall of Fame (2008) * College of Insurance - Insurance Leader of the Year (1997) * Order of Lincoln Medallion (1998) - the highest award granted by the State of Illinois, recognizing a lifetime of accomplishment. * The Insurance Federation of New York - Free Enterprise Award (1999) * Brigham Young University - International Executive of the Year for Corporate Integrity (2002) * Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (2002) ‚Äì presented by Awards Council member Dr. Francis Collins at the International Achievement Summit in Dublin, Ireland * Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award (2008) * Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame (2016) In 2004, Ryan hosted President George W. Bush during a political fundraising dinner at his home in Winnetka, Illinois. Later that year, he hosted another fundraiser with Bush's wife and daughters as guests.Hoffmania!: Bush Just Leaves a Trail of Destruction In November 2008, Ryan was named one of five co-chairs for Barack Obama's inaugural committee.

Sentiments turned against the Campbell family to the point that a movement arose to present a bill in Parliament to abolish the family name altogether.The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution, Vol. IV; Robert Wodrow; Blackie & Son, Glasgow, 1832; p. 311 On 24 June 1685, King James II and VII issued a proclamation against traitors and fugitives in which Neil Campbell's son Archibald, among others, were named with a price of 1,800 Scottish merks offered for their capture.The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution, Vol. IV; Robert Wodrow; Blackie & Son, Glasgow, 1832; p. 311 - 312 It was shortly after these events that Lord Neill Campbell prepared to voyage to America. On 13 August 1685 Campbell purchased of Viscount Tarbat one quarter of one twenty-fourth share in East New Jersey;State of New Jersey, Office of the Secretary of State; East Jersey Deeds, Liber A, p. 227 that same day he was given power of attorney by Sir John Dalrymple to act as Dalrymple's agent in America.

On 4 June Governor Robert Barclay issued a commission to Lord Neill Campbell as deputy governor in the event Lawrie needed to be replaced. By September 1686 the decision was made to remove Lawrie from office, and on 5 October Campbell presented his commission from Gov. Barclay as deputy governor to the East New Jersey Provincial Council, who confirmed and recognized the appointment. As Barclay was an absentee official who never actually visited East New Jersey, Lord Neill Campbell was the de facto governor. Lawrie was then commissioned a member of the Council. Lord Campbell, having urgent business in Britain, nominated Councillor Andrew Hamilton as his replacement as Deputy Governor on 10 December 1686; the next day Lawrie was the only councillor to register a protest and vote against confirming Hamilton.Journal of the Governor and Council Vol. I (1682-1714), Archives of the State of New Jersey, First Series, Vol. XIII; The John L.

The Four Ancient Books of Wales is a term coined by William Forbes Skene to describe four important medieval manuscripts written in Middle Welsh and dating from the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. They contain primarily texts of poetry and prose, some of which are contemporary and others which may have originated from traditions dating back to as early as the sixth and seventh centuries. These also contain some of the earliest native Welsh references to King Arthur. The four books included by Skene in his list are: * The Black Book of Carmarthen * The Book of Taliesin * The Book of Aneirin * The Red Book of Hergest The principal texts of the Four Ancient Books of Wales were edited and translated in a two volume compilation by William Forbes Skene in 1868.

Biography Slater was born in England in 1776 and received an education from Thomas Jackson, also his older brother's teacher, and then became a millwright's apprentice. Slater gained technical mill information in Manchester and Oldham, England to use in America. Slater immigrated in the United States in 1803 to work for Almy, Brown and Slater at Pawtucket. He eventually formed a partnership with the Providence firm of Almy and Brown, purchased land in what is now Slatersville, Rhode Island (then was the northern wilderness of Smithfield, Rhode Island) and began construction of a textile mill. By 1807, the village included the Slatersville Mill, the largest and most modern industrial building of its day, two houses for workers, the owner's house and the company store.

Opened in 1922, La Jolla High School (LJHS) is San Diego Unified School District's second oldest campus. The site encompasses 12 acres with 14 permanent buildings. LJHS, one of the 16 high schools in the district, is located in La Jolla, a community of about 41,000 within the city limits of San Diego. The high school is surrounded by residential housing and private and public entities including the University of California, San Diego, Salk Institute, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Scripps Health, Scripps Research Institute, and retail, financial and professional services, and located south of downtown La Jolla. Modernization of the school has been funded through Proposition MM, The Foundation of La Jolla High School, the ongoing efforts of the PTA, and other community partnerships. In 2003, LJHS was named a California Distinguished School. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). As a result of the most recent 2016 visitation and self-study cycle, WASC granted LJHS a 6-year accreditation term In 2019, LJHS was cited as the 1,139th ranked high school in the nation and 173rd in California by Newsweekhttps://www.usnews.com/education/best-high- schools/california/districts/san-diego-unified-school-district/la-jolla- high-3204 and is also recognized as an Achievement via Individual Determination (AVID) School of Distinction. In addition, LJHS was the first public high school west of the Mississippi to earn a chapter in the Cum Laude Society. Administration * Principal: Dr. Chuck Podhorsky * Vice Principal A: Cindy Ueckert * Vice Principal B: Tony Meeks thumb PTSA According to the official PTSA website the La Jolla High PTSA promotes itself as \\"a not- for-profit organization and the nation's premier parent involvement group in schools. PTSA organizes and manages a variety of programs and services at La Jolla High. Our website and eBlasts keep parents informed, our mini-grants keep classrooms stocked with supplies, and our volunteers keep school events running smoothly.\\" The PTSA mini-grants are available to individual LJHS teachers who are members of the PTSA. In 1997, the controversial PTSA (then \\"PTA\\") Volunteer Hours program was discontinued under former principal Dana Shelburne. The program, which was reportedly not put in writing until 1996, allowed PTA parents who volunteered over 75 hours to exercise specific control over their students' schedule and teachers. A PTA brochure stated that the program allowed parents to create a \\"dream schedule\\" for their child. Under heavy criticism from VEEP parents, Shelburne said that the program was shut down due to \\"the bookkeeping burden on the PTA and lack of benefit.\\" The Foundation The Foundation is the fundraising organization for LJHS. Funds raised by the Foundation have been used to fund full-time faculty positions, security cameras, robotics class equipment, technology, textbooks and fiction books, teachers' professional development conference registration, academic league and team competition fees, athletic facility improvements, athletic trainer, and coaching fees among others. The LJHS Foundation fulfills a complementary, but distinct, role from the PTSA by raising funds for high- priority programs that are not fully funded by the San Diego Unified School District, as determined by the administration, site governance, and academic department chairs. Site governance The Site Governance team meets on the first Monday of each month. It consists of the following nineteen members: the principal; eight certificated staff representatives; one SDEA site representative; one classified representative; five parent representatives; one community representative; and two student representatives. Agenda items, which can be submitted by anyone, are turned in to the elected chair prior to the meeting. The role of the Governance Committee is to provide a forum for examination of issues relating to LJHS. The development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies of LJHS fall within the purview of the Governance Committee. The School Site Counsel meets after Site Governance, and some members are in both groups. Demographic data The current LJHS population stands at approximately 1,500 students in grades 9-12, supported by 109 staff members (a principal, 2 vice-principals, 67 credentialed teachers, 2 visiting community college professors, 4 counselors, a nurse, a psychologist, a librarian, a media tech, 6 custodial staff, a landscaper, and other support staff). LJHS has two NBCTs (National Board Certified Teachers) in its English Department, as well as numerous AP (Advanced Placement) Instructors in English, Computer Science, Social Science, and Science Departments who serve as Readers or Table Leaders for the annual AP Exams, which are designed by the College Board to measure student achievement in college-level classes and administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). All LJHS teachers have a valid credential for the subjects they teach and SDUSD has certified that the site is 100 percent No Child Left Behind (NCLB) compliant. Caucasian students make up a little more than one half of the student population with Hispanic students comprising the largest minority population. LJHS is made up of 61% residential students and 39% nonresidential. Of the approximately 1,500 students currently enrolled at LJHS, 24% are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Various students are enrolled in Voluntary Ethnic Enrollment Plan (VEEP), CHOICE, Program Improvement School Choice (PISC), NCLB, and special education programs. LJHS does not receive any Title I funds. Discipline, dropout and graduation rate LJHS seniors line up for 2018 graduation in Big Gym La Jolla High's suspension rate is low, at about 115 suspensions per year; some of these suspensions are accrued by the same students. The main reasons (about 50%) are due to minor disruptions in the classroom. The other 50% of suspensions include reasons such as fighting, alcohol/drug/tobacco possession and/or use, and stolen property. The dropout rate is 0.2%. Students graduating with UC \\"a-g\\" credits increased from 70.7% to 79.4% in 2013‚Äì2014, the most recent year recorded by the district. Class of 2016 students will be required to pass the \\"a-g\\" requirements for graduation. Assessment and testing The most recent testing date is available on the California Department of Education website. The CST Standards Assessment and Reporting system was phased out in the 2014‚Äì15 school year and replaced with the new California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASP). The CAASPs are summative assessments for all 11th graders in English Language Arts and Mathematics to measure their achievement in the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). On La Jolla's 2018 performance on the CA School Dashboard, LJHS 11th graders scored 78.6 above the standard for Math and English Language arts, a 21.8 point increase from 2017. A more comprehensive breakdown of testing statistics related to English Language Learners, students receiving SpED services, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, and other subgroups can be found on the Mid-Cycle Review WASC document published on the La Jolla High website. Instruction and classes All LJHS classes have a hard cap of 36 students per class, however certain AP courses and other classes are filled above capacity. The school offers a breadth of courses at a variety of academic levels. These include: *21 Advanced Placement courses *6 college courses: Mesa College Political Science 101/102, Mesa College English 47A/101, Mesa College Math 150/151, Mesa College Math 254/245, Mesa College Business/Marketing 100, UCSD Extension Introduction to Sociology/Human Nutrition *AVID classes for 26 students *GATE services through cluster, honors, and AP courses *Seminar Program/Independent Studies *English Language Learner support *Literacy Advancement classes (Bridging English for students in need of remediation) *Special Education courses in math, reading and transition skills *Credit recovery through APEX for eleventh and twelfth grade students *iHigh credit recovery LJHS also has a Seminar Humanities program. In 2015, the number of seminar-identified students in grades 9-12 was 234. The number of students enrolled in a seminar-identified class was 152. There are no seminar classes for 12th grade, as seniors are expected to take AP's or college-level classes such Political Science (offered through Mesa Community College) on the LJHS campus. Each year, approximately 72% of LJHS students attend four-year universities, with a significant number of students attending Ivy League schools, out-of-state institutions, and the University of California and California State University systems, an additional 20% of students attend 2 year community colleges for a total of 92% seeking higher education right after graduation. Beginning with the 2019‚Äì20 school year, LJHS, along with Muirlands Middle School and the San Diego School of Creative and Performing Arts, is piloting a new late start program for the San Diego Unified School District, with first period at 8:35 am (rather than the previous 7:25 am), with the stated purpose of increasing attendance, test scores, and graduation rates. Muirlands Middle Principal Geof Martin has also stated that \\"In addition, healthy start times lead to decreased rates of emotional and behavioral problems, including anxiety and depression, along with corresponding increases in social, academic and athletic performance\\". All classes are expected to conform to the Schoolwide Student-Learner Outcomes (SSLOs): # Students will demonstrate effective oral and written communication skills, and will be able to use technology when applicable. # Students will develop the interpersonal skills necessary to work collaboratively, ethically, and effectively with others in order to be contributing members in a global society. # Students will be able to demonstrate the higher order thinking skills of analysis, synthesis, application, and evaluation. # Students will be able to demonstrate knowledge of the world's various viewpoints, belief systems, and cultures as well as American core values. In 2013‚Äì2014, La Jolla High School did not meet the Adequate Yearly Progress criteria mandated under the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), with an insufficient percentage of students proficient in Mathematics. LJHS did meet each of the other four criteria. 2014 football concussion La Jolla High School athletes conduct Physical Readiness Training in a four-day program hosted by the National Guard and National Football League in 2012. In October 2014, La Jolla High School student Trey Enloe suffered a concussion in a Junior Varsity football game against Point Loma High School. Assistant coach Steven Wachs was suspended for the rest of the season following the incident, however, he said he was unaware of the player's concussion during the game. Former NFL player and LJHS Football Head Coach Jason Carter denied any knowledge of the incident. Carter told the Voice of San Diego (VOSD) that he \\"was present at the junior varsity game on Oct. 16, but didn‚Äôt see [the student] get injured.\\" However, video footage obtained by VOSD through a Public Records Act request show Carter watching as the injured student was assessed. VOSD reporter Mario Koran wrote that \\"Principal Chuck Podhorsky wouldn‚Äôt confirm whether the incident took place. The district said my inquiry was the first it had heard of the details of the incident.\\" An internal email obtained by the VOSD revealed that Vice Principal Anne McCarty had notified all other administrators, including Principal Podhorsky, of the incident via email. According to his father, the student \\"now experiences a constant state of fogginess. He can‚Äôt read more than three lines at a time before a searing headache sets in ...[he] hasn‚Äôt formally withdrawn from school, his dad said, but his grades for the semester won‚Äôt count.\\" In October 2015, the Enloe family filed suit against the San Diego Unified School District. ACLU settlement La Jolla High School Free Speech Board as of February 2, 2015. On February 17, 2012, a year after the former principal of La Jolla High School, Dana Shelburne, whitewashed students‚Äô political messages from its free speech benches, a student represented by the ACLU of San Diego & Imperial Counties agreed to a settlement with the San Diego Unified School District that greatly strengthened the free speech rights of all district students. The settlement goes well beyond the senior benches at La Jolla High, marking a major victory for student speech in California and the nation. The settlement includes an updated and constitutionally-sound free speech policy for all students in the San Diego Unified School District. 2015 campus vandalism Between Friday, February 20, 2015, and Saturday, February 21, 2015, LJHS was subject to campus-wide vandalism in the form of graffiti. In addition to graffiti that was graphic and sexual in nature, the San Diego Union Tribune reported that it was being pursued as a hate crime, in part because the words \\"White America\\" and a swastika were a part of the graffiti. The graffiti was found in various areas of the campus, including on the Free Speech Bulletin Board. News footage from San Diego CBS8 shows SDUSD employees removing student posters from the Free Speech Board indicated in the 2012 ACLU settlement in order to scrub explicit graffiti.

He served on the city council since 1999, representing Baltimore's 4th Council District, until 2007. On September 20, 2008, Harris was shot and killed outside of a jazz club in northeast Baltimore. Education and early career Ken Harris was born to Sylvia Harris, a single teenage mother in the Park Heights neighborhood of Baltimore City. Growing up in a rough area, Ken saw first hand what a crime-ridden community looked like. He put all of his energy into school, learning at an early age that he didn't want to wind up in gangs or worse. Harris graduated from Dunbar Senior High School and was MVP of their baseball team in 1981. Although Harris had been drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, he enrolled at Morgan State University to further his education. On August 25, 1985, Harris married the former Annette Barnes and from this union, Nicole and Kenneth Jr. were born. After completing a B.S. in Business Administration at Morgan in 1989, Harris first worked for Care First Blue Cross/Blue Shield. In 1997 he was hired as director of membership and business services for the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore and a few years later he was hired as an executive at Comcast. Harris served as President of the Leith Walk Elementary School PTA and coached in the Northwood Baseball League. Baltimore City Council Harris was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1999. He represented the fourth district, located in North-Central Baltimore. In addition to his committee responsibilities, Harris was a frequent speaker at City Schools, delivering motivational speeches focused on what young people need to succeed. Harris established the \\"Bridge to Manhood\\" in 2005, a program that sends successful African-American men into City Schools to talk with boys about overcoming the odds. He was a leader on the Council to combat secondhand smoke through a citywide smoking ban. Harris chaired the Education, Housing, Health, and Human Services Committee, was a member of the Land Use and Transportation Committee, and chaired the Highways and Franchise Subcommittee. City Council President's race Harris launched a campaign for President of the Baltimore City Council on January 29, 2007. Harris was endorsed by United States Senator Ben Cardin, Baltimore City delegation chairman Curt Anderson and the Baltimore Afro American newspaper. Harris' campaign failed to gain traction, and he ultimately won 11 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary, far behind Michael Sarbanes and incumbent and ultimate winner Stephanie Rawlings Blake. Death On September 20, 2008, at approximately 1:45 in the morning, Harris was shot outside of the New Haven Lounge in northeast Baltimore City. Four men, with their faces covered and at least one of them armed with a hand gun, surprised Harris and the club's owner during an apparent robbery attempt at the club's front entrance. Harris was chased to his car by one of the men when the assailant shot through the window of Harris' Toyota, striking him in the chest. The men then robbed the club and fled out a back door leading to an alley behind the shopping center. Harris was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly after 2:00 am. On November 14, 2008, Baltimore City police announced the arrest of two suspects in the case. More than 1,500 people, including Governor Martin O'Malley, former Governor Robert Ehrlich, Senator Ben Cardin and Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger, attended his funeral at the Murphy Fine Arts Building on the campus of Morgan State University. All state of Maryland flags were flown at half-staff on the day of his funeral.

It includes the Slatersville Historic District, a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic district has been included as part of the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park. The North Smithfield Public Library is located in Slatersville. Slatersville was associated with and named for Samuel Slater and John Slater, members of the well-known Slater family. In the late nineteenth century, the Woonsocket and Pascoag Railroad was built through the village, and the line is now owned and operated by the Providence and Worcester Railroad. The freight rail line now terminates in Slatersville near a steel distributor by the Slater Mill, rather than its former endpoint in Pascoag. History Slatersville Mill, 2005, prior to renovation The region was originally settled in the 17th century by British colonists as a farming community. The village was founded in 1803 by entrepreneurs Samuel and John Slater, in partnership with the Providence firm of Almy and Brown. The firm purchased the land and began construction of a textile mill.Walter Nebiker, The History of North Smithfield (Somersworth, NH: New England History Press, 1976). By 1807, the village included the Slatersville Mill, \\"the largest and most modern industrial building\\" of its day, two houses for workers, the owner's house, and the company store. The first mill building was destroyed by fire in 1826 and was replaced by the large stone mill which stands on the site today. Behind the 1826 mills stands a stone mill of similar design built in 1843. The mills were powered by water from the large Slatersville reservoir. Slatersville's village green was laid out in 1838 in a traditional New England pattern. Many of the houses around the Green were built by the Slater company in 1810-20. They were substantially renovated earlier in the 20th century to make Slatersville look more like a traditional New England Village. At the head of the Green stands the Slatersville Congregational Church, a steepled Greek revival building, which houses the oldest continuously operated Sunday School in America. The Slater family owned the village until 1900 when it was sold to James R. Hooper, who used the mills to bleach and dye cloth. In 1915, Hooper sold the Slatersville village to Henry P. Kendall. Kendall took a personal interest in the village and initiated many of the improvements which give Slatersville its traditional New England character. Today, Slatersville is owned by private individuals and, in 1973, it became a National Historic District, bounded by Main, Green, Church, and School Sts. and Ridge Rd., with and 149 buildings.

A Vita et miracula Sanctae Opportunae was written within a century of her death (ca 885-88) by Adalhelm (later rendered Adelin), bishop of S√©ez, who believed he owed his life and his see to Opportuna.Julia M. H. Smith, \\"The Problem of Female Sanctity in Carolingian Europe c. 780-920\\" Past and Present No. 146 (February 1995), pp. 3-37. Life When she was still young, Opportuna became a Benedictine nun at the convent called the Monasteriolum near Almen√®ches, where her cousin Lantildis was abbess. Opportuna took the veil from her brother, Chrodegang (later rendered Godegrand), the bishop of S√©ez. Although Montreuil was only three miles away from S√©ez, Chrodegang was murdered on the way to visit his sister at the abbey. Later Opportuna succeeded her cousin as abbess. In this position, she was conventionally described as \\"a true mother to all her nuns\\", correcting their faults, significantly enough to record, with words, not blows.William Smith and Henry Wace, A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines \\"Opportuna\\". Some sources say that Opportuna died from a brief illness which was compounded by grief from the death of her brother, as Chrodegang had died on 3 September 769. His murder had been planned by Chrodobert, a powerful relation to whom he had entrusted the administration of his diocese during his seven years' absence at Rome.Smith and Wace, op. cit. Though she foresaw her brother's death in a prophetic vision, Opportuna was powerless to intervene;\\"When attention switches to political intrigue, women become bystanders, potential victims or mourners, but not the central characters in a story.\\" (Smith 1995:23). afterwards she buried Chrodegang in her own convent. Whatever the cause, Opportuna died on 22 April 770. Hagiography Like all Carolingian saints, Opportuna's sanctity was not expressed in charismatic actions during her lifetime: she effected no miracles during her lifetime. Though the cult of the saintly dead and hagiography flourished, \\"the Carolingian era forms an interlude in the history of sainthood, for no charismatic ascetics, healers, prophets or visionaries made their mark on a church whose bishops were implacably hostile to any such forms of expression,\\" Julia Smith has observed, in analysing Carolingian attitudes towards appropriate representations of female sainthood through the lens of the Vita et miracula Sanctae Opportunae. The account of miracles worked at the site of Opportuna's tomb reminded readers and hearers that the abbess remained present in her former precincts, extending her protection to her flock forward in time. Julia Smith has detected that the comparatively small corpus of hagiographies of female saints are restricted in the area in which they were produced, north of the Loire and east of the Rhine for the greatest part.Smith 1995:9f. Opportuna's vita records that once a peasant stole a donkey from the convent and refused to acknowledge his crime. Opportuna turned the matter over to God, and the next day the farmer's field was sown with salt. The repentant peasant both returned the donkey and gave the nuns the field. Veneration Though she was not recorded in the martyrologies, the cultus of Saint Opportuna has always flourished locally, as a patroness of Alman√®ches and among the patrons of Paris; she was praised in the acta of her kinsman, Chrodegang/Godegrand. During the reign of Charles the Bald, according to the sources, Vikings invaded; both the convent at Montreuil and the abbey at Almen√®ches were destroyed, and her relics were translated to the priory of Moussy. Later they were moved to Senlis. In 1374, her right arm and a rib were enshrined in a small church dedicated to her in Paris, near a hermitage called Notre Dame des Bois Paris. As the city grew, so did the church. Most of Opportuna's head still rests at Moussy, while her left arm and part of her skull are still at Almen√®ches; additionally, a jaw bone can be found in the priory of Saint Chrodegang at √éle-Adam. Her shrine in Paris is carried in processions along with the relics of Saints Honor√© and Genevi√®ve. =Iconography= In art, Saint Opportuna is often depicted carrying an abbess's crozier and a casket of relics. She may also be shown with the Virgin appearing at her deathbed or as a princess with a basket of cherries and a fleur-de-lys. Notes 1. Meaning \\"little monastery\\", it later gave its name to Montreuil-la-Cambe. 2. He should probably not be conflated with Chrodegang of Metz. 3. Opportuna's brother is identified with Saint Chrodegang of Metz by at least one source. However, Opportuna's story, which places him as Bishop of S√©ez and being murdered by a rival while on the road to Montreuil, is not mentioned in any resources relating to his life, which state instead that he died on 6 March 776 at Metz. 4. Lacking opportunities for public careers, their lives offered few events. Three Merovingian hagiographies of female saints circulated widely: Genevi√®ve of Paris (d. 502), Venantius Fortunatus' vita of Radegund (d. 587) and that of Gertrude of Nivelles. To these can be added the Hiberno-Latin vita of Brigid (Smith 1995:13). 5. Here, Adalhelm envisions her being summoned to Heaven by Cecilia and Lucy. 6. The Siege of Paris (885-886) took place during the reign of Charles the Fat, who may have been intended. 7.

Born at Bandung in the midst of political transition of the country from the Dutch colonial era to the independent republic of Indonesia, Kerton's paintings exhibited the revolutionary era of Indonesia. He was an artist of a generation that was globally aware, politically active, and intensely involved with aesthetic and formal questions. Kerton is recognized as one of Indonesia‚Äôs most original and controversial artists. Biography As a young man, Kerton had many interactions with both Indonesians and Dutch residents. After Indonesian independence, Kerton joined with other artists working with the new national government of Sukarno, and became an artistic journalist. His drawings documented the Indonesian independence efforts on the battlefield, at the negotiation table, and in secret underground meetings. During the Indonesia revolution period, Kerton's ideology went along with the anti-Dutch movements that he had to move from Jakarta to Yogyakarta. Through his sketches and drawings, he immortalized several important historical events, including the sovereignty transfer from the Dutch to Indonesia in 1949. His fierce sense of nationalism carried over into his work, and many of his paintings convey a sense of pride in his country. In the early 1950s, Kerton studied art and life in very different cultures in Europe, including the Netherlands and France.Wright, Astri. (2000). Sudjana Kerton at the Mexican Embassy, Jakarta. Jakarta Post / artdesigncafe. Retrieved 1 June 2013. He also visited Mexico, where he studied the role of artists during the Mexican revolution. Kerton studied at the Art Student League at New York City, where he learned from Yasuo Kuniyoshi and Harry Sternberg. Kerton‚Äôs woodcut entitled Homeward was chosen by the UNICEF for their Christmas card in 1964. The woodcut depicts a family returning home from a daily work at the fields. Kerton settled in the New York City, married, and raised a family. He returned to Indonesia in 1976.

The company is responsible for the master community planning of Valencia and previously developed other areas such as Canyon Country and Newhall which together with Saugus and Valencia would merge to create the city of Santa Clarita in 1987. The company is also responsible for the management of farm land elsewhere in the state. Company history The company was incorporated on July 1, 1883, by the five sons of Henry Newhall (William, Edwin, Henry, Walter, and George), a businessman who had purchased a number of former Mexican land grants. Newhall had died the previous year and had instructed his sons not to sell the land. The company initially had 143,000 acres (579 km¬≤) of land, ranging from Monterey to Los Angeles counties. Unfortunately, the income generated by ranching was not enough to support the families of all five sons in the comfortable lifestyle they had grown up with, and they began to sell off portions of their vast holdings in order to generate income. Successive land sales allowed the Newhalls to maintain their lifestyle, but William (who was known by his middle name Mayo), a graduate of Yale University, understood that they needed a better way to generate income. After a few more land sales, Mayo took the income and reinvested it into the land by developing agriculture. The land around their headquarters, the former Rancho San Francisco, was cleared for citrus trees, and lima beans were planted in the Sacramento Valley. The income from these crops allowed the company to grow in the 1920s. Additionally, one more land sale, a 38,000 acre (150 km¬≤) parcel in 1922 to William Randolph Hearst for $1 million (to be paid in installments over ten years) helped fill the company's coffers. The collapse of the St. Francis Dam in 1928 was devastating to the company. Much of its livestock, orchards, and buildings were destroyed. Although the city of Los Angeles agreed to pay reparations for its role in the dam's construction, those payments would not be available for some time. Compounding the problem was the onset of the Great Depression. George Newhall, who was the last surviving of Mayo's brothers and treasurer of the company, died that year, and Mayo discovered that the company was bankrupt and on the brink of insolvency. At this point, Mayo was in his late seventies and growing increasingly frail. He turned the operation over to his son-in-law, Atholl McBean, a San Francisco businessman who had held onto his entire savings during the Wall Street Crash. With McBean's money, the company was able to hold on long enough for the reparations payments to come through. That, combined with the last of the Hearst payments, was enough for the company to climb out of debt. By his third year in charge, Newhall Land and Farming reported a profit of $25,000 and by 1935, they resumed dividend payments, the first since 1930. Henry Newhall had purchased Rancho San Francisco from speculators who had purchased it from Ygnacio del Valle in the hopes of finding crude oil. Alex Mentry had discovered oil in 1876 just to the south of the rancho (which became the Pico Canyon Oilfield), but the group of investors who sold to Newhall had had no such luck. McBean was convinced no oil was to be found on the land, which by now he had renamed Newhall Ranch, but he leased it to Barnscall Oil Company anyway. To his great astonishment, Barnscall struck oil in 1937 and there was so much oil that over the next few years, 44 oil wells were producing millions of dollars of \\"black gold\\" for the company, which ended all of their cash flow problems. By the 1950s, urbanization began to encroach on Newhall Ranch. The County of Los Angeles, hoping to encourage more residential development, changed its rules for property taxes, taxing land at what its \\"best use\\" would be, regardless of its actual use. Newhall Ranch was assessed to be a residential zone, which substantially increased the tax burden of Newhall Land and Farming (the Williamson Act would be enacted in 1965 to counteract this problem, but it came too late for Newhall Ranch). McBean understood that agriculture alone was not going to pay the taxes, and that if the land was to be designated for residential homes, the company might as well head in that direction. Real estate developers made offers to buy the land, but family members did not want to sell pieces of the family homestead. Instead, McBean hired city planners and the company opted to create a brand new city, which would be called Valencia after the oranges they had grown for so many years. Construction began in the early 1960s, the Master Plan was adopted in 1965, and in 1967 the first new homeowners moved in. McBean retired soon after, turning over the company to non-family members. During the next two decades, the company continued to flourish. Valencia experienced steady growth and garnered praise as a planned city. During 1971 the city saw the opening of Magic Mountain amusement park, which was sold to Six Flags in 1979. In the 1980s, the company expanded its oil interests to seven states and Canada, and found another revenue source in leasing its land for film and television show production. In 1994, the company submitted plans to the county for a new master-planned community to be named *Newhall Ranch. In 2004 the company was purchased by Lennar Corporation and LNR Corporation for approximately $1 billion, leaving Newhall Land and Farming owning 50% and Lennar and its industrial and commercial properties spinoff LNR owning the other 50% through a new holding company called LandSource Communities Development LLC.http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sg012804.htm In early 2007, by a further transaction, Lennar and LNR each sold 34% interests in LandSource Communities Development LLC to a new set of investors, including the California Public Employees Retirement System. In June 2008, LandSource Communities Development LLC, along with Newhall Land and Farming Company and other subsidiaries, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In July 2009, LandSource Communities Development LLC and its subsidiaries emerged from bankruptcy under a new control structure with a new set of owners. =Baca Grant= The firm owned Luis Maria Baca Grant No. 4, near Crestone, Colorado in Saguache County, Colorado in the San Luis Valley from 1951 until 1962 when, retaining the mineral rights, Newhall sold it to Arizona-Colorado Land and Cattle Company.

Styled around the Chicago blues clubs, it is a long, narrow venue in a building built in 1921. Around 1971, Jim Ludwig, Bill Kennedy, and Don Chamberlin purchased the bar. Larry Boehmer, a Master of Fine Arts student at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln at the time, promoted the bar to his fellow artists. He booked the first band in 1973 and was sole owner by 1977. Boehmer met Chicago musician and promoter Bob Riedy and formed a connection that brought many revered Chicago artists to the Lincoln club. Because of this connection, the Zoo Bar was the first white club that Magic Slim ever played. In 1975 he had never ventured outside the clubs in Chicago's African-American neighborhoods. In 1977, Boehmer was the sole owner and the Zoo was established as an important stop for bands on the touring circuit. The first band Boehmer booked to play in the club was The Cotton Blues Band in the summer of 1973. The first national act to play at the bar was Luther Allison in September 1974. Musical acts have included: Bernard Allison, Luther Allison, Dave Alvin, Billy Bacon and the Forbidden Pigs, Tab Benoit, Tommy Castro, Albert Collins, Robert Cray, Deke Dickerson, Bo Diddley, Chris Duarte, Lil Ed and the Blues Imperials, Tinsley Ellis, Rick Estrin, Anson Funderburgh, Buddy Guy, the Hacienda Brothers, John Hammond, The Belairs, James Harman, Mark Hummel, Candye Kane, Jay McShann, Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy, Charlie Musselwhite, Rod Piazza, Ana Popovic, Otis Rush, Doug Sahm, Curtis Salgado, Gina Sicilia, Magic Slim, Watermelon Slim, Son Seals, Koko Taylor, Junior Wells, Kim Wilson, and Link Wray.

Magic Slim and his band were regular performers at the bar, playing week-long stints. In the 1990s, Magic Slim moved his family from Chicago to Lincoln. In 1993 the Zoo Bar won the Blues Foundation's Keeping the Blues Alive Award for Club of the Year. James Harman wrote a song on behalf of the club called \\"Everybody's Rockin' (At The Zoo Bar)\\", which can be found on Harman's 1995 Black And White CD. In 2000 Larry Boehmer retired and passed the bar on to his sons, Jeff and Tim Boehmer, and Pete Watters; Jeff and Pete are partners in the club now. On September 4, 2012, Larry Boehmer died after struggling with lung cancer. Many not only remember Larry as a visual artist and blues player, but as a community builder. In July 2013, the bar celebrated its 40th anniversary.

Etc. later filling the dancefloor to tunes by the latest indie gods such as Suede, pulp etc. Characters always filled the club. There was \\"roller guy\\" who wore roller boots and took photos all night, \\"daddy Acid\\" who used to walk around with a bowl of fruit (apparently laced with Acid tabs). It was a real hive and buzzing place of individual clubbers. The tramshed which opened later was home to the upcoming dance scene and often played hours of trance with old black and white movies playing on a huge screen. Drugs became a huge problem within the clubs and that was the start of the demise. Theo sold up and it was then that the clubs took on a new crowd mainly underage drinkers. The Tramshed and Zoo Bars were side-by-side nightclubs in Halifax featuring rock, emo, indie, punk and ska music. They were located on Lord Street close to the former site of Samuel Webster's Fountain Head Brewery. The property the clubs were located in has now been demolished and the land used for social housing. Police officers raided the nightclub on 18 November 2005. During the raid, police reportedly identified 420 of the 500 people in the club to be underage drinkers.Courts try new ways to close down rowdy pubs. The Times 25 November 2005. More than a dozen youths were arrested following scuffles with the police. A 28-day temporary closure order was applied for by the police on 27 November 2005. This 2005 incident was cited as the third such raid of the Tramshed and Zoo Bar in which under-age drinking was proven. Previous occasions included December 2003, when almost half of the 150 revellers were found to be under 18. At that time the youngest was 13 and a member of the bar staff was 15. In July 2004, more under-age drinkers were found. Immediately after that incident, attempts to revoke the license under the old licensing laws failed.

Many of the artists came from the West Yorkshire area and usually performed the Punk, Ska or Indie genres of music. The bands that performed have gone on to receive varying degrees of national acclaim. Bands which have performed at The Zoo Bar include well known acts such as The Prophecy, Old Man's Child, thesevenmachine, Worm and Lymph. For an extended period during 2004-2005, in response to the increased attendances on Friday nights (and as a result the decreased popularity of the club on a Saturday) a stage was set up and bands encouraged to perform on Saturdays. The night was sponsored by local music shop First Floor Music. The Tram-Shed part of the nightclub has also previously played host to the heats of 2005 The Pulse of West Yorkshire battle of the bands.

Originally known as Seven Mile Beach, it was renamed after the wife of the then Governor, Sir Hercules Robinson. Isolated settlements separated from the beach by sand dunes were also given the name of Lady Robinson's Beach as their postal address. Being Sydney's longest beach, Lady Robinsons Beach is the eastern boundary of the area known as the St George District. It is also the eastern boundary of the Municipality of Rockdale and of the suburbs of Kyeemagh, Brighton-Le-Sands, Monterey, Ramsgate Beach, Sans Souci, Dolls Point and Sandringham. Geology Lady Robinsons Beach was formed by the erosion of the Hawkesbury sandstone which is still evident as rocky outcrops and cliffs located 1-3 kilometres west of the beach. The sand of the beach and its dunes is a pale yellow, almost white at parts (such as in Dolls Point), and is fine-grained. Nonetheless, it is the most whitest beach in the Sydney area. The beach is limited to the north and to the south by the Wianamatta shale through which the Cooks River and Georges River and their tributaries have carved their lower reaches and mouths. Marshes form and mangroves grow in the eroded shale. These marshes and mangroves restricted access from the north to what became the St George district south of Cooks River. In the early years of settlement these marshes caused numerous other problems for the nearby suburbs. These two types of rock form an integral part of the geological entity, the Sydney Basin SydneyBasin. Ecology The underwater sand flats adjacent to the beach were the habitat of a number of mollusc species, including sand-snails (Uber species), wedge- pipis (Amesodesma species) and Bankivia. Their shells littered the beach. After their habitat was destroyed by a storm in 1966 these species disappeared. The shells found on the beach after this disaster were those of molluscs inhabiting the mudflats of the Georges River and southern part of Botany Bay. These include the Sydney cockle (Anadara trapezia), the large Sydney whelk also known as the Hercules club shell (Pyrazus australis) and a similar, smaller whelk, (Velacumantis ebininus). Before the third runway of Sydney Airport was extended in the late 1950s, nereid worms were abundant on sand flats at the northern end of the beach. These sand flats were covered with very shallow water which warmed in the sun during daylight hours, encouraging the colourful worms to emerge from their burrows. History =1770‚Äî1880= Lady Robinsons Beach is approximately 5 km long, starting from Kyeemagh in the north to Sandringham in the south. It is located on the western shores of Botany Bay, or to the left of Sydney Airport on the map. Although they didn't land it in it, this beach is one of the first landmarks that Captain James Cook and his crew in 1770, and later Captain Arthur Phillip and his crew in 1788, would have seen as they sailed through the mouth of Botany Bay. In 1839 a dam with a carriageway was constructed across the Cooks River from what are now Tempe to Arncliffe. This dam remained the major access to the district south of the river for approximately the next fifty years. About five years later Rocky Point Road was built from the tiny settlement south of the dam to Rocky Point on Georges River. This new road meant land access was now closer to Seven Mile Beach. It took longer still for the pioneers to cut their way further east to reach the coast and Seven Mile Beach. Timber harvesting assisted in pushing tracks through to the coast. When land grants were eventually made in the area it was found that for most of the land the scrub was difficult to clear and that the deep sandy soil was unsuitable for agriculture or grazing. The land was deemed suitable for pig- farming, poultry-farming and their associated industries. Also, swamps were soon found to exist only about one kilometre inland from the beach. By contrast, at the northern end of the area, Muddy Creek overflowed frequently, leaving behind a much richer alluvial soil which was suitable for the growing of vegetables. Market gardening along the eastern bank of Muddy Creek continued for over 130 years. The abundance of shells on the beach meant the establishment of lime-burning facilities. Fishing in the area was very good in the relatively sheltered bay. Small settlements soon developed close to the beach. In 1871 Rockdale was made a municipality. Local government assumed much of the responsibility for management of the district, including the settlements along the foreshore of the bay, collectively known as Lady Robinson's Beach. The opening of Rockdale Station on the new railway line in 1884 heralded considerable expansion for the coastline of the bay. Two roads linked Rocky Point Road to the beach: Bay Street to New Brighton and Sandringham Street (built in 1875 and gravelled in 1877) which led to a foreshore hotel near Dolls Point. In the mid-1880s Bestic Street, west of Muddy Creek and Goodes Road to its east were linked by a bridge over the creek and the road was extended to reach the beach. Initially Bestic Street was proposed as the site of the tramway. Instead the tramway was built along Bay Street, further extending access to the beach. At the beginning of this era the region was deemed to be semi-rural; but, during its last few years, the locale was up-graded to suburban status). =Modern history= mouth of Georges River. When the Sydney postal service was extended to Rockdale the settlements along the coastline were collectively included in the Rockdale postal district, with the name of their sub-district, Lady Robinsons Beach, enclosed in brackets. At a later date the postal sub-district of Brighton-le- Sands (attached to the postal district of Rockdale) was extended to include the whole area from Cooks River to Sandringham Road. Gradually, over time, these settlements along the coastline increased in size until each was given its own post office and independent suburban status. The first of these were Brighton-le-Sands and Sandringham separated by President Avenue. Now there is contiguous development along the full length of the coastline. From north to south these suburbs are Kyeemagh, Brighton-Le-Sands, Monterey, Ramsgate Beach and Dolls Point. Between Lady Robinsons Beach and The Grande Parade, which has housing along its western border only, lies Cook Park. Initially Grand Parade (as The Grand Parade is popularly called) ran north from Bay Street, Brighton- le-Sands to Selwood Street. Later the road was extended further north to Bestic Street. The Esplanade ran south from Bay Street, Brighton-le-Sands along the coast line to Burlington Street. Later The Esplanade was extended to Sandringham Street, Ramsgate (now Ramsgate Beach). Eventually the entire road from Bestic Street in the north to Sandringham Street in the south was named The Grand Parade. The swimming baths at Brighton-le-Sands remained the only sea baths along this beach for over 60 years. In the 1950s the Cook Park Camp at Kyeemagh was closed and the high sand dunes were cleared so that a second swimming baths could be built. These baths also catered to people of the Mascot/Botany area as they could travel to the park by bus. Earlier the Kyeemagh sand dunes had also been used extensively for sand-boarding (sliding down the face of a dune on a polished wooden board). In the mid-1930s at Ramsgate, a recreation ground comprising a zoo and baths (concrete pools) suitable for competitive swimming and for the teaching of swimming and a toddlers' pool were constructed at the corner of Grand Parade and Ramsgate Road. When these baths were sold and a shopping precinct was erected on the site in the mid-1970s sea baths were built at the nearby beach and Cook Park in the area was developed as a picnic site. In the mid-1940s it was decided to build a third runway for the Sydney Airport. This runway was to jut out into Botany Bay at the position of the mouth of the Cooks River. It took several years to relocate the mouth of the river to its current position and to landfill the former mouth of the river. This relocating of the mouth of the river allowed for widening and deepening of the mouth of the river and the now adjacent mouth of the river's tributary, Muddy Creek. The widened and deepened mouth of Muddy Creek was renamed Kyeemagh Canal. One consequence of this change in position of the mouth of the river also meant the shortening of and other modifications to Lady Robinsons Beach. The changes in Muddy Creek allowed boating facilities and so the Brighton Fishermans Club ( formerly the Brighton-le-Sands Amateur Fishmans Club) was formed. Incidents Although regarded as a safe beach with a low hazard rating of 2,Dolls Point NSW by Beachsafe.org Dolls Point Beach has had a few incidents, such as the drowning of two young men in 2007 and a 5-year-old boy in 2013,Family despair after five-year-old boy swept away in Sandringham by the Sydney Morning Herald and a near-drowning of an 8-year-old girl in 2015.Near-drowning scare with girl, 8, unconscious in water at Dolls Point by The Leader As a result of these incidents, the locals called for the City of Rockdale to prohibit swimming at the hazardous section and install warning signs, with more than 4000 people signing a petition on change.org.More than 4,000 sign petition to close beach at Dolls Point where five-year-old Ayman Ksebe died by The Daily Telegraph Consequentially, new signs were installed, encouraging people to swim in netted areas only as the nearby sand banks can create the semblance that waters are shallow, when there is actually a deep river channel with a strong current, which is the part of the beach that is deceptively dangerous with shifting sands, a big drop-off and rips. The Council said these incidents were caused by the staunch changes to the beach through erosion and sand build-up along the beachfront on Botany Bay, since the construction of the third runway at Sydney Airport.No swimming at Dolls Point danger spot: Rockdale Council approves councillor motion by The Leader Lady Robinsons Beach has not been identified as a coastal erosion hotspot, due to the fact that there are no houses in the area that are threatened.

To measure the fineness of sheep wool fiber before microscopes and lasers were used, English wool handlers in the city of Bradford described wool by estimating (with experienced eyes) how many 560-yard hanks of single strand yarn could be made by a good spinner from a pound of \\"top.\\" (Top is cleaned combed wool with the fibers all parallel). The finer the average diameter of a single wool fiber, the more hanks could be spun. From a pound of \\"64s,\\" for example, sixty-four such hanks could be made (more than 20 miles!). From the finest wools, more than 80 hanks could be spun; from the strongest, perhaps 36 or fewer. Using ranges denoted by the stronger end (that is ‚Äú44s‚Äù ran up to ‚Äú46s‚Äù), wool lots were classified and prices derived. The Bradford count may be biased no matter how experienced the rater is; also it relies heavily on number of crimps (regular undulations) per inch, which has a not-very-strong correlation with actual average fiber diameter. More objective measuring systems are replacing its use in the international market, although the Bradford System is still widely used among shepherds and breed associations. In 1968, the United States Department of Agriculture issued official standards (for the U.S.A. only, not applicable worldwide) which assigned ranges of average fiber diameter (AFD) and maximum standard deviation to each of the Bradford counts. For example, wool with average fiber diameter in micrometers from 28.60 to 30.09 was to be called \\"54s.\\" In the last ten years, objective measurement of several fiber characteristics has become faster and more available and is likely to replace the Bradford count system in all commercial arenas. The spinning count will not disappear overnight. Average fiber diameter, although a salient characteristic of sheep breeds and the major determinant of end-uses for wool, is only one of many factors that determines wool quality.

Researches in mycology Broome became interested in natural history whilst at Swaffham Prior and later, with his friend G.H.K. Thwaites, in Clifton. He developed an expertise in fungi, sending many of his collections to the Rev. M.J. Berkeley. Together, Berkeley and Broome published a series of \\"Notices of British Fungi\\" over a 37-year period, jointly describing no less than 550 new species. The two mycologists also collaborated on descriptions of fungi collected in Sri Lanka by Thwaites and on collections from Brisbane, Australia. Broome published little on his own, mainly accounts of local fungi from Somerset and Wiltshire. His particular interest was in truffles and truffle-like fungi, but he collected widely and carefully. On his death, his herbarium contained some 40,000 fungal specimens, which are now at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.Ainsworth, G.C. (1996). Brief biographies of British mycologists. Stourbridge: British Mycological Society His botanical specimens and library were willed to the Bath Royal Literary & Scientific Institution, where they remain. Broome became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1866. The fungal genera Broomeia and Broomella were named after him, together with over a dozen fungal species, including Nectriopsis broomeana, Nitschkia broomeana, Ramaria broomei, and the truffle-like Melanogaster broomeanus.

Life and career His father was Hotta Masamori, advisor (Tair≈ç) under the previous sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, who committed seppuku upon Iemitsu's death in 1651. Masatoshi was then adopted by Iemitsu's nurse, Kasuga no Tsubone. He served as personal secretary to the next sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Ietsuna, for a time, before being appointed wakadoshiyori (junior councillor) in 1670. Ietsuna was already quite ill when Masatoshi was appointed r≈çj≈´ in 1679, and died the following summer. At this time, another r≈çj≈´, Sakai Tadakiyo, in a bid for personal power, proposed that the next sh≈çgun be selected from the princely houses. He sought to be regent to this new sh≈çgun, who would be made a puppet ruler. However, Masatoshi, said to have been infuriated, voiced strong opposition to this scheme; Tadakiyo resigned his post shortly afterwards, and Ietsuna's brother Tokugawa Tsunayoshi was installed as the new shogun. Masatoshi became Tair≈ç soon afterwards, and was granted a domain worth 13,000 koku by Tsunayoshi. He was killed several years later, on 7 October 1684. The motives of the culprit, Masatoshi's cousin Inaba Masayasu, are unknown. Following Masatoshi's death, Tsunayoshi took the opportunity to reorganize the shogunate's offices so as to weaken the r≈çj≈´ and grant additional powers to the Soba-y≈çnin (Chamberlains).

Spacecraft history  Galaxy started life as twin spacecraft named Guardian which would have acted as 45% scale intermediates between the one-third size Genesis I & Genesis II pathfinders and the full size BA 330 man-rated module. Sometime after 2004, the two Guardian flights were split into the Galaxy module and larger Sundancer module, each testing progressively advanced systems.

In 2007, the parameters for Galaxy were again modified, with final specifications being for a spacecraft in length, in diameter and with of interior volume‚Äî45% greater than the Genesis modules. It was intended for launch in late 2008. In August 2007, however, Bigelow Aerospace announced that due to rising launch costs (stated as three times more expensive than for previous launches) and the successful Genesis missions, the Galaxy spacecraft would not be launched. Instead, many of the module's systems‚Äîpossibly the entire craft‚Äîwould be constructed and ground tested, allowing Bigelow employees to gain further experience and potentially advance Sundancer's schedule.  Systems  A number of advanced and experimental systems were to be flight tested aboard Galaxy. Among the most notable upgrades were improved avionics and attitude control systems, a more damage-resistant interior air barrier and expanded communications bandwidth capabilities. Also on the manifest were larger, more efficient, articulated solar arrays and supporting battery systems, and flight qualifications would be performed on elements of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). Galaxy would have included more efficient structural components, lending to easier upscaling to larger spacecraft, and was to carry a view port and access hatch, though no docking port would be included on this flight.

In 1958, at age 21, Edwards backstopped the Whitby Dunlops, Canada's representative, to the IIHF World Hockey Championship at Oslo, Norway. He posted a perfect 7‚Äì0 record in the eight-team round-robin tournament. In those seven games, Edwards played every minute. He recorded three shutouts and surrendered just six total goals to achieve an impressive 0.86 goals-against average. In 1960 he became property of the Chicago Black Hawks. His name was engraved on the Stanley Cup in 1961 even though he never played a single game for Chicago. (In fact he did not play his first NHL game until 1967-68.) Edwards' road to the NHL was a long, winding one. In nine years, he played for seven teams in four leagues. On June 6, 1967 the Pittsburgh Penguins selected him in the expansion draft, but traded him to the Detroit Red Wings the very next day. In 1967‚Äì68, Roger Crozier, the Red Wings' first-string goaltender, retired due to illness, and Edwards was called upon to take his place. He led the team in games and wins for four consecutive seasons. A collision in 1970 with an opposing forward and the goalpost caused a hairline fracture in Edwards' skull, and this caused him headaches and dizzy spells. His health caused him to retire, but only briefly. He made a comeback with the Pittsburgh Penguins, and after one season there he returned to the Wings. He had his best season in 1972‚Äì73: he won 27 games and led the NHL with six shutouts. The following season, he lost his first three games and retired for good.

This helicopter demonstrated Bell's Cobra II design at the Farnborough Airshow in 1980. The Cobra II was to be equipped with Hellfire missiles, a new targeting system and improved engines. The later Cobra 2000 proposal included General Electric T700 engines and a four-blade rotor. This design drew interest from the US Marine Corps, but funding was not available. In 1993, Bell proposed an AH-1W-based version for the UK's new attack helicopter program. The derivative CobraVenom featured a modern digital cockpit and could carry TOWs, Hellfire or Brimstone missiles. The CobraVenom design was altered in 1995 by changing to a four-blade rotor system.

BAFF is also known as B Lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS) and TNF- and APOL- related leukocyte expressed ligand (TALL-1) and the Dendritic cell-derived TNF-like molecule (CD257 antigen; cluster of differentiation 257).  Structure and function  BAFF is a cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. This cytokine is a ligand for receptors TNFRSF13B/TACI, TNFRSF17/BCMA, and TNFRSF13C/BAFF-R. This cytokine is expressed in B cell lineage cells, and acts as a potent B cell activator. It has been also shown to play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of B cells. BAFF is a 285-amino acid long peptide glycoprotein which undergoes glycosylation at residue 124. It is expressed as a membrane- bound type II transmembrane protein on various cell types including monocytes, dendritic cells and bone marrow stromal cells. The transmembrane form can be cleaved from the membrane, generating a soluble protein fragment. BAFF steady-state concentrations depend on B cells and also on the expression of BAFF-binding receptors. BAFF is the natural ligand of three unusual tumor necrosis factor receptors named BAFF-R (BR3), TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor), and BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), all of which have differing binding affinities for it. These receptors are expressed mainly on mature B lymphocytes and their expression varies in dependence of B cell maturation (TACI is also found on a subset of T-cells and BCMA on plasma cells). BAFF-R is involved in the positive regulation during B cell development. TACI binds worst since its affinity is higher for a protein similar to BAFF, called a proliferation- inducing ligand (APRIL). BCMA displays an intermediate binding phenotype and will work with either BAFF or APRIL to varying degrees. Signaling through BAFF-R and BCMA stimulates B lymphocytes to undergo proliferation and to counter apoptosis. All these ligands act as homotrimers (i.e. three of the same molecule) interacting with homotrimeric receptors, although BAFF has been known to be active as either a hetero- or homotrimer (can aggregate into 60-mer depending on the primary structure of the protein).  Interactions  B-cell activating factor has been shown to interact with TNFRSF13B, TNFSF13, TNFRSF13C, and TNFRSF17. Interaction between BAFF and BAFF-R activates classical and noncanonical NF-Œ∫B signaling pathways. This interaction triggers signals essential for the formation and maintenance of B cell, thus it is important for a B-cell survival.  Recombinant production  Human BLyS has been expressed and purified in E. Coli. The BLyS protein in the engineered bacteria can be as much as 50% to the bacteria's total protein content and still retains activity after a purification procedure.  Clinical significance  As an immunostimulant, BAFF (BLyS, TALL-1) is necessary for maintaining normal immunity. Inadequate level of BAFF will fail to activate B cells to produce enough immunoglobulin and will lead to immunodeficiency. Excessive level of BAFF causes abnormally high antibody production, results in systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and many other autoimmune diseases. Overexpression of BAFF also correlates with enhanced humoral immunity against malaria infection. Belimumab (Benlysta) is a monoclonal antibody developed by Human Genome Sciences and GlaxoSmithKline, with significant discovery input by Cambridge Antibody Technology, which specifically recognizes and inhibits the biological activity of B-Lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and is in clinical trials for treatment of Systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases. BAFF has been found in renal transplant biopsies with acute rejection and correlate with appearance C4d. Increased levels of BAFF may initiate alloreactive B cell and T cell immunity, therefore may promote allograft rejection. Lower level of BAFF transcripts (or a higher level of soluble BAFF) show a higher risk of producing donor-specific antibodies in the investigated patients. Donor-specific antibodies bind with high affinity to the vascular endothelium of graft and activate complement. This process result in neutrophils infiltration, hemorrhage, fibrin deposition and platelet aggregation. Targeting BAFF-R interactions may provide new therapeutic possibilities in transplantation. Blisibimod, a fusion protein inhibitor of BAFF, is in development by Anthera Pharmaceuticals, also primarily for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. BAFF may also be a new mediator of food-related inflammation. Higher levels of BAFF are present in non-atopic compared with atopic patients, and there is not any correlation between BAFF and IgE, suggesting that BAFF might be particularly involved in non-IgE-mediated reactions. In patients with celiac disease, serum BAFF levels are reduced after a gluten-free diet. The same reduction could be present in the recently defined ‚ÄúNon Celiac Gluten sensitivity‚Äù (a reaction to gluten which provokes almost the same symptoms of celiac disease and could involve up to 20% of apparently healthy individuals. BAFF is also a specific inducer of insulin resistance and can be a strong link between inflammation and diabetes or obesity. BAFF gives the organism a sort of danger signal and usually, according to the evolutionary theories, every human being responds to danger activating thrifty genes in order to store fat and to avoid starvation. BAFF shares many activities with PAF (Platelet Activating Factor) and they are both markers of non-IgE-mediated reactions in food-reactivity.

The route travels from Highway 7 east of Elginfield north to Highway 9 and Highway 89 in Harriston. The total length of Highway 23 is . The highway was first established in 1927 between Highway 8 in Mitchell and Highway 9 in Teviotdale, via Monkton, Listowel and Palmerston. As part of a depression relief program, it was extended south to Highway 7 in 1934. It remained relatively unchanged until 2003, when it was rerouted northward from Palmerston to Harriston.  Route description  Highway 23 begins at Highway 7, east of Elginfield, a community straddling the boundary between the municipalities of Middlesex Centre and Lucan Biddulph. The route travels north through the latter, surrounded on both sides by farmland. At Whalen Corners, the highway curves northeast as it exits Middlesex County, becoming the boundary road between Huron County to the west and Perth County to the east. The highway passes through the communities of Woodham and Kirkton, crossing completely into Perth County just north of the latter. It later enters Russeldale, meeting the eastern terminus of former Highway 83 (County Road 83) as it swerves north. Approximately beyond there it enters the town of Mitchell, where it is known as Blanchard Street. The route intersects Highway 8 (Huron Street), and becomes concurrent with it briefly to cross the North Thames River before branching back northeast along St. George Street. Midway between Mitchell and the village of Monkton, the highway bisects the community of Bornholm within the municipality of West Perth. Prior to entering Monkton, Highway 23 curves gently towards the southeast; In the middle of the village, drivers must turn at an intersection with Perth County Road 55 to remain on Highway 23. Highway 8 and Highway 23 cross the North Thames River in Mitchell Continuing its northeasterly course, the highway passes through more farmland, now within the town of North Perth, and serves the communities of Newry and Atwood before encountering former Highway 86 (County Road 86) on the western edge of Listowel. South of this intersection, the route is known locally as Mitchell Road South. It turns southeast onto Main Street West, where it once travelled concurrently with Highway 86 before turning northeast onto Wallace Avenue North. The final leg of the route passes through the village of Gowanstown. The route gently curves to the east before turning north at an intersection just west of Palmerston, where it crosses the boundary into Wellington County and the Town of Minto. Eight kilometres (5 miles) north of the intersection, Highway 23 encounters the western terminus of former Highway 87 (County Road 87), where it turns east then northeast. The route enters Harriston, where it is locally known as Arthur Street. The Highway 23 designation ends at a junction with Highway 9 and Wellington County Road 109 (formerly a segment of Highway 9), locally known as Elora Street. The road continues beyond the junction as Highway 89.  History  Highway 23 was first established on June 22, 1927, when the Department of Highways assumed the road from Mitchell to Teviotdale through Perth and Wellington counties, via Monkton, Listowel and Palmerston, connecting Highway 8 and Highway 9. As part of depression relief work undertaken by the department during the early 1930s, Highway 23 was extended from Highway 8 to Highway 7 east of Elginfield on July 11, 1934. Highway 23 remained unaltered between 1934 and 1998. On January 1, 1998, the section from the Highway 89 junction west of Palmerston to Highway 9 in Teviotdale was decommissioned, resulting in the northern terminus of Highway 23 becoming the western terminus of Highway 89. During the spring of 2003, the segment of Highway 89 between this junction and Harriston was renumbered as Highway 23, resulting in the current routing.

He was given to the National Zoo on April 30, 1891 by James E. Cooper, owner and manager of the Adam Forepaugh Circus. When Dunk first arrived at the National Zoo, he had no shelter and was tied to a tree with his companion Gold Dust to prevent him from wandering. Once a day, both elephants were walked to Rock Creek to swim. A temporary structure, known as the Octagonal House, was eventually built for the elephants. Construction on a permanent, brick elephant house, designed by Hornblower & Marshall, began in September 1902 and was completed in January 1903. Dunk was ill throughout the winter of 1917. On March 30, 1917, after Dunk broke his shoulder in a fall, keeper William Blackburne euthanized him by shooting. Despite a famous ill-temper, Dunk was popular with the children of Washington, D.C. To commemorate his memory, they raised money for a plaque, which remains in the elephant house at the National Zoo today.

The Chinese arrived in the U.S. in large numbers on the West Coast in the 1850s and 1860s to work in the gold mines and railroads. They encountered very strong opposition‚Äîviolent as riots and physical attacks forced them out of the gold mines (citation needed). The Central Pacific railroad hired thousands, but after the line was finished in 1869 they were hounded out of many railroad towns in states such as Wyoming and Nevada. Most wound up in Chinatowns‚Äîareas of large cities which the police largely ignored. The Chinese were further alleged to be \\"coolies\\" and were said to be not suitable for becoming independent thoughtful voters because of their control by tongs. The same negative reception hit the Asians who migrated to Mexico and Canada.Lee (2005)Alexander Saxton, Indispensable Enemy: Labor and the Anti-Chinese Movement in California (1971) The Japanese arrived in large numbers 1890‚Äì1907, many going to Hawaii (an independent country until 1898), and others to the West Coast. Hostility was very high on the West Coast, but not especially violent. Hawaii was a multicultural society in which the Japanese experienced about the same level of distrust as other groups. Indeed, they were the largest population group by 1910, and after 1950 took political control of Hawaii. The Japanese on the West Coast of the U.S. (as well as Canada and Latin America) were interned during World War II, but very few on Hawaii at the Honouliuli Internment Camp. Historiography According to Chan (1996), the historiography of Asians in America falls into four periods. The 1870s to the 1920s saw partisan debates over curtailing Chinese and Japanese immigration; \\"Yellow Peril\\" diatribes battled strong, missionary-based defenses of the immigrants. Studies written from the 1920s to the 1960s were dominated by social scientists, who focused on issues of assimilation and social organization, as well as the World War II internment camps. Activist revisionism marked the 1960s to the early 1980s as a new wave of Asian- American scholars rejected the dominant assimilationist paradigm, and instead turned to classical Marxism and internal colonialist models. Starting in the early 1980s there was an increased stress on human agency. Only after 1990 has there been much scholarship by professional historians.

Ancestry One of his great-grandfathers was Henry Colley (d.1700) (or Cowley) of Castle Carbery, King's County, Ireland. That family from Rutland, England settled in Ireland ' Henry VIII, where they were distinguished soldiers and administrators. Henry's sister Elizabeth married Garret (or Gerald) Wesley I of Dangan, Meath, younger son of Valerian Wesley and Ann Cusack (see legacy below). Henry's youngest son by Mary Usher, only daughter of Sir William Usher of Dublin, was Richard Colley (d.1758) who in 1728, on the death without issue of his first cousin Garret Wesley II inherited the Wesley estates with the proviso in the will that he and his heirs should adopt the name and arms of Wesley. He made the necessary formal declaration in 1728 and became known as Richard Wesley.The solemn declaration is recorded in: Patent Rolls 2 George II, 2a.p.D.R.4. (Quoted in Collins Peerage (1812) vol.8, p.541). In 1746 he was created 1st Baron Mornington, an ancient barony of the Wesleys. His sister Ann married William Pole of Ballyfin, Queen's County. Mornington married Elizabeth Sale, producing as heir Garret Wesley, 2nd Baron Mornington, who was created in 1760 1st Earl of Mornington in County Meath. In 1759 he married Ann Hill and produced five successful sons; of these, most prominent, are: *firstly Richard Wesley later Governor General of India and was created 1st Marquess Wellesley *thirdly Hon. William Wesley (later William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington), father of the 4th Earl; *fifthly Arthur, Duke of Wellington. William, above, inherited the Pole estates from William Pole (d. 1778) of Ballyfin, the childless brother of his aunt Ann Colley. The will of Pole required the family name honour the inheritance, here Pole, thus William Wesley became in 1778 William Wesley-Pole. Wesley-Pole, born in 1763, also had an outstanding career, having been an Irish member of parliament for Trim, a Governor of Queen's County, and after the Union of 1800 a Westminster member for that county also, and having served as Chief Secretary for Ireland. He married in 1784 Katherine-Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Hon. John Forbes, Admiral of the Fleet and they had the 4th Earl .Ancestry in Collins Peerage, 1812, (9 vols.) vol. 8, pp. 540-545 Early life Charles Williams, \\"The Disconsolate Sailor\\", 1811 - a cartoon about Catherine's choice between the Duke of Clarence (right) and William Wesley-Pole (left). He was born William Wesley-Pole on 22 June 1788 in London and baptised at St George's, Hanover Square, on 19 July.As viewed in the Baptism Records (Westminster Archive) by Greg Roberts on 24 June 2009 His family, quite broadly defined, changed their surname to the more archaic 'Wellesley' in the early 1790s. His first marriage was on 14 March 1812 to Catherine Tylney-Long, known in fashionable London society as \\"The Wiltshire Heiress\\",James Waylen, A History, Military and Municipal, of the Town (otherwise Called the City) of Marlborough (1854) and believed to be the richest commoner in England. Two months before the ceremony William Wellesley-Pole assumed the additional surnames of Tylney-Long, changing his name by Royal Licence. During this period William enjoyed a political career, first as a Tory Member of Parliament for the pocket borough of St Ives from 1812 until 1818, and then for Wiltshire, where his wife's family was influential. However, he was principally known for his dissipation and extravagance. On one occasion in 1814, Long-Wellesley held a grand f√™te in Wanstead House and its gardens to celebrate his uncle the Duke of Wellington's victory over Napoleon, attended by the Prince Regent, a number of other members of the royal family, and over a thousand dignitaries.Roger Fulford, George the Fourth (1949) He was also known to be a friend of the Irish poet Thomas Moore and of Lord Byron. On 8 August 1822, as his debts began to mount, he was appointed a Gentleman Usher to King George IV, an appointment which rendered him immune to arrest for debt, but he was soon to leave England entirely. Second marriage and custody battle While in Europe evading his creditors, Long-Wellesley began a relationship with Helena Paterson Bligh (d. 7 April 1869), the wife of Captain Thomas Bligh of the Coldstream Guards, eventually abandoning Catherine, who died two years later on 12 September 1825. Catherine had implied in a letter to her sisters that her husband had given her a venereal disease. Long- Wellesley married Helena in 1828, but this marriage as quickly proved calamitous. As a notorious rake he was unable to afford to make prudent investments in his first wife's property, but nor could he sell or mortgage it, having only a life interest in it (enjoying its income). As life tenant he arranged with other beneficiaries for the demolition and carving up of Wanstead House's estate, the proceeds of which repaid some of his great debts. He returned to Parliament in 1830, again as a member (MP) for St Ives. He was one of the Tories who broke with the first his uncle's Ministry and brought about its fall on 15 November 1830. He was returned and as a knight of the shire (MP) for Essex (in which lay Wanstead) from 1831 to 1832. In the years following Catherine's death, he sought to regain control over his children, who were in the care of Catherine's two unmarried sisters, Dorothy and Emma. He was especially interested in William, the eldest, on whom Catherine's fortune had devolved. His uncle, the Duke, fighting one of his furious defensive actions, intervened on behalf of the children to keep the hapless William from his father. Deprived of the custody of his children by the Court of Chancery, he was committed to the Fleet prison by Lord Brougham in July 1831 for contempt of court; Long-Wellesley invoked parliamentary privilege, but his plea was rejected by the committee of privileges of the House of Commons. For some time he was in and out of court on charges of libel, and various other matters relating to his quest for custody of his children. Decline and death He led a very dissipated life and lived for a time in Brussels to avoid his creditors. In his last years he lived on a small pension of ¬£10 a week allowed by his cousin Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington. From 1842 he was styled Viscount Wellesley, and succeeded his father as Earl of Mornington in 1845. He died in lodgings in Thayer Street, Manchester Square, London, on 1 July 1857, from heart disease. The obituary notice three days later in the Morning Chronicle claimed that he was \\"A spendthrift, a profligate, and a gambler in his youth, he became debauched in his manhood... redeemed by no single virtue, adorned by no single grace, his life gone out even without a flicker of repentance\\". His coffin is in Catacomb B, Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

Career Originally named City of Quesnel, she was truly a home town product: owned by Telesphore Marion, a local merchant, built by local carpenter, John Strand and piloted by local man, Captain Donald Arthur Foster. However, on her launch day, it was discovered that she rode too low in the water and that her hull needed to be lengthened. Shipbuilder Donald McPhee was already in town, having just completed the construction of another sternwheeler, the Nechacco. McPhee was hired to do the work and City of Quesnel was rebuilt and relaunched under the name Quesnel on September 2. Among the first of the upper Fraser River vessels built during the era of rail construction, she would also be the last. She served the district for six seasons, until she was retired in the spring of 1915. By then, several factors had devastated the local economy and steamer service wasn't as profitable as it had been previously. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was completed, and the outbreak of the Great War had caused an abrupt halt to the construction of the promised Pacific Great Eastern Railway which had been under construction from Fort George south since early 1914. Sinking In April 1921, Captain Foster, in partnership with WH Matheson, relaunched Quesnel, intending to resume the local service that BC Express and BX had recently abandoned. The local farmers, settlers and miners, especially those between Quesnel and Fort George, applauded her return, as it was a financial hardship for them to be without steamer service, because the rates on other shipping methods were higher. Quesnel only worked for three weeks before she was wrecked in the Fort George Canyon on May 13. Captain Foster and Matheson recovered her cargo, which consisted of, among other things, a Ford automobile and 100 barrels of beer, and attempted to salvage her, but during the operation, she broke free from the rock she was caught on and sank and was never recovered.

To forestall this, the United States acted to guarantee Greenland's position. However, with the entrance of the United States into the war in December 1941, Greenland became a combatant. From 1941 until 1945, the United States established numerous and extensive facilities for air and sea traffic in Greenland, as well as radio beacons, radio stations, weather stations, ports, depots, artillery posts, and search-and- rescue stations. The United States Coast Guard also provided a considerable portion of the civilian resupply task up and down both coasts. Economically, Greenland traded successfully with the United States, Canada, and Portugal, which, supplemented by the cryolite exports, caused a reanimation and permanent realignment of the island's economy. Neutrality Before the war, Greenland was a tightly controlled colony of Denmark, otherwise closed off to the world. After the invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940, Greenland was left on its own, because the Royal Navy seized any ships arriving from Axis- controlled Europe. The United Kingdom and Canada initially laid plans to occupy points of interest on the island, but the United States, still neutral, firmly rejected \\"third party\\" intervention there. The sheriffs (\\"landsfogeder\\") of South and North Greenland, Eske Brun and Aksel Svane, invoking the emergency clause of a 1925 law specifying how Greenland was ruled, declared Greenland a self-ruling territory, believing this to be in the best interests of the colony as Denmark was occupied by Germany. This step was taken in coordination with the Danish ambassador to the United States, Henrik Kauffmann, and the US State Department, and comported with the American declaration of 1920 that no third nation would necessarily be accepted as a sovereign in Greenland. This diplomatic stance was seen as an extension of the Monroe Doctrine.Walling (2004), p 6 Although the Danish government continued in power and still considered itself neutral, it was forced to obey German wishes in foreign policy matters. Kauffmann immediately recognized that his government was unable to exercise its full sovereignty, and therefore began to act in an independent capacity. On 13 April he took counsel with the Greenland sheriffs, and after some controversy they agreed to recognize him as their representative in the United States. Since the United States would not offer diplomatic recognition and aid to Greenland unless the local administration was independent, the sheriffs informed the local advisory parliament (\\"Landsraad\\") on 3 May that \\"there was no choice\\" but to act as a sovereign nation. The Danish Government continued to send orders to the colony via radio and through Portugal, but these messages were ignored.Howarth, p 8 In this decision they were influenced by their determination to avoid becoming subject to a Canadian occupation and thus being drawn into the war. The Greenlanders were also aware of the heavy Norwegian presence in Canada. In the event that Canada attempted to occupy the colony, they were worried that Free Norwegian Forces would be stationed in the area. This was a cause for concern, as the Norwegians had been vying for control over part of the territory until the Permanent Court of International Justice settled the dispute in 1933.Legal Status of Eastern Greenland , PCIJ Series A/B No. 53 (1933) Instead, they requested the protection of the United States, whose Treasury Department agreed to dispatch the U.S. Coast Guard vessels, and with supplies and a consular team to establish a provisional consulate at Godthaab. Accepting the protection of the Americans, a third party, was seen as less of a threat to Greenland's sovereignty. Comanche arrived at Ivigtut on 20 May, and Godthaab on 22 May, thereby establishing direct diplomatic relations with Greenland. Canada sent a consul and vice-consul to Godthaab two weeks later. The Ivigtut cryolite mine in southwestern Greenland, 1940 In 1940, the chief concern of all interested parties was to secure the strategically important supply of cryolite from the mine at Ivigtut. Cryolite was a key component used in the production of aluminum. Due to diplomatic considerations, no American soldiers could be used to protect the mines so the U.S. State Department recruited fifteen Coast Guardsmen who were voluntarily discharged and in turn hired by the mine as guards. Three-inch naval deck guns were supplied by Campbell and the recently arrived along with eight machine guns, fifty rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition.Walling (2004), p 8 In this way the United States maintained neutrality and still preempted British-Canadian plans for the island. The Dane, Eske Brun, decided that Greenland should undertake its own measures to ensure its sovereignty. He made an appeal to the Greenland's guides and hunters to join an elite unit tasked with patrolling the most remote areas of the colony.Zabecki, p 628 Using the rifles left by the Americans, he directed the creation of what became the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol (Sl√¶depatruljen Sirius). The 15 man volunteer team was made up of native Inuit, Danish colonists, and Norwegian expatriates.Northeast Greenland Sledge Patrol warcovers.dk Germany made no attempts to reach Greenland in 1940. However, three Norwegian vessels reached Norwegian stations on the East Coast. Two were intercepted by the Royal Navy, one (which was left to go) by the U.S. Coast Guard. In violation of Greenlandic neutrality, the Royal Navy demolished the Norwegian stations, drawing an American protest, and a German reconnaissance plane made a flight over the East Coast in November in order to check on a Norwegian station that had not been heard from. In 1941, the situation shifted towards delivery of Lend-Lease aircraft to Britain via the North Atlantic island \\"stepping stones.\\" Again, the United Kingdom and Canada pressed for an operation to establish an airfield near Cape Farewell. This led the United States and the Greenland government to formalize an American protectorate in order to preserve the island's neutrality. Following surveys in 1940 and 1941, two locations for air bases were located, and a naval base established close to Ivigtut. The American bases and stations were codenamed under the Bluie West and Bluie East moniker. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took a strong personal interest in Greenland's fate. On 9 April 1941, the anniversary of the German occupation, the Danish envoy Kauffmann, against the instructions of his government, signed an executive agreement with Secretary of State Cordell Hull, allowing the presence of American troops and making Greenland a de facto United States protectorate. The cryolite mine in Ivigtut was a unique asset that made it possible for Greenland to manage fairly well economically during the war. The United States supplied the island and sent patrol boats to survey the east coast of Greenland although this activity was limited by seasonal ice. The Coast Guard, in coordination with Eske Brun, created the Northeast Greenland Sledge Patrol, consisting of 15 men, many of them former hunters in the area. Their task was to patrol the coast to discover any German activity. However, in 1941 there was no such landing, although the Norwegian resupply trawler was encountered in September. Among its otherwise innocuous crew and passengers was a civilian Norwegian who intended to provide weather reports for German contacts in Norway. This ship was seized and brought to Boston by the Coast Guard. In 1941, Royal Navy ships continued to interfere with weather stations on the east coast. A couple of reconnaissance aircraft from Norway flew over Scoresbysund.  Greenland enters the war  When the United States entered the war with Germany on 11 December, Greenland became a warring nation. Remaining contact with Copenhagen was broken off, rationing and daylight saving time was introduced, and local currency and stamps printed. In 1942, the U.S. Army took over protection of the Ivigtut mine, and combat patrols began to be flown from Bluie West One, which became the headquarters for both the Coast Guard Greenland Patrol and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Greenland Base Command. A third air base was established at Bluie East Two during the summer. The Greenland population, which had been 18,000 natives and fewer than 500 Danes, was augmented by thousands of U.S. servicemen. Relations with the Americans were excellent, as they provided news, provisions, humanitarian aid, and entertainment in addition to greatly expanding the island's infrastructure. In 1944 a five kroner coin was struck in Philadelphia, to be used by American soldiers.Hengeveld: Exploring the Coinage of Greenland Greenland's commercial interests in North America were maintained by the Greenland Delegation with the aid of Kauffmann and Svane. Brun remained in Greenland as head of a unified administration. = German weather stations = Universal Newsreel about the 1944 attack on a German weather station Both the Allies (Britain in particular) and Germany tried to gain a monopoly on weather data in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Meteorological intelligence was important as it affected military planning and the routing of ships and convoys. Greenland became an important part of this North Atlantic weather war. Beginning in August 1942, the Germans established four clandestine weather stations on the east coast. The first expedition on Sabine Island was detected in the spring, but was withdrawn successfully before it was attacked. The fall 1943 expedition at Shannon Island also operated successfully over the winter and spring and was withdrawn by air. Two expeditions in October 1944 were seized by the Coast Guard before they could get established. The German weather station Holzauge at Hansa Bay on the northeast coast of Sabine Island was discovered by a team from the Sledge Patrol on 11 March 1943. The Germans realized they had been discovered, and gave chase to the team, who had to abandon their equipment (including their dog teams) and retreat to the station at Eskimon√¶s, to warn Ib Poulsen, the Sledge Patrol commander. Poulsen reported the German base to the Greenland government on 13 March 1943, and asked for automatic weapons and further orders. Governor Brun officially designated the patrol the \\"Army of Greenland\\" and named Poulsen its captain, effective 15 March.Howarth, 1957 edition, pp 72-90 The Germans attacked Eskimonaes on 23 March, seized it and then burned the station two days later. Though unhurt in the firefight, the entire Sledge Patrol contingent based there was forced to make a 400-mile trek to the station at Ella Island without sleds, food, or equipment. On 26 March, while returning to Sabine Island, the Germans ambushed Corporal Eli Knudsen at Sandodden, and accidentally killed him with a machine-gun burst meant for his dogs.Howarth, 1957 ed., pp 108-156 In late-April, Lieutenant Hermann Ritter, the officer in command of the German detachment , was taken prisoner by Marius Jensen, a member of the Sledge Patrol, and brought to the Americans after a long journey to Scoresby Sound.Howarth, 1957 edition, pp 183-211 Externsteine shortly after its capture by the Eastwind The German base on Sabine was bombed by USAAF bombers from Iceland.Howarth, pp 210-213 It was then seized by a Coast Guard landing party, but all German personnel save one person had already been evacuated by a Dornier Do 26.Dege & Barr (2004), p. xx Apart from fire exchanged between German aircraft and American ships, this was the only offensive air attack on the Greenland mainland. An American air force formation attacked the station on 14 May to make sure it could be of no use to the Germans. On April 22, 1944, six Sledge Patrol members attacked the Bassgeiger weather station and in the ensuing skirmish a German lieutenant died. The station was subsequently evacuated on June 3. The last German weather station, Edelweiss II, was captured by U.S. Army forces and its crew taken prisoner on 4 October 1944.

For a long period, a flight of six PBY Catalinas of VP-6(CG) was maintained at Bluie West One, carrying out a great variety of missions. Aftermath On 5 May 1945, Greenlanders celebrated the liberation of Denmark in Nuuk. The Greenland Administration under Eske Brun surrendered its emergency powers and again came under direct control from Copenhagen. Kauffmann returned to Copenhagen, where treason charges against him were dropped, and the Danish parliament ratified his agreement with the United States. The United States presence continued in decreasing numbers until the Kauffmann-Hull agreement was replaced by a new base treaty in 1951.Grant (2010) The American presence brought Sears catalogs, with which Greenlanders and Danes ordered modern appliances and other products by mail. The successful experience of an independent Greenland led to a dramatic restructuring and modernization of Danish policy with respect to the colony.

Moreover, for a finite cyclic group of order n, every subgroup's order is a divisor of n, and there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor.. This result has been called the fundamental theorem of cyclic groups. Finite cyclic groups For every finite group G of order n, the following statements are equivalent: * G is cyclic. * For every divisor d of n, G has at most one subgroup of order d. If either (and thus both) are true, it follows that there exists exactly one subgroup of order d, for any divisor of n. This statement is known by various names such as characterization by subgroups. (See also cyclic group for some characterization.) There exist finite groups other than cyclic groups with the property that all proper subgroups are cyclic; the Klein group is an example. However, the Klein group has more than one subgroup of order 2, so it does not meet the conditions of the characterization. The infinite cyclic group The infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive subgroup Z of the integers. There is one subgroup dZ for each integer d (consisting of the multiples of d), and with the exception of the trivial group (generated by d = 0) every such subgroup is itself an infinite cyclic group. Because the infinite cyclic group is a free group on one generator (and the trivial group is a free group on no generators), this result can be seen as a special case of the Nielsen‚ÄìSchreier theorem that every subgroup of a free group is itself free.. The fundamental theorem for finite cyclic groups can be established from the same theorem for the infinite cyclic groups, by viewing each finite cyclic group as a quotient group of the infinite cyclic group. Lattice of subgroups In both the finite and the infinite case, the lattice of subgroups of a cyclic group is isomorphic to the dual of a divisibility lattice. In the finite case, the lattice of subgroups of a cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of divisors of n, with a subgroup of order n/d for each divisor d. The subgroup of order n/d is a subgroup of the subgroup of order n/e if and only if e is a divisor of d. The lattice of subgroups of the infinite cyclic group can be described in the same way, as the dual of the divisibility lattice of all positive integers. If the infinite cyclic group is represented as the additive group on the integers, then the subgroup generated by d is a subgroup of the subgroup generated by e if and only if e is a divisor of d. Divisibility lattices are distributive lattices, and therefore so are the lattices of subgroups of cyclic groups. This provides another alternative characterization of the finite cyclic groups: they are exactly the finite groups whose lattices of subgroups are distributive. More generally, a finitely generated group is cyclic if and only if its lattice of subgroups is distributive and an arbitrary group is locally cyclic if and only its lattice of subgroups is distributive.. The additive group of the rational numbers provides an example of a group that is locally cyclic, and that has a distributive lattice of subgroups, but that is not itself cyclic.

These dietary laws ultimately derive from various passages in the Torah with various modifications, additions and clarifications added to these rules by Halakha. Various other animal-related rules are contained in the 613 commandments. A 15th-century depiction of shechita Land animals Cow and both give the same general set of rules for identifying which land animals (Hebrew: ◊ë◊î◊û◊ï◊™ Behemoth) are ritually clean. According to these, anything that \\"chews the cud\\" and has a completely split hoof is ritually clean, but those animals that only chew the cud or only have cloven hooves are unclean. Both documents explicitly list four animals as being ritually impure: * The camel, for chewing the cud without its hooves being divided. * The hyrax, for chewing the cud without having cloven hooves. (The Hebrew term for this animal - ◊©◊§◊ü shaphan - has been translated by older English versions of the bible as coney; the existence of the hyrax wasn't known to early English translators. The coney was an exclusively European animal, not present in Canaan, while the shaphan was described by the Book of Proverbs as living on rocks like the hyrax, but unlike the coney.) * The hare, for chewing the cud without having cloven hooves. * The pig, for having cloven hooves without chewing the cud. While camels are actually not true ruminants they chew cud, and while they do stand on two large toes they lack proper hooves. Although hares and coneys do not ruminate at all, they do usually reingest soft cecal pellets made of chewed plant material right after excretion for further bacterial digestion in their stomach and this serves the same purpose as rumination. Although not ruminants, hyraxes have complex, multichambered stomachs that allow symbiotic bacteria to break down tough plant materials, though they do not regurgitate. Further clarification of this classification has been attempted by various authors, most recently by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, in a book, entitled The Camel, the Hare, and the Hyrax. Mountain gazelle Unlike Leviticus 11:3-8, Deuteronomy 14:4-8 also explicitly names 10 animals considered ritually clean: * the ox * the sheep * the goat * the deer * the gazelle * the yahmur; this term, directly taken from the Masoretic Text, is ambiguously used by Arabs to refer to roe deer and to oryxCatholic Encyclopedia, Animals * the the'o; this term, directly taken from the Masoretic Text, has traditionally been translated ambiguously. In Deuteronomy, it has traditionally been translated as wild goat, but in the same translations is called a wild ox where it occurs in Deutero-Isaiah; the bubal hartebeest lies somewhere between these creatures in appearance and has been regarded as a likely fit for the'o. * the pygarg; the identity of this animal is uncertain, and pygarg is merely the Septuagint's rendering. The Masoretic Text calls it a dishon, meaning springing; it has thus usually been interpreted as some form of antelope or ibex. * the antelope * the camelopardalis; the identity of this animal is uncertain, and camelopardalis, is merely the Septuagint's wording.Catholic Encyclopedia, animals The Masoretic Text calls it a zamer, but camelopardalis means camel-leopard and refers to the giraffe (giraffe is derived, via Italian, from the Arabic term ziraafa meaning assembled [from multiple parts]). The traditional translation has been chamois, but the chamois has never naturally existed in Canaan; neither is the giraffe naturally found in Canaan, and consequently the mouflon is considered the best remaining identification. The Deuteronomic passages mention no further land beasts as being clean or unclean, seemingly suggesting that the status of the remaining land beasts can be extrapolated from the given rules. By contrast, the Levitical rules later go on to add that all quadrupeds with paws should be considered ritually unclean, something not explicitly stated by the Deuteronomic passages; the only quadrupeds with paws are the carnivorans (dogs, wolves, cats, lions, hyenas, bears, etc.), and all carnivorans fall under this description. The Leviticus passages thus cover all the large land animals that naturally live in Canaan, except for primates, and equids (horses, zebras, etc.), which are not mentioned in Leviticus as being either ritually clean or unclean, despite their importance in warfare and society, and their mention elsewhere in Leviticus. In an attempt to help identify animals of ambiguous appearance, the Talmud, in a similar manner to Aristotle's earlier Historia Animalium,Jewish Encyclopedia argued that animals without upper teeth would always chew the cud and have split hoofs (thus being ritually clean), and that no animal with upper teeth would do so; the Talmud makes an exception for the case of the camel (which, like the other ruminant even-toed ungulates, is apparently 'without upper teeth' though some citations.Jewish Encyclopedia, Dietary Laws), even though the skulls clearly have both front and rear upper teeth. The Talmud also argues that the meat from the legs of clean animals can be torn lengthwise as well as across, unlike that of unclean animals, thus aiding to identify the status of meat from uncertain origin. =Origin= Many Biblical scholars believe that the classification of animals was created to explain pre-existing taboos.Peake's commentary on the Bible Beginning with the Saadia Gaon, several Jewish commentators started to explain these taboos rationalistically; Saadia himself expresses an argument similar to that of totemism, that the unclean animals were declared so because they were worshipped by other cultures.Saadia Gaon, Kitab al-Amanat Wal-l'tikadat, 117 Due to comparatively recent discoveries about the cultures adjacent to the Israelites, it has become possible to investigate whether such principles could underlie some of the food laws. Egyptian priests would only eat the meat of even-toed ungulates (swine, camelids, and ruminantians), and rhinoceros.Porphyry, De Abstinentia 4:7 Like the Egyptian priests, Vedic India (and presumably the Persians also) allowed the meat of rhinoceros and ruminantians, although cattle were excluded from this, since they were seemingly taboo in Vedic India;\\"Laws of Apastamba\\" 1:5, 1:29-39, 2:64Laws of Vasishta, 14:38-48, 14:74Laws of Bandhayuna, 1:5, 1:12, 14:184 in a particular parallel with the Israelite list, Vedic India explicitly forbade the consumption of camelids and domestic pigs (but not boar). However, unlike the biblical rules, Vedic India did allow the consumption of hare and porcupine, but Harran did not, and was even more similar to the Israelite regulations, allowing all ruminants, but not other land beasts, and expressly forbidding the meat of camels.Daniel Chwolson, Die Szabier und der Szabismus, 2:7 It is also possible to find an ecological explanation for these rules. If one believes that religious customs are at least partly explained by the ecological conditions in which a religion evolves, then this too could account for the origin of these rules. See \\"Why mammals with split hooves?\\" https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/why-mammals-with- split-hooves/ =Modern practices= In addition to meeting the restrictions as defined by the Torah, there is also the issue of masorah (tradition). In general, animals are eaten only if there is a masorah that has been passed down from generations ago that clearly indicates that these animals are acceptable. For instance, there was considerable debate as to the kosher status of zebu and bison among the rabbinical authorities when they first became known and available for consumption; the Orthodox Union permits bison, as can be attested to by the menus of some of the more upscale kosher restaurants in New York City. Water creatures Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, Kosher fish and both state that anything residing in \\"the waters\\" (which Leviticus specifies as being the seas and rivers) is ritually clean if it has both fins and scales, in contrast to anything residing in the waters with neither fins nor scales. The latter class of animals is described as ritually impure by Deuteronomy, Leviticus describes them as an \\"abomination\\" KJV Leviticus 11:10. Abomination is also sometimes used to translate piggul and toebah. Although these biblical rules do not specify the status of animals in the waters with fins but no scales, or scales but no fins, it has traditionally been assumed that these animals are also excluded from the ranks of the ritually clean. These rules restrict the permissible seafood to stereotypical fish, prohibiting the unusual forms such as the eel, lamprey, hagfish, and lancelet. In addition, these rules exclude non-fish marine creatures, such as crustaceans (lobster, crab, prawn, shrimp, barnacle, etc.), molluscs (squid, octopus, oyster, periwinkle, etc.), sea cucumbers, and jellyfish. Other creatures living in the sea and rivers that would be prohibited by the rules include the cetaceans (dolphin, whale, etc.), crocodilians (alligator, crocodile etc.), sea turtles, sea snakes, and all amphibians. An oxyrhynchus sturgeon Sharks are sometimes regarded as being among the ritually unclean foods according to these regulations, as they appear to have a smooth skin. However, sharks do have scales, they are just placoid scales, which are denser and appear smooth if rubbed in one direction, in contrast to leptoid scales, ganoid scales, and cosmoid scales. The sturgeon, and related fish, are also sometimes included among the ritually impure foods, as their surfaces are covered in scutes, which are bony armoured nodules; however, fish scutes are actually just hardened and enlarged scales. Scales has thus been traditionally interpreted along the lines ofKosher Fish at kashrut.com. Retrieved 22 April 2007. Nachmanides's proposal that qasqeseth (scales) must refer specifically to scales that can be detached, by hand or with a knife, without ripping the skin. In practice this excludes all but cycloid and ctenoid scales.Nahmanides, commentary to Leviticus 11:9 A minor controversy arises from the fact that the appearance of the scales of swordfish is heavily affected by the ageing process ‚Äì their young satisfy Nachmanides' rule, but when they reach adulthood they do not. Traditionally fins has been interpreted as referring to translucent fins. The Mishnah claims that all fish with scales will also have fins, but that the reverse is not always true.Niddah 6:9 For the latter case, the Talmud argues that ritually clean fish have a distinct spinal column and flatish face, while ritually unclean fish don't have spinal columns and have pointy heads,'Abodah Zarah 39b-40a which would define the shark and sturgeon (and related fish) as ritually unclean. Nevertheless, Aaron Chorin, a prominent 19th-century rabbi and reformer, declared that the sturgeon was actually ritually pure, and hence permissible to eat. Many Conservative rabbis now view these particular fish as being kosher,A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice. Isaac Klein. The Jewish Theological Seminary of America. New York and Jerusalem. 1979. p. 305 (in 1992 reprint). but most Orthodox rabbis do not. The question for sturgeon is particularly significant as most caviar consists of sturgeon eggs, and therefore cannot be kosher if the sturgeon itself is not. Sturgeon-derived caviar is not eaten by some Kosher-observant Jews because sturgeon possess ganoid scales instead of the usual ctenoid and cycloid scales. There is a kosher caviar. Atlantic salmon roe is also kosher. =Origin= Nachmanides believed that the restrictions against certain fish also addressed health concerns, arguing that fish with fins and scales (and hence ritually clean) typically live in shallower waters than those without fins or scales (i.e., those that were ritually impure), and consequently the latter were much colder and more humid, qualities he believed made their flesh toxic.Nachmanides, Bi'ur on Leviticus The academic perception is that natural repugnance from \\"weird-looking\\" fish is a significant factor in the origin of the restrictions.Cheyne and Black, Encyclopedia BiblicaPeake's commentary on the BIbleW. Robertson Smith, \\"Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia\\"Jacobs, \\"Studies in Biblical ArchaeologyBaentsch, \\"Exodus and Leviticus Vedic India (and presumably the Persians also) exhibit such repugnance, generally allowing fish, but forbidding \\"weird looking\\" fish and exclusively carnivorous fish; in Egypt, another significant and influential culture near to the Israelites, the priests avoided all fish completely. Birds In regard to birds, no general rule is given, and instead and explicitly list the prohibited birds. In the Shulchan Aruch 3 Signs are given to Kosher birds: Crop, an extra finger, a gizzard that can be peeled. Also it must not be a bird of prey. The Masoretic Text lists the birds as: * nesher (that which sheds [its feathers]) * peres (bone breaker) * ozniyah (feminine form of oz, meaning strong) * ra'ah/da'ah ([that which] darts, in the sense of rapid) * ayyah * orev * bat yaanah (daughter of howling) * tahmas ([one who] scratches the face) * shahaf ([one which] atrophies) * netz * kos (cup) * shalak (plunger) * yanshuf (twilight) * tinshemet (blower/breather) * qa'at (vomiting) * racham (tenderness/affection) * hasidah (devoted) * anafah ([one which] sniffs sharply, in the sense of anger) * dukifat * atalef The list in Deuteronomy has an additional bird, the dayyah, which seems to be a combination of da'ah and ayyah, and may be a scribal error; the Talmud regards it as a duplication of ayyah.Hullin 63b This, and the other terms are vague and difficult to translate, but there are a few further descriptions, of some of these birds, elsewhere in the Bible: * The ayyah is mentioned again in the Book of Job, where it is used to describe a bird distinguished by its particularly good sight. * The bat yaanah is described by the Book of Isaiah as living in desolate places, and the Book of Micah states that it emits a mournful cry. * The qa'at appears in the Book of Zephaniah, where it is portrayed as nesting on the columns of a ruined city; the Book of Isaiah identifies it as possessing a marshy and desolate kingdom. The Septuagint versions of the lists are more helpful, as in almost all cases the bird is clearly identifiable: * aetonLeviticus 11:13, LXXDeuteronomy 14:12, LXX (eagle) * grypa (ossifrage) * haliaetos (sea-eagle) * gypsLeviticus 11:14, LXXDeuteronomy 14:13, LXX (vulture) * ictinia (kite) * coraxLeviticus 11:15, LXXDeuteronomy 14:14, LXX (raven) * stouthiosLeviticus 11:16, LXXDeuteronomy 14:15, LXX (ostrich) * glaux (owl) * laros (gull) * hieraxDeuteronomy 14:17, LXX (hawk) * nycticoraxLeviticus 11:17, LXX (night raven) * cataractes (cormorant) * porphyrionLeviticus 11:18, LXXDeuteronomy 14:18, LXX (\\"swamp hen\\") * cycnosDeuteronomy 14:16, LXX (swan) * ibis * pelican * charadriosLeviticus 11:19, LXX (plover) * herodios (heron) * epops (hoopoe) * nycturia (bat) * meleagrisDeuteronomy 14:19, LXX (guineafowl) Although the first ten of the birds identified by the Septuagint seem to fit the descriptions of the Masoretic Text, the ossifrage (Latin for bone breaker) being a good example, the correspondence is less clear for most of the remaining birds; it is also obvious that the list in Leviticus, or the list in Deuteronomy, or both, are in a different order in the Septuagint, compared to the Masoretic Text.in the Masoretic Text, the lists are nearly the same between Leviticus and Deuteronomy, but in the Septuagint Leviticus is clearly in a different order to Deuteronomy Attempting to determine the correspondence is problematic; for example, the pelican may correspond to qa'at (vomiting), in reference to the pelican's characteristic behaviour, but it may also correspond to kos (cup), as a reference to the pelican's jaw pouch. An additional complexity arises from the fact that the porphyrion has not yet been identified, and classical Greek literature merely identifies a number of species that are not the porphyrion, including the peacock, grouse, and robin, and implies that the porphyrion is the cousin of the kingfisher. From these meager clarifications, the porphyrion can only be identified as anything from the lilac-breasted roller, Indian roller, or northern carmine bee-eater, to the flamingo. A likely candidate is the purple swamphen. During the Middle Ages, classical descriptions of the hoopoe were mistaken for descriptions of the lapwing, on account of the lapwing's prominent crest, and the hoopoe's rarity in England, resulting in lapwing being listed in certain bible translations instead of hoopoe; similarly the sea eagle has historically been confused with the osprey, and translations have often used the latter bird in place of the former. Because strouthos (ostrich) was also used in Greek for the sparrow, a few translations have placed the sparrow among the list. In Arabic, the Egyptian vulture is often referred to as rachami,Jewish Encyclopedia, Vulture and therefore a number of translations render racham as gier eagle, the old name for the Egyptian vulture. Variations arise when translations follow other ancient versions of the Bible, rather than the Septuagint, where they differ. Rather than vulture (gyps), the Vulgate has milvus, meaning red kite, which historically has been called the glede, on account of its gliding flight; similarly, the Syriac Peshitta has owl rather than ibis. Other variations arise from attempting to base translations primarily on the Masoretic Text; these translations generally interpret some of the more ambiguous birds as being various different kinds of vulture and owl. All of these variations mean that most translations arrive at a list of 20 birds from among the following: * Bat * Black kite * Black vulture * Cormorant * Cuckoo * Desert owl * Eagle * Eagle owl * Egyptian vulture * Falcon * Flamingo * Glede * Great owl * Gull * Hawk * Heron * Hoopoe * Ibis * Indian roller * Kingfisher * Kite (all) * Lapwing * Lilac-breasted roller * Little owl * Nighthawk * Night raven * Northern carmine bee-eater * Osprey * Ossifrage * Ostrich * Owl (all) * Peacock * Pelican * Plover * Porphyrion (untranslated) * Raven * Red Kite * Screech owl * Sea eagle * Sparrow * Stork * Swan * Vulture (all) * White owl Turtle dove Despite being listed among the birds by the Bible, bats are not birds, and are in fact mammals (the reason being that the Hebrew Bible distinguishes animals into four general categories ‚Äì beasts of the land, flying animals, creatures which crawl upon the ground, and animals which dwell in water ‚Äì not according to modern scientific classification). Most of the remaining animals on the list are either birds of prey or birds living on water, and the majority of the latter in the list also eat fish or other seafood. The Septuagint's version of the list comprehensively lists most of the birds of Canaan that fall into these categories. The conclusion of modern scholars is that, generally, ritually unclean birds were those clearly observed to eat other animals.Jewish Encyclopedia, dietary laws Although it does regard all birds of prey as being forbidden, the Talmud is uncertain of there being a general rule, and instead gives detailed descriptions of the features that distinguish a bird as being ritually clean. The Talmud argues that clean birds would have craws, an easily separated double-skin, and would eat food by placing it on the ground (rather than holding it on the ground) and tearing it with their bills before eating it;Hullin 59aHullin 61aHullin 63a however, the Talmud also argues that only the birds in the biblical list are actually forbidden ‚Äì these distinguishing features were only for cases when there was any uncertainty in the bird's identity. =Origin= The earliest rationalistic explanations of the laws against eating certain birds focused on symbolic interpretations; the first indication of this view can be found in the 1st century BC Letter of Aristeas, which argues that this prohibition is a lesson to teach justice, and is also about not injuring others.Letter of Aristeas, 145-154 Such allegorical explanations were abandoned by most Jewish and Christian theologians after a few centuries, and later writers instead sought to find medical explanations for the rules; Nachmanides, for example, claimed that the black and thickened blood of birds of prey would cause psychological damage, making people much more inclined to cruelty. However, other cultures treated the meat of certain carnivorous birds as having medical benefits, the Romans viewing owl meat as being able to ease the pain of insect bites. Conversely, modern scientific studies have discovered very toxic birds such as the Pitohui, which are neither birds of prey nor water birds, and therefore the biblical regulations allow them to be eaten. Laws against eating any carnivorous birds also existed in Vedic India and Harran, and the Egyptian priests also refused to eat carnivorous birds. =Modern practical considerations= Rooster Due to the difficulty of identification, religious authorities have restricted consumption to specific birds for which Jews have passed down a tradition of permissibility from generation to generation. Birds for which there has been a tradition of their being kosher include: * Chicken * Ducks * Geese * Chukar partridge * Common pheasant * Common quail * Grey partridge * House sparrow * Rock partridge * Japanese quail * Rock dove * Turtle dove61a-b ‚Äì Determining the kosher status of birds As a general principle, scavenging birds such as vultures and birds of prey such as hawks and eagles (which opportunistically eat carrion) are unclean. The turkey does not have a tradition, but because so many Orthodox Jews have come to eat it and it possesses the simanim (signs) required to render it a kosher bird, an exception is made, but with all other birds a masorah is required. Songbirds, which are consumed as delicacies in many societies, may be kosher in theory, but are not eaten in kosher homes as there is no tradition of them being eaten as such. Pigeons and doves are known to be kosher based on their permissible status as sacrificial offerings in the Temple of Jerusalem. The Orthodox Union of America considers that neither the peafowl nor the guineafowl are kosher birds since it has not obtained testimony from experts about the permissibility of either of these birds. In the case of the swans, there is no clear tradition of eating them. Rabbi Chaim Loike is currently the Orthodox Union's specialist on kosher bird species. =Predator birds= Unlike with land creatures and fish, the Torah does not give signs for determining kosher birds; instead it gives a list of unkosher birds, The Talmud also offers signs for determining whether a bird is kosher or not. If a bird kills other animals to get its food, eats meat, or is a dangerous bird, then is not kosher, a predatory bird is unfit to eat, raptors like the eagles, hawks, owls and other hunting birds are not kosher, vultures and other carrion-eating birds are not kosher either. Crows and members of the crow family such as jackdaws, magpies and ravens are not kosher. The storks, kingfishers, penguins and other fish-eating birds are not kosher. Flying insects The migratory locust specifies that all \\"flying creeping things\\" were to be considered ritually unclean and goes further, describing all flying creeping things as filth, Hebrew sheqets. Leviticus goes on to list four exceptions, which Deuteronomy does not. All these exceptions are described by the Levitical passages as \\"going upon all four legs\\" and as having \\"legs above their feet\\" for the purpose of leaping. The identity of the four creatures the Levitical rules list are named in the Masoretic Text using words of uncertain meaning: * arbeh; the Hebrew word literally means [one which] increases. The Septuagint calls it a brouchos, referring to a wingless locust, and older English translations render this as grasshopper in most parts of the Bible, but inconsistently translate it as locust in Leviticus.The King James Version for example, translates brouchos/arbeh as grasshopper in the Book of Judges, Book of Job, and Book of Jeremiah, but as locust in Leviticus In the Book of Nahum, the arbeh is poetically described as camping in hedges in cold days, but flying off into the far distance when the sun arises; for this reason, a number of scholars have suggested that the arbeh must actually be the migratory locust. * sol'am; the Hebrew term literally means \\"swallower\\". The Septuagint calls it an attacos, the meaning of which is currently uncertain. The Talmud describes it as having a long head that is bald in front,Hullin 65b 'Abodah Zarah 37a for which reason a number of English translations call it a bald locust (an ambiguous term); many modern scholars believe that the Acrida (previously called Tryxalis) is meant, as it is distinguished by its very elongated head. * hargol; the Hebrew term literally means strafer (i.e., [one that] runs to the right or to the left). The Septuagint calls it an ophiomachos, literally meaning \\"snake fighter\\"; the Talmud describes it as having a tail.Hullin 65a The Talmud also states that it has large eggs, which were turned into amulets.Shabbat 6:10 This has historically been translated as beetle, but since the 19th century, cricket has been deemed more likely to fit. * hagab; the word literally means \\"hider\\". The Book of Numbers implies that they were particularly small. The Septuagint calls it an akrida, and it has usually been translated as grasshopper. The Mishnah argues that the ritually clean locusts could be distinguished as they would all have four feet, jumping with two of them, and have four wings which are of sufficient size to cover the entire locust's body.Hullin 3:8 The Mishnah also goes on to state that any species of locust could only be considered as clean if there was a reliable tradition that it was so. The only Jewish group that continue to preserve such a tradition are the Jews of Yemen, who use the term \\"kosher locust\\" to describe the specific species of locusts they believe to be kosher, all of which are native to the Arabian Peninsula. Due to the difficulties in establishing the validity of such traditions, later rabbinical authorities forbade contact with all types of locustJoseph Caro,Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah:85 to ensure that the ritually unclean locusts were avoided. Small land creatures specifies that whatever \\"goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, any swarming thing that swarms on the ground, you shall not eat, for they are detestable.\\" (Hebrew: sheqets). Before stating this, it singles out eight particular \\"creeping things\\" as specifically being ritually unclean in . Like many of the other biblical lists of animals, the exact identity of the creatures in the list is uncertain; medieval philosopher and Rabbi, Saadia Gaon, for example, gives a somewhat different explanation for each of the eight \\"creeping things.\\" The Masoretic Text names them as follows: * holed; the Talmud describes it as a predatory animalHullin 52b that bores underground.Baba Kama 80aBaba Batra 19bHullin 20b * akhbar; in Arabic, the cognate word, akhbar, refers to the jerboa * tzab; the Talmud describes it as being similar to a salamanderHullin 127a * anaqah; this Hebrew term literally means groaner, and consequently a number of scholars believe it refers to a gecko, which makes a distinctive croaking sound. * ko'ah * leta'ah; the Talmud describes it as being paralyzed by heat but revived with water, and states that its tail moves when cut off Oholot 1:6 * homet * tinshemet; this term literally means blower/breather, this term also appears in the list of birds The Septuagint version of the list does not appear to directly parallel the Masoretic, and is thought to be listed in a different order. It lists the eight as: * galei; a general term including the weasel, ferret, and the stoat, all of which are predatory animals noticeably attracted to holes in the ground. * mus; the mouse. * krokodelos-chersaios; the land crocodile, which is thought to refer to the monitor lizard, a very large lizard of somewhat crocodilian appearance. * mygale; the shrew. * chamaileon; the chameleon, which puffs itself up and opens its mouth wide when threatened * chalabotes; a term derived from chala meaning rock/claw, and therefore probably the wall lizard * saura; the lizard in general, possibly here intended to be the skink, since it is the remaining other major group of lizards * aspalax; the mole-rat, although some older English translations, not being aware of the mole-rat's existence, have instead translated this as mole *The earthworm, the snake, the scorpion, the beetle, the centipede, and all the creatures that crawl on the ground are not kosher. *Worms, snails and most invertebrate animals are not kosher. *All reptiles, all amphibians and insects with the exception of four types of locust are not kosher.

It is smaller but similar in colouration to the common myna, only differing in having brick-red naked skin behind the eyes instead of yellow. It is greyer on the underside and in this and in the presence of a slight tuft of feathers bears some resemblance to the jungle myna. They are found in flocks on the plains of northern and central India, often within towns and cities. Their range appears to be extending southwards into India. The name is derived from their habit of nesting almost exclusively in the earthen banks of rivers, where they excavate burrows and breed in large colonies. Description left The head is black on the crown and sides and the upper plumage is slaty grey while the underside is lighter grey with pale pink plumage towards the centre of the abdomen. The wing is black but has a wing patch at the base of the primaries and the tips of the outer tail feathers are pale pinkish buff. The naked skin behind the eye is brick red, the legs are yellow while the iris is deep red. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Young birds have a browner head and neck. The species is evolutionarily closest to the common myna. Habitat and distribution The native range of the bank myna is almost restricted to the Indian subcontinent from the Indus valley in the West to the Gangetic delta in the East and south of the lower foothills of the Himalayas, only rarely being found in sheltered valleys. They are found mainly in the vicinity of open water and their usual habitat is cultivated farmland and open country, but flocks will often live within cities, in markets and railway stations. They make use of food scraps disposed by humans, even following catering vehicles at airports to standing aircraft. A group on an overhead water storage tank The distribution was formerly noted to be restricted north, roughly, of a line between Bombay and Balasore in Orissa, but the species may be expanding its range. They are also common in Pakistan in the districts of Sind and Punjab. A specimen from Kandahar was earlier considered the westernmost record of a vagrant, but the birds have since established themselves in the region. Although mainly resident, they make movements in response to food and weather. The species name of the bird is based on the name given by Latham from a description by Pierre Sonnerat who described Le petit Martin de Gingi in 1782, referring to Gingee near Pondicherry in southern India. Thomas C. Jerdon noted in 1863 that the species did not occur in southern India however the species was recorded in the region in 1914 at Vandalur near Madras. Records from further south in India are, however, increasing since 2000. Breeding colonies have been found in Assam. These mynas have been introduced into Kuwait, where they have become established in the wild. Flocks have also been found in the Maldives, Taiwan and Japan. Behaviour and ecology A bank myna having captured a frog Bank mynas are gregarious foraging in flocks, breeding colonially and roosting together in trees. They perch on livestock and live in crowded towns allowing close approach, often picking up scraps in markets and dumps. They are vociferous and use a wide range of calls that include clucks, croaks, screeches, whistles and warbling elements. Bank mynas feed on grain, insects and fruits. Like the common myna, they sometimes follow grazing animals picking up disturbed insects or even ticks on the animals. They feed on ripening crops such as those of sorghum, grape and pearl millet. They feed on a variety of insects, including some that are crop pests such as Achaea janata whose caterpillars feed on castor. Bank mynas have a nesting season from April to July or August, most birds breeding in May and June. The nest is always built in earth walls, on the banks of rivers, embankments or the sides of open wells. They will sometimes make use of holes in brick walls. Nests have also been recorded between stacked bales of sugarcane stalks. They excavate the nest hole, the egg chamber sometimes 4 to 7 feet from the entrance. The nest is lined with grass, feathers and sometimes snake sloughs. About four of five pale sky blue or greenish-blue eggs is the usual clutch. Two broods may be raised in the same season. The eggs hatch after about 13 to 14 days. Nestlings open their eyes after about 5 days and fledge in about 21 days. About 38% of the eggs hatched into young that fledged in one study. A species of coccidian parasite, Isospora ginginiana, and several species of nematode (Oxyspirura, Choanotaenia, Hymenolepis sp.) have been described from the species.

During the early Bronze Age period Sargon of Akkad united all the native Semitic-speakers and the Sumerians of Mesopotamia (including the Assyrians) under the Akkadian Empire (2335‚Äì2154 BC). Assyria essentially existed as part of a unified Akkadian nation for much of the period from the 24th century BC to the 22nd century BC, and a nation-state from the mid 21st century BC until its destruction as an independent state between 615‚Äì599 BC. The Assyrians are culturally, linguistically, genetically and ethnically distinct from their neighbours in the Middle East ‚Äì the Arabs, Syrians, Persians/Iranians, Kurds, Jews, Turks, Israelis, Azeris, Shabaks, Yezidis, Kawliya, Mandeans and Armenians. Assyrian nationalism emphasizes their indigeneity to the Assyrian homeland, together with cultural, historical and ethnic Assyrian continuity since the Iron Age Neo-Assyrian Empire, and Achaemenid Persian, Greek, Roman, Parthian, and Sassanid ruled Athura/Assuristan. Assyria was a land stretching from Tkrit in the south to Amida, Kultepe and Harran in the north, and from Edessa in the west to the border of Persia (Iran) in the east. The Assyrians are indigenous to modern northern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran and northeast Syria. These modern areas encompassed ancient Assyria between the 21st century BC and 7th century AD. Much of this land is now also inhabited by much later arriving Kurds, Arabs, Turks, Yezidis, Armenians, Shabakis, Turcomans and others. The Assyrians are a Semitic people, with many (estimates range between 575,000 and 1,000,000) still speaking, reading and writing Akkadian influenced dialects of East Aramaic. Today they are a Christian people, with most being followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church. Ancient Assyria In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to a Neanderthal culture such as has been found at the Shanidar Cave. The earliest Neolithic sites in Assyria were the Jarmo culture c. 7100 BC and Tell Hassuna, the centre of the Hassuna culture, c. 6000 BC. The cities of Assur (also spelled Ashur or A≈°≈°ur) and Nineveh, together with a number of other towns and cities, existed as early as the 26th century BC, although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centers at this time, rather than independent states. The Assyrian king list records kings dating from the 25th century BC onwards, the earliest being Tudiya, who was a contemporary of Ibrium of Ebla. However, many of these early kings would have been local rulers, and from the late 24th century BC to the early 22nd century BC, usually subject to the Akkadian Empire based in the city of Akkad, which united all of the Akkadian speaking Semites (including the Assyrians) under one rule.. The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) population.Woods C. 2006 \\"Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian\\". In S. L. Sanders (ed) Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture: 91‚Äì120 Chicago After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, the Akkadians once more fragmented into smaller nation-states, with Assyria coming to dominate northern Mesopotamia, and states such as Ur, Kish, Isin and Larsa the south. In the 18th century BC the south Mesopotamian states were subsumed into a new power, that of Babylonia. However, Babylonia unlike Assyria, was founded and originally ruled by non indigenous Amorites, and was to be more often than not ruled by other waves of non indigenous peoples such as Kassites, Hittites, Elamites, Arameans and Chaldeans, as well as by the indigenous Assyrians. Assyria was for most of this period a powerful and highly advanced nation, and a major center of Mesopotamian civilization and Mesopotamian religion. Assyria had three periods of empire; the Old Assyrian Empire (2025‚Äì1750 BC) which saw it emerge as the most powerful state in the region, extending colonies into southeast Anatolia, the northern Levant, central Mesopotamia and northwestern Ancient Iran. The Middle Assyrian Empire (1365‚Äì1020 BC) saw Assyria emerge as the most powerful military and political force in the known world, destroying the Mitanni-Hurrian empire, largely annexing the Hittite Empire, forcing the Egyptian Empire from the region, conquering Babylonia and besting the Elamites, Kassites, Phrygians, Amorites, Arameans, Phoenicians and Cilicians among others. Middle Assyrian Empire kings extended Assyrian domination from Mount Ararat in the north to Dilmun (modern Bahrain) in the south, and from the Eastern Mediterranean and Antioch in the west to the Zagros (in modern northern Iran) in the east. The Neo-Assyrian Empire (911‚Äì605 BC) was the largest the world had yet seen; in the north, it extended to the Transcaucasia (modern Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan), to the south it encompassed Egypt, northern Nubia (modern Sudan), Libya and much of the Arabian peninsula, to the west it extended into parts of Ancient Greece, Cyprus, Cilicia, Phoenicia western Anatolia etc., and the East Mediterranean, and to the east into Persia, Media, Gutium, Parthia, Elam, Cissia and Mannea (the modern western half of Iran). In 626 BC it descended into a bitter series of civil wars conducted by rival claimants to the throne, weakening it severely, and allowing it to be eventually conquered by a coalition of former subject peoples. In 615 BC combined attacks by an alliance of its former subjects; namely the Medes, Babylonians, Persians, Chaldeans, Scythians, Sagartians and Cimmerians, gradually led to its fall by 599 BC. However, Assyria was to survive as a geo-political entity until the mid 7th century AD. The Assyrians today speak dialects of Eastern Aramaic, which still contain an Akkadian grammatical structure and hundreds of Akkadian loanwords. This language was originally introduced to Assyria as the lingua franca of the Neo Assyrian Empire in the mid 8th century BC by Tiglath-pileser III. Post Assyrian Empire After the defeat of Ashur-uballit II in 608 BC at Haran, at Carchemish in 605 BC, and after the last center of Assyrian imperial records at D≈´r-Katlimmu in 599 BC, the Assyrian empire was divided up by the key invading forces, the Babylonians and the Medes, with the Medes ruling Assyria proper. The Assyrian people, after the fall of their empire, fell under foreign domination ever since. Assyria came under the rule of the short-lived Median Empire until 546 BC. The last king of Babylon, Nabonidus (together with his son and co-regent Belshazzar), was ironically an Assyrian from Harran. Assyria then became an Achaemenid province named Athura (Assyria). The Median Empire was then conquered by Cyrus in 547 BC,Olmatead, History of the Persian Empire, Chicago University Press, 1959, p.39 under the Achaemenid dynasty, and the Persian Empire was thus founded, which consumed the entire Neo-Babylonian or \\"Chaldean\\" Empire in 539 BC. King Cyrus changed Assyria's capital from Nineveh to Arbela. Assyrians became front line soldiers for the Persian empire under King Xerxes, playing a major role in the Battle of Marathon under King Darius I in 490 BC. Artifacts show rivals Athens and Sparta, Yahoo News, December 5, 2006. Cyrus II returned the sacred images of the Assyrians to Nineveh and Assur, established for them permanent sanctuaries, gathered all their former inhabitants and returned them to their habitations. At the news of the assassination of Bardiya (son of Cyrus II), and this connection, Darius the Great declared that several satrapies including the Assyrian satrapy revolted. In 482 BC, Babylonia and Assyria were joined together in the same administrative division. The Assyrian people were Christianized in the 1st to 3rd centuries, in Roman Syria and Roman Assyria. They were divided by the Nestorian Schism in the 5th century, and from the 8th century, they became a religious minority following the Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia. They suffered a genocide at the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and today to a significant extent live in diaspora. Early Christian period Edessa family, 3rd century. In Assyrian Church of the East tradition, the Assyrians are descended from Abraham's grandson (Dedan son of Jokshan), progenitor of the ancient Assyrians.Genesis 25:3 Along with the Arameans, Phoenicians, Armenians, Greeks and Nabateans, they were among the first people to convert to Christianity and spread Eastern Christianity to the Far East. The Council of Seleucia of c. 325 dealt with jurisdictional conflicts among the leading bishops. At the subsequent Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon of 410, the Christian communities of Mesopotamia renounced all subjection to Antioch and the \\"Western\\" bishops and the Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon assumed the rank of Catholicos. The Nestorian and Monophysite schisms of the 5th century divided the church into separate denominations. With the rise of Syriac Christianity, eastern Aramaic enjoyed a renaissance as a classical language in the 2nd to 8th centuries, and the modern Assyrian people continue to speak eastern Neo- Aramaic dialects which still retain a number of Akkadian loan words to this day. Whereas Latin and Greek Christian cultures became protected by the Roman and Byzantine empires respectively, Assyrian/Syriac Christianity often found itself marginalized and persecuted. Antioch was the political capital of this culture, and was the seat of the patriarchs of the church. However, Antioch was heavily Hellenized, and the cities of Edessa, Nisibis, Arbela and Ctesiphon became Syriac cultural centres. =The Seleucid Greek hegemony= At the end of the Achaemenid Persian rule in 330 BC, Mesopotamia was partitioned into the satrapy of Babylon in the south, while the northern part of Mesopotamia was joined with Syria in another satrapy. It is not known how long this division lasted, but by the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, the north was removed from Syria and made into a separate satrapy. Generally speaking, the Seleucid rulers respected the native priesthood of Mesopotamia, and there is no record of persecutions. There is proof that the Parthians, when establishing their sovereignty over different parts in the empire, retained the dynasts that had become independent or had been acting on behalf of the Seleucids, as long as they accepted Parthian sovereignty. Full overlordship of the Parthians was established since the full establishment of the empire under Arsaces I of Parthia. Aramaic was the official language of the Achaemenid Persian Empire; after the conquests of Alexander the Great, Greek replaced Aramaic, including up to the Seleucid empire. However, both Greek and Aramaic were used throughout the empire, although Greek was the principal language of the government. Aramaic changed different parts of the empire, and in Mesopotamia, under the subsequent rule of the Parthians it evolved into Syriac. =Roman Empire= Syria became a Roman province in 64 BC, following the Third Mithridatic War. The Assyria-based army accounted for three legions of the Roman army, defending the Parthian border. In the 1st century, it was the Assyria-based army that enabled Vespasian's coup. Syria was of crucial strategic importance during the crisis of the third century. From the later 2nd century, the Roman senate included several notable Assyrians, including Claudius Pompeianus and Avidius Cassius. In the 3rd century, Assyrians even reached for imperial power, with the Severan dynasty. Roman Syria in 125 AD. Roman sovereignty of Syria ceased passed the Euphrates River. From the 1st century BC, Assyria was the theatre of the protracted Perso-Roman Wars. It would become a Roman province (Assyria Provincia) between 116 and 363 AD, although Roman control of this province was unstable and was often returned to the Parthians and Persians. =Parthian hegemony= When the Seleucids passed, it was the Iranian Parthians who took their place, wielding the scepter over much of West Asia for some 400 years. It is during the Parthian period that the Christianisation of Adiabene began. Despite the influx of foreign elements, despite the changes in architecture, the presence of Assyrians is confirmed by the worship of God Ashur, all proof of the continuity of the Assyrians. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the Greeks, Parthians, and Romans had a rather low-level of integration with the local population in Mesopotamia, which allowed their cultures to survive. Therefore, the large influx of Greek and Iranian Parthian elements did not wipe out the local population and culture. The Parthians exercised only loose control over Assyria, and it saw a major cultural revival, with Ashur once more becoming independent, and other Assyrian states arising, such as Adiabene, Osroene, Beth Nuhadra and Beth Garmai, together with the partly Assyrian state of Hatra. At the dawn of Christianity in the 1st century AD the people living in Assyria were Assyrians, bordered by Parthians, Persians, Greeks, and Armenians. =Sassanid Persian hegemony= In 225 AD Parthian rule over the Assyrian territories straightly moved to the newly established and vibrant Sassanid Persian Empire. The population of Asorestan was a mixed one, composed of Assyrians, Arameans (in the far south, and western deserts), and Persians. The Greek element in the cities, still strong in the Parthian period, was absorbed by the Semites in Sasanian times. The majority of the population were Assyrian people, speaking Eastern Aramaic dialects. As the breadbasket of the Sasanian Empire, most of the population were engaged in agriculture or worked as traders and merchants. The Persians were found in the administrative class of society, as army officers, civil servants, and feudal lords, living partly in the country, partly in Ctesiphon. At least three dialects of Eastern Aramaic were in spoken and liturgical use: Syriac mainly in the north and among Assyrian Christians, Mandaic in the south and among Mandaeans, and a dialect in the central region, of which the Judaic subvariety is known as Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. Aside from the liturgical scriptures of these religions which exist today, archaeological examples of all three of these dialects can be found in the collections of thousands of Aramaic incantation bowls‚Äîceramic artifacts dated to this era‚Äîdiscovered in Iraq. While the Jewish Aramaic script retained the original \\"square\\" or \\"block\\" form of the Aramaic alphabet used in Imperial Aramaic (the Ashuri alphabet), the Syriac alphabet and the Mandaic alphabet developed when cursive styles of Aramaic began to appear. The Mandaic script itself developed from the Parthian chancellery script. The religious demography of Mesopotamia was very diverse during Late Antiquity. From the 1st and 2nd centuries Syriac Christianity became the primary religion, while other groups practiced Mandaeism, Judaism, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and the old Mesopotamian religion. Christians were probably the most numerous group in the province. The Sasanian state religion, Zoroastrianism, was largely confined to the Persian administrative class. Asorestan, and particularly Assyria proper, were the centers for the Church of the East (continuity with which is now claimed by several churches), which at times (partially due to the vast areas the Sasanian empire covered) was the most widespread Christian church in the world, reaching well into Central Asia, China and India. The Church of the East went through major consolidation and expansion in 410 during the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, held at the Sasanian capital (in Asorestan). Selucia-Ctesiphon remained a location of the Patriarchate of the Church of the East for over 600 years. This period of Sassanid hegemony lasted till the advent of the invading Rashidun Arabs between 633 and 638 AD after which Assuristan got annexed by the Islamic Arabs. Together with Mayshan became the province of al-'IrƒÅq. A century later, the area became the capital province of the Abbasid Caliphate and the center of Islamic civilization for five hundred years; from the 8th to the 13th centuries. Islamic empires After the Arab Islamic Conquest of the mid 7th century AD Assuristan (Assyria) was dissolved as an entity. The previously basic civilization of the desert-dwelling Arabs was greatly enhanced and enriched by the influence and knowledge of native Mesopotamian scientists, physicians, mathematicians, theologians, astronomers, architects, agriculturalists, artists, and astrologers. Aramaic language and Syriac Christianity in the Middle East and Central Asia until being largely annihilated by Tamerlane in the 14th century. Assyrian Christians especially Nestorian contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Ummayads and the Abbasids by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic.Hill, Donald. Islamic Science and Engineering. 1993. Edinburgh Univ. Press. , p.4 They also excelled in philosophy, science (such as Hunayn ibn Ishaq, Qusta ibn Luqa, Masawaiyh, Patriarch Eutychius, Jabril ibn Bukhtishu etc.) and theology (such as Tatian, Bar Daisan, Babai the Great, Nestorius, Toma bar Yacoub etc.) and the personal physicians of the Abbasid Caliphs were often Assyrian Christians such as the long serving Bukhtishu dynasty.R√©mi Brague, Assyrians contributions to the Islamic civilizationBritannica, Nestorian However, despite this, indigenous Assyrians became second class citizens in a greater Arab Islamic state, and those who resisted Arabisation and conversion to Islam were subject to religious, ethnic and cultural discrimination, and had certain restrictions imposed upon them.Clinton Bennett (2005). Muslims and Modernity: An Introduction to the Issues and Debates. Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 163. . Retrieved 2012-07-07 They were excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters, as Christians they were subject to payment of a special tax (jizyah), they were banned from spreading their religion further in Muslim ruled lands, men were banned from marrying Muslim women, but at the same time they were also expected to adhere to the same laws of property, contract and obligation as the Muslim Arabs.H. Patrick Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 219. The ancient Assyrian capital of Nineveh had its bishop of the Church of the East at the time of the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia. The Arabs still recognised Assyrian identity in the Medieval period, describing them as Ashuriyun.Hannibal Travis (2006), \\"Native Christians Massacred\\": The Ottoman Genocide of the Assyrians During World War I, Genocide Studies and Prevention: An International Journal, vol. 1.3, pp. 329 Assyrian people, still retaining Akkadian infused and influenced Eastern Aramaic and Church of the East Christianity, remained dominant in the north of Mesopotamia (what had been Assyria) as late as the 14th century ADAccording to Georges Roux and Simo Parpola and the city of Assur was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the mid-14th century when the Muslim Turco-Mongol ruler Tamurlane conducted a religiously-motivated massacre of indigenous Assyrian Christians. After that, there are no traces of a settlement at Ashur in the archaeological and numismatic record, and from this point, the Assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland. However, another theory posits that the migration of many Assyrians out of Ashur began in the fourteenth century during the Mongol conquests. In 1552, a schism occurred within the Church of the East: the established \\"Eliya line\\" of patriarchs was opposed by a rival patriarch, Sulaqa, who initiated what is called the \\"Shimun line\\". He and his early successors entered into communion with the Catholic Church, but in the course of over a century their link with Rome grew weak and was openly renounced in 1672, when Shimun XIII Dinkha adopted a profession of faith that contradicted that of Rome, while he maintained his independence from the \\"Eliya line\\". Leadership of those who wished to be in communion with Rome passed to the Archbishop of Amid Joseph I, recognized first by the Turkish civil authorities (1677) and then by Rome itself (1681). A century and a half later, in 1830, headship of the Catholics was conferred on Yohannan Hormizd. Yohannan was a member of the \\"Eliya line\\" family, but he opposed the last of that line to be elected in the normal way as patriarch, Isho øyahb (1778‚Äì1804), most of whose followers he won over to communion with Rome, after he himself was irregularly elected in 1780, as Sulaqa was in 1552. The \\"Shimun line\\" that in 1553 entered communion with Rome and broke it off in 1672 is now that of the church that in 1976 officially adopted the name \\"Assyrian Church of the East\\", while a member of the \\"Eliya line\\" family is one of the patriarchs of the Chaldean Catholic Church. For many centuries, from at least the time of Jerome (c. 347 ‚Äì 420), the term \\"Chaldean\\" indicated the Aramaic language and was still the normal name in the nineteenth century. Only in 1445 did it begin to be used to mean Aramaic speakers in communion with the Catholic Church, on the basis of a decree of the Council of Florence, which accepted the profession of faith that Timothy, metropolitan of the Aramaic speakers in Cyprus, made in Aramaic, and which decreed that \\"nobody shall in future dare to call [...] Chaldeans, Nestorians\\".\\"Council of Basel-Ferrara-Florence, 1431-49 A.D.Braun-Winkler, p. 112 Previously, when there were as yet no Catholic Aramaic speakers of Mesopotamian origin, the term \\"Chaldean\\" was applied with explicit reference to their \\"Nestorian\\" religion. Thus Jacques de Vitry wrote of them in 1220/1 that \\"they denied that Mary was the Mother of God and claimed that Christ existed in two persons. They consecrated leavened bread and used the 'Chaldean' (Syriac) language\\".Wilhelm Braun, Dietmar W. Winkler, The Church of the East: A Concise History (RoutledgeCurzon 2003), p. 83 Until the second half of the 19th century. the term \\"Chaldean\\" continued in general use for East Syriac Christians, whether \\"Nestorian\\" or Catholic:William F. Ainsworth, Travels and Researches in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Chaldea and Armenia (London 1842), vol. II, p. 272, cited in John Joseph, The Modern Assyrians of the Middle East (BRILL 2000), pp. 2 and 4 it was the West Syriacs who were reported as claiming descent from Asshur, the second son of Shem. Starting from the 19th century after the rise of nationalism in the Balkans, the Ottomans started viewing Assyrians and other Christians in their eastern front as a potential threat. Furthermore, constant wars between The Ottomans and the Shiite Safavids encouraged the Ottomans into settling their allies, the nomadic Sunni Kurds, in what is today Northern Iraq and South-eastern Turkey.Hirmis Aboona, Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans: Intercommunal Relations on the Periphery of the Ottoman Empire, pp. 105 Starting from then, Kurdish tribal chiefs established semi-independent emirates. The Kurdish Emirs sought to consolidate their power by attacking Assyrian communities which were already well established there. Scholars estimate that tens of thousands of Assyrian in the Hakkari region were massacred in 1843 when Badr Khan the emir of Bohtan invaded their region.David Gaunt, Massacres, Resistance, Protectors: Muslim-Christian Relations in Eastern, pp. 32 After a later massacre in 1846 The Ottomans were forced by the western powers into intervening in the region, and the ensuing conflict destroyed the Kurdish emirates and reasserted the Ottoman power in the area. The Assyrians of Amid were also subject to the massacres of 1895. 20th century The Assyrians suffered a further catastrophic series of massacres known as the Assyrian Genocide, at the hands of the Ottomans and their Kurdish and Arab allies from 1915‚Äì1918. The genocide (committed in conjunction with the Armenian Genocide and Greek Genocide) accounted for up to 750,000 unarmed Assyrian civilians and the forced deportations of many more. The sizable Assyrian presence in southeastern Asia Minor which had endured for over four millennia was reduced to a few thousand. As a consequence, the surviving Assyrians took up arms, and an Assyrian war of independence was fought during World War I, For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers, scoring a number of victories over the Ottomans and Kurds, and also hostile Arab and Iranian groups; then their Russian allies left the war following the Russian Revolution, and Armenian resistance broke. The Assyrians were left cut off, surrounded, and without supplies, forcing those in Asia Minor and Northwest Iran to fight their way, with civilians in tow, to the safety of British lines and their fellow Assyrians in the Assyrian homeland of northern Iraq. Assyrians prominently served in Iraq Levies organized by the British in 1919, and after 1928, these became the Assyrian Levies. Many Assyrians from Hakkari settled in Syria after they were displaced and driven out by Ottoman Turks in southeast Turkey in the early 20th century.Betts, Robert Brenton, Christians in the Arab East (Atlanta, 1978) During the 1930s and 1940s, many Assyrians resettled in northeastern Syrian villages, such as Tel Tamer, Al-Qahtaniyah Al Darbasiyah, Al-Malikiyah, Qamishli and a few other small towns in Al-Hasakah Governorate.Dodge, Bayard, \\"The Settlement of the Assyrians on the Khabur,\\" Royal Central Asian Society Journal, July 1940, pp. 301-320. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of Iraq and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader Mar Shimun XXI Eshai asked the League of Nations to recognize the right of Assyrians to govern the area known as the \\"Assyrian triangle\\" in northern Iraq. The Assyrians suffered the Simele Massacre, where thousands of unarmed villagers (men, women, and children) were slaughtered by joint Arab-Kurdish forces of the Iraqi Army. These massacres followed a clash between Assyrian tribesmen and the Iraqi army, where the Iraqi forces suffered a defeat after trying to disarm the Assyrians, whom they feared would attempt to secede from Iraq. Armed Assyrian Levies were prevented by the British from going to the aid of these defenseless civilians. Eventually this led to the Iraqi government to commit its first of many massacres against its unarmed minority populations (see Simele massacre).Iraq Between the Two World Wars: The Militarist Origins of Tyranny, by Reeva Spector Simon The Assyrian Levies were founded by the British in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as Rab-shakeh, Rab-talia and Tartan, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds, guard the borders with Iran and Turkey and protect British military installations.Len Deighton (1993), Blood, Tears and Folly The Assyrians were allied with the British during World War II, with eleven Assyrian companies seeing action in Palestine/Israel and another four serving in Cyprus. The Parachute Company was attached to the Royal Marine Commando and Assyrian Paratroopers were involved in fighting in Albania, Italy and Greece. Assyrians played a major role in the victory over Arab-Iraqi forces at the Battle of Habbaniya and Anglo-Iraq war in 1941, when the Iraqi government decided to join WW2 on the side of Nazi Germany. The British presence in Iraq lasted until 1954, and Assyrian Levies remained attached to British forces until this time. The period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President Kassim, in particular, saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over-represented in sports such as Boxing, Football, Athletics, Wrestling and Swimming. However, in 1963, the Ba'ath Party took power by force in Iraq. The Baathists, though secular, were Arab Nationalists, and set about attempting to Arabize the many on Arab peoples of Iraq, including the Assyrians. Other ethnic groups targeted for forced Arabization included Kurds, Armenians, Turcomans, Mandeans, Yezidi, Shabaki, Kawliya, Persians and Circassians. This policy included refusing to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group, banning the publication of written material in Eastern Aramaic, and banning its teaching in schools, banning parents giving Assyrian names to their children, banning Assyrian political parties, taking control of Assyrian churches, attempting to divide Assyrians on denominational lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox) and forced relocations of Assyrians from their traditional homelands to major cities. In response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the Zowaa movement within the Assyrian Democratic Movement took up armed struggle against the Iraqi regime in 1982 under the leadership of Yonadam Kanna, and then joined up with the IKF in the early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna, in particular, was a target of the Saddam Hussein Ba'ath regime for many years. The policies of the Baathists have also long been mirrored in Turkey, whose governments have refused to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group since the 1920s, and have attempted to Turkify the Assyrians by calling them Semitic Turks and forcing them to adopt Turkic names. In Syria too, the Assyrian/Syriac Christians have faced pressure to identify as Arab Christians. Many persecutions have befallen the Assyrians since, such as the Anfal campaign and Baathist, Arab and Kurdish nationalist and Islamist persecutions. Post-Ba'thist Iraq With the fall of Saddam Hussein and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, no reliable census figures exist on the Assyrians in Iraq (as they do not for Iraqi Kurds or Turkmen), though the number of Assyrians is estimated to be approximately 800,000. The Assyrian Democratic Movement (or ADM) was one of the smaller political parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its officials say that while members of the ADM also took part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future. The ethnic make-up of the Iraq Interim Governing Council briefly (September 2003 ‚Äì June 2004) guided Iraq after the invasion included a single Assyrian Christian, Younadem Kana, a leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement and an opponent of Saddam Hussein since 1979. In October 2008 many Iraqi Christians(about 12,000 almost Assyrians) have fled the city of Mosul following a wave of murders and threats targeting their community. The murder of at least a dozen Christians, death threats to others, the destruction of houses forced the Christians to leave their city in hurry. Some families crossed the borders to Syria and Turkey while others have been given shelters in Churches and Monasteries. Accusations and blames have been exchanged between Sunni fundamentalists and some Kurdish groups for being behind this new exodus. For the time the motivation of these culprits remains mysterious, but some claims related it to the provincial elections due to be held at the end of January 2009, and especially connected to Christian's demand for wider presentation in the provincial councils. In recent years, the Assyrians in northern Iraq and northeast Syria have become the target of extreme unprovoked Islamic terrorism. As a result, Assyrians have taken up arms, alongside other groups (such as the Kurds, Turcomans and Armenians) in response to unprovoked attacks by Al Qaeda, ISIS/ISIL, Nusra Front and other terrorist Islamic Fundamentalist groups. In 2014 Islamic terrorists of ISIS attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the Assyrian Homeland of northern Iraq, together with cities such as Mosul and Kirkuk which have large Assyrian populations. There have been reports of atrocities committed by ISIS terrorists since, including; beheadings, crucifixions, child murders, rape, forced conversions, Ethnic Cleansing, robbery, and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non-Muslims. Assyrians in Iraq have responded by forming armed Assyrian militias to defend their territories. Assyrian continuity Thus far, the only people who have been attested with a high level of genetic, historical, linguistic and cultural research to be the descendants of the ancient Mesopotamians are the Assyrian Christians of Iraq and its surrounding areas in northwest Iran, northeast Syria and southeastern Turkey (see Assyrian continuity), although others have made unsubstantiated claims of continuity. Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century, and Assyrian identity, personal, family and tribal names, and both spoken and written evolutions of Mesopotamian Aramaic (which still contain many Akkadian loan words and an Akkadian grammatical structure) have survived among the Assyrian people from ancient times to this day (see Assyrian people).

Coker began with English club West Ham United then moved to the North American Soccer League and the Major Indoor Soccer League. He also earned five caps with the U.S. national team. Professional career Coker was born in Nigeria, but moved to England at the age of 11. He was playing schoolboy football when he was spotted by West Ham scout Wally St Pier. In 1971, he signed with English First Division club West Ham United when he was 17. His first start with the Hammers came on 30 October 1971, against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park following a late injury to Geoff Hurst. He scored on his debut, a 3‚Äì0 victory, but despite this auspicious first game, he made only eleven first team appearances over three seasons.Belton, Brian (2006). The Black Hammers p.23-24 Pennant Books. He spent the 1974 off-season with the Boston Minutemen of the North American Soccer League (NASL), earning Second Team All Star honors. Returning to England, in December 1974 he joined Lincoln City on loan, making his debut in the 2-0 home victory over Stockport County on 20 December 1974. He remained with the Imps for a month before returning to West Ham. Coker then moved permanently to America, rejoining the Boston Minutemen. Halfway through the 1976 season, Minutemen owner John Sterge began selling his players in order to forestall bankruptcy. Coker was sent to the Minnesota Kicks. Three games into the 1978 season, Minnesota traded Coker to the San Diego Sockers. At the end of the 1979 season, the Sockers sent Coker to the Rochester Lancers for the 1980 season. Coker spent the 1980‚Äì1981 Major Indoor Soccer League club Baltimore Blast. In 1982 Coker was back with San Diego as the Sockers began to transition towards indoor soccer. When the NASL collapsed following the 1984 season, the Sockers moved to MISL and became the league's dominant team. Coker remained with the Sockers until 1987. He spent one more season (1987‚Äì1988) in MISL with the St. Louis Steamers. U.S. national team Coker earned 5 caps with the U.S. national team. He earned his first cap in a September 9, 1984, scoreless draw with the Netherlands Antilles. A month later, he scored twice as in a 4‚Äì0 victory over the Netherlands Antilles after coming on for Chance Fry. He scored again two matches later, a 1‚Äì0 victory over Colombia. He played his fifth and last match for the U.S. in a 2‚Äì1 loss to Mexico on October 17, 1984. Post-Career In 2008, Coker alongside his West Ham teammates, Clive Charles and Clyde Best, were the subjects of the book 'East End Heroes, Stateside Kings'.

P0 is a major structural component of the myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Myelin protein zero is expressed by Schwann cells and accounts for over 50% of all proteins in the peripheral nervous system, making it the most common protein expressed in the PNS. Mutations in myelin protein zero can cause myelin deficiency and are associated with neuropathies like Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease and Dejerine‚ÄìSottas disease.  Structure  In humans, the gene that encodes myelin protein zero is located on chromosome 1 near the Duffy Locus or the Duffy Antigen/Chemokine Receptor. The gene is about 7,000 bases long and is divided into 6 exons. In total, myelin protein zero is 219 amino acids long and has many basic amino acid residues. Myelin protein zero consists of an extracellular N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-124), a single transmembrane region (125-150), and a smaller positively charged intracellular region (151-219). Its cytoplasmic domain is highly positively charged but presumably does not fold into a globular structure. The extracellular domain is structurally similar to the immunoglobulin domain and therefore the protein is considered as belonging to immunoglobulin superfamily Besides existing as a monomer, myelin protein zero is also known to form dimers and tetramers with other myelin protein zero molecules in vertebrates.  Function  The myelin sheath is a multi-layered membrane, unique to the nervous system, that functions as an insulator to greatly increase the velocity of axonal impulse conduction. Myelin protein zero, absent in the central nervous system, is a major component of the myelin sheath in peripheral nerves. Mutations that disrupt the function of myelin protein zero can lead to less expression of myelin and degeneration of myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system. Currently, myelin protein zero expression is postulated to be produced by signals from the axon. However, more details about the regulation of myelin protein zero are unknown. It is postulated that myelin protein zero is a structural element in the formation and stabilization of peripheral nerve myelin. Myelin protein zero is also hypothesized to serve as a cell adhesion molecule, holding multiple layers of myelin together. When a myelinating cell wraps its membrane around an axon multiple times, generating multiple layers of myelin, myelin protein zero helps keep these sheets compact by serving as a \\"glue\\" that keeps the layers of myelin together. It does so by holding its characteristic coil structure together by the electrostatic interactions of its positively charged intracellular domain with acidic lipids in the cytoplasmic face of the opposite bilayer. and by interaction between hydrophobic globular 'heads' of adjacent extracellular domains. Myelin protein zero's function is similar to the function of other proteins with immunoglobin domains like polyimmunoglobin and T4 protein. These proteins function as binding and adhesion molecules and participate in homotypic interactions, or interactions that involve two similar proteins. Myelin protein zero holds together the myelin sheath by participating in homotypic interactions with other myelin protein zero proteins. Myelin protein zero's extracellular domain binds to the myelin sphingolipid membrane and holds together myelin layers using homotypic interactions with other myelin protein zero extracellular domains, and with extracellular tryptophan residues interacting with the membrane. Myelin protein zero has also been demonstrated to interact with other proteins like peripheral myelin protein 22. However, at this point the purpose of these interactions has not yet been determined.  Associations with neuropathy  Mutations in myelin protein zero are known to cause myelin degeneration and neuropathy. Mutations that reduce myelin protein zero's adhesion function or its ability to participate in homeotypic interactions with other myelin protein zero proteins are thought to cause neuropathy. Mutations to myelin protein zero can lead to issues with the development of myelin early on in life or myelin degeneration on the axon later on in life. Some mutations can cause neuropathy in infancy like Derjerine-Sottas disease while other mutations can cause neuropathy within the first two decades of life like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Adding a charged amino acid or changing a cysteine residue in the extracellular membrane can lead to neuropathy onset early on. Truncating the cytoplasmic domain or changing the tertiary structure of myelin protein zero can also result in neuropathy because the cytoplasmic domain has been demonstrated to be necessary for homotypic interactions.

A former lieutenant in the Seattle Police Department, he began to bootleg part-time while still on the force. Following his arrest for that crime, he lost his job in law enforcement and turned to illegally importing and distributing alcohol from Canada as a full-time and highly profitable occupation. Eventually, wiretaps of his phones provided sufficient evidence for his arrest and prosecution, despite an appeal that reached the Supreme Court regarding the legality of the wiretap.Roy Olmstead, biography on the website of the 2011 PBS miniseries Prohibition. Accessed January 6, 2012. Biography =Early life= Born in 1886 to farmers John and Sarah Olmstead, in Beaver City, Nebraska, Roy moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1904. Working in the Moran Brothers Co. shipyard before joining the Seattle Police Department on May 16, 1907, he rose rapidly through the ranks and was promoted to sergeant on April 5, 1910; his brothers Frank and Ralph were also on the Seattle force. Seattle police chief Joe Warren (1858‚Äì1934) was so impressed with Sgt Olmstead's intelligence and professionalism, he appointed him Acting Lieutenant in 1917, with the promotion being made permanent on January 22, 1919. =Bootlegging operations= When Washington State prohibited the manufacturing and selling of alcohol in 1916, the police force began raiding bootleg operations. Olmstead, noting the potential for profit, began his own bootlegging operation while still a policeman. On March 22, 1920, Olmstead was identified driving around a roadblock set by Prohibition Bureau agents raiding a rum-running operation. He was fired from the force and paid a fine of $500, but now could devote his full attention to his smuggling operations. He ran his illegal operation like a business and before long he became one of the largest employers in Puget Sound. Known on the West Coast as \\"the Good Bootlegger\\", Olmstead did not engage in the practice of diluting his contraband with toxic industrial grade chemicals in order to increase his profits, selling only bonded liquor imported from Canada. To most other bootleggers, smuggling alcohol was but one facet of their criminal organization, and many were involved in prostitution, gambling, gun-running, and narcotics trafficking. Olmstead did not engage in these activities, and many did not regard him as a \\"true criminal\\" as a result. Despite the risks involved in rum-running, Olmstead did not allow his employees to carry firearms, telling his men he would rather lose a shipment of liquor than a life. In August 1924, after his divorce to his first wife Caliste Viola CottleMarriage Certificate dated 3 Apr 1909, Seattle King, WA, USA came through, Olmstead married Elise Caroline Parch√© (aka Campbell),Olmstead, Roy (1886-1966--King of King County Bootleggers http://www.historylink.org/File/4015 a Londoner who had worked for British Intelligence during World War I.Metcalfe, p. 69-70 =KFQX radio= In early October 1924, Roy and Elise Olmstead started radio station KFQX, with the assistance of inventor Al Hubbard.Metcalfe, p. 102 Studios were built in the Smith Tower, but were seldom used.Richardson, p. 95. For the most part, Elise ran the station. Typical of stations of the time, it had a variety format. The most popular program was \\"Aunt Vivian,\\" where Mrs. Olmstead as \\"Aunt Vivian\\" read bedtime stories for children, beginning at 7:15 at night. This led to a popular legend that Elise inserted coded language into her stories as signals for her husband's bootlegging network. Elise was broadcasting from her home as usual on November 17, 1924, when the home was raided by government agents and put off the air.Richardson, p. 33‚Äì37. After the raid the station was leased to Birt Fisher, who changed the call letters to KTCL.Richardson, p. 40. After Olmstead's liquor trial ended, he sold the station to Vincent Kraft who changed the call sign to KXA and moved the frequency from 570 to 770.Richardson, p. 134. =Olmstead v. United States= Largely on the basis of evidence obtained through police wiretapping of his telephone, Olmstead was arrested and tried for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act. A Federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Roy Olmstead and 89 other defendants on January 19, 1925, with the trial ending on February 20, 1926, with the conviction of 21 defendants including Roy Olmstead and his attorney, Jerry Finch. Olmstead was sentenced to four years with hard labor and fined $8,000; Finch receiving a sentence of two years and a fine of $500. Other defendants' sentences ranged from 15 months to three years, with fines; defendants who cooperated and testified for the government, received one-year sentences. Olmstead appealed his case, arguing that the incriminating wiretapping evidence, which had been obtained without a warrant, constituted a violation of his constitutional rights to privacy and against self- incrimination. However, in February 1928 the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in the landmark case of Olmstead v. United States. =Prison and later life= Olmstead spent his four-year prison sentence at the McNeil Island Correctional Institute,Prohibition‚Äôs Roy Olmstead: The Man Who No Longer Exists, BlogCritics.com, October 4, 2011. Last accessed January 6, 2012. and was released on May 12, 1931, with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reporting: \\"He got the usual time off for good behavior, but aside from this, he served his full term plus thirty days for the $8,000 fine assessed against him.\\" He moved back to Seattle to be with his wife and daughter, where he worked as an insecticides salesman and fumigator.Metcalfe, p. 339 On 25 December 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt granted him a full presidential pardon. Besides restoring his constitutional rights, the pardon remitted $100,000 the IRS claimed he owed in unpaid liquor taxes.Metcalfe, p. 340 While in prison, Olmstead became a Christian Science practitioner and a carpenter, later working with prison inmates in the Puget Sound area on an anti- alcoholism agenda. He was a vibrant and active community member for his remaining years, teaching Sunday school and visiting prisoners in the King County Jail every Monday morning. Olmstead and his wife separated in 1940, citing personal and religious differences, and they divorced in 1943.Metcalfe, p. 342 Roy Olmstead died April 30, 1966, at the age of 79.

It runs from Northeim to Nordhausen, via Herzberg am Harz, Bad Lauterberg-Barbis, Bad Sachsa, Walkenried and Ellrich. The line is long. Route The South Harz line runs roughly east‚Äìwest, with Northeim lying further north than Nordhausen. It runs from the Leine valley along the Rhume and the Oder (Harz) rivers with normal grades through Katlenburg-Lindau to Herzberg am Harz. From there it rises on a grade of up to 1.06% through Scharzfeld and Barbis to the former station of Osterhagen, the highest point of the line. The line falls gently and runs south of Bad Sachsa to Walkenried. To the east is the only tunnel on the line, connecting to the valley of the Zorge. Shortly after the tunnel is the border of Lower Saxony and Thuringia, the former Inner German border. From Ellrich the line follows the Zorge to Nordhausen. The Harz Railway (Harzquerbahn) runs parallel from Niedersachswerfen. Nordhausen station From Herzberg to Niedersachswerfen the South Harz line crosses the South Harz gypsum karst. Near Tettenborn, at Sachsenstein near Walkenried and near Woffleben there are problems with subsidence: the load-carrying capacity of the soil must be regularly controlled. During the building of the Walkenried Tunnel in 1868, the miners discovered the unstable Himmelreich cave, which made construction difficult. Three workers died during the tunnel construction, when the tunnel fell several metres. The distance markers begin in Northeim (Han) station at (measured from Hanover Central) and end in Nordhausen at . History At the beginning of the 1860s, the Kingdom of Hanover began to consider various options for railways in the southwest of the Harz. On the one hand, a connection between the planned Altenbeken‚ÄìKreiensen and Halle‚ÄìKassel railways could be built to take a portion of east‚Äìwest traffic. On the other hand, the industrial town of Osterode am Harz sought a rail connection. In 1865, it was agreed to build the line as it now exists with a branch from Katlenburg to Osterode. The section of the line in the Kingdom of Hanover would be built and operated by the Royal Hanoverian State Railways, while the Prussian section would be built and operated by the Magdeburg-C√∂then-Halle-Leipzig Railway Company (Magdeburg-C√∂then-Halle-Leipziger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), which owned the Halle‚ÄìKassel railway. The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 interrupted the work. Prussia won the war and confiscated the Hanoverian State Railways, giving control of the whole line to the Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway. 216 180-0 reached Northeim on 6 August 1995 with RE 3666 and is running around ready for the return journey. The level crossing at Northeimer M√ºhlentor, a possible location for a local halt. The South Harz line was opened on 1 December 1868 from Northeim to Herzberg and it was put into operation to Nordhausen on 1 August 1869. Since the completion of the Solling Railway from Ottbergen to Northeim in 1878, it was part of the shortest route between Cologne and Leipzig. It was therefore an important freight route between the Ruhr and Halle/Leipzig until 1945. On the other hand, the line never became important for passenger traffic, since most express trains bypassed the Harz. Near Ellrich the line crosses the modern border between Lower Saxony and Thuringia, which was the Inner German border from 1945 to 1990. The line was operated with freight trains during the existence of East Germany. Passenger services began operating along the whole line again on 12 November 1989. Since it was badly in need of repairs, trains in the 1990s and early 2000s could only run in some sections at a maximum speed of . It is now possible to operate over the major part of the line at a speed of . From 1899 to 1963, Walkenried was a terminus of the metre gauge line of the South Harz Railway Company (S√ºdharz- Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) to Braunlage. In Ellrich, a light railway to Zorge (Kleinbahn-AG Ellrich‚ÄìZorge) branched off between 1906 and 1945. In Scharzfeld, the former Oder Valley Railway branched off to St. Andreasberg- Silberh√ºtte. Passenger services on the last section to Bad Lauterberg were closed on 12 December 2004. Later Scharzfeld station was also closed and it was replaced from the timetable change on 11 December 2005 with a new halt called Bad Lauterberg im Harz‚ÄìBarbis. This is about 1 km to the east and is somewhat closer to the former Bad Lauterberg station than Scharzfeld station was. However, the new station is nearly 4.5 kilometers west of the centre of the town. Since 1911, the town of Northeim has held so far unsuccessful negotiations with the relevant railway companies to establish a station at the M√ºhlentor, which would be closer to the pedestrian zone than Northeim station. Signalling on the South Harz line will in future use electronic interlockings that are remotely controlled from a centre in G√∂ttingen. During World War II work began on the Helme Valley Railway (Helmetalbahn) between Osterhagen and Nordhausen to relieve congestion associated with the establishment of the nearby Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp to the northwest of Nordhausen in 1943. The camp was attached to the vast underground Mittelwerk weapons factories for building V-2s and V-1 flying bombs. Construction of the Helme Valley Railway began in 1944 and shortly later in 1945 the single-track ‚Äúvalley track‚Äù (Talgleis) was opened. The second track of the Helme Valley Railway, the \\"mountain track\\" (Berggleis), which would have run in the opposite direction, would have run to a point about two kilometres northeast of the junction of the South Harz line and the valley track, first crossing from the north to the south of the South Harz line and then running onto the track of the South Harz line that runs from Osterhagen to Northeim. Work was only started on its construction before work came to an end with Germany's loss of the war. Rail operations  The South Harz line is served by Regionalbahn services operated by DB Regio Niedersachsen. Since 2009, hourly services have operated between Nordhausen and Northeim, services going to or coming from G√∂ttingen or Bodenfelde alternatively. From Monday to Friday additional services also run between Northeim and Walkenried as well as between Northeim and Herzberg, connecting in Herzberg to Osterode am Harz and Brunswick. Services are operated with Alstom Coradia LINT diesel multiple units.  Literature  * Manfred Dittman: Vor 150 Jahren ‚Äì Lokomotiven aus dem Harz. Vom Lokomotiv- und Tenderbau in Zorge 1842‚Äì1851.

The route runs from an intersection with Bi-State Boulevard a short distance west of U.S. Route 13 (US 13) between Laurel and Delmar to DE 1 Business (DE 1 Bus.) southeast of Milford in the area of Lincoln and Cedar Creek. The road runs east to Gumboro, where it turns north on the Millsboro Highway to Millsboro. Along this road, DE 30 shares concurrencies with DE 26, DE 54, and DE 24\\\\. From Millsboro, the route passes through Gravel Hill and to the west of Milton before reaching Milford. DE 30 is signed as an east-west road from the southern terminus to the east end of the DE 24 concurrency in Millsboro and as a north-south road from that point until the northern terminus. What is now DE 30 south of Gravel Hill was built as a state highway in various stages during the 1920s and 1930s. A short-lived DE 30 in the 1930s ran from DE 20 in Seaford north and east to DE 404 northwest of Bridgeville. The current DE 30 was first designated by 1938 to connect DE 24 in Millsboro to DE 5 in Milton. The route was rerouted to end at DE 14 (now DE 1) south of Milford by 1971. DE 30 was extended southwest to Bi-State Boulevard by 1994 and its northern terminus was moved to DE 1 Bus. by way of a new road by 2003. An interchange with DE 1 was completed in 2014. DE 30 formerly had an alternate route, DE 30 Alternate (DE 30 Alt.), that was created by 1999 to connect the route with DE 1 by way of Johnson Road and was removed by 2017. Route description DE 30 northbound past US 9/DE 404 in Gravel Hill DE 30 begins at an intersection with Bi-State Boulevard in southwestern Sussex County between the towns of Laurel and Delmar, heading east on two-lane undivided Whitesville Road. A short distance later, the road crosses US 13 at a superstreet intersection, in which DE 30 traffic must turn right, use U-turn ramps along US 13, and turn right again to continue on DE 30\\\\. Following this, the road through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes to the south of Trap Pond State Park, crossing James Branch. The route turns southeast before it curves to the east again. Farther east, DE 30 comes to an intersection with DE 26/DE 54. At this point, DE 30 turns northeast to form a concurrency with DE 26/DE 54 on Millsboro Highway. The road curves north and heads into the residential community Gumboro, where DE 54 splits to the east. DE 26/DE 30 leaves Gumboro and continues back into areas of farms and forests with occasional residences. In Shaft Ox Corner, DE 26 splits to the east and DE 30 heads north to an intersection with DE 24 in Mission. Here, DE 24 turns north to join DE 30, with the road running northeast. Farther along, residential development increases as the road heads into the town of Millsboro. At this point, the road names becomes Laurel Road and it reaches an intersection with US 113/DE 20\\\\. Past this intersection, DE 24/DE 30 turns north-northeast on Washington Street. The two routes split into a one-way pair that heads north, following Main Street eastbound and Washington Street westbound. The road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision line at-grade. The one- way pair runs through the downtown area of Millsboro, rejoining along two-way Main Street and crossing Indian River to the east of Millsboro Pond. A short distance later, DE 24 and DE 30 split at an intersection. Upon splitting from DE 24, DE 30 signage changes from east-west to north-south and the route leaves Millsboro. It continues north on Gravel Hill Road, passing to the east of Millsboro Pond. The road heads through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. In the community of Zoar, the route intersects DE 24 Alt. Farther north, DE 30 reaches the community of Gravel Hill. In Gravel Hill, the road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Lewes Industrial Track line at-grade and comes to an intersection with US 9/DE 404\\\\. From this point, the route curves northwest before bending north again. DE 30 intersects DE 5 Alt., which serves as a western bypass of the town of Milton for DE 5\\\\. Here, DE 5 Alt. turns north to form a concurrency with DE 30, with the road crossing an abandoned railroad grade just east of the terminus of the Delmarva Central Railroad's Milton Industrial Track line. At an intersection with DE 16, DE 5 Alt. heads east along with that route and DE 30 continues north on Isaacs Road. The route heads away from Milton and crosses Sowbridge Branch as it passes to the east of Reynolds Pond. DE 30 intersects Cedar Creek Road and turns northwest onto that road, curving north and back to the northwest. The road heads through the Cedar Creek area and crosses Cedar Creek to the east of Swiggets Pond before it intersects Johnson Road. DE 30 continues north- northwest and comes to ramps providing access to and from the southbound lanes of DE 1\\\\. At this point, the route gains a center left-turn lane and passes east of Bayhealth Hospital, Sussex Campus before it reaches an intersection with Wilkins Road, which provides access to and from the northbound lanes of DE 1 at an interchange. Past this intersection, DE 30 turns northwest and passes between residential subdivisions to the southwest and DE 1 to the northeast as a two-lane road, coming to its northern terminus at an intersection with DE 1 Bus. at the point that route merges into DE 1 at an interchange southeast of the city of Milford. DE 30 has access to northbound DE 1 Bus. and access from southbound DE 1 Bus. The section of DE 30 between DE 24 and DE 1 serves as part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from areas along the inland bays in eastern Sussex County to points inland while the sections of DE 30 concurrent with DE 54 and between DE 26 and DE 24 serve as part of a secondary hurricane evacuation route from the coastal areas. The section of the route between DE 16 near Milton and DE 1 Bus. in Milford is designated as part of the Delaware's Bayshore Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 30 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 34,023 vehicles at the east end of the DE 24 concurrency to a low of 1,087 vehicles at the intersection with DE 26/DE 54. None of DE 30 is part of the National Highway System. History DE 30 eastbound concurrent with DE 26 and DE 54 in Gumboro By 1920, what is now DE 30 existed as a state highway between Mission and Phillips Hill and was proposed as one between Phillips Hill and Millsboro, with the remainder of the route existing as a county road. The state highway between Phillips Hill and Millsboro was completed by 1924. The state highway portion of the present-day route was extended from Mission to Gumboro a year later, with a section in the Gumboro area under proposal as a state highway. By 1931, the road was completed as a state highway between US 13 and Jones Branch and from James Branch to Gumboro. In addition, the state highway was completed from Millsboro to north of Gravel Hill as an unpaved road, with a portion north of Gravel Hill becoming a paved county road. The state highway between US 13 and Gumboro was fully complete the following year. By 1936, the road between Millsboro and Gravel Hill was paved. DE 30 was first designated in 1936 to run from DE 20 in Seaford north and east to DE 404 northwest of Bridgeville, heading north and crossing DE 18 in Atlanta before turning east to reach DE 404. This was eliminated by 1938, and is now Atlanta Road and Dublin Hill Road. By 1938, DE 30 was designated to run from DE 24 in Millsboro north to DE 5 in Milton, following its current alignment to north of Gravel Hill and then running along Shingle Point Road north into Milton. A portion of current DE 30 south of the DE 16 intersection was paved a year later. By 1952, the current route of DE 30 north of Gravel Hill was paved. DE 30 was rerouted to follow its present alignment north to DE 14 (now DE 1) south of Milford by 1971. By 1994, DE 30 was extended from Millsboro to its current terminus at Bi-State Boulevard. The northern terminus of DE 30 was moved to its current location at DE 1 Bus. by 2003 when a road connecting DE 30 to DE 1 Bus. was completed. In November 2012, construction began on an interchange at DE 1 southeast of Milford. The interchange between DE 1 and DE 30 was completed in July 2014. On February 29, 2016, construction began on a superstreet intersection at US 13; this project was completed on May 19 of that year. Major intersections Delaware Route 30 Alternate Delaware Route 30 Alternate (DE 30 Alt.) was a alternate route of DE 30 south of the city of Milford in the Cedar Creek area. It ran from DE 30 northeast to DE 1 along two-lane undivided Johnson Road, passing through a mix of farmland, woodland, and residential development. The route was created by 1999. DE 30 Alt. originally had full access to and from DE 1, but the median crossover was modified in 2011 to only allow access from DE 30 Alt. to southbound DE 1 while retaining access to DE 30 Alt. from both directions of DE 1. The DE 30 Alt. designation was removed from the road by 2017.

The school is named for its benefactor, James W. Bolton, an Alexandria banker who was one of the most prominent civic and political leaders of Central Louisiana during the first third of the 20th century. Bolton Bears insignia During the long era of segregation, Bolton was the only high school for white students in Alexandria and neighboring Pineville, a smaller city located to the east of the Red River. African Americans attended historically black Peabody Magnet High School. The construction of Pineville High School and Alexandria Senior High School (sometimes known as ASH), along with Tioga High School thereafter provided new options. Bolton has a tradition of academic and extracurricular excellence and performance. On its website, the school claims \\"a demanding academic program, coupled with opportunities to excel in athletics, music, forensics, publications, and academic competition, helps prepare our students to meet the challenges they will face as productive adults.\\" Bolton has had the highest average ACT composite in Rapides Parish for the past seven years. This year, Bolton's average ACT composite score is 23.20. Bolton is ranked in the top 3% of the nation's public schools. Bolton is the only school in the parish that has received a gold, silver, or bronze medal by U.S. News & World Report, and is one of only five silver medal rated schools in the state. Modest beginnings Bolton began in 1888 as a six-room framed structure on the corner of Seventh and Johnston Streets, next to what was then called the Red Ditch, for all then existing eleven grades. In 1900, as pushed by then-president of Alexandria Central High School, a brick building replaced the original structure at a cost of $50,000. During the 19071908 academic year, Alexandria High School, as it was known, enrolled only fifty-six students, with three instructors. Within seven years, enrollment grew to some two hundred, with eight faculty members. James Bolton, a member of the Rapides Parish School Board, proposed a separate building for high school students. He therefore purchased land at Sixth and Beauregard streets for the consideration of the board. On that site, the original Bolton High School, named for James Bolton, was constructed in 1915, a structure for up to four hundred students. Records show that for the year 19161917, there were a few more than 300 students, with 45 graduates and 15 teachers. For the first eleven years, enrollment increased from three hundred to nine hundred students. The overflow was handled through the old Presbyterian church next door and temporary frame building. Before the school was officially opened, there was an open house of sorts held in the school on September 25, 1915. The people were able to see their achievements towards education, and multiple teachers were stationed around the school, explaining the many merits of the different departments. 41 pupils graduated the first year it opened. As board president, Bolton obtained the purchase of for a new school, located adjacent to the City Park. The current building opened on November 2, 1926. The building contractor, George A. Caldwell, also designed twenty-five other public buildings in Louisiana, including courthouses in Baton Rouge, Minden, and Monroe. Renovations throughout the decades In 1953, the board approved a new football stadium that would seat some six thousand fans. A gymnasium and a new industrial arts building were completed. The auditorium was renovated, with band and choral rooms added. In 1964, the board authorized the enlargement of the cafeteria and the construction of a gymnasium for girls. Air conditioning was installed in the auditorium, the cafeteria, the home economics department, and in the rear section of the first floor of the main building. In 1967, a second parking lot was completed for the use of faculty and staff, and the choral room was modernized. In 1968, the U.S. Air Force ROTC program was added to the Bolton curriculum. In 1990, Bolton High School underwent major remodeling, with the addition of a central heating and cooling system and fire doors. Ceilings were lowered, and new lighting was installed. In 1992, the football stadium was completely rebuilt because the presence of lead in the original paint made it impractical to have the old structure repainted. In 1995, Bolton was wired for the Internet. In 2001, construction began on a new building for ROTC and journalism classes. The school has also modernized technologically, with computerized attendance, grading system, library service, and digital video equipment. Laptops have become nearly as common as textbooks. Also in 1995, Bolton added a Scholar's Program and Gifted Curriculum giving students from all over Rapides Parish the chance to attend Bolton. Bolton was also made a magnet school. Bolton currently follows a seven period day. With seven credits available per year, a student can complete up to twenty-eight units over four years. As the result of several private and state grants, Bolton High School has issued Apple Mac OS X laptops to all of their students and teachers. In addition to the school issuing laptop computers to students, Bolton High School now has wireless internet connection everywhere on campus. The school also renovated an unused classroom into the \\"Bolton Internet Cafe.\\" Though renovations are still in progress, the cyber cafe is open, and accessible before and after school, as well as at lunch, providing students without internet access at home with a place to use their laptops. In February 2017, the Rapides Parish School Board confirmed that it may merge Bolton with Alexandria Middle Magnet School. Though built for 1,500 students, Bolton had only 586 enrolled in the fall of 2016, just over one-third capacity in use. A group of parents who favor keeping Bolton intact expressed fear that a merger would lower academic standards and cause disciplinary problems. The board is also examining other alternatives to reduce operating costs, including the outright closure of three elementary schools and the consolidation of Arthur F. Smith Middle Magnet School with historically black Peabody Magnet High School. AP/Dual Enrollment Program Advanced Placement classes are currently offered at Bolton for many of the AP tests. These tests are taken by the students at the end of the year to receive college credit for the classes. In 2007, a Dual Enrollment program was put into full swing. The Dual Enrollment classes are taught through LSUE. The AP classes offered are: * Art (AP Studio Art, AP 3-D Art) * Western Civilizations (AP European History) * American History (AP United States History) * American Government (AP Government and Politics: United States) * Geography (AP Human Geography) * World History (AP World History) * Psychology (AP Psychology) * Microeconomics (AP Microeconomics) * Macroeconomics (AP Macroeconomics) * English III (AP English Language and Composition) * English IV (AP English Literature and Composition) * Biology II (AP Biology) * Chemistry II (AP Chemistry) * Environmental Science (AP Environmental Science) * Advanced Mathematics: Functions and Statistics (AP Statistics) * Calculus I (AP Calculus AB) * Calculus II (AP Calculus BC) The Dual Enrollment classes offered are: * American History GT (American History 2057) * Advanced Mathematics: Pre- Calculus * World History GT (World History 1001) * French II OR French III (Elementary French 1101 (Fall) and Elementary French 1102 (Spring)) * Spanish II OR Spanish III (Elementary Spanish 1101 (Fall) and Elementary French 1102 (Spring)) Course Offerings ENGLISH-RELATED ELECTIVES English I (GT, Pre-AP) English II (GT, Pre-AP) English III (AP) English IV (AP, DE)) Creative Writing Library Worker Debate I, II, III, IV Theatre I, II, III, IV Journalism I, II Publications I, II, III, IV Speech I, II, III, IV SCIENCE-RELATED ELECTIVES Physical Science (GT, Pre-AP) Biology I (GT, Pre-AP) Biology II (AP) Chemistry (GT, Pre-AP) Chemistry II (AP) Physics (GT, Pre-AP) Environmental Science Basic Electricity/Electronics Aerospace Science I, II, III, IV SOCIAL STUDIES-RELATED ELECTIVES World Geography (GT) World History (GT) Civics (GT, Pre-AP) Free Enterprise (GT, Pre-AP) American History (AP) European History (AP) Macroeconomics (AP) Microeconomics (AP) Emerging China Psychology (AP) American Government (AP) SMART Program MATHEMATICS-RELATED ELECTIVES Algebra I (GT, Pre-AP) Geometry (GT, Pre-AP) Algebra II (GT, Pre-AP) Algebra III (DE) Advanced Math (GT, DE) Calculus AB (AP) Calculus BC (AP) Statistics (AP) FOREIGN LANGUAGE French I, II (DE), III (DE) Spanish I, II (DE), III (DE) Latin I, II (LVS Course) BUSINESS/VOCATIONAL Basic Technical Drafting Advanced Technical Drafting Entrepreneurship Photography Keyboarding Desktop Publishing (GT) Web Mastering (GT) Teacher Cadet (STAR) (Intro to) Business Computer Applications FINE ARTS Band I, II, III, IV Choir I, II, III, IV Orchestra (String) Fine Arts Survey Sculpting Art I, II, III, IV (AP) PHYSICAL EDUCATION Sports Medicine Physical Education I, II, III Health Education Strength and Conditioning (Baseball, Softball, Track and Field, Football) Gifted Program The school offers a full slate of gifted classes, making it the only school in the parish with the offerings to support a gifted population. Athletics The high schools sports teams, the Bolton Bears, are members of LHSAA. Bolton, previously one of the only high schools in Central Louisiana, has all of the amenities that an athletic organization needs. The S.M. Brame Memorial Gym, built in 1951, is home to Bolton High School Basketball games. Before the Brame Gymnasium was constructed, the basketball games were held inside of the auditorium, which featured retractable seating. The Boy's Gym's Lobby's walls are covered with plaques designating the many athletic championships. The Girls' Gym, built in the 1960s, is home to Lady Bruins basketball games. It is also home to the Badminton Club, and it has the floor markings for high school volleyball and badminton. The Football Stadium, built in 1953, has been replaced by a new, modern stadium. It has a full 6-lane track, with a straightaway with 8 lanes. The softball field is between of Washington Drive and Masonic Drive, and the baseball team plays at Cheatham park. In 2017 it was announced that Bolton would be the first Rapides parish school to offer the sport of wrestling. The many amenities of Bolton High School allow teams in any sport to excel to championships. Publications of the school The school's publications include the Cumtux (newspaper), the Bruin (yearbook), √âcrivez (literary magazine), Studio BTV (student-run morning news channel) and its End of the Year Video, a compilation of all events that have happened over the school year. The Cumtux, published on average six times per year, has been student-run since 1912. The Cumtux is the \\"oldest high school newspaper in the south\\". The Bruin, published every year since 1925, is the annual yearbook done by the student body. It is in full color, and is a fall delivery book. The Bruin was originally published to alleviate the items in the Cumtux's Senior Issue, which reached in excess of 70 pages in 1924. √âcrivez was originally done by the Bolton Publications Staff. It has now been absorbed by the English department. It features writings and photography from the student body. Studio BTV is Bolton's news broadcast service. It takes full advantage of the Digital Academy, as it is shown through Blackboard. It ranges from 1 minute to 4 minutes in length. One extinct publication, The Cub, was a somewhat miniature version of the Bruin. Now called \\"the blue book\\" by students, it was Bolton's first handbook, complete with rules, regulations, specifications for athletic letters, a pull-out map of the school, history of the school, and much more. It was published for the first time in the 192728 school year. Bolton High School principals Since 1915, Bolton has been served by nine principals: * Scott M.

It is located in the parish of Kentisbeare, near Cullompton. Orway consists of around fourteen houses and two working farms. There is a third but it no longer operates as a working farm. Orway Crescent Farm is primarily chickens and horses. Orway Porch farm, specialising in crops (largely potatoes) and cows (Friesians), is adjacent. A stream runs through Orway Farm, past Orway Porch Farm and out through Kentisbeare. The source of the stream is very close to Forest Glade. The few children who live in Orway attend, mainly, Kentisbeare Primary School and Uffculme School. Due to the location of Uffculme School, the children are collected and returned home via bus. Orway is approximately 5.5 kilometres from Cullompton and about 10 kilometres from Honiton (as the crow flies). Directly east of Orway, at the top of the woods is North Hill. This is the home of Devon and Somerset Gliding Club. On most summer days there will be one or two gliders in the sky above Orway. DSGC offer pilot training as well as open days for those wishing to try gliding.

Plot In Great Britain, Vigil in the Night nurse Anne Lee (Carole Lombard) takes the blame for a fatal error made by her sister Lucy (Anne Shirley), also a nurse, and is forced to leave the hospital where they both work. She moves to a large city where she procures a job at another hospital and falls in love with Dr. Robert Prescott (Brian Aherne).

Premiership season In 1938, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus one substitute player, known as the 19th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and- away season of 18 rounds; matches 12 to 18 were the \\"home-and-way reverse\\" of matches 1 to 7.

L. Mencken, the first edition in 1907. The book covers both better and lesser known areas of Friedrich Nietzsche's life and philosophy. It is notable both for its suggestion of Mencken's still-developing literary talents at the age of 27 and for its impressive detail as the first book on Nietzsche written in English (only seven years after Nietzsche's death) considering the lack of reliable interpretations of Nietzsche in the Western sphere of letters at the time; Mencken prepared for writing this book by reading all of Nietzsche's published philosophy, including several works in the original German.\\"Introduction to The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche\\", See Sharp Press, December 14, 2005.

Literary reception Following its publication, The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche quickly became a popular resource to scholars and lay audiences alike, though this is likely due to the fact that few such publications existed in English at that time. Mencken personally translated The Antichrist for use in his compendium. Despite the best available information at the time, some of the particulars of Nietzsche's life that Mencken described are now known to be false. Additionally, Mencken often ‚Äì albeit unintentionally ‚Äì permitted his personal biases (especially his own views on social Darwinism and, potentially, anti- semitism) to influence his interpretations of Nietzsche.\\"Introduction to The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche\\", See Sharp Press, December 14, 2005. Retrieved September 3, 2013. Mencken, for instance, erroneously equated Nietzsche's \\"will to power\\" with Arthur Schopenhauer's \\"will to live\\", and at times omitted explanations of Nietzsche's philosophies due to his confusing writing style. Nevertheless, some of his analyses are still considered cogent, especially regarding Nietzsche's theory of drama and views on Christianity. Due to this broad and close style of examination, and enthusiasm for such, The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche may very well be where \\"Nietzsche Studies\\" earnestly began in America.

Originally broadcast as fifty twelve-minute episodes, the serial was written and directed by Meatball Fulton. History Following on the success of The Fourth Tower of Inverness, Fulton set about working on a sequel in 1973. Fulton described the story \\"a mystery fantasy with a whiff of 'Casablanca' about it\\". It was set in Morocco where he spent a month recording ambient sounds and music for the production. Fulton stayed with the writer Paul Bowles in Tangier and learned about Moroccan magic practices from him. Fulton recorded location sound throughout Morocco, including the courtyard of Bowles' villa in Marrakech. The production also used traditional Moroccan music recorded by Bowles for the festival scenes. The recordings helped inspire his writing, Fulton told Billboard magazine. \\"It's so real, you'll even be able to smell the flowers and spice and dry earth of Morocco. Ah, yes. Escapism at its finest,\\" he said. Synopsis Jack Flanders arrives in Tangier on a search for sites that lie along \\"ley lines\\", undercurrents of mystical energy described in ancient texts. He meets Kasbah Kelly, an expatriate bar owner, and Kelly's assistant Mojo Sam and befriends one of the bar's customers, Sunny Skies. He also visits the Comtese Zazeenia, an expatriate holdover from Morocco's French colonial days and an old enemy of Kelly's. Strange events begin to occur: Jack is pursued by owls, his hotel room crumbles away as the hotel disintegrates around him and a mysterious woman named Layla Oolupi warns him to leave Morocco immediately. Refusing to heed her warning, Jack instead travels to a music festival in Marrakech with Kelly and Sunny. Caught up in a traditional dance, Jack begins to disappear into an invisible world straight out of Moroccan legend. This first night, Kelly tackles him and prevents his disappearance, but the next night, Jack succeeds in completing the transition into the land of legend. Kelly's intervention causes Jack to (seemingly) split into two rival figures in this alternate world, a usurper Emperor (Hassan Bizel) and an upstart claimant to the throne, known as the Son of El Kabah. Kelly, Mojo and Sunny search for Jack in our world, while the two Jacks confront one another after the \\"Son of el Kabah\\" completes a long journey through the Sahara desert, accompanied by Little Flossic (revisiting the \\"Little Frieda\\" role of The Fourth Tower of Inverness).

From 1925 until his death in 1937, he was a member of the Nobel Prize Committee. Jacobaeus was an important figure in regards to modern laparoscopy and thoracoscopy.

In 1911 he published an article titled √úber die M√∂glichkeit die Zystoskopie bei Untersuchung ser√∂ser H√∂hlungen anzuwenden (The Possibilities for Performing Cystoscopy in Examinations of Serous Cavities) in the journal M√ºnchner Medizinischen Wochenschrift. He also did pioneer work involving cystoscopic diagnostics of the abdomen (laparoscopy). He understood the possibilities, as well as the limitations of the procedure, and was an advocate of endoscopic training for medical personnel. He also stressed the need for specialized instruments for optimum performance during laparoscopic examinations. In 1901 Dresden physician Georg Kelling (1866‚Äì1945) performed a cystoscope-aided intervention of a dog's abdomen. Kelling also claimed to have performed two successful laparoscopic examinations on humans prior to Jacobaeus, but nonetheless failed to timely publish his experiences.

Data sharing is the practice of making data used for scholarly research available to other investigators. Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered by many to be part of the scientific method. A number of funding agencies and science journals require authors of peer-reviewed papers to share any supplemental information (raw data, statistical methods or source code) necessary to understand, develop or reproduce published research. A great deal of scientific research is not subject to data sharing requirements, and many of these policies have liberal exceptions. In the absence of any binding requirement, data sharing is at the discretion of the scientists themselves. In addition, in certain situations governments and institutions prohibit or severely limit data sharing to protect proprietary interests, national security, and subject/patient/victim confidentiality. Data sharing may also be restricted to protect institutions and scientists from use of data for political purposes. Data and methods may be requested from an author years after publication. In order to encourage data sharing and prevent the loss or corruption of data, a number of funding agencies and journals established policies on data archiving. Access to publicly archived data is a recent development in the history of science made possible by technological advances in communications and information technology. To take full advantage of modern rapid communication may require consensual agreement on the criteria underlying mutual recognition of respective contributions. Models recognized for improving the timely sharing of data for more effective response to emergent infectious disease threats include the data sharing mechanism introduced by the GISAID Initiative. Despite policies on data sharing and archiving, data withholding still happens. Authors may fail to archive data or they only archive a portion of the data. Failure to archive data alone is not data withholding. When a researcher requests additional information, an author sometimes refuses to provide it. When authors withhold data like this, they run the risk of losing the trust of the science community.\\"Publication and Openness,\\" chapter from \\"On Being A Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research\\", National Academy of Sciences. Data sharing may also indicate the sharing of personal information on a social media platform. U.S. government policies =Federal law= On August 9, 2007, President Bush signed the America COMPETES Act (or the \\"America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act\\") requiring civilian federal agencies to provide guidelines, policy and procedures, to facilitate and optimize the open exchange of data and research between agencies, the public and policymakers. See Section 1009.\\"America COMPETES Act =NIH data sharing policy= The NIH Final Statement of Sharing of Research Data says: =NSF Policy from Grant General Conditions= Office of Research Integrity Allegations of misconduct in medical research carry severe consequences. The United States Department of Health and Human Services established an office to oversee investigations of allegations of misconduct, including data withholding. The website defines the mission: Ideals in data sharing Some research organizations feel particularly strongly about data sharing. Stanford University's WaveLab has a philosophy about reproducible research and disclosing all algorithms and source code necessary to reproduce the research. In a paper titled \\"WaveLab and Reproducible Research,\\" the authors describe some of the problems they encountered in trying to reproduce their own research after a period of time. In many cases, it was so difficult they gave up the effort. These experiences are what convinced them of the importance of disclosing source code.WaveLab and Reproducible Research by Jonathan B. Buckheit and David L. Donoho The philosophy is described: :The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.WaveLab850 website The Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) and Data Conservancy are projects supported by the National Science Foundation to encourage and facilitate data sharing among research scientists and better support meta- analysis. In environmental sciences, the research community is recognizing that major scientific advances involving integration of knowledge in and across fields will require that researchers overcome not only the technological barriers to data sharing but also the historically entrenched institutional and sociological barriers. Dr. Richard J. Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging has stated, \\"the old model in which researchers jealously guarded their data is no longer applicable\\".NY Times article about value of shared data to Alzheimers research The Alliance for Taxpayer Access is a group of organizations that support open access to government sponsored research. The group has expressed a \\"Statement of Principles\\" explaining why they believe open access is important.The Alliance for Taxpayer Access website They also list a number of international public access policies.Worldwide momentum for public access to publicly funded research This is no more so than in timely communication of essential information to effectively respond to health emergencies. While public domain archives have been embraced for depositing data, mainly post formal publication, they have failed to encourage rapid data sharing during health emergencies, among them the Ebola and Zika, outbreaks. More clearly defined principles are required to recognize the interests of those generating the data while permitting free, unencumbered access to and use of the data (pre-publication) for research and practical application, such as those adopted by the GISAID Initiative to counter emergent threats from influenza.

The study found that \\"Because they were denied access to data, 28% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research.\\" =Psychology= In a 2006 study, it was observed that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period. In a follow up study published in 2015, it was found that 246 out of 394 contacted authors of papers in APA journals did not share their data upon request (62%). =Archaeology= A 2018 study reported on study of a random sample of 48 articles published during February‚ÄìMay 2017 in the Journal of Archaeological Science which found openly available raw data for 18 papers (53%), with compositional and dating data being the most frequently shared types. The same study also emailed authors of articles on experiments with stone artifacts that were published during 2009 and 2015 to request data relating to the publications. They contacted the authors of 23 articles and received 15 replies, resulting in a 70% response rate. They received five responses that included data files, giving an overall sharing rate of 20%. =Scientists in training= A study of scientists in training indicated many had already experienced data withholding. This study has given rise to the fear the future generation of scientists will not abide by the established practices. Differing approaches in different fields Requirements for data sharing are more commonly imposed by institutions, funding agencies, and publication venues in the medical and biological sciences than in the physical sciences. Requirements vary widely regarding whether data must be shared at all, with whom the data must be shared, and who must bear the expense of data sharing. Funding agencies such as the NIH and NSF tend to require greater sharing of data, but even these requirements tend to acknowledge the concerns of patient confidentiality, costs incurred in sharing data, and the legitimacy of the request. Private interests and public agencies with national security interests (defense and law enforcement) often discourage sharing of data and methods through non-disclosure agreements. Data sharing poses specific challenges in participatory monitoring initiatives, for example where forest communities collect data on local social and environmental conditions. In this case, a rights-based approach to the development of data-sharing protocols can be based on principles of free, prior and informed consent, and prioritise the protection of the rights of those who generated the data, and/or those potentially affected by data-sharing.D Sabogal. 2015.

Built in 1893 to a design by Peabody and Stearns, it is one of the few surviving great Berkshire Cottages of the late 19th century, with grounds landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. Its estate now reduced to , Wheatleigh was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It is now operated as a hotel. Description and history Wheatleigh is located in far northeastern Stockbridge, just south of the Tanglewood facility of the Boston Symphony Orchestra on the east side of West Hawthorne Road. The estate is located atop a knoll from which there are commanding views of Stockbridge Bowl to the west. The remnant portion of the estate includes only the main house and water tower of the formerly property, which also included greenhouses, a large garage with apartments above, an icehouse, barn, and three gatehouses. The house is a large 2-1/2 story masonry building, with Mediterranean Revival styling. It is organized in a U shape, with a central main block, a bedroom wing to the north, and a loggia and \\"summer house\\" to the south. It is built out of buff brick with terra cotta trim. The water tower is in height, built out brick in three octagonal stages, and was one of the tallest structures in Berkshire County when it was completed. Henry H. Cook was a New York-based businessman who made is fortune in the railroad and banking businesses. He purchased the undeveloped estate land in 1892, and oversaw construction and landscaping of the property. He named it Wheatleigh, in homage to his family's ancestral home, Wheatley, Oxfordshire. The house, designed by the Boston architectural firm of Peabody and Stearns, received notice in architectural publications, and was described by Charles McKim as one of the best examples of modern Italian Villa architecture. The property passed to Cook's daughter, Gloria de Heredia, who opened the formal gardens on the grounds for vespers church services in the summer, and was a financial backer behind the establishment of Tanglewood. The estate was sold out of the Cook family in 1946, and the house grounds were subdivided off soon afterward. The property was owned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra between 1949 and 1957. Since 1976 it has served as a hotel.

He spent much of his youth playing soccer before picking up Rugby League in 1997 at the age of 14. He moved to the Canberra Raiders. In 2010, it was revealed that Irwin was playing for Bundaberg in The Queensland competition.https://www.news- mail.com.au/news/croc-back-for-bundy-in-clash-up-north/530006/ Controversy On 18 May 2007, Irwin was with his teammate Todd Carney when Carney decided to drive in Irwin's ute, despite Carney having been disqualified from driving at the time. Police began to pursue the vehicle in a high-speed chase through the back streets of the Canberra suburb of Bruce. After turning into a dead-end street, Carney stopped the car and fled the scene on foot, leaving Irwin in the passenger seat. Irwin told police Carney was the driver. Controversially, the Raiders club sacked Irwin over the incident (who was not charged with any offenses), but retained Carney. On 24 June 2007, Irwin lashed out at the Canberra Raiders club during a stinging interview in the Sunday Mail newspaper. He blamed the Raiders for ruining his career and his reputation.

The route runs through agricultural areas, crossing the Appoquinimink River, and turns north-northeast onto Levels Road. DE 15 passes to the west of a residential neighborhood before turning northwest at a roundabout with St. Annes Church Road to remain on Levels Road and reach an intersection with DE 299. At this point, DE 15 turns northeast to join DE 299 on four-lane divided Middletown Warwick Road, entering commercial areas in the town of Middletown. At an intersection, the two routes split, with DE 15 heading northwest on Bunker Hill Road, DE 299 turning east onto West Main Street, and Middletown Warwick Road continuing north. Past DE 299, DE 15 is briefly a four-lane divided highway before it becomes a two-lane divided road, running through areas of homes and businesses and becoming undivided. The roadway passes over the US 301 toll road without an interchange before heading northeast of Appoquinimink High School. At a roundabout, the route turns north onto Choptank Road and leaves Middletown, heading through agricultural areas with some woods and residential development and coming to a roundabout with Churchtown Road. DE 15 intersects the eastern terminus of DE 286 at a roundabout and continues northeast along Bethel Church Road, ending at an intersection with DE 71/DE 896 in Summit Bridge, just south of the Summit Bridge over the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal. The section of DE 15 between DE 14 and US 13 serves as part of a secondary hurricane evacuation route from coastal areas in southern Delaware. The portion of the route along the DE 6 concurrency west of Clayton and between Alley Mill Road and Caldwell Corner Road in southwestern New Castle County is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 15 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 30,257 vehicles at the Walker Road intersection in Dover to a low of 806 vehicles at the Caldwell Corner Road intersection south of Middletown. The portions of DE 15 concurrent with US 13, between DE 8 and Scarborough Road, and along the DE 299 concurrency are part of the National Highway System. History DE 15 northbound past DE 6 in Clayton By 1920, the roads that comprise present-day DE 15 existed as county roads. Bunker Hill Road was paved by 1932, with Levels Road being constructed as a state highway by this time. Four years later, the segment between DE 12 and US 13, Brenford Road, a portion north of DE 6, and Bethel Church Road were paved, while Kenton Road was paved three years later. Paving was completed on the sections between DE 14 and Carpenter Bridge Road and from DE 8 to Kenton Road by 1942, and the entire segment between Clayton and Middletown excluding a portion of Blackbird Station Road. The remainder of the road between Milford and Canterbury, the portion between Woodside and DE 10, the portion between Wyoming and Dover, and the segment of Choptank Road between Bohemia Church Road and Bethel Church Road were all paved by 1952. The remainder of the route between Clayton and Middletown was paved two years later. By 1957, paving was completed on the remainder of Choptank Road. The section between Woodside and Wyoming was fully paved by 1959. The Mt. Friendship Road part of the current route was paved by 1964. Two years later, the paving of present-day DE 15 was completed when Alley Corner Road was paved. DE 15 was designated to run from DE 14 near Milford north to US 13 in Canterbury by 1984. The route was extended north to US 301/DE 299 west of Middletown by 1990. Four years later, DE 15 was extended farther north to US 301/DE 71/DE 896 near the Summit Bridge. In 2005, a $1.5 million construction project realigned the southern terminus of DE 15 to a four-way intersection with DE 14 and Holly Hill Road in order to improve traffic congestion and safety. In June 2007, construction began on a $11.3 million project to improve the Choptank Road portion of DE 15 by widening the travel lanes, adding shoulders, and constructing roundabouts at Bunker Hill Road, Churchtown Road, and DE 286\\\\. The project was completed on May 27, 2010. In 2011, Wyoming Mill Road was realigned to intersect Hazlettville Road further to the west at a signalized intersection, reducing congestion. This project, which cost over $1.8 million, was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. On June 5, 2017, construction began for a roundabout at the junction with DE 10 west of Camden in order to improve safety at the intersection. The roundabout was completed by September 2017.

Etymology of the town's name  Unlike other cities, the toponym \\"Mariyampil\\" has a well-defined etymology. The name derives from the Christian name Mary. Based on the folk legend (from the book \\"–ö—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ñ –≥—Ä–æ–Ω–∞ –î–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞\\", Kul'turni groda Dnistra), during the time of the Tatar raids, the Polish leader (wojewoda), Kaietan was fleeing the Tatars on his horse. Having crossed the Dnister, this horse could not jump onto the bank. Despairing of being caught by the Tatars, Kaietan yelled \\"Jesus-Maryja\\" and the horse carried him to dry land. In thanks giving to God, Kaietan founded on the either bank of the river, the cities of Jesupol, in honour of Jesus and Marijampol, in honour of Mary, the Mother of God. Most researchers believe that this settlement was named by the hetman of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Stanis≈Çaw Jan Jab≈Çonowski. The Polish researcher W. Urban found in the ancient documents of the parish of Marijampil that in 1691, the town of Bo≈æyj Vydok was renamed as Marijampol by Stanislaw Jablonowski. This name was chosen since this hetman brought to the town the miraculous icon of \\"Our Lady of the Knight\\" (\\"–†–∏—Ü–∞—Ä—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –ë–æ–≥–æ–º–∞—Ç–µ—Äi\\", Rytsars'koi Bohomateri) that had followed him in all his military campaigns, especially his campaign in defence of Vienna in 1683. Around 1694, the neighbouring town in honour of Jesus was named \\"Jesupil\\". In 1946, after the Western oblasts of Ukraine were reestablished as part of the Soviet Union, Marijampol was renamed Marynopil. In 2003, after a townwide referendum, the town administration decided to return to its historic name of Mariyampil (Ukrainian version of Polish name). In February 2004, this was confirmed by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Name variations include Marinopol', Marijampol, Mariyampol', Marynopil, Mar'yampol', and Mar'yampol.Carte satellite de Mar'yampol' at GeoGuide.fr  History  Mariyampil is at the same time an ancient and new settlement. It is an ancient town due to the fact that the area has been inhabited since the Palaeolithic era and through the existence of the Kingdom of Galicia. It is a new settlement since its current history only dates from 1691, when on the ruins of the pagan town of Chortopol‚Äô (Ukrainian for Devil's Town), the town, with a Christian name of Marijampol, was built. From the top of the Castle Hill (Zamkova hora), it is possible to see the Dnister valley (Dniester Canyon). The view from the hill breathes of its history about the kings and their (boyars), about the Tatar and their raids, about the religious growth and years of neglect. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first town was built during the times of Ruthenian Kingdom of the 12th to 13th century. It was founded on the high bend on the Dnister river and, thus, the town was well fortified. It has been suggested that the town was called Chortopil. Based on the folklore tale recorded by I. Drabƒçuk, the castle was built by either king Danylo of Halych or one of his sons in the 13th as a defensive outpost. According to further legends, since the 13th, in the courtyard of the castle, a deep, 207 ft (63 m) well was built by Tatar captives. This well was forgotten and covered in the 20th century. Unfortunately, historical information about these times is scarce. Obviously, the mysterious Chortopil managed to exist into the 15th century, whereupon it was ruined during one of the Tatar raids. About half a mile away (500‚Äì900 m) from this place along the Dnister, near a Tatar encampment, in the 15th century, the town of Delijiv ‚Äì Vovchkiv was built. The first historical mention of this settlement can be found in 1404, when the lord of Vovchkiv, a \\"dibr Vovce\\" Dobeslav out of Delijiv had to send seven of his subjects to the court in Halych. For the existence of this town from at least 1378, the judicial document, \\"Acts of the lands and towns,\\" from the middle of the 15th century. In them, a Jan with the surname of Bylinka, who was adjudicated to have the privilege of \\"Vovce,\\" given to him by the king Wladyslaw Opolczyk (1372‚Äì1380) and a document affirming this signed by the Polish king Casimir IV Jagiellon. In the 16th century, Vovchiv grew tremendously. In 1594, together with its neighboring town of Cheshybisy (today Yezupil) was burned by the Tatars. Beginning in the 1630s, this settlement belonged to the princely (szlachta) family of Theodor- Andrzej Belzecky. In 1638, he helped Vovchiv in obtaining the Magdeburg City Rights. In the 1670, the Polish king John III Sobieski granted the settlement the Magdeburg Rights. The nucleus of the city was the wooden castle called Bozhy Vydok (Heavenly View), that was built by Belezecky on one of the foothills. The second half of the 17th century was extremely difficult for Galicia: military campaigns, Tatar raids, epidemics, fires, and civil strife. In 1655, the inhabitants of Vovchkiv and neighbouring towns, raided the castle of Jesupol, destroying its gate and taking the treasure of the former szlachta. In two years time, the raids of the renegade Cossack leader Anton Sichlos ruined the towns of Jesupol and Vovchkiv-Bozhy Vydok. The worst came in 1676 when the Ottoman armies with their allies the Crimean Tatar besieged the castle and burnt the town and castle to the ground. In 1691, the Polish king gave the ruined town of Vovchkiv-Bozhy Vydok to the Krackowian, castellan, hetman Stanislaw Jan Jablonowski (1634‚Äì1702) with the privilege of building a fort on this location. It is not known who suggested that the castle be built on a hill of the bend in the river, that made this place an impregnable fort. The fort had four tall towers. There were two entrances to the castle through strong doors and a draw bridge. The walls of the fort were up to 10 ft thick and 15 ft tall. The southern and southeasterly sections of the fort were protected by a large, deep moat. At the foot of the hill, a square market place was built. The first inhabitants were the villagers from the former town of Bozhy Vydok. Later settlers from Masuria settled in Vovchkiv, which was now called Mariyampil. Due to the work of the Stanislaw Jan Jablonowski, the town not only obtained its name, but also the miraculous icon of Our Lady of Marijampil, the main religious object of this settlement. The Polish ducal dynasty of Jablonowski ruled Marijampol for almost 190 years and they saw its large growth. On the death in 1702 of Stanislaw Jan Jablonowski, his son, Jan Stanislaw Jablonowski, Ruthenian voivode, a scholar and a writer, inherited the town. Under his supervision, the wooden (Roman Catholic) church of Holy Trinity, which now housed the Icon of the Mother of God, was built. Around 1703, Marijampol had its own crest, which was used as the town seal. At first, the crest consisted of the Lamentation of Mary over the crucified body of Christ; later, the crest was an icon of the Our Lady with Christ. The field of the crest was blue with the figures in gold. Later, the family crest of the Jablonowski was added as a separate crest. In 1736‚Äì1741, the grandson of Stanislaw Jan Jablonowski, Jan Kaietan Jablonowski (1699‚Äì1764) set aside money for the construction of a stone church of the Holy Trinity. In 1742, he built in Marijampol, a Capuchin Monastery along with the (Roman Catholic) church of St. Anthony, at first out of wood and later out of stone. The stone buildings were completed by 1757. In 1753, next to the monastery, one of the many centres of higher learning in Galicia was built. At first, it solely consisted of a collegeum of classical studies, but later the study of rhetoric was added. In 1746, under the patronage of Therese of Wilgorsly, the wife of Jan Kaietan Jablonowski, a hospital for the poor and a school for princely (szlachta) orphans was built. The Sisters of Mercy of the Order of Charity were in charge of this establishment. In 1772, the Galician lands became a part of the Austrian empire. In time, Marijampol become the administrative center for the local district. For the next 150 years, a military garrison was stationed in the local castle. The town continued to expand by area and population. In 1775, there were 1,332 inhabitants and 218 buildings in Marijampol. In accordance with the decree of the Austrian king about closing small monastic establishments, the Capuchin monastery was abandoned. Later, the Austrian government gave the monastery to the Sisters of Mercy, and around the church of St. Anthony a Greek-Catholic community developed. The first mention of churches in Marijampol can be traced to the 1742 founding document of Kaietan Jablonowski to the Capuchins, which mentions that the monastery was to be built next to a \\"Ruthenian\\" (Orthodox) church. At the end of the 18th century, there were two churches in Marijampol: the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in the center of the town and the Church of St. Nicholas. In 1790, the first church was in a state of severe neglect, while the second had burned down. Thus, due to the lack of a religious place for the inhabitants, they petitioned the Austrian king to permit them to build a new church. The authorities gave the inhabitants the church of St. Anthony. The 130-year common use of this church by both the Roman Catholics and Greek- Catholics was the source of many disagreements and legal cases of both courts in Halych and Lviv. To these religious problems, even the emperor and parliament were dragged into. The authorities attempted to be even-handed when dealing with the two sides. Marijampol played an important role in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1809, a 4,000-strong, pronapoleonic, gathering of Polish partisans under the command of P. Strizewsky gathered in the local fortress. Against them an 8,000-strong Austrian army, consisting of corps under the generals Merfeld, Kesler, and Ederman, could not dislodge the army from the fortress. The Austrian artillery was called in and, in addition to the damage to the surrounding buildings, it managed to cause some damage to the fortress. At the same time, word came to the generals that Napoleon Bonaparte and Francis II had agreed to a peace treaty. Thus, the Polish army left the fortress. In order to avoid a similar repeat, the Austrian government in 1817 decreed that the walls of the fortress be torn down. In the 1820s, the Jablonowski family taking advantage of the large amount of building material that could be obtained from the ruins of the fortress, built in Marijampol a typical, contemporary palace, which has survived to today in ruins. The European Spring of Nations in 1849 touched the life of Marijampol. A large influence on the socio-political life had the family Zaklynskiy. One of the most notable members was Hnata Onufriyovych Zaklynska (1818‚Äì1866), a member of the Greek-Catholic parish of Marijampol at the end of the 1840s. Together with her husband, Joseph Katherine, they organized in the town a reading room, a choir, and a drama group. Another prominent member was Father Vasyl Motiuk (1853‚Äì1934), a Greek-Catholic pastor. For 50 years from 1884, he organized a church choir which was well known beyond the confines of the town. Motiuk was the starter of many social organizations, especially the reading club of Prosvita (Enlightenment) in 1899. Based on the plan given by the engineer Volodymyr Sichynsky, the members of the club met in a single-story building that became a meeting place for the drama group, the choir, a store, and a credit union. In the early 19th century, the town grew economically. It had always been a center for artisan materials, primarily out of wood and stone. The largest artisan shop was a shingle making shop and became well known for its shingles in the Austrian Empire and around the world. During the 1844 International Exhibition in Vienna, it demonstrated its products in public. For the further development of trade in Marijampol, Jablonowski invited Jewish merchants and built a Market Square (bazaar). In 1857, this town was settled by the followers of the Hasidic sect led by rabbi Elisar Gorovuƒç ben Meshulam Isaac Ga Levi . The Jewish community in Marijampol then experienced a huge increase in numbers. In 1898, Marijampil had 4,135 inhabitants, of which 2,020 were Roman Catholics, 1,265 Greek-Catholics, and 850 Jewish. Most of the Roman Catholic inhabitants of Marijampol were either the descendants of the Galician szlachta or the descendants of the Mazurian colonists from the former town of Vovchkiv. Until the First World War, the three communities lived in relative peace in Marijampol. However, the worldwide cataclysms of the 20th century heavily touched on the town. During the World War I, due to its location Marjapol was involved in many fights. On 2 September 1914, the town was captured by the Russian Imperial Army. Fierce fighting occurred in Marijampol from 27 February to 4 March 1914. Many inhabitants were evacuated, however, many more were killed in the fighting. A major fire destroyed many of the buildings including the palace. The Russian Army was unable to defend against the fierce Austrian counterattack and the town was retaken by the Austrian assault on 2 July 1915. The Russian Army returned for the second time in June 1916. In July 1920, the front-lines between the Bolsheviks and the forces loyal to Symon Petliura met around Marijampil. During this time, the commander of the Ukrainian Army, Chief-Otaman Symon Petliura visited Marijampol. From 3 March through 15, 1920 the town and the left bank of the Dnister river were controlled by the 1st Cavalry Army of Budyonny. At the same time, the Ukrainian and Polish communities of Marijampol were growing to become radicalized. Many youths from Marijampol joined the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen and the Ukrainian Galician Army. During the short-term government of the Western Ukrainian Republic, the Ukrainian youth took control of the town from the Poles. On 9 June 1919, during the Liturgy in the monastery church that had been shared for the last 130 years between the Roman Catholics and Greek- Catholics, 40 Polish soldiers entered the church started to destroy books, steal the valuables, and assault the parishioners. After the battles of Polish-Ukrainian War and the annexation of Galicia the Second Polish Republic under the Treaty of Riga, the Ukrainian found themselves under a brutal Polish regime. On 26 September 1924, the leaders of the Stanislawow voivodeship forced the Greek-Catholics to abandon the church by 1 January 1926. Given the hardships of post-World War I Poland, it was impossible to build a new church. Thus, the Sister Servants and the Roman Catholic parish pastor, Father Maricin Bosak emptied the church of the Greek-Catholics icons and objects. From 5 January 1926, a day before Christmas, the church was closed to Ukrainians. Soon thereafter, the wooden bell tower was destroyed as well. One of the most important figures in the interwar period in Marijampol was the Roman Catholic pastor Marcin Bosak (1889‚Äì1941), who arrived in this town in 1920, and immediately took an interest in the cultural growth of the Polish community. He not only improved their spiritual life, but also their economic status. Under his initiative, the shingle factory, the city's cultural center, the three-story school, new sewers, sidewalks, and the new Roman Catholic Church were built. Furthermore, he organized several Polish organizations. With the help of the Stanislawow (Greek-Catholic) bishop, Reverend Gregory Khomyshyn, in 1930, in Marijampol, a new Greek-Catholic Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross was built and consecrated. The Ukrainian reading hall of Prosvita was re-opened in 1927. In its halls were headquartered the Milkmen Association (Molocarska spilka), the store \\"Village Host\\" (Silskiy hospodar), Agrarian school (Khliborobska byshkil), the \\"Self-help\\" co-operative (Vlasna pomic), a patriotic organization Sokol, and other numerous organizations such as a library and a child daycare (ran by the sisters of Father Vasyl Motiuk, Stephania and Olha). From 1935, an underground station of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UIA) was headquartered in Marijampol. The most tragic years for Marijampol were in 1939‚Äì1950 and especially after the Soviet invasion in 1940. Twenty Polish and all religiously active families were deported to Siberia. On 19 December 1940, the German Gestapo roaming through the countryside of the western Ukraine before Operation Barbarossa shot 12 members of the UIA. During the night of 23/24 September, the members of UIA killed the Roman Catholic pastor Father Marcin Bosak. During the years of the German occupation, all the Jews of Marijampol were sent to a ghetto and later killed in an unknown place. The Jewish cemetery, which had its first burial in 173, was completely ruined by the Germans; with the headstones being used to pave sidewalks. Upon the return of the Soviet army, a garrison of NKVD soldiers was stationed in the Castle hill. Agents of this new government created a Polish organization that took part in the burning of the neighboring Ukrainian town of Tumyr, where a division of the UIA was based. Vovchkiv, by the end of war was the base for a division of the Polish Armia Krajowa of the Prykarpattia, which as revenge for the burning of Tumyr, was burned by the UIA during the night of 29/30 March 1944. Almost 60 people were killed in Vovchkiv. The ethnic hostilities continued and after the World War II. On Good Friday of 1947, agents of the NKVD arrested Father Honchar, who had refused to renounce the Greek Catholic Church. During the population exchange of Poles and Ukrainians in 1945‚Äì1952, most of the Poles in Marynopil were sent to Wroclaw and Opole in Poland, while the Ukrainians from the San region and the land of Lemkos in Poland replaced the evacuated Poles. In September 1949, in the Dibrova Forest near Marynopil, the UIA leader Saner was killed by the Soviet agents. As a result, a new group of families from Marynopil were sent to Siberia. After the fall of the Communist regime, Polish-Ukrainian ties in Marynopil were renewed. Each year, both communities exchange visits between Mariyampil and Wroclaw. Miraculous Icon of the Our Lady of Marijampil  Miraculous Icon of the Our Lady of Marijampil The main symbol of Marijampil, from its very first beginnings, has been the painted cloth containing an image of Our Lady. Since it was brought to this town by its founder Stanis≈Çaw Jan Jab≈Çonowski, the icon has guarded the inhabitants of Marijampil from misfortunates and fortified them against evil. Many researchers think that the beginnings of this icon date to the 16th century, and whose painter was influenced by the work of the painter Raphael Santi. Other believe that an earlier date is possible for this icon. In fact, H. H. Hoffman believes that this icon was painted by Byzantine masters. This icon was placed in the field chapel of the royal hetman Stanis≈Çaw Jan Jab≈Çonowski during his battle at Chotin (1673), Zurawny (1676), and the Siege of Vienna in 1683, as well as his countless campaigns in the Volyn, Podilia, and Bukovyna regions. It was believed by the soldiers of Jablonowski that this icon gave them victory and thus it came to be known as the \\"Hetman,\\" \\"Knightly,\\" or \\"Victorious\\" icon of Our Lady. After Jab≈Çonowski's wars, the icon was placed in his new castle in Marijampil. The image of Our Lady with the Infant Jesus was placed on the coat-of-arms of the city. The grandson of the hetman, Jan Kajetan Jablonowski, in 1721, placed the icon in the newly built wooden church of the Holy Trinity. In 1733, the icon was noted to weep, which led the inhabitants of Marijampil to build a new stone church. The icon not only attracted soldiers, but also the inhabitants, by its powers. In time, healings of the sick, cleansing of the sinned, and conversion of the pagans were attributed to the icon. The icon was declared officially miraculous in 1737. The news of this icon travelled all over Europe due to the praise given by printers, writers, and polemists. The wife of Jan Kaietan Jablonowski, Theresa from Wilgorska created for the icon a silver crown and gown. In 1752‚Äì1788, the priest Wojec Bilinsky donated silver and gems to the icon. The miraculous nature of the icon is catalogued in W. Urban's work \\"The icon of the Mother of God of Marijampil in Wroc≈Çaw\\" (Wroc≈Çaw, 1981, in Polish). In 1936, the icon was restored by the Lvivsky artist Jurii Jani≈°. During the postwar population exchange, the icon was saved by the Polish community from the hands of the atheistic communists and brought to Poland. At first the icon was placed in the church in Glubczuc, where it was restored by Marian Pacyn. At the start of the 1950s, the icon was transferred to Wroc≈Çaw to the church of the Sisters of Nazareth. In 1965, four Polish bishops, including the future Pope, but then Archbishop of Krak√≥w, John Paul II, festivally transferred the \\"Knightly Icon of Our Lady\\" to the newly built, 13-storey church on Piasek in Wroc≈Çaw. Sometime in the next 20 years, a thief stole the silver crown. A new coronation was performed on 10 September in the presence of the Primate of Poland J√≥zef Glemp. In the 1990s, a copy of the miraculous Icon of the Marijampilian Mother of God was given by the Polish Marijampilians to the Ukrainian inhabitants of Marijampil. It was placed in a side altar of the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.

The protein is a transmembrane (type I) heparan sulfate proteoglycan and is a member of the syndecan proteoglycan family. The syndecan-1 protein functions as an integral membrane protein and participates in cell proliferation, cell migration and cell-matrix interactions via its receptor for extracellular matrix proteins. Syndecan-1 is a sponge for growth factors and chemokines, with binding largely via heparan sulfate chains. The syndecans mediate cell binding, cell signaling, and cytoskeletal organization and syndecan receptors are required for internalization of the HIV-1 tat protein. Altered syndecan-1 expression has been detected in several different tumor types. Syndecan 1 can be a marker for plasma cells.  Structure  The syndecan-1 core protein consists of an extracellular domain which can be substituted with heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, a highly conserved transmembrane domain, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain, which contains two constant regions that are separated by a variable region. The extracellular domain can be cleaved (shed) from the cell surface at a juxtamembrane site, converting the membrane-bound proteoglycan into a paracrine effector molecule with roles in wound repair and invasive growth of cancer cells. An exception is the prosecretory mitogen lacritin that binds syndecan-1 only after heparanase modification. Binding utilizes an enzyme- regulated 'off-on' switch in which active epithelial heparanase (HPSE) cleaves off heparan sulfate to expose a binding site in the N-terminal region of syndecan-1's core protein. Three SDC1 elements are required. (1) The heparanase-exposed hydrophobic sequence GAGAL that promotes the alpha helicity of lacritin's C-terminal amphipathic alpha helix form and likely binds to the hydrophobic face. (2) Heparanase-cleaved heparan sulfate that is 3-O sulfated. This likely interacts with the cationic face of lacritin's C-terminal amphipathic alpha helix. (3) An N-terminal chondroitin sulfate chain that also likely binds to the cationic face. Point mutagenesis of lacritin has narrowed the ligation site. While several transcript variants may exist for this gene, the full-length natures of only two have been described to date. These two represent the major variants of this gene and encode the same protein. Inflammation  Syndecan-1 deficient mice show increased inflammation, which was attributed to an increased ICAM-1 and heparan sulfate-dependent recruitment of leukocytes (including neutrophils and dendritic cells) to the inflamed endothelium. This increase results in higher inflammatory responses and tissue damage in experimental models of contact dermatitis, inflammation of the kidney, myocardial infarction, inflammatory bowel disease and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis In experimental colitis-induced colon carcinoma, syndecan-1 deficiency promotes tumor growth in an IL-6 / STAT-signaling-dependent manner. Clinical significance Altered syndecan-1 expression has been detected in several different tumor types. In breast cancer, syndecan-1 is up regulated and contributes to the cancer stem cell phenotype, which is linked to increased resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy It is a specific antigen on multiple myeloma cells.Indatuximab Ravtansine (BT062) In Combination With Lenalidomide and Low- Dose Dexamethasone In Patients With Relapsed and/Or Refractory Multiple Myeloma: Clinical Activity In Len/Dex-Refractory Patients Indatuximab ravtansine targets this protein.

Crotalus atrox tortugensis is a venomous pit viper subspecies found only on Tortuga Island in the Gulf of California. Description This species is smaller than its close relative, C. atrox atrox, with large males not growing to much more than in length. The largest specimen on record is (Klauber, 1972). Compared to C. atrox atrox, the head is shorter relative to the length of the body‚Äîa trait considered to be an indication of dwarfing, which is common in island populations. The color pattern consists of a gray to gray-brown ground color, occasionally with a slight purplish or pinkish hue, overlaid dorsally with a series of 32-41 dark brown to purplish-brown blotches running down the length of the body. The blotches are hexagonal or diamond-shaped, marked with black spots, and bordered with irregular black mottling. Geographic range Found only on Tortuga Island, Baja California Sur, in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Its type locality is \\"Tortuga Island\\". Habitat It lives in barren, rocky, desert terrain, sparsely covered with brush and cacti. Conservation status This subspecies is classified as \\"Least Concern\\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The population trend was stable when assessed in 2007. Species are listed as \\"Least Concern\\" due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. However, this species is threatened due to its limited range, though it is common on the island. Crotalus tortugensis at San Diego Natural History Museum. Accessed 23 April 2007. Behavior Although Van Denburgh reported they would rattle vigorously when approached, they have been described as being less excitable than C. atrox atrox, their mainland relative. Feeding Its diet apparently consists of mice. Several specimens from the island are reported to have contained mammal hair, and a white-footed mouse, Peromyscus dickeyi, is common on the island. Venom Klauber (1956) gives an average venom yield of 56 mg for this species. For comparison, the same study yielded an average of 277 mg for C. atrox atrox.

Created as an independent university in 2012, it is the newest of the 12 institutions in the State University System of Florida. It is the state's only public polytechnic university, and focuses solely on STEM education. The institution originated as a branch campus of the University of South Florida, which opened in 1988. The State of Florida authorized a new campus in 2008, and renamed the school University of South Florida Polytechnic. In 2012, the Florida Legislature initiated plans to dissolve the USF branch campus and reform the Lakeland institution into an independent school. Florida Poly opened for classes on August 25, 2014 with an inaugural class of 554 students. Florida Poly resides on a 170-acre campus. The university's Innovation, Science and Technology (IST) Building, designed by architect Santiago Calatrava, is home to a 3-D printing lab, cyber gaming and media lab, cyber security lab, robotics lab, and a big data lab. In addition, Florida Poly is the first university whose campus library is completely digital. History Eastern side of the IST Building The University of South Florida opened a satellite campus in Lakeland ‚Äì University of South Florida Lakeland ‚Äì in 1988. The branch shared its grounds with the Lakeland campus of Polk Community College (now Polk State College). By the 2000s it had grown to enroll around 4,000 students, and the local business owners secured state funding for a separate campus in 2008. The same year, USF's trustees renamed the campus University of South Florida Polytechnic, reflecting a new focus on STEM education. A site near Interstate 4 was chosen for the new campus. In 2009 Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava was selected to design the campus' first building. Meanwhile, the institution's backers, most prominently Florida State Senator J. D. Alexander, initiated a campaign to break USF Polytechnic away from USF and form an independent university, Florida Polytechnic University. In 2011 Alexander proposed a 2012-13 state budget that provided $33 million for the move. Like the acquisition of the new campus, the proposed split was controversial in some quarters, as it came during a tight budget year and was unpopular with USF students and faculty.\\"JD Alexander is the face of what's wrong with Florida\\" Tampa Bay Times, March 4, 2012 In response to Alexander's proposal, the Florida Board of Governors approved a multi-year plan to allow Florida Polytechnic to gain independence gradually once it met certain criteria, including accreditation, the construction of residence halls, and the development of a STEM curriculum. Displeased with the Board's compromise, Alexander introduced a new budget for the state universities that included immediate independence from USF Polytechnic, effectively bypassing the Board of Governors. On April 20, 2012, Governor Rick Scott signed into law Alexander's budget for the State University System, including the provision that created Florida Polytechnic University as an independent institution, and closed down USF Polytechnic. The law took effect on July 1, 2012. In a letter that accompanied the signed legislation (SB 1994) creating Florida Poly, Scott noted that Florida Poly, with its strong focus on STEM programs, will be a key component of the State University System of Florida meeting the goals outlined in its 2012-2015 Strategic Plan. The strategic plan requires the State University System to increase STEM degree production from 9,605 to 22,500 per year by 2025. The university submitted its initial application for regional accreditation in December 2014. In March 2016, the Florida Poly administration announced that the university would not meet its original accreditation deadline of December 31, 2016. A budget bill sent to the office of Gov. Rick Scott would extend the school's accreditation deadline until December 2017. The university finally received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges in June 2017. The University had its inaugural commencement ceremony on Jan 3, 2017. Fourteen students graduated with the Master of Science and four students were awarded the Bachelor of Science. The commencement speaker was JD Alexander, the former State Senator known for his advocacy of a STEM university in Lakeland. The campus was thus named after him. Academics The university offers nine baccalaureate programs, two master's programs and 31 areas of concentration. Curricula and classroom facilities are designed to facilitate hands-on, applied learning, and degree programs are focused on preparing students for STEM-related careers. Four Florida Poly bachelor's degrees received ABET accreditation on August 28, 2019. The degree programs are computer engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. =Demographics= The inaugural class of students at Florida Poly had an average incoming GPA of 3.9 and test scores of 1350 on the SAT and 25 on the ACT. The average weighted high school GPA was 4.0, with average SAT and ACT scores for admitted freshman in fall 2017 at 1280 (SAT) and 28 (ACT). Industry partnerships Florida Poly collaborates with more than 100 high- tech corporate, government and non-government organizations that provide guidance on curriculum development, assist with research and offer internship opportunities that stress real-world experience. Industry partners include Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, Mosaic, Cisco and Harris Corporation. In Sept 2016, the University announced a long-term partnership with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). The FDOT will build a 400-acre technology test facility, which will include a 2.25-mile test track. Research The Florida Industrial and Phosphate Research (FIPR) Institute is a Florida Poly research institution. The FIPR institute supports phosphate-related studies to improve the environment, protect public health and increase mining and processing efficiency. FIPR Institute's staff biologists, engineers and chemists also conduct in-house research, and the institute supports some non- phosphate topics such as energy and the mining and processing of other minerals. Florida Poly's Advanced Mobility Institute (AMI) is a university- affiliated technology research center focused on the development and testing of autonomous vehicle (AV) related technology. AMI is not only unique to the state, but also one of the largest university centers specialized on the narrow area of testing and verification of AV technology in the country. Campus Florida Poly's 170-acre campus includes the Innovation, Science and Technology (IST) Building, two residence halls, Student Development Center, Wellness Center, and Admissions Center. The University Trail, which connects the University to the Lakeland campus of Polk State College is one of many biking trails connected to the campus. = Innovation, Science, and Technology (IST) Building = 240x240px The 162,000-square-foot Innovation, Science, and Technology (IST) Building is the University's main facility. It houses 26 classrooms, faculty and administrative offices, 11,000-square-foot Saddle Creek Logistics Commons, seven innovation labs‚Äìincluding a 3D printing lab, cybersecurity lab, and health informatics lab‚Äìwhere students are able to get hands-on experience with the latest technology. The building is also home to the school's digital library. Designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the building includes 94 robotic louvers on the roof that move to accommodate changing sunlight patterns. Applied Research Center The Applied Research Center (ARC) is under construction with an anticipated opening in spring 2021. The new 85,000 square foot Applied Research Center (ARC) will house research and teaching laboratories, student design spaces, conference rooms, and faculty offices. The building will also provide study areas for graduate students and a small amount of administrative space. A dedicated section of the center will assist with commercialization of innovation and applied research and send new inventions into the marketplace. Digital Library Florida Poly's IST Building includes a bookless library where students can access more than 135,000 digital titles on their choice of reader, tablet or laptop. Students still have access to librarians and a reference desk to receive tutoring, resources and training to manage digital materials. Hard copy books can be requested on loan from libraries at Florida's 11 other public universities.  Residence Halls  Florida Polytechnic University has two residence halls, starting with Residence Hall I, with Residence Hall II being built 2015. Residence Hall I consists of three- and four-bedroom suites, while Residence Hall II is mostly two-bedroom \\"semi-suites\\". The buildings themselves are owned by an outside companies, as of October 2019 the school's division of student life will manage the dorms FLPolyCon Since April 2015, Florida Polytechnic University has hosted an annual convention called FLPolyCon. According to the website for the 2018 FLPolyCon, \\"FLPolyCon is a diverse, all-inclusive geek culture celebration hosted by the students at Florida Polytechnic University.\\" Historically, the convention has catered to the self-professed \\"geek\\" culture by including aspects of video games and comics, often of the science fiction genre. More recently, FLPolyCon has been adding elements of anime and cosplay.

Since its inception it has remained one of the country's most prestigious schools. While St. Edwards is designed to be an all-male school, female students are permitted to enroll as A Level candidates. It is affiliated with St. Edward's Primary School. St. Edwards has a long list of distinguished former pupils, including many of Sierra Leone's top ranking statesmen, presidents and prime ministers. The majority of the school's pupils have gone on the attend institutions of higher learning including Fourah Bay College, Oxford University, University of Cambridge and Harvard University.  History  St. Edward's origins began with St. Edward's Primary School which was established in 1865 by a French Roman Catholic priest, Rev. Father Edward Blanchet. In 1921, the board of directors which consisted of a group of priests from Italy, France and Ireland decided to start a secondary school for the students. On February 6, 1922, the new secondary school opened its doors to seven St. Edward's Primary School graduates: Anthony Tucker, Sylvester Tucker, James Massallay, Edward Farrah, William Luke, Joseph Luke and Albert M. Margai - future prime minister of Sierra Leone. At that time, the secondary school was located at the same address as the primary school at Howe Street in Freetown. St. Edward's is the third oldest secondary school in Sierra Leone. The first head master of St. Edward's was Father Michael O'Connor, but six months after the school opened, Father O'Connor retired due to illness and was replaced by Father Mulcahy. Under the stewardship of Father Mulcahy, St. Edward's Secondary School became a first rate academic institution which followed a strict, old-fashioned British curriculum and enforced discipline by means of corporal punishment. The sports programs at St. Edward's became a source of general admiration.  Present  Today, the school continues to be managed by a board of directors and the disciplinary committee remains intact. St. Edward's has maintained its longstanding traditions, which include a Scripture Union, a Literary Society and a Debating Society. The school also has a boy scout troop known as 8th Freetown. St. Edward's is still widely held to be one of the best schools in the country. On May 1, 2000, headmaster J.P. Kamara and the school's Parent/Teacher Association started a Development Committee to facilitate the expansion of the school.  Past headmasters  Past headmasters include: *Rev. Father Michael O'Connor (1922) *Rev. Father Mulcahy (1922-1956) - the school's indefatigable and definitive founding father who devoted most of his life to St.Edward's. *Rev. Father Jeremiah O‚ÄôSullivan (1956-1979) - who introduced the co-ed sixth Form and founded the school band. *Mr. A.J. Robinson (1979) - known affectionately as 'Sir Rob'. *Rev. Father Curran *Rev. Father Hamelberg - St. Edward's alumnus and Sierra Leone's first indigenous priest and headmaster. *Mr. M.A.C. Renner. *Mr. J.P. Kamara (2000) - Commonly known as 'The great Tizo'.  House system  The house system at St. Edward's was instituted in 1934 by the school's second headmaster, Father Mulcahy, in order to encourage competitive sportsmanship among the pupils. Following the Eton model, St. Edward's employs a system which divides the pupils into five houses. Each house has a House Captain and Games Captain. House Captains are usually selected from the sixth form students. Games Captains are chosen from the school's most talented athletes from Forms 4-6. Initially there were five houses, each with its own color and each named after the most reverend fathers who founded the school. They are: O'Gorman (Red), Browne (Green), Wilson (Dark Blue), Blanchet (Light Blue), and Mulcahy (Yellow). Later a sixth house was founded and named O'Sullivan. Its color is white. There is inter-house competition during each semester culminating in an annual inter-school track- and-field championship. Houses also compete in extracurricular activities such as academic contests, debate and drama.  School prefects  Members of the student body are elected as school prefects. St. Edward's Disciplinary Committee delegates the execution of various punishments to the school's council of prefects. Prefects are also responsible for the leadership of their fellow students in sport and academics. The House Captains and Games Captains are a part of the council.  Athletics  St. Edward's is nicknamed \\"The Sports Academy\\". Throughout the school's history, athletics have been a prominent attribute of St. Edward's. The school is surrounded by sprawling fields where students can play sports and train in their respective disciplines. The land was acquired by former head master, Father Mulcahy, for the sole purpose of executing an ambitious athletics plan for the pupils. This remains a hallmark of St. Edward's even today. The school has produced a number of gifted sportsmen who play at national and international levels. Among them is football star Mohamed Kallon who began his career with the school team, Old Edwardians FC and went on to play for Inter Milan. Kallon also captained the national team, the Leone Stars.  Performing arts  St. Edward's has excellent music and drama programs. The school band was founded by Father Jeremiah O'Sullivan during the middle half of the last century. The school also has an acclaimed dramatic society called St. Edward's Theater. The school band is the most remarkable in the country‚Äôs history of school brass band music. They have won the Balanta Academy of Music Awards three times under the directorship of James Pratt, making them the only premier brass band in the country. They are regarded as the most successful school brass band after creating the first ever school jazz band section supported by the Balanta Academy of Music. The band is sometimes fondly referred to by other school band members as the Renner Brass band for the illustrious support the four sons of the late principal M.A.C Renner; namely Augustine M. Renner (alto saxophone) the current bandmaster, Jerry M. Renner (baritone) the music director, Christie J. Renner (trombone), Raymond D. Renner (trumpet) a former director and ex-member of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces Regiment Band and the last Edward A. Renner (horn); the four are all-rounder‚Äôs in music as they can play just every instrument in the brass and woodwind section of the band. Under the supervision of Rev. Fr. John Garrick, the band consists of 60 players with multi talents in choral and brass music. A few of them include Emmanuel Beal, a second lieutenant in the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces, Oluwole Compagnie-Coker, Abubakarr Barrie, Derrick Lewis, Joseph Senesi, Daniel Mettle, Abu Amadu, Christopher L.D Pratt (jr), Musa Sam Gandah, Henry Gagba, John Adowale Washington Williams, Victor Gordon, Silvanus Parkinson, Daniel Brown, Allieu Badarr, Joseph Macaulay, Michael Scott, Foday Mansaray, Timothy Bala Kamara, Mohamed Koroma and many others. The Band also has distance members in Europe and America such as Michael Kuwaite, Michael Kanyako, Theophilus Morrison, Augustine Thorpe, Dauda Sannoh, Foday Kanyako, Lyndon Pratt, Fredrick Hudor, Abdulai Turay, Elizabeth Kanja, Michael Faux, Dian Davies and lots more.  Celebrations  St. Edward's celebrates February 6 as Foundation Day and October 13 as the Feast of St. Edward in honor of the school's patron saint, Edward the Confessor.  School uniform  Students of St. Edward's are easily distinguished by their uniform which consists of a white shirt, dark shorts and a matching tie. In a country where there is no free compulsory education, attending secondary school is a rare privilege and the school uniform is a badge of honor. School song St. Edward Patron of our school And protector of our youth Guide us in our search for truth To the Holy Ghost Faithful Instill in us true leadership Model of Christian piety So may we always honor thee For all our lives to see The name Edwardian proudly stands In our country's honor roll Inspiring us to follow close Those who to great heights rose With prayers our battle we shall fight And all life's struggles win We shall be loyal to our school To our kith and kin However far in days to come Our lives may make us roam The closest friends will be those made In youth at boyhoods home Sing hail to Edward king and saint Confessor pure and chaste Enjoying now that heavenly bliss Which we soon hope to taste.  Old Edwardians  St. Edward's alumni are called Old Edwardians. While the school is open to all students regardless of their economic, social or religious background, it is a favorite of the Sierra Leonean oligarchy as it has produced an impressive number of statesmen and community leaders. Some of the most famous Old Edwardians include former Prime Minister of Sierra Leone, Sir Albert Margai and President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. The senior generation of Old Edwardians are sometimes criticized for being a British-style old boy network. However, the alumni hold that they are most concerned with supporting their alma mater and contributing to the community. Among the younger generation of Old Edwardians, re-construction of the school is a key issue. The Georgia Chapter of St. Edward's Alumni Association runs a charity that raises funds to refurbish the school which was badly damaged during Sierra Leone's decade-long civil war.

University of Queensland The University of Queensland follows the Cambridge pattern for its Academic regalia, the nuances in design in terms of its hoods and gowns are part of the Groves classification system of academic regalia. Previous to the current colour coding system, which consists of special dye lot colours described in the British Colour Codes, there was a more complex course based colour system in place for each degree.. Revisions took place during 1998 with the changes being visible in the graduating classes of 1999. With the merger of the Queensland College of Agriculture at Gatton in 1990, a series of other complications arose with the Gatton Council wearing robes unique to them. However, with the disbanding of the Gatton council circa-2005 their dress regulations have passed into university history. =Robes= The robe is based on the Cambridge design with bell sleeves and gathering at the shoulders and across the back, straight panels are at the front and are worn open with arms placed through the openings that are at the front of the sleeves for Certificates, Diploma, Bachelor and graduates up to Masters. Masters robes are more ornate with the pointed ends on the elongated sleeves being a type that is recognised as being a long sleeved robe for graduates with awards of Masters, Juris Doctorates and Professional Doctorates. A Doctor of Philosophy has in addition panels rich scarlet silk down the front, and the Higher and Honorary Doctorates is a rich bright red robe with luxurious gold lined flowing sleeves and panels down the front. =Stoles= Students graduating from either Certificate or Diploma programs are permitted to wear a stole over their gown. The stoles' color denotes the rank of the graduate. All stoles are without pleats at the neck. * Certificate - Pearl White * Diploma - Royal Blue * Associate Diploma Undergraduate - Saffron * Associate Diploma Graduate - Silver * Graduate Certificate - Ruby * Graduate Diploma - Gold All awards with graduate in its title wear the award of Bachelor hood over the stole. Special provision is made for graduates from Indigenous Australian communities (either Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander), allowing them to wear a stole representing their communities' flag. The Aboriginal stole is divided equally down the center (length-ways), with ruby on the left and black on the right and is fringed at the ends in gold. At either end of the stole an image of the Australian continent depicting the Aboriginal flag is embroidered approximately from the base. The Torres Strait islander stole is a pale blue with thick edgings in aqua colored silk and a divider bands between the edging and central section in black, with ends fringed in pearl. At either end of the stole an image of the Australian continent depicting the Torres Strait flag is embroidered approximately from the base. =Hoods= On top (of the stole, if awarded in the case of Graduate Certificates or Graduate Diplomas; otherwise, on top of the gown) is the cambridge hood type 1 in the Groves classification system, with the special dye lots colours have long been made by one historical Robe maker. The black Cambridge hood is a design classified in Groves with the design changed by the award (whether Bachelor, Masters or Doctorate). Each award has its own unique gown and hood. Bachelor's degree holders wear hoods partially lined with pearl white silk; For Masters and Juris Doctors A hood fully lined with rich blue silk; For Doctorate of Philosophy graduates, the hood is fully lined with crimson silk; And for Professional Doctorates, it is fully lined with burgundy silk. Higher doctorates and honorary doctorates are an exception, in their case the gown is made of the finest material in a special dye lot - bright red, with gold silk panels and luxurious gold lined sleeves with a bright red hood lined in a luxurious gold silk. Denoting the highest academic achievement or excellence in achievement that The University of Queensland recognises. =Headwear= All are awards up to and including the award of Masters wear a black trencher with a black tassel. Professional Doctorates, Doctorates of Philosophy and Higher Doctorates, wear a black velvet Tudor bonnet with a red silk cord tied in decorative bow with two red silk tassels hanging on the left hand side.. A distinction is the Higher Doctorate which has a rich gold tassel. Queensland University of Technology The basic robes of Queensland University of Technology (QUT) are the black Cambridge style robes that are common throughout the Queensland universities along with the black mortar board. All undergraduates at official Academic functions wear these robes. =Robes= Three styles of robes are worn at academic functions. The first type is a black Cambridge gown. It is worn by undergraduates, Associate Diploma/Degree, Diploma, Bachelors, Honors, Graduate Diploma/Certificate. The second type is a black Cambridge style master's gown. This is worn by Professional Doctorate holders, Doctors of Philosophy and members of the University Council. Differences in this case are that Professional Doctorate holder's gowns have facings in the colors of their faculty, whereas those graduating with a Doctorate of Philosophy have crimson facings. Councillors wear this gown with gold bullion and cream embossed trimming and vertical gold bullion edging. The third type is a Cambridge doctor's gown. These are scarlet in colour and are lined in the appropriate colors. Higher Doctorate holders wear this gown with gold linings and facings. Those who are Doctors of the University wear it with facings and linings in University Blue.

It is commonly referred to in Brazilian media and diplomatic jargon as Itamaraty, after the palace which houses the ministry (originally in Rio de Janeiro, and currently in a second location which also bears this name in Bras√≠lia). As of 1 January 2019 the ministry is headed by Chancellor Ernesto Ara√∫jo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs operates the Rio Branco Institute and the Alexandre de Gusm√£o Foundation. History The original Itamaraty Palace in Rio de Janeiro, former headquarters and current regional office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Brazil There were three relevant moments that defined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the institution that would later be established. The first was the signature of the 1750 Spanish‚ÄìPortuguese treaty, which re-established the borders set in the Treaty of Tordesillas. This moment was not a foreign issue policy of Brazil per se, but was instead a pursuit of interests by the Portuguese in their largest colony. There was, however, a notable Brazilian in the diplomatic corps, Alexandre de Gusm√£o, who directed the Portuguese foreign policy of trying to separate the Americas from the subject of European successions. The height of Gusm√£o's diplomatic effort was the signing of the Treaty of Madrid of 1750, in which territorial issues in South America were resolved. The second relevant historic moment was the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil in 1808 as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, when the capital of the Portuguese Empire and all its bureaucracy were transferred to Rio de Janeiro. The transfer of the Portuguese Court heavily influenced the Brazilian institutions that would later form. Finally, there was the participation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the process of recognizing Brazilian independence. This moment's relevance surpassed the creation of Brazilian diplomatic institutions and for the first time tested the negotiation skills of Emperor Peter I's diplomatic corps, which achieved recognition from every world power. From that moment on and since its inception in 1822, Itamaraty has defined some of its basic principles of action such as the peaceful resolution of principles and non- intervention. With the conclusion of World War II and the creation of the United Nations in 1945 the Ministry consolidated Brazil's presence in international forums. Notable diplomats in the history of Itamaraty include the Viscount of Uruguay, the Baron of Rio Branco and Osvaldo Aranha.CARVALHO, Carlos Delgado de. Hist√≥ria Diplom√°tica do Brasil.

Site do Minist√©rio das Rela√ß√µes Exteriores: www.mre.gov.br Foreign policy The primary objective of the Brazilian foreign ministry is to increase the process of regional integration with Mercosur and other regional and financial bodies. It has also been heavily involved in the discussion of important topics on the international agenda including issues such as the protection of human rights, environmental preservation and the maintenance of peace. At the same time, it has strengthened its links with the Community of Portuguese- Speaking Countries and has structured itself in order to meet the needs and ambitions of day to day foreign policy concerns. Brazil currently maintains diplomatic relations with every U.N. member country in the world. Diplomatic missions Permanent diplomatic missions are meant to carry out representation, negotiation and information activities, as well as the protection of Brazilian interests with governments of other States and international organizations.

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1940 VFL Premiership team was Melbourne. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Jack \\"Skinny\\" Titus of Richmond with 92 goals (100 after finals). * The joint winners of the 1940 Brownlow Medal were Herbie Matthews of South Melbourne and Des Fothergill of Collingwood with 32 votes each. The rules of the award stated that there was only one medal to be awarded in any one season. A count-back revealed that each had the same number of 3, 2, and 1 votes; and, although the controversy associated with such a criterion being applied in the case of Stan Judkins in 1930 meant that it was never used again, having played the whole 18 home-and-away matches each, they could not have been separated on the basis of the number of matches played anyway. The VFL announced the tied result and neither player received a medallion, but as a consequence of its 1981 decision to change its rules relating to tied Brownlow Medal contests, the AFL awarded retrospective medals to Matthews and Fothergill in 1989. * North Melbourne took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1940. * The seconds premiership was won by .

This record stood until 1977.Australian Football League: Most Behinds * The Round 10 match between Melbourne and Geelong produced an aggregate score of 46.29 (305). It was the first VFL match ever to see an aggregate of more than 300 points scored. * The VFL suspended its round 15 matches and conducted a one-day lightning carnival, known as the Patriotic Premiership, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday 3 August 1940 to raise money for the war effort. Each match was played over a single twenty- minute period without time-on. 4.2 (26) defeated 0.2 (2) in the final. The carnival raised almost ¬£3,000 for the war effort. * The ANFC decided to cancel the 1940 Interstate Carnival, which was scheduled to have been held in Hobart, because of the war. * In one of the most rugged seasons ever, 47 players were reported to the VFL Tribunal.VFL Tribunal 1940, Boyles Football Photos. * In the last quarter of the Grand Final, Jack Titus scored a goal with his last kick, bringing his season's total to 100 goals.

As a leading member of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS), Ngom served as a minister in national unity governments from 1991 to 1992 and from 1995 to 1998. He split from the PDS to form his own party in 1998, but returned to the PDS in 2003. Under President Abdoulaye Wade, Ngom was a presidential adviser from 2003 to 2004, and from 2004 to 2012 he again served as a minister in the government, ultimately as Minister of State for the Interior from September 2010 to April 2012. Since 2012, he has served as a Deputy in the National Assembly of Senegal. Political career Ngom, a lawyer by profession, was born in Saint-Louis, Senegal. He held a variety of positions within the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) from 1975 to 1998, while it was in opposition, and for a time he was the party's second ranking figure, after Secretary-General Abdoulaye Wade. Over the years he served as the party's National Secretary for Press and Information, as Wade's spokesman for over 15 years, as National Secretary for Foreign Relations, and as Deputy Secretary-General. He was a member of the National Assembly and President of the Liberal Parliamentary Group from May 1988 to March 1991. When the PDS participated in the government from April 1991 to October 1992, Ngom served as Minister of Labor and Professional Training. From 1993 to 1995 he was again a member of the National Assembly and President of the Liberal Parliamentary Group. Following the assassination of Constitutional Council Vice-President Babacar S√®ye in May 1993, Ngom was brought in for questioning along with Wade on May 18. He and Wade were among those charged with complicity in the murder on October 1, 1993, but he was not held in custody or put on trial, enjoying parliamentary immunity.Senegal Human Rights Practices, 1993, United States Department of State. When the PDS joined the government for a second time, Ngom became Minister of Health and Social Action and served in that position from March 1995 to March 1998. The PDS leadership was rearranged on June 5, 1998, and Ngom lost his position as deputy leader of the party; he was named Permanent Secretary instead. He promptly resigned from the PDS on June 11 and announced the creation of a new party, the Senegalese Liberal Party (PLS),\\"Senegal: Opposition member forms new political party\\", Agence France- Presse, June 19, 1998. Retrieved October 27, 2007. on June 18. Wade was elected as President in 2000. Ngom was elected to the National Assembly in the April 2001 parliamentary election, winning his seat through national list proportional representation; he was the only PLS candidate to win a seat. He was also elected to the Municipal Council of Saint-Louis and the Regional Council of Saint-Louis in May 2002. The PLS merged with the PDS in May 2003, and Ngom was appointed as Presidential Adviser for International Relations, with the rank of Minister, on August 14, 2003. He was then appointed to the government as Minister of Trade on July 19, 2004, before being moved to the position of Minister of the Interior in the government named on November 2, 2004. In the government of Prime Minister Cheikh Hadjibou Soumar√©, named on June 19, 2007, Ousmane remained Minister of the Interior and was promoted to the rank of Minister of State. On March 31, 2008, he was moved to the post of Minister of State for Mines, Industry, and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises. The Sopi Coalition was defeated in the March 2009 local election in Saint- Louis. Ousmane Masseck Ndiaye, the head of the Sopi candidate list and Mayor of Saint-Louis, accused Ngom of contributing to the defeat by engaging in \\"factional activities\\". Ngom's spokesman, in turn, compared Ndiaye to a general blaming his troops for losing a battle, and he said that Ndiaye should take responsibility for the defeat by resigning from his government and party positions. Following the election, both Ngom and Ndiaye were excluded from the government of Prime Minister Souleymane Nd√©n√© Ndiaye, which was appointed on May 1, 2009. Ngom was succeeded in his ministry by Ibrahima Ciss√©. However, Wade reversed himself within days, reappointing Ngom to his post as Minister of State for Mines, Industry, and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises on May 4. On 11 September 2010, Wade moved Ngom back to the interior portfolio. In the February-March 2012 presidential election, President Wade was defeated by Macky Sall, and consequently Ngom lost his post in the government when Sall took office in April 2012. He was subsequently one of 12 PDS candidates to be elected to the National Assembly in the July 2012 parliamentary election. On 30 July 2012, he said that the PDS deputies would do well in their new role as the parliamentary opposition because they benefited from having experience of government.\\"Ousmane Ngom : \\"Nous incarnons une opposition qui a l'exp√©rience gouvernementale\\"\\" , Agence du Presse Senegalaise, July 30, 2012.

The show demonstrates all the steps the athlete must do to successfully complete the stunt. Stunt Junkies was created and executive produced by Jordan G. Stone and produced by CBS Eye Too Productions. The series lasted two seasons and 43 episodes. The first 13 episodes were hosted by Jeb Corliss. Corliss was dismissed in the summer of 2006 after being arrested for attempting to BASE jump from the observation deck of the Empire State Building in New York City. The second season and next 30 episodes were hosted by Eli Thompson, a world champion skydiver with over 15,000 skydives, including the opening aerial stunt for Austin Powers in Goldmember. Stunt Junkies shows such stunts as Bob Burnquist 50-50 a rail over the Grand Canyon and then BASE jumping to the bottom, and a man trying to backflip a Ski-Doo on a wave.

Gameplay Undertow features a 15 level campaign for single-player or co-op and two multiplayer modes for up to 16 players. Players select their race (Iron Marine, Nemoidian, Atlantean, or Elect) and unit type and are then launched into battle. Each of the four races features four unique, upgradeable unit types ranging in ability from the fast and agile to the large and powerful. Players have the ability to unlock and purchase unit upgrades as they acquire points. Each unit type has three levels of permanent upgrades. Through conquest-style battles, players obtain points by killing enemies, accomplishing team goals, and capturing check points. Points and a variety of power-ups can be used to further upgrade unit abilities. Plot Undertow is set underwater, where an aquatic alien race known as the Elect launches an attack on the polar ice caps, causing them to melt and flood the planet. Most of the human race is decimated in the destruction. The remaining humans band together to reclaim the planet back from the alien race. The Iron Marines, an elite group of underwater divers, are sent to combat the alien threat. Elsewhere Captain Nemo and his followers become enraged at the oceanic disturbances, joining the fight. With the city of Atlantis thawed by the melting of the ice caps the Atlanteans also become a threat, vowing to reclaim the planet and rule again. Marketing On April 23, 2007, Chair Entertainment announced through a company press release that Undertow was in development for Xbox Live Arcade. The news had been first reported in a \\"first look\\" preview on IGN.com and quickly became a popular news item across all other major gaming news sites. In addition to the news, the company also released a 30-second teaser trailer, which revealed the first footage of the game in action. Chair began production on Undertow in the fall of 2006 and the game was released on November 21, 2007. On January 18, 2008, Microsoft selected Undertow for its free game offer from January 23 through January 27 as compensation for the holiday traffic/outage experienced on Xbox Live. Given the game's strong focus on multiplayer, Chair welcomed the opportunity to participate in this promotion as the immediate influx of hundreds of new players greatly enhanced the competitive game play experience. A single downloadable content pack was released for the game. Titled \\"Path of the Elect\\", the pack featured a new five-mission campaign following the story of the Elect, the aquatic alien race responsible for flooding the Earth, as well as new multiplayer maps. Reception The game received numerous Editors Choice Awards from gaming publications and websites, including Official Xbox Magazine, IGN, and Team Xbox. IGN also selected Undertow as its Game of the Month for November 2007. Undertow was nominated for Microsoft's 2007 XBLA Awards and 1UP's 2007 Editors Choice Awards and was selected by Official Xbox Magazine as its 2007 Game of the Year for Xbox Live Arcade.

The game was exclusively in the Japanese language until an English translation patch was created for the Nintendo Famicom.http://www.romhacking.net/translations/2783/ Described to be the antithesis of the Dragon Quest series, the introductory story deals with life after all organisms (humans and animals) have been wiped out by a mysterious force. All of the music in this game is considered to be representative of Hiroharu Hayama's early works; he was a composer for Japanese video games during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hayama often used his music to make games feel spooky and dark. The game had a sequel, After Armageddon Gaiden, released for the Sega CD in 1994. Working Designs planned to release the game in North America as A Side Story of Armageddon in 1995, but the localization was cancelled due to the demise of the Sega CD system. Story A skeleton and a Minotaur are pondering the fate of the devastated planet. The humans, who breathed the toxin-filled air on Earth's surface, became one with the Earth and kept dissolving. The history of humanity ended and dominion of the planet returned to the demons. These mutant creatures did not depend on oxygen to survive. Therefore, they were able to breathe the air and use the land. Meanwhile, an army of robots wage World War IV against the demons in order to conquer what is now known as Makai - the Demon World. These robots came to the planet on a wave of energy that created an explosion that turned the world into a wasteland. Much later in the game, concurrent themes including Adolf Hitler, war, creating a perfect race of people, and the destruction of humanity in the year 1999 are revealed to the player inside one of the robot's main bases. Can the demons gain dominion on the humans' old planet or will robots impose a millennium of logic and dictatorial force throughout Makai? Playing as the robots is not an option open to the player. Therefore, the player must take advantage of their mutant army and crush the robot invaders. The game builds on the theme of an impending world domination through machines, as popularized famously in the Terminator series. The gameplay is similar to Final Fantasy featuring turn-based fights viewed from a third- person perspective. Gameplay Both the demon soldiers and their enemies may cast magic spells or physical attacks. Some magic attacks have the ability to inflict poison damage on any of the player's creatures. If a creature is poisoned, the player must spare some of their creature's magic points in order to cure the affected monster through the spell. Letting the creature remain poisoned for a certain amount of time will eventually lead to its death. The game plays like a role-playing video game and graves of fallen demons by the home base remind the player of the situation of the game. When a player first starts the game, they should not go to the right, as experienced monsters lie there in a stadium-shaped power station that is in the southeastern corner of the map. It will take a foursome of level 5-10 characters in order to defeat the robots inside the dome. As characters advance in level, the monster images change slightly. By the time the characters advance to levels 17 through 34 (the maximum possible levels), the monsters will look completely slimy and the fusion of the cells will get ugly. There are two groups of four monsters that the player controls; a \\"daytime\\" group and a \\"nighttime\\" group. After it becomes night in the game, the daytime group becomes inactive and the nighttime group takes over. However, there is no HP/MP replenishment when a group becomes inactive until the next morning or night phase. Although monsters can use their healing spells to cure conditions like poisoning, there is no known way to cure HP in the game other than via items spread throughout the dungeons in the game, or by using the magic spell . Version differences The Nintendo Family Computer version lacks the monster encyclopedia that exists in the other versions of the game. None of the background music in the game resembles that of the PC Engine or the FM Towns version. This was most likely because the Famicom version was not only developed by a different company, but also because four different people worked on the soundtrack. Two versions existed for the FM Towns version; a \\"large memory version\\" with normal levels of animation and the \\"small memory version\\" with slightly reduced levels of animation. The FM Towns version also comes in a series of three CD-ROMs and requires 1 megabyte of RAM (for the low memory version) and 2 megabytes of RAM (for the high memory version). Only one character can be equipped with the most powerful sword (Azotto) and this person is pre-determined by the game itself. A 3.5\\" floppy disk is needed to save the game; which had to be purchased separately from the game. In the PC Engine version, all the 3D maps are shown as flat two-dimensional dungeons. Only goblins and orcs can be equipped with swords, unlike in the other versions. Transition time between \\"daytime\\" and \\"nighttime\\" characters has been eliminated in the PC Engine version, leading to an immediate swap of characters.

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1941 VFL Premiership team was Melbourne. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Sel Murray of North Melbourne with 88 goals. * The winner of the 1941 Brownlow Medal was Norman Ware of Footscray with 23 votes. He was the only playing coach to achieve the feat. * Hawthorn took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1941. * The seconds premiership was won by . Essendon 12.16 (88) defeated 9.17 (71) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the senior Grand Final on Saturday 27 September at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Notable events * Owing to the military takeover of Corio Oval, Geelong moved its home games to Kardinia Park. *During March, the players of the Geelong Football Club went on strike and refused to train over a pay dispute. The players were seeking ¬£3 per week, but the club was offering ¬£1/10/‚Äì per week, which upset the players as they had received pay cuts in 1940 (from ¬£3 to ¬£1) when the club had made the finals and finished the year in a strong financial position. In response, the club claimed the lower offer was due to the extra expense of moving from Corio Oval to Kardinia Park, and increased payments to war funds drove the decision.\\"Strike\\" at Geelong ‚Äì Players' Reasons, The Argus, (Thursday, 13 March 1941), p.12. The majority of players acquiesced and accepted the ¬£1/10/‚Äì offer,Blake, Jim, \\"Five Geelong men for Association?\\", The Sporting Globe, (Saturday, 29 March 1941), p.1. but five senior players did not. Three of those crossed to the Victorian Football Association without a clearance ‚Äì Allan Everett going to Preston,The VFA Project: Alan Everett. Bernie Hore going to Coburg,The VFA Project: Bernie Hore. and Alan \\"Nipper\\" Marsham to WilliamstownThe VFA Project: Alan Marsham. ‚Äì while the other two, George Dougherty and Tom Arklay, having trained in the pre-season with the VFA clubs Coburg and Preston (respectively), eventually returned to play with Geelong in the 1941 season.Tom Arklay was named captain of Geelong in 1941. * In the Round 2 match between Carlton and Richmond, 11 players were injured, while highly talented Carlton rover Jack Hale, who broke his leg in an accidental collision with Richmond centreman Bernie Waldron, never played again. * The VFL postponed its Round 5 matches and conducted its second patriotic lightning carnival at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday 24 May 1941. Collingwood won the carnival, defeating Melbourne 3.2 (20) to 3.1 (19). The carnival raised ¬£1,526 for the war effort. * On 31 July 1941, Melbourne rover Ron Barassi, Sr. was killed in action at the Siege of Tobruk. He was the first VFL player to be killed in the Second World War. On 16 August 1941, a brief, moving memorial tribute to Barassi was conducted (including a bugler playing \\"The Last Post\\") at the Melbourne Cricket Club by spectators, players, trainers, and officials of Melbourne and Collingwood. * In the last minutes of the last quarter of the Second Eighteens Grand Final, played at the MCG on 27 September 1941, which Essendon, captain-coached ex-Collingwood player Harry Collier, won (beating Fitzroy 12.16 (88) to 9.17 (71)), a Fitzroy player felled an Essendon player and fights broke out all over the ground. As the final bell was sounding, a vicious bench-clearing brawl broke out involving almost every player, with many of the players felled by punches and kicks.League Seconds' Fists Fly, The Age, (Monday, 29 September 1941), p.7.Brawl Mars Second Grand Final (photograph), The Sporting Globe, (Saturday, 27 September 1941), p.3.de Lacy, H.A., \\"Football with the Lid off: Disgraceful Scenes in Seconds Final, The Sporting Globe, (Saturday, 27 September 1941), p.1.

They would hold this distinction until Round 8 of the 1954 VFL season.

A Great Britain and England international representative , he played club football in England for Widnes, Leeds, Bradford Bulls and Wigan, and in Australia for the Eastern Suburbs Roosters, Western Suburbs Magpies and the Brisbane Broncos, with whom he won the 2000 grand final. Playing career Howard played in Australia, while going over to England regularly. Howard played left-, i.e. number 11, in Widnes 24-0 victory over Leeds in the 1991‚Äì92 Regal Trophy Final during the 1991‚Äì92 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 11 January 1992. He played right-, i.e. number 10, in Widnes' 14-20 defeat by Wigan in the 1993 Challenge Cup Final during the 1992‚Äì93 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 1 May 1993, played right- in Leeds' 16-26 defeat by Wigan in the 1994 Challenge Cup Final during the 1993‚Äì94 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 30 April 1994, and played left-, i.e. number 8, in the 10-30 defeat by Wigan in the 1995 Challenge Cup Final during the 1994‚Äì95 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 29 April 1995. Also while at Leeds, in 1995 he won his first international cap for England against Wales. During his time with the Western Suburbs Magpies on the playing roster, he gained several nicknames, including Harves and Harvester, freight, but also mainly as Night Train. This was because of a song at the time which he insisted the whole team listen to a song called \\"Night Train\\". In 1997, he played for the 'Rest of the World' against Australia. While at Bradford Bulls in 1998 Howard won a cap for Great Britain against New Zealand as a substitute. After four seasons with Wests in the late 1990s, Howard could not win a place in the joint team, Wests Tigers. Wayne Bennett had no such concern, using Howard as a stop-gap and bringing him off the bench in the Broncos' 2000 NRL Grand Final win over the Sydney Roosters. After that Howard represented England in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup, also mostly from the interchange bench. He played for the Wigan Warriors in the 2001 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Bradford Bulls. Post playing Harvey returned to Australia on a permanent basis, and now works full-time for the Western Suburbs Magpies DRLFC as Development officer, in charge of the junior grades of football, as well as the Junior Magpies development teams. Howard was appointed Hull Kingston Rovers' first team coach in late 2004. Howard was dismissed shortly before the Northern Rail Cup Final, which the Hull Kingston Roverswent on to win 18-16 over Castleford Tigers, with the Hull Kingston Rovers utilising the temporary player-coaching abilities of James Webster. Permanently taking over from Howard was the former Toulouse coach, Justin Morgan.

Only one mature tree exists on Guam, while 121 mature trees have been identified on Rota since 1984.Serianthes nelsonii, poster by Agricultural Experiment Station, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Guam The tree is found in limestone forests in Rota and Guam. It has bipinnately compound leaves and brush-like flowers with long pinkish filaments. Seedpods contain one to seven smooth brown seeds.  Name  There are three local names for S. nelsonii. On Guam, it is known as hayun l√•gu, meaning \\"northern tree\\" or \\"foreign tree\\", referring to Rota, which is located north of Guam. The common name on Rota is trongkon gu√•fi, meaning \\"fire tree\\". Another name on Rota is trongkon fi'a may have originated in a region on Rota called Fia. Alternatively, \\"fi'a\\" may have derived from the Chamorro pronunciation of \\"fire\\", from \\"gu√•fi\\". The species was named \\"nelsonii\\" by E.D. Merrill in 1919 to honor Peter Nelson of the Guam Department of Agriculture, the discoverer of the plant.  Conservation  S. nelsonii was declared an endangered plant in 1987 and was assessed as critically endangered in 1998 and again in 2017. The University of Guam began a program to save the plant in 1998 with the help of numerous other agencies. S. nelsonii seedlings are being raised on protected lands for transplantation back into the wilds of Guam. On Rota, the Department of Lands and Natural Resource is monitoring the plant population and growing seedlings in a plant nursery. In 2019, the single remaining mature tree on Guam was diagnosed with heart rot, raising concerns about if it could survive the next tropical storms. A total of 18 trees exist on Guam. In June 2019, the Legislature of Guam passed a resolution to urging a halt to planned military buildup and construction until the impact to S. nelsonii could be investigated. Insufficient regeneration is blamed for the decline of the population. Possible causes include insect predation on seeds and predation on seedlings by invasive ungulates and mealybugs. The subpopulation on Rota is expected to decline as older trees die.

In 2007, the Law Review hosted a distinguished panel of legal scholars and foreign policy experts for its annual Symposium, titled \\"A Nuclear Iran: The Legal Implications of a Preemptive National Security Strategy.\\" The 59th Volume was recently cited by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Second Amendment case McDonald v. City of Chicago. In 2016, the Syracuse Law Review hosted the National Conference of Law Reviews. History The first issue of the Syracuse Law Review was in spring 1949.http://lawreview.syr.edu/about/history/ At that time, $2.00 bought a subscription to the Syracuse Law Review. The new bi-annual law journal offered leading articles and current commentary by members of the judiciary, practicing lawyers, and law teachers and students. The new law review delved into topics of interest and importance to the legal profession and recent developments discussing noteworthy recent cases. Among the 14 leading articles in Volume 1 were articles on judicial rule-making, civil investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, law and equity, and legal thinking. Authors in the inaugural volume included J. Edgar Hoover, the legendary director of the FBI, and Roscoe Pound, the noted author and dean of Harvard Law School. Over the years, scholars' articles have proposed changes and improvements to the law. To date, even the United States Supreme Court referred to this publication, citing the Review in at least 11 different court opinions. Likewise, the Syracuse Law Review has contributed to scholarship and served as a record of the events at Syracuse University College of Law and the university itself by sponsoring symposia, publishing commencement speeches, distinguished service awards, and the dedication of new buildings. One of the journal's most influential contributions to legal scholarship came in 1962 when the Syracuse Law Review inherited the honor of publishing the Annual Survey of New York Law. In his foreword, Dean Ralph E. Kharas paid tribute to the other law schools in New York state and graciously accepted the torch from the New York University Law Review which had published the Annual Survey since 1947. The Annual Survey, he wrote: \\"has made a substantial contribution to the Empire State lawyers in their task of keeping up with the law.\\".http://lawreview.syr.edu/about/history/ Over the years, the judges of the New York Court of Appeals regarded the Survey as a useful record and reflection of the nation's common law tradition. The Survey chronicled developments with statewide, national and international implications, marked the law's progression and served as an annual \\"report card\\" for New York's courts and judges. Recent Volumes As part of Volume 60, the Syracuse Law Review published a Winter 2010 Symposium book that included nine prominent authors who considered the recent United States Supreme Court decision Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., the soundness of the majority and dissenting opinions, and the implication of the decision on judicial ethics. The Symposium book featured articles written by James Sample; James Bopp and Anita Woudenberg; Andrew Frey and Jeffrey Berger; Roy Schotland; Ronald D. Rotunda; Steven Lubet; Bruce Green; and Elizabeth Wydra. The June 2016, Vol. 66, No. 3, Issue of the Syracuse Law Review was a specially organized Symposium book titled: Richard A.

The word allotype comes from two Greek roots, allo meaning 'other or differing from the norm' and typos meaning 'mark'. In immunology, allotype is an immunoglobulin variation (in addition to isotypic variation) that can be found among antibody classes and is manifested by heterogeneity of immunoglobulins present in a single vertebrate species. The structure of immunoglobulin polypeptide chain is dictated and controlled by number of genes encoded in the germ line. However, these genes, as it was discovered by serologic and chemical methods, could be highly polymorphic. This polymorphism is subsequently projected to the overall amino acid structure of antibody chains. Polymorphic epitopes can be present on immunoglobulin constant regions on both heavy and light chains, differing between individuals or ethnic groups and in some cases may pose as immunogenic determinants. Exposure of individuals to a non-self allotype might elicit an anti- allotype response and became cause of problems for example in a patient after transfusion of blood or in a pregnant woman. However, it is important to mention that not all variations in immunoglobulin amino acid sequence pose as a determinant responsible for immune response. Some of these allotypic determinants may be present at places that are not well exposed and therefore can be hardly serologically discriminated. In other cases, variation in one isotype can be compensated by the presence of this determinant on another antibody isotype in one individual. This means that divergent allotype of heavy chain of IgG antibody may be balanced by presence of this allotype on heavy chain of for example IgA antibody and therefore is called isoallotypic variant.Especially large number of polymorphisms were discovered in IgG antibody subclasses. Which were practically used in forensic medicine and in paternity testing, before replaced by modern day DNA fingerprinting.  Definition and organisation of allotypes in humans  Human allotypes nomenclature was first described in alphabetical system and further systematized in numerical system, but both could be found in the literature. For example, allotype expressed on constant region of heavy chain on IgG are designated by Gm which stands for ‚Äògenetic marker ‚Äò together with IgG subclass (IgG1 √†G1m, IgG2 √†G2m) and the allotype number or letter [ G1m1/ G1m (a) ]. Polymorphisms within IgA are denoted in the same way as A2m (eg. A2m1/2) and kappa light chains constant region polymorphisms as Km (eg. Km1). Despite the fact, that there are multiple known lambda chain isotypes, there have not been reported any lambda chain serological polymorphisms. All these before mentioned allotypes are expressed on constant regions of the immunoglobulin. Genes responsible for encoding structure of constant regions of heavy chains are closely linked and therefore inherited together as one haplotype with low number of crossovers. Although some crossovers did occur during human evolution resulting in the creation of current populations characteristic haplotypes and importance of allotype system in population studies.,  Implications for monoclonal antibody therapy  Antibody allotypes came back to spotlight due to development and use of therapies based on monoclonal antibodies. These recombinant human glycoproteins and proteins are now well established in clinical practise, but sometimes leads to adverse effects such as generation of antitherapeutic antibodies that negates therapy or even cause severe reactions to the therapy. This reaction may be attributed to differences between therapeutics itself or may arise between same therapeutics produced by different companies or even between different lots produced by the same company. To prevent production of such antitherapeutic antibodies, ideally, all clinical used proteins and glycoproteins should poses same allotype as natural patient‚Äôs product, this way the presence of ‚Äòaltered self‚Äò which poses a potential target for immune system, is limited. Whilst many parameters connected to developing and manufacturing process that might predispose monoclonal antibodies to cause immune response are well known and appropriate steps are taken to monitor and control these unwanted effects, complications linked with administration of monoclonal antibodies to genetically diverse human population are less well described. Humans exhibit abundance of genotypes and phenotypes, however all currently licenced IgG therapeutic immunoglobulins are developed as single allotypic/ polymorphic form. Patients that are homozygous for alternative phenotype are therefore at higher risk of developing potential immune response to the therapy.

Hiram Edson was a Millerite adventist, and became a Sabbath-keeping Adventist. Like all Millerites, Edson expected that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ would occur on October 22, 1844. This belief was based on an interpretation of the 2300 day prophecy which predicted that \\"the sanctuary would be cleansed\\" which Millerites took to mean that Christ would return on that day. Early life Hiram Edson, was a prosperous farmer of Ontario County, N.Y.. Edson's first wife died in 1839, leaving him to care for three children. He soon remarried in Port Gibson, New York. At the time, Edson was a steward of the Methodist church who had embraced the Millerite expectation of the Advent in the spring of 1843. His home in Port Gibson soon became a home church for the believers of the region. Involvement with the Millerites The Millerite message came to Rochester, New York, in 1843 and soon spread to Port Gibson. The message was based on the preaching of William Miller and predicted that Christ would return about the year 1843, which was later refined to October 22, 1844. This belief was based on the day-year principle and an interpretation of the 2300 days mentioned in which predicted that \\"the sanctuary would be cleansed\\". The Millerites understood this verse to point to Christ's return to \\"cleanse\\" the earth. Edson, a Methodist, heard and accepted the message at an evangelistic series. On the last day of the series, Edson was impressed to visit a dying neighbor and ask for his healing in the name of the Lord. He followed through on this thought, entering the neighbor's home late that night and laying his hands on him. It is said that the neighbor immediately threw off the blankets, got out of bed, and began praising God. Soon the whole household was doing the same. That same night Edson believed that the Lord told him to begin preaching the Advent message to his friends and neighbors. He struggled with the thought for days, finding this more difficult to do even than healing the sick. He finally acted on his belief and soon three or four hundred of his neighbors accepted the Advent message as well. The Great Disappointment Edson spent October 22, 1844 with friends waiting for the event, and was heart-broken when Jesus did not return as expected. He later wrote, :\\"Our fondest hopes and expectations were blasted, and such a spirit of weeping came over us as I never experienced before. It seemed that the loss of all earthly friends could have been no comparison. We wept, and wept, till the day dawn.\\" As the hours passed, Edson reflected on the events of the previous year. He believed he had been given the power to heal the sick, and he had seen many hundreds of friends turn to Jesus as a result of his preaching. His confidence soon returned, and he suggested that he and some friends visit some nearby Adventists (or Millerites) to encourage them. On the morning of October 23, 1844 they walked through Edson's cornfield to avoid the mocking jeers of the neighbors who had refused to believe the Advent message.The Life and Work of Hiram Edson by James Nix, Thesis. Andrews University, Berrien Springs, 1971, pp. 18-20. From Edson's Manuscript. It was in this cornfield that Edson claimed to have seen a vision. In this vision, Edson came to understand that \\"the cleansing of the sanctuary\\" meant that Jesus was moving from the Holy Place to the Most Holy Place in the heavenly sanctuary, and not to the Second Coming of Jesus to earth: :\\"We started, and while passing through a large field I was stopped about midway of the field. Heaven seemed opened to my view, and I saw distinctly and clearly that instead of our High Priest coming out of the Most Holy of the heavenly sanctuary to come to this earth on the tenth day of the seventh month, at the end of the 2300 days, He for the first time entered on that day the second apartment of that sanctuary; and that He had a work to perform in the Most Holy Place before coming to the earth.\\" Edson shared what he believed he saw with many of the local Adventists who were greatly encouraged by his account. As a result, Edson began studying the Bible with two of the other believers in the area, O. R. L. Crosier and Franklin B. Hahn, who published their findings in a paper called the Day-Dawn. This paper explored the biblical parable of the Ten Virgins, which describes a group of women waiting at a wedding for the bridegroom to arrive. The bridegroom, who was thought to symbolise Christ, was delayed, of which the men saw a parallel in their own situation. They attempted to explain why the \\"bridegroom\\" had tarried. The article also explored the concept of the day of atonement and what the authors called \\"our chronology of events\\". The findings published by Crosier, Hahn and Edson led to a new understanding about the sanctuary in heaven. Their paper explained how there was a sanctuary in heaven, that Christ, the heavenly High Priest, was to cleanse. The believers understood this cleansing to be what the 2300 days in Daniel was referring to. This distinctive Seventh-day Adventist belief is now known as the investigative judgment. Crosier's published account of Edson's vision came into the possession of James White (husband of Ellen G. White) and Joseph Bates, the latter of whom visited Edson in New York and converted him to the seventh-day Sabbath. Later life At the close of a revival in 1855, Edson was ordained as a local church elder. For many years after the \\"Great Disappointment\\" when Jesus did not come as expected, he continued as a lay preacher, working with Joseph Bates, J. N. Andrews, and J. N. Loughborough. He continued to farm in the summer to pay his expenses. In 1850 Edson sold his Port Gibson farm to help support the Sabbatarian movement, and sold a second farm two years later in Port Byron, NY so that James White could purchase a printing press in Rochester. The Sabbatarian Adventist movement was formally organized as the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1863. Edson was credentialed as a minister in 1870.

She was a teenage convert from Orthodoxy of Serbian descent from Montenegro.Lukoviƒá, Don Niko. Bla≈æena Ozana Kotorka, Kotor (1965).

She was later beatified in 1934.  Life  Osanna was born in the village of Relezi in Zeta to an Eastern Orthodox priestly family named Kosiƒá and was baptized \\"Jovana\\" in that tradition.Razzi, Serafino. \\"La vita della beata Osanna da Cattaro\\", Firenze (1592), AS XX, 39-42. (first personal biographer of Osanna) Her father was priest Pero Kosiƒá and her uncle was Marko Kosiƒá, a monk with the name of \\"Makarije\\" who later became Eastern Orthodox Bishop of Zeta. Her grandfather Aleksa Kosiƒá and her great grandfather ƒêuro Kosiƒá were also Orthodox priests. She was a shepherdess in her youth, and developed the habit of spending her solitary hours in prayer. A story says that one day while watching the flocks, she saw a child lying asleep on the grass. Attracted by its beauty, she went to pick up the baby, but it disappeared, leaving Osanna with a feeling of great loneliness. Osanna continued to witness these apparitions. When she was 14 years old, her visions began to be followed by an odd desire to travel to the coastal Venetian town of Cattaro in Albania Veneta (Bay of Kotor, modern- day Montenegro), where she felt she could pray better. Her mother did not understand, and grudgingly arranged a position for Osanna as a servant to the wealthy Catholic Bucca family, who allowed the girl as much time as she wished for church visits. In Cattaro, Osanna abandoned Eastern Orthodoxy and converted to Roman Catholicism, and took the name Katarina (Catherine Cosie). Osanna learned to read and write during her free time. She read religious books in both Latin and Italian, especially the Bible. In her late teens, Osanna felt a call to live the life of an anchoress. Though she was considered very young for such a calling, her spiritual director had her walled up in a cell built near Saint Bartholomew's church in Cattaro. It had a window through which Osanna could hear Mass, and another window to which people would occasionally come to ask for prayers or give food. Katarina made the customary promises of stability and the door was sealed. After an earthquake destroyed her first hermitage, she moved to a cell at Saint Paul's church, and became a Dominican tertiary, taking the name Osanna in memory of Blessed Osanna of Mantua. She would follow the Dominican Rule for the last 52 years of her life. A group of Dominican sisters took up residence near her, consulting her for guidance, and came to consider her their leader. Osanna soon had so many followers that a convent was founded for them. In her tiny cell, it is said that Osanna received many visions. These included the Christ as an infant, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and several saints. Once the Devil appeared to her in the form of the Blessed Virgin and told her to modify her penances. By obedience to her confessor, Osanna managed to penetrate this disguise and vanquish this enemy. A convent of sisters founded at Cattaro regarded her as their foundress because of her prayers, although she never actually saw the place. When the city was attacked on August 9, 1539 by Khair ad-Din Barbarossa, and Cattaro was threatened, the citizens of Cattaro ran to her for help. They credited their deliverance to her prayers and counsel. Again, her prayers were credited to saving them from the plague.  Veneration  The incorrupt body of Osanna was kept in the Church of St. Paul until 1807, when the French Army converted the church into a warehouse. Her body was then brought to the Church of St. Mary. The people of Kotor venerated her as a saint. In 1905, the process for her beatification began in Kotor and was successfully completed in Rome. In 1927, Pope Pius XI approved her cultus, and in 1934, she was formally beatified. Over the course of her life, the people of Kotor came to call her \\"the trumpet of the Holy Spirit\\" and the \\"teacher of mysticism.\\" People from all walks of life came to her for advice, and she interceded particularly for peace in the town and among feuding families. Therefore, she was also called \\"the Virgin Reconciler\\" and the \\"Angel of Peace.\\"  References   External links  * CatholicSaints.Info: Blessed Hosanna of Cattaro * Beata Osanna di Cattaro * Den salige Hosanna av Kotor Category:1493 births Category:1565 deaths Category:16th-century venerated Christians Category:16th-century Serbian people Category:16th-century Christian mystics Category:Dominican nuns Category:Montenegrin hermits Category:Dominican mystics Category:Montenegrin Roman Catholics Category:Serbian Roman Catholics Category:Serbian beatified people Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy Category:Former Montenegrin Orthodox Christians Category:People from Kotor Category:Serbs of Montenegro Category:Venetian period in the history of Montenegro Category:Venetian Slavs Category:16th-century Serbian women ","title":"Osanna of Cattaro"},{"id":"10807821","text":"The idiotype is based upon the variable region (labeled VL and VH in the diagram.) In immunology, an idiotype is a shared characteristic between a group of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules based upon the antigen binding specificity and therefore structure of their variable region. The variable region of antigen receptors of T cells (TCRs) and B cells (immunoglobulins) contain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) with unique amino acid sequences. They define the surface and properties of the variable region, determining the antigen specificity and therefore the idiotope of the molecule. Immunoglobulins or TCRs with a shared idiotope are the same idiotype. Antibody idiotype is determined by: *Gene rearrangement *Junctional diversity *P-nucleotides (palindromic nucleotides at sites of single-strand breaks) *N-nucleotides *Somatic hypermutations Etymology and usage The word idiotype comes from two Greek roots, idio meaning 'private, distinctive, peculiar' and typos meaning 'mark.' Thus, idiotype describes the distinctive sequence and region that makes any immunoglobulin/TCR unique from others of the same type which is its variable region. The term \\"idiotype\\" is sometimes used to describe the collection of multiple idiotopes, and therefore overall antigen binding capacity, possessed by an antibody. The word \\"idiotype\\" became influential in immunology when Niels Jerne formulated his immune network theory. Jerne was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 largely for being the father of immune network theory. He defined idiotype as the set of epitopes on the V region of an antibody molecule, where epitope means an antigenic determinant. He also defined the \\"paratope\\" to be that part of an antibody variable region that binds to an antigen. The best developed version of immune network theory is called the symmetrical network theory, in which the distinction between idiotype and paratope plays no role.

In immunology, antibodies (immunoglobulins (Ig)) are classified into several types called isotypes or classes. The variable (V) regions near the tip of the antibody can differ from molecule to molecule in countless ways, allowing it to specifically target an antigen (or more exactly, an epitope). In contrast, the constant (C) regions only occur in a few variants, which define the antibody's class. Antibodies of different classes activate distinct effector mechanisms in response to an antigen (triggering different elements of the innate immune system). They appear at different stages of an immune response, differ in structural features, and in their location around the body. Isotype expression reflects the maturation stage of a B cell. Naive B cells express IgM and IgD isotypes with unmutated variable genes, which are produced from the same initial transcript following alternative splicing. Expression of other antibody isotypes (in humans: IgG, IgA, and IgE) occurs via a process of class switching after antigen exposure. Class switching is mediated by the enzyme AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) and occurs after the B cell binds an antigen through its B cell receptor. Class-switching usually requires interaction with a T helper cell. In humans, there are five heavy chain isotypes Œ±,Œ¥,Œ≥,Œµ,Œº, corresponding to five antibody isotypes: * Œ± ‚Äì IgA, further divided into subclasses IgA1 and IgA2 * Œ¥ ‚Äì IgD * Œ≥ ‚Äì IgG, further divided into subclasses IgG1 to IgG4 * Œµ ‚Äì IgE * Œº ‚Äì IgM There are also two light chain isotypes Œ∫ and Œª; however, there is no significant difference in function between the two. Thus an antibody isotype is determined by the constant regions of the heavy chains only. IgM is first expressed as a monomer on the surface of immature B cells. Upon antigenic stimulation, IgM+ B cells secrete pentameric IgM antibody formed by five Ig monomers are linked via disulfide bonds. The pentamer also contains a polypeptide J-chain, which links two of the monomers and facilitates secretion at mucosal surfaces. The pentameric structure of IgM antibodies makes them efficient at binding antigens with repetitive epitopes (e.g. bacterial capsule, viral capsid) and activation of complement cascade. As IgM antibodies are expressed early in a B cell response, they are rarely highly mutated and have broad antigen reactivity thus providing an early response to a wide range of antigens without the need for T cell help. IgD isotypes are expressed on naive B cells as they leave bone marrow and populate secondary lymphoid organs. The levels of surface expression of IgD isotype has been associated with differences in B cell activation status but their role in serum is poorly understood. The IgG, IgE and IgA antibody isotypes are generated following class-switching during germinal centre reaction and provide different effector functions in response to specific antigens. IgG is the most abundant antibody class in the serum and it is divided into 4 subclasses based on differences in the structure of the constant region genes and the ability to trigger different effector functions. Despite the high sequence similarity (90% identical on the amino acid level), each subclass has a different half-life, a unique profile of antigen binding and distinct capacity for complement activation. IgG1 antibodies are the most abundant IgG class and dominate the responses to protein antigens. Impaired production of IgG1 is observed in some cases of immunodeficiency and is associated with recurrent infections. The IgG responses to bacterial capsular polysaccharide antigens are mediated primarily via IgG2 subclass, and deficiencies in this subclass result in susceptibility to certain bacterial species. IgG2 represents the major antibody subclass reacting to glycan antigens but IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses have also been observed in such responses, particularly in the case of protein-glycan conjugates. IgG3 is an efficient activator of pro-inflammatory responses by triggering the classical complement pathway. It has the shortest half-life compared to the other IgG subclasses and is frequently present together with IgG1 in response to protein antigens after viral infections. IgG4 is the least abundant IgG subclass in the serum and is often generated following repeated exposure to the same antigen or during persistent infections. IgA antibodies are secreted in the respiratory or the intestinal tract and act as the main mediators of mucosal immunity. They are monomeric in the serum, but appear as a dimer termed secretory IgA (sIgA) at mucosal surfaces. The secretory IgA is associated with a J-chain and another polypeptide chain called the secretory component. IgA antibodies are divided into two subclasses that differ in the size of their hinge region. IgA1 has a longer hinge region which increases its sensitivity to bacterial proteases. Therefore, this subclass dominates the serum IgA, while IgA2 is predominantly found in mucosal secretions. Complement fixation by IgA is not a major effector mechanism at the mucosal surface but IgA receptor is expressed on neutrophils which may be activated to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. sIgA has also been shown to potentiate the immune response in intestinal tissue by uptake of antigen together with the bound antibody by dendritic cells. IgE antibodies are present at lowest concentrations in peripheral blood but constitute the main antibody class in allergic responses through the engagement of mast cells, eosinophils and Langerhans cells. Responses to specific helminths are also characterised with elevated levels of IgE antibodies.

The station operates on 95.7 MHz. . The studios are located at 3824 South 18th Street in Lafayette with the tower facility located in rural eastern Warren County, IN near Greenhill, Indiana. History WYCM signed on in late 1988 as WBQR. At the time, the station broadcast from Attica featuring an eclectic mix of folk, progressive rock, and Celtic sounds. In 1994, the station was sold to Artistic Media Partners, which moved the station to the Lafayette market. Upon acquisition, WBQR flipped format to New Country as ‚ÄúBig Dog 95-7.‚Äù Calls were also changed to WGBD, reflecting the station name. The station went head-to- head against the market's long-established country leader, K105. K105's loyal listeners, however, did not embrace the new country station. After two years, the format was dropped. In 1996, Big Dog 95 began stunting with Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and Elton John‚Äôs ‚ÄúRocket Man.‚Äù A few days later, the station was relaunched as ‚ÄúModern Rock 95-7, The Rocket,‚Äù featuring an Alternative rock format with the newly syndicated, and locally popular, Bob & Tom Show anchoring mornings. Until The Rocket began broadcasting the show, Lafayette area listeners had to tune to Indianapolis‚Äô Q95, WFBQ, to listen to the show, which accounted for the station's unusually high ratings in the Lafayette market. The Rocket quickly became a very widely listened-to radio station throughout the Greater Lafayette area winning in many younger demographics throughout its run, according to Arbitron. The success of the station can be credited to two things. One, modern rock nationwide reached its peak in popularity during the period when The Rocket was an alternative rock station. Two, the Lafayette market did not have a Top 40 station in the market at the time. The Rocket, in other words, became the market default for hit music. In 2000, Radio and Records reported WGBD as the highest-rated alternative rock station in the country. As an alternative rock station, The Rocket embraced the fact that they were broadcasting to a college town by escaping from the norm of many other alternative rock stations throughout the country. WGBD played all of the alternative rock core artists heard everywhere else such as The Foo Fighters, Metallica, Nirvana, Green Day, 311, The Dave Matthews Band, etc., but also played artists heard largely on Indie rock stations such as Liz Phair, The Rentals, The Dandy Warhols, Ween, and King Missile. This made the station unique and very popular amongst the area's true alternative and mainstream alternative fans alike. During much of its existence, WSHP programming was largely automated. Steve Clark, program director, served as the afternoon disk jockey; evening, overnight, and weekend talent occasionally filled the remaining air shifts. Syndicated programming consisted of the weekend modern rock countdown show ‚ÄúOut of Order with Jed the Fish‚Äù and ‚ÄúLoveline.‚Äù The station also aired the entire radio broadcast of ‚ÄúWoodstock ‚Äô99.‚Äù In 2000, while the station was broadcasting an Alternative rock format, The Rocket was credited by Arbitron and Radio and Records magazine as the highest-rated alternative rock station in the country. In March and April 2001, The Rocket's parent company, Artistic Media Partners, made the decision to realign some of their stations in the Greater Lafayette area. Sister-station WAZY returned to its Top 40 roots on March 16 after seven years away from the format. As a result of WAZY's flip, management cited The Rocket as a direct competitor with their newly launched Top 40 format, and The Rocket's format needed to be changed. Many radio professionals at the time did not quite understand this logic and argued that the stations could have coexisted with one another and given AMP ownership over the area's younger listeners. Top 40 appeals primarily to young females while alternative rock appeals primarily to males 18-34. On March 30, The Rocket began stunting with R.E.M.'s ‚ÄúIt's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine).‚Äù On April 2 at 10a.m., the station relaunched with Classic rock. The Rocket name stayed intact, but the station earned the better-suited calls of WSHP. The first songs played on the new classic rock version of The Rocket were Queen's ‚ÄúWe Will Rock You‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe are the Champions.‚Äù Longtime program director Steve Clark also stayed through the change and former part-timer Dan Somers returned after stints in Indianapolis and Anderson/Muncie to host the afternoon show known as \\"The Dan Somers Experience\\", a take off on Poison guitarist C.C. Deville's solo band, \\"The C.C. Deville Experience\\", not an ode to Jimi Hendrix, as some thought. Dan Somers was let go due to budget cuts in February 2003 and now hosts the mid-days at crosstown rival WASK-FM. In 2004, Artistic Media Partners adopted a new initiative to move all their sports programming to better fitting formats within their Lafayette, Bloomington, and South Bend properties. This would take most sports off their female-targeted Top 40 stations and move them to their primarily male-targeted properties. WSHP was chosen to be the Purdue flagship station. As a result, Artistic Media Partners decided to swap WSHP's signal with co-owned country station WLFF in order to gain rights for being the flagship station for Purdue Men's Basketball and Football. WSHP moved to 95.3 while WLFF moved to 95.7. It was cited in the Lafayette Journal and Courier that the frequency switch to 95.3 was necessary in order for The Rocket to carry the games. 95.3's signal was more dominant through the stadium section of the Purdue campus. Women's games formerly heard on 95.3 moved with The Wolf to 95.7. The move turned out to be very successful for The Rocket. According to the fall 2004 Arbitron ratings, WSHP became the number 2 radio station 12+ in the market. However, this move was short-lived. In August 2005, just 17 months after the stations traded dial positions, they moved back to their original homes. The Rocket moved back to 95.7 and lost its Purdue flagship station status. Starting in the 2007-2008 season, Purdue sports have been divided amongst the Artistic Media Partners Lafayette stations, a move that has made it difficult for Purdue sports fans to find their team's broadcasts. WBPE (formerly WLFF) & 1410 WSHY remains the home of Purdue Women's Basketball, WAZY is the home of Purdue Football, and WSHP is the home of Purdue Men's Basketball. In 2007, Steve Clark stepped down from his role to become the programming consultant. Rob Creighton took over Steve's responsibilities as program director. Rob Creighton was fired by Artistic Media as yet another move to cut operational costs at the end of December 2010. On October 5, 2013, WSHP changed formats to country, branded as \\"Your Country 95.7\\".,http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/85302/lafayettes-rocket- crashes/ and abandoned fans of classic rock. The station's website features a splashface logo with a section thanking the listeners and having a section asking what the listeners should name the station, possibly meaning the \\"Your Country\\" branding is only temporary. However, another website linked to it possibly reveals the new branding as 95.7 The Bull, joining other nationwide country stations with the branding. On February 28, 2014, WSHP changed callsigns to WYCM. Artistic Media Partners sold its Lafayette stations to Star City Broadcasting, owner of WPBI-LD (channel 16), in 2016. The transfer to Lafayette TV, LLC was completed on January 3, 2017. On March 26, 2018, the station tweaked its branding, repositioning as \\"Y95\\" while retaining the country format. Programming While broadcasting under the slogan \\"Lafayette's Classic Rock,\\" WSHP's playlist was composed primarily of 70s and 80s songs, although select rock hits from the 60s and 90s were also included. With the exception of Rob Creighton's shift, most WSHP programming aired without disk jockeys. The syndicated Bob & Tom Show aired on WSHP for the last time on October 20, 2010 (and still airs in the Lafayette area from its home studios at WFBQ, 94.7, Indianapolis). General manager Ernie Caldemone, as quoted in an October 28, 2010 Lafayette Journal and Courier article, said, \\"Every three to five years a contract (renewal) comes up and we just decided this was not a time to be broadcasting Bob and Tom. There are people who are upset. But after we share with them the reasoning for it, they understand. It's strictly a business decision.\\" From Monday, November 1, 2010 through Saturday, December 25, 2010, WSHP switched from classic rock to an all Christmas music format, according to the Lafayette Journal and Courier. North Pole Radio programming aired around the clock until midnight on Sunday, December 26, 2010 when WSHP returned as 95-7 The Rocket, only this time with an Active Rock format. The new format would be short-lived. In mid-January 2011, the station quietly returned to the classic rock format that the station previously carried only without Bob and Tom. North Pole Radio returned to the frequency on November 18, 2011. According to an article in the Lafayette Journal & Courier newspaper, the Christmas format will run through December 31. The station returned to its previous classic rock format after the holidays. In 2014 Artistic Media Partners gave up trying to do something original and changed the format to Contemporary Country and is now competing poorly against WKOA/105.3 (Lafayette, WCDQ/106.3 (Crawfordsville) and WWKI/100.5 (Kokomo) for listeners. Local Classic Rock fans were left with no radio station in the DMA. Former listeners have turned to local Hard Rock/Metal station WKHY (Lafayette), WFBQ (Indianapolis) or WIM (Crawfordsville). WYCM is the flagship station for Purdue Men's Basketball.

The ledge has a half moon-shaped opening to allow the passage of liquids and serves as a guard to keep moustaches dry. It is generally acknowledged to have been invented in the 1860s by British potter Harvey Adams (born 1835).  Historic context  Moustaches flourished throughout the Victorian era. In fact, from 1860 to 1916, the British military actually required all of its soldiers to sport a moustache for the authority it imparted to the moustachioed man. The Victorian Moustache Cup - todayifoundout.com Often, moustache wax was applied to the moustache to keep it stiff, with every hair in place. When drinking hot liquids, steam from the drink would melt the wax, which would drip into the cup. Sipping hot tea or coffee would also often stain moustaches. Kovels - moustach cups  Invention  In 1860, Englishman Harvey Adams came up with an unusual invention, \\"the moustache cup\\". This had a ledge or shelf, called a moustache guard, across the cup. The ledge had one semicircular opening against the side of the cup. The pampered moustache then rested safe and dry on the guard while sipping a hot beverage through the opening.  Production  The new invention spread all over the European continent and soon, every famous potter was making the new cups. A multiplicity of moustache cups were made by famous manufactories such as Meissen, Royal Crown Derby, Imari, Royal Bayreuth, Limoges and others. Each potter created his own version of this masculine tableware and the news of that invention soon spread to America. A collection of cups from the tea museum at Mariage Freres, Paris Although many moustache cups were made in America, the earliest were marked with names which led buyers to believe they were actually manufactured in England. This was due to the popularity of English-made ceramics. Therefore, with the exception of the quadruple silver moustache cups made in the U.S., it is nowadays extremely difficult to find an authentic Victorian moustache cup bearing an American pottery mark.  Decline and resurge  Between 1920 and 1930, moustaches progressively began to go out of fashion and hence moustache cup production trickled down. Today though, these examples of Victorian male elegance are coveted and collected by a growing number of enthusiasts. Moustache cups are becoming highly collectible as their popularity has increased in recent years due to a resurgence of men's facial hair styles, particularly ones calling for moustache wax. My Moustache Cup - History  In popular culture  In James Joyce's Ulysses, Leopold Bloom drinks his tea from a moustache cup he received from his daughter Milly for his twenty-seventh birthday. In Episode 15 of Season 4 of The Andy Griffith Show, Aunt Bea receives one as a gift from a local Farmer, Mr. Frisby. In Margaret Mitchell‚Äôs Gone With the Wind chapter 9 Scarlett O'Hara thinks of the painted China mustache cups she made for the bazaar.

It is a comparison sort related to bubble sort, with which it shares many characteristics. It functions by comparing all odd/even indexed pairs of adjacent elements in the list and, if a pair is in the wrong order (the first is larger than the second) the elements are switched. The next step repeats this for even/odd indexed pairs (of adjacent elements). Then it alternates between odd/even and even/odd steps until the list is sorted. Sorting on processor arrays On parallel processors, with one value per processor and only local left‚Äìright neighbor connections, the processors all concurrently do a compare‚Äìexchange operation with their neighbors, alternating between odd‚Äìeven and even‚Äìodd pairings. This algorithm was originally presented, and shown to be efficient on such processors, by Habermann in 1972.N. Haberman (1972) \\"Parallel Neighbor Sort (or the Glory of the Induction Principle),\\" CMU Computer Science Report (available as Technical report AD-759 248, National Technical Information Service, US Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Rd Springfield VA 22151). The algorithm extends efficiently to the case of multiple items per processor. In the Baudet‚ÄìStevenson odd‚Äìeven merge-splitting algorithm, each processor sorts its own sublist at each step, using any efficient sort algorithm, and then performs a merge splitting, or transposition‚Äìmerge, operation with its neighbor, with neighbor pairing alternating between odd‚Äìeven and even‚Äìodd on each step. Batcher's odd‚Äìeven mergesort A related but more efficient sort algorithm is the Batcher odd‚Äìeven mergesort, using compare‚Äìexchange operations and perfect-shuffle operations. Batcher's method is efficient on parallel processors with long- range connections.  Algorithm  The single-processor algorithm, like bubblesort, is simple but not very efficient. Here a zero-based index is assumed: function oddEvenSort(list) { function swap(list, i, j) { var temp = list[i]; list[i] = list[j]; list[j] = temp; } var sorted = false; while (!sorted) { sorted = true; for (var i = 1; i < list.length - 1; i += 2) { if (list[i] > list[i + 1]) { swap(list, i, i + 1); sorted = false; } } for (var i = 0; i < list.length - 1; i += 2) { if (list[i] > list[i + 1]) { swap(list, i, i + 1); sorted = false; } } } } Proof of correctness Claim: Let a_1, ..., a_n be a sequence of data ordered by <. The odd-even sort algorithm correctly sorts this data in n passes. (A pass here is defined to be a full sequence of odd-even, or even-odd comparisons. The passes occur in order pass 1: odd-even, pass 2: even-odd, etc.) Proof: This proof is based loosely on one by Thomas Worsch. Since the sorting algorithm only involves comparison-swap operations and is oblivious (the order of comparison-swap operations does not depend on the data), by Knuth's 0‚Äì1 sorting principle, it suffices to check correctness when each a_i is either 0 or 1. Assume that there are e 1s. Observe that the rightmost 1 can be either in an even or odd position, so it might not be moved by the first odd‚Äìeven pass. But after the first odd‚Äìeven pass, the rightmost 1 will be in an even position. It follows that it will be moved to the right by all remaining passes. Since the rightmost one starts in position greater than or equal to e, it must be moved at most n - e steps. It follows that it takes at most n - e + 1 passes to move the rightmost 1 to its correct position. Now, consider the second rightmost 1. After two passes, the 1 to its right will have moved right by at least one step. It follows that, for all remaining passes, we can view the second rightmost 1 as the rightmost 1. The second rightmost 1 starts in position at least e - 1 and must be moved to position at most n - 1, so it must be moved at most (n - 1) - (e - 1) = n - e steps. After at most 2 passes, the rightmost 1 will have already moved, so the entry to the right of the second rightmost 1 will be 0. Hence, for all passes after the first two, the second rightmost 1 will move to the right. It thus takes at most n - e + 2 passes to move the second rightmost 1 to its correct position. Continuing in this manner, by induction it can be shown that the i-th rightmost 1 is moved to its correct position in at most n - e + i passes. Since i \\\\leq e, it follows that the i-th rightmost 1 is moved to its correct position in at most n - e + e = n passes. The list is thus correctly sorted in n passes. QED. We remark that each pass takes O(n) steps, so this algorithm has O(n^2) complexity.

Influence of World War II World War II had many effects on the organisation of football in Australia: *Geelong was unable to compete in the competition because of wartime travel restrictions. Temporary transfers to other clubs were available to Geelong players (limit of three per club). *Melbourne and Collingwood struggled to field a team, and at one stage considered amalgamating into a joint team, however they were both ultimately able to compete. *Hawthorn and Collingwood withdrew their teams from the reserves competition. *Available servicemen were often called upon to make up the numbers - this accounts for the drop in form of the Melbourne team, having previously won three premierships in a row. *The VFA went into recess, and any eligible players were given temporary league permits. *The Brownlow Medal was suspended until 1946. *Many ground changes were also forced upon teams, as their usual home grounds were used in the war effort. The new grounds used were Yarraville Oval (Footscray), Toorak Park (St Kilda), Punt Road Oval (Melbourne) and Princes Park (South Melbourne). *Government regulations meant the traditional matches on the King's Birthday public holiday could not be played until 1946.'Cancelling of Holidays: Mr. Curtin Defines Extent of Ban'; Sydney Morning Herald; 27 May 1942, p. 6 Premiership season In 1942, the VFL competition consisted of eleven teams of 18 on-the- field players each, plus one substitute player, known as the 19th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and-away season of 16 rounds. The determination of the 1942 season's fixtures was complicated by the fact that when the VFL decided to proceed with senior football on 1 April,'League to Play Football'; The Argus, 2 April 1942, p. 8 it was not known which grounds would be available. All 1941 grounds except Windy Hill and the Brunswick Street Oval were candidates for long-term appropriation by the military, and the VFL announced that unless three grounds were available, it would not play the season.'League Football Doubtful'; The Argus, 4 April 1942, p. 1 Consequently, each round's fixture through the first eleven weeks was set only on the previous Wednesday week, rather than being pre-determined at the start of the season. Ultimately the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Lake Oval, the Western Oval, and the Junction Oval all became unavailable; but, several Victorian Football Association grounds became available when the VFA announced on 21 April that it was going into recess, resulting in St Kilda and Footscray moving to Toorak Park and Yarraville Oval respectively,'Association Against Football ‚Äì Scratch games May Be Played'; The Argus, 21 April 1942, p. 6 and the remaining ground losses were managed by Melbourne sharing the Punt Road Oval with Richmond and South Melbourne sharing Princes Park with Carlton. During the first eleven rounds, each team played each other once and had one bye. The remaining five rounds (Rounds 12 to 16) featured the same matches as Rounds 1 to 5. This resulted in an uneven fixture in which six teams played 15 matches, and five teams played 14 matches. Teams were awarded four premiership points for each bye, so the teams with an extra bye were favoured by this draw. Once the 16 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1942 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the Page- McIntyre System. =Round 1= - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date -

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1942 VFL Premiership team was Essendon. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Lindsay White of South Melbourne with 67 goals (80 after finals); White usually played for Geelong, but transferred to South Melbourne because Geelong had withdrawn from the war-time competition. * No Brownlow Medal was awarded in 1942. * Hawthorn took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1942. * The seconds premiership was won by . St Kilda 13.10 (88) defeated 7.15 (57) in the Grand Final, played as a stand-alone match on 12 September at the Punt Road Oval. Notable events * In Round 2, Melbourne and Richmond set the record for the highest aggregate score in a game, with the teams combining for 48.25 (313). This record would stand for thirty years, eventually being broken in the 1972 Grand Final. * Melbourne was led on to the field by RAAF air ace Squadron Leader Keith \\"Bluey\\" Truscott, DFC and Bar. Truscott unfurled Melbourne's 1941 premiership flag and, very obviously lacking match condition, played an average game, kicking a single goal in his team's 79-point loss, which proved the last of his fifty career senior games). * The second half of the 1942 Grand Final was delayed as the captains Jack Dyer and Dick Reynolds, both of whom were in \\"reserved\\" occupations and, therefore, exempt from military service (Dyer was a police officer, and Reynolds a munitions worker), made speeches to the crowd in support of the wartime Austerity Loan. * On Sunday 12 July at the Punt Road Oval, a Combined Services Team, which included Percy Beames, Allan La Fontaine, Jack Mueller, Alby Pannam, and Norman Ware, played a match against a combined team of VFL players chosen by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, former Olympic swimming champion Sir Frank Beaurepaire, which included Norm Smith, Jack Dyer, and Bob Chitty. * On Saturday, 26 September, the premiers, Essendon played a patriotic match against a Combined Services Team that included former VFL stars Laurie Nash, Bob Pratt and Ron Todd (all of whom had been lost to the VFL since crossing to the Victorian Football Association before the war). Essendon won 24.18 (162) to 20.15 (135) before a crowd of 10,000 at Princes Park. * Hawthorn recorded its only win of the season over Collingwood in Round 5, the first time that the Hawks had beaten the Magpies since they joined the VFL in 1925 after 29 losses. Hawthorn were to lose nineteen in a row to the Magpies between 1944 and 1954 before its first peacetime victory in Round 4, 1955.

It is a medium-sized parrot (31 cm), which is found on the Tanimbar Islands and Babar in the southern Moluccas.  Appearance  The blue-streaked lory is about in length, including the tail. They weigh between . Adults of both sexes look the same ‚Äì this is called sexually monomorphic. Most of the bird's general plumage is bright red. Against this intense red background, there are scattered electric blue feathers near the ears and on the nape of the neck, which is where the bird gets its name. From the area to the base of the neck, there is an indigo-violet stripe. The lower part of the nape of the neck, to the top of the back, is a bluish black. The main part of the back, as well as the rump, is red. Wing coverts and flights are red with black tips. The upper part of the tail feathers are a reddish black, and the underside of the tail is a muted red. The iris of the eye is orange-red. The beak is sharply curved, short, and bright red-orange. The feet are medium gray, and the claws are black.  Social ecology  There are estimated to be between 100,000 and 500,000 blue-streaked lories in the wild. While their diet in the wild is unknown, it is thought to be similar to that of most lories and lorikeets, with pollen, nectar, fruit, and some insects making up the vast bulk of the ingesta. These lories are known as one of the louder species, and when kept in captivity, people's neighbors who desire quiet might be disturbed or annoyed by the bird's penetrating voice. The call is described as a shrill series of screeches in succession, or singular screeches. Social and gregarious, these birds travel in noisy flocks of up to ten individuals when possible. The bird's lifespan in captivity is reported to be 28‚Äì32 years. The usual clutch of eggs is 2, but in exceptional circumstances, 3 eggs may be laid. In commercial aviculture for breeding, it is very important to set up compatible pairs, to prevent harm to one member of the pair. Incubation time is 25 days, and from the time of hatching, the time to fledge is approximately 12 weeks.  Threats  Main threats to the bird in the wild are habitat degradation (logging, forest extirpation to plant palms or other monocultures) and trapping for the pet trade. The birds have a restricted and small range, but because the population is not fragmented, it is not severely threatened. Both primary, old growth forest and replacement, or secondary, forest are preferred habitats. These parrots will live in mangrove forests as well as on human managed lands such as coconut plantations.  Legal status  The IUCN lists these parrots as Near Threatened. For international trade, this parrot is listed as CITES Appendix II, which means that commercial trade must be done with special permits.  Relationship with humans  The bird is tame and playful when they have been raised by humans in captivity. Wild caught birds, being wild, are shy. The bird readily adapts to life in captivity.

The group's subtitle \\"Re.V\\" stands for Renaissance Voices. Baby Vox Re.V was revealed on December 26, 2006, and like the original group, there is one lead vocalist, three \\"sub-vocalists\\", and a singer/rapper. History =Debut= The group made its debut in January 2007 with the lead single \\"Shee\\". Around the same time, rival groups Cats and Wonder Girls also made their debuts. Compared to the other groups, however, Baby Vox Re.V has a more mature, sexual image, much like the original Baby V.O.X. For example, the group encountered some minor controversy when parts of the choreography for \\"Shee\\" was found to be too sexual. KBS has reported that member Myung Sa Rang left the group in order to continue school in Singapore and will be there for at least one year. Han Aeri has also left, in hopes for a career in acting. They were later replaced by two new members, Oh Min Jin and Park So Ri. Oh Min Jin has had prior experience in the industry, being part of the Japanese band Zenith; Park Sori is a newcomer, born in Gangneung, South Korea. The two have reportedly been brought in for their distinct looks, as Oh has a \\"sexy\\" look while Park has a cute appeal. The two new members have been training since Spring 2007, in order to prepare for the group's Asia-wide promotional tour.Kbs World The revamped Baby VOX Re.V made their debut in a Thailand showcase. Since then, the group has performed in many events such as the Korea-China Song Festival, SBS Super Concert and KBS' New Year's Live Broadcast. They also had a concert during a promotional trip in Cambodia. Baby Vox Re.V visited and performed in Mongolia in May 2007.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8PqkJcujKU =Second album comeback= The second album was released on July 11, 2008, with the first single being \\"I Believe\\".

The port is operated by Guangzhou Port Group Co. Ltd which is a state owned company. The company was established on February 26, 2004 from the former Guangzhou Harbor Bureau. It was approved by the Guangzhou Municipal Government. It is currently the largest comprehensive port in South China. Its international maritime trade reaches over 300 ports in more than 80 countries and districts worldwide.Guangzhou International-the Official Website of Guangzhou Municipality The port also incorporates the former Huangpu Port.Guangzhou Huangpu Port Dock www.lifeofguangzhou.comGuangzhou Port www.asiatradehub.com The port also serves as the important economic and transport center for the Pearl River Delta region and Guangdong province. It is also vital transport hub for industries located in neighboring provinces such as Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi. History Guangzhou was an important port during the ancient times as far back as the Qin Dynasty. It served as a trading port as the \\"Silk Road on the Sea\\". The port became one of China's busiest ports during the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty. Geography Guangzhou Port is situated at the intersection of the three most important rivers of Dongjiang, Xijiang and Beijiang in South China. All the three rivers have the waterway, railway, expressway and air lines intersecting here, thus forming a critical transportation hub. It is the main port of focus in the Pearl River Delta Region. The port's harbor area extends along the Pearl River coast and water areas in the cities of Guangzhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Shenzhen and Zhuhai. The port being situated beyond the entrance of Pearl River opening serve as a gateway for shipping activity for other Harbor area such as Nansha Harbor Area, Xinsha Harbor Area, Huangpu Harbor Area and Inner Harbor Area, and Nansha Harbor Area near Hong Kong. Port infrastructure Guangzhou Port comprises 4600 berths, 133 buoys and 2359 anchorages each of 1,000 tonnage class and the largest capacity is 3,000 tons. The government has approved of the dredging of the port to allow 100 000 tonnes vessels to enter Nansha at high tide in July 2009. The port is currently dredging to allow 100 000 tonnes vessels to enter Nansha terminal in low tide. Port activities The Port of Guangzhou plays a very important role in the economy. The port handles a range of activities which include loading and discharging, storage, bonded warehousing, container cargo services. Many agricultural, industrial and manufactured products are shipped through the port which include oil, coal, grain, chemical fertilizer, steel, ore and automobiles.ÂπøÂ∑ûÊ∏ØÈõÜÂõ¢ The port also provides passenger services as well as logistics services. It also played a major role in contributing to the success of the missionary hospital, the Canton Hospital. Shipping As the biggest comprehensive hub port in South China, Port of Guangzhou is experiencing an increase in cargo volume and ships calling in. This is due to the buoyant economic activity in Guangzhou and the surrounding hinterland.Guangzhou Port Launches Container Rail Service to Changsha In 1999, Port of Guangzhou surpassed its annual cargo throughput of 100 million tons. It is the second port in Mainland China to ranked with such record volume. As a result, the annual cargo volume continues to grow. In 2006, the whole Guangzhou Port surpassed 300 million tons (ranking the third in China's coastal ports and the fifth among the world top ten ports) and 665 million TEUs, and Guangzhou Port reached 201 million tons and 4.774 million TEUs.

She was owned by the Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company. The partners in this company were Nick Clark and Russel Peden of South Fort George, who operated a sawmill there. Nick Clark also owned the lots in that townsite and was offering them up for sale. The new steamer was intended to bring prospective property buyers to Fort George and to furnish them with supplies. 1909 The Nechacco was built by Donald McPhee and was launched in Quesnel on May 25, 1909. In her first year of service she was piloted by Captain John Bonser, an experienced swift-water pilot from the Skeena and Yukon Rivers. Under his direction, the Nechacco completed several difficult and history making trips. She was the first sternwheeler to reach Fort George from Quesnel, arriving on May 30, barely nudging the Charlotte out of the honor, and the first to ever navigate through the fearsome Grand Canyon of the Fraser, 104 miles upriver from Fort George. She was also be the only sternwheeler to follow in the footsteps of the pioneer ship Enterprise and make the trip to Takla Landing on Takla Lake, as well as the first steamer to take the Nechako River all the way to Stoney Creek. The Nechacco was often chartered by pioneer surveyor Frank Swannell whose survey work took him far and wide along many of the local rivers from 1908 until 1914. Despite such a prestigious start, she was destined to have the most dramatic end of all the upper Fraser sternwheelers. 1910 John and Ida Bonser at upper left In 1910, the Nechacco had been re-registered as the Chilco and was piloted for the first part of the season by Captain Bonser and the latter part by Captain George Ritchie. Late in November, she was on her way back from Soda Creek with South Fort George's winter food supplies and had just passed the Cottonwood Canyon when she hit a reef and sank. The river was nearing freeze up and nothing could be done at that time to salvage her, so the cargo was removed and taken down to Quesnel. Upon hearing of the wreck, one of the Chilco's owners, Russell Peden, and South Fort George hotelier, Al Johnson, immediately snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne, who was then master of the BX, to make one last trip upriver with the much needed supplies. Browne consented and the supplies were delivered without incident, although ice had already begun to form along the shoreline. 1911 In March 1911, Captain Ritchie returned to the Chilco with his crew and began the salvage operations and temporary repairs that were necessary to get her back to Quesnel where she could be properly made ready for the season. In late April, Ritchie decided that the river was clear and started the trip downstream to Quesnel. Upon entering the head of the Cottonwood Canyon, he saw that the foot of the canyon was blocked solid with ice. The Chilco was rapidly speeding towards the deadly obstacle and it was too late to turn back. The captain and the crew escaped to the shore on the lifeboat and there were no injuries or loss of life. (Other reports were made in the local paper, then the Fort George Herald, that the escape was made onto the ice). Nonetheless, the end result was the same, the crew survived, but the Chilco did not. She was torn apart in the icy waters and not one piece of her was ever recovered.

There are several different types of flip flop hubs available for different applications. Their main purpose is to allow changing between two different size gear ratios on one rear wheel without the added complications of a derailleur or internal hub gear, or between a fixed and freewheeling option. By removing the rear wheel and flipping it around, the rider can switch between the two options. They are traditionally found on track bicycles, but can also be found on other single speed bicycles. Types = Fixed gear/track bicycles = Usually, one side has a fixed type stepped threading, and the other side is threaded for a standard freewheel. Occasionally you may find double-sided fixed hubs with stepped threading on both sides, but these are rare and only a few companies offer them. The fixed side has a stepped- down diameter thread to accept a lockring. The larger diameter thread on the fixed side accepts a standard threaded cog and uses the same size threads as the freewheel side of the hub. The most common standard I.S.O. thread size is 1.375\\" x 24 tpi (threads per inch), but there are other less common older sizes (British 1.371\\" x 24 TPI, French 34.7 x 1 mm, Italian 35 mm x 24 TPI). The smaller diameter thread on the fixed side has reverse/left-hand threads to accept a lockring. The lockring is reversely threaded to prevent the cog from coming loose when applying reverse/braking power to the pedals. There are also different sized threads for the left hand lockring (English/ISO 1.29\\" x 24 TPI), Campagnolo/Phil Wood (1.32\\" x 24 TPI) and Old French (33 mm x 1.0 mm). The first two are the most common, with the French threading being older, and a little less common. It is advisable to check with the manufacturer of the hub for lock ring compatibility. Wrong thread type lockrings may easily thread onto the wrong hub, but over time, the poorly-mating thread interface will cause the threads on the hub to become damaged or destroyed. This allows the installation of a cog (or freewheel) on one side of the hub, and another (cog or freewheel) on the other side of the same hub. Reversing the rear wheel allows switching between Fixed/Free drivetrain, between two different size gears, or both. Generally, the freewheel is selected to be the same size, or slightly larger (more teeth) than the fixed cog. The same size allows the same gearing, but with coasting option, while a slightly larger freewheel gear allows coasting and easier pedaling for longer or hilly rides. Both could also be freewheels for two different coasting gear selections. Any two different size cogs/freewheels can be used as long as they are within the limits of adjustability allowed by the length of the frame's dropout slots, derailleur cage, and chain length. Large differences in the number of teeth may require adding or subtracting chain links to achieve a proper fit. Also, if rear brakes are used (recommended for fixed/free, or free/free setups) brake pad reach to the rear rim may need to be adjusted. The ISO threading for freewheels (Single or Multiple Speed) is the same as for track/fixed cogs. A standard single-speed BMX style freewheel can be used on the track threads of the hub. Because of the stepped down lock ring threads, not as many threads of the freewheel engage the hub threads as they would if it were threaded to a freewheel thread, however, this is not a problem since the same number of threads is sufficient to secure a track cog. The force applied to a freewheel is the same as that applied to a fixed cog of the same size, so the missing threads cause no durability issue. Also, there is never any reverse torque on the threads with a freewheel, so a freewheel actually puts less strain on the threads than a fixed cog does. If a track hub is not available, or if a beginner wishes to try a fixed-gear bicycle without buying a new hub or rear wheel, track cogs can be installed on a standard Freewheel hub using a right hand threaded ISO English bottom bracket lockring as the lockring for the cog (the threads are exactly the same). This may work for some lighter, or delicate riders, but any repeated reverse or braking pressure on the pedals will eventually cause the cog and lockring to come loose. It is recommended that anyone using a freewheel hub with a track cog in this manner do so with caution and with both front and rear brakes mounted to the bicycle. Track cogs are generally available in a range of sizes from 12T to 23T (number of teeth) and two different widths - 3/32\\" and 1/8\\" (thickness of teeth). The 3/32\\" size is made to accommodate narrower 3/32\\" chains but is also compatible with 1/8\\" and wider BMX/single speed chains. The thicker 1/8\\" cogs are ONLY compatible with 1/8\\" or wider single speed chains. There may be larger (number of teeth) sizes available as well, either custom manufactured or adapted from chain wheels or front sprockets using a number of methods or devices. There are some heavy-duty 3/16\\" chains designed for BMX use which are compatible with most cogs. However, because these chains usually have taller thicker side plates, they may not work properly with some cogs smaller than 11T or freewheels smaller than 16T. Freewheels are available in sizes 13T to 28T and in the same two different widths as the cogs (3/32\\" and 1/8\\"). ACS makes a special \\"FAT\\" heavy duty BMX freewheel in 14T and 16T with 3/16\\" teeth compatible only with 3/16\\" chains. ACS also makes a 15T freewheel that accepts a 3/32\\" chain. = BMX/Single Speed Bicycles = There are a few different variations of flip- flop hubs for BMX bikes that are different from the track style. The most common type of BMX flip flop hub has standard ISO freewheel threads on one side and smaller metric BMX threads (30 mm x 1 mm) on the other side that are designed to work with smaller 14T to 15T BMX freewheels. In recent years a few companies have started making 13T freewheels compatible with this thread as well, allowing more gearing options. In recent years, an innovation in BMX freestyle riding spawned \\"Left Side Drive\\". This component option switches the drivetrain to the left side of the bike in order to move the sprocket and chain out of harms way for riders who prefer to do grinding tricks using the pegs or pedal on the right side of the bike. Moving the drivetrain to the left side required modification to the design of three components. #A freewheel with left hand threads which threads on and ratchets in the opposite direction for use on the left side. #A rear hub with left hand threads to accept the LH freewheel. #A left side drive crank arm. Although you could simply reverse a normal set of crank arms, the left side and right side specific pedal bosses would be reversed, causing them to tend to come loose and spin out with normal riding. Also, directional pedals would look backwards unless the pedal spindles were also reversed. Many companies now provide cranksets in which both arms are designed to be drive arms with the appropriate sprocket drive bosses. While this application to BMX is new, this is not a new idea. For decades, tandem bicycles have used left side drive cranks to drive the timing chain. Left side drive introduced a different type of flip flop hub for BMX. This hub is a Right Hand/Left Hand flip flop hub. One side of the hub allows the use of normal right hand freewheels, while the other side is threaded with left hand threads (1.375\\" x 24L tpi) and accepts the new left hand drive freewheels. The first/most common was the ACS South Paw Claw model, available in 16T. Later, a version of this hub was made with small metric BMX (30 mm x 1 mm) threads, left hand on one side and right hand on the other side. These hubs accepted either Left or right side drive freewheels in the smaller 13T-15T sizes. DK Bicycles introduced the Dual Drive hub back in the early 2000s which is a BMX Left/Right drive flip flop hub with the smaller sized metric (30 mm x 1 mm) BMX threads for 13T-15T freewheels, but also includes two threaded adapters, one left and one right, threaded inside to match the smaller metric threads and threaded on the outside with standard ISO threads. This allows the hub to use any size or combination of left and right drive freewheels available. Other companies like Wethepeople also made these dual- threaded metric hubs for a short time before cassette hubs enabled the use of much smaller rear cogs. = Drum/Disk brake Tandem Hubs = A third type of flip-flop hub is rather rare and not truly a flip flop hub by design, although it can be used in that way. This type of hub has standard ISO 1.375\\" x 24 tpi on BOTH sides, but it was not intended for two freewheels. These were designed for the use of a drum or disc hand brake on the left side, and a multi speed freewheel on the right. The drum and disc brakes designed for early tandems used standard ISO 1.375\\" x 24 freewheel threads to attach the disc or drum to the hub. These tandem hubs can easily be adapted for use as single speed flip flop hubs using any combination of two ISO English threaded freewheels.

Influence of World War II *Geelong were still unable to field a team due to the war, so the bye was retained. New System A new system was introduced so that each team received only one bye. There were still 16 rounds. The first 11 had every team competing - after round 11, the bottom placed team would drop out, and a new byeless draw would be made. Premiership season In 1942, the VFL competition consisted of eleven teams of 18 on-the-field players each (Geelong did not field a team due to wartime rail and road transport restrictions), plus one substitute player, known as the 19th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and-away season of 16 rounds. During the first 11 rounds each team played each other once and had one bye. At round 11, the eleventh team on the ladder dropped out of the competition. In the remaining rounds (12 to 16), the other ten teams played 5 matches each. During the 1943 season, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Lake Oval, and the Junction Oval were all appropriated for military use. Melbourne shared the Punt Road Oval with Richmond as their home ground, South Melbourne now shared Princes Park with Carlton as their home ground, and St. Kilda now played their home games at Toorak Park (this was possible because there was no VFA competition in 1943). Footscray, however, were able to return to the Western Oval as it was vacated by the defence authorities after a year. Once the 16 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1943 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the Page-McIntyre System. =Round 1= - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date -

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1943 VFL Premiership team was Richmond. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Fred Fanning of Melbourne with 62 goals. * No Brownlow Medal was awarded in 1943. * St Kilda took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1943. * The seconds premiership was won by for the second consecutive season. St Kilda 11.14 (80) defeated 8.6 (54) in the Grand Final, played as a stand-alone match on 18 September at Victoria Park. Notable events * Hawthorn's coach Roy Cazaly renames the club \\"The Hawks\\" from \\"The Mayblooms\\". * In the spiteful round 1 match between Essendon and South Melbourne, a vicious brawl broke out in the last quarter when South Melbourne's Jack \\"Basher\\" Williams felled Ted Leehane (apparently in a square- off retribution for Leehane's similar action against Williams in the 1942 Preliminary Final) which involved a dozen players, team officials, trainers, fans, and police. Three players were reported: Williams received an eight-week suspension for striking Leehane, Dick Reynolds, Gordon Lane, and Perc Bushby, 1940 Brownlow Medal winner Herbie Matthews was suspended for four weeks for striking Allan Hird, and Bushby was suspended for two weeks for striking Williams in retaliation. * Entering Round 11, St Kilda and South Melbourne were tenth and eleventh on the ladder with two premiership points separating them; so, the match between those two clubs in Round 11 directly decided which club was eliminated after the first set of home-and-away matches. South Melbourne won the game by 35 points. * The VFL suspended its round 12 matches and conducted a one-day lightning carnival amongst the top four teams; the Victorian Football League Patriotic Match Cup was won by Essendon. * In round 5, Denis Cordner makes his debut for Melbourne in a team that also contains his brothers Don and Ted. * Munitions worker Bob Chitty plays for Carlton in round 15 despite losing the top of his finger during the week in a workplace accident. * Richmond's centre half-forward Jack Broadstock went Absent Without Leave (AWL) from his Army duties in order to play in the 1943 Grand Final. He was arrested by the Military Police upon his arrival at Princes Park, and it was only after some very persuasive talking by Richmond captain Jack Dyer, who was himself a policeman with the Victorian Police Force, that Broadstock's commanding officer dropped the matter and allowed him to play in the match. Broadstock went on to kick a goal and be one of Richmond's best players. * For the first time, no score of four or fewer goals was kicked in a VFL season. The only seasons since without a goal tally of four or fewer have been 1969, 1973, 1982, 1983, 2005 and 2008.

Early years Catterns was born in Balmain, Sydney,Australia, World War II Military Service Records, 1939‚Äì1945 on 11 August 1917, the son of an English merchant seaman, Wilfred Catterns, and Emily (n√©e Greenwell). An uncle, Basil G. Catterns, for whom he was named, later became the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. Educated at Fort Street Boys' High School, Catterns joined the staff of the (now defunct) Sydney afternoon daily newspaper, The Sun. Second World War On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 he volunteered for military service and served with the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) in the Middle East and North Africa, including Siege of Tobruk. When the 2nd AIF was brought back to Australia in 1942, he met Nina McKnight and later married her in 1943. In September 1942, Catterns, by now a captain, was sent to New Guinea with the 2/1st Battalion where he saw action on the Kokoda Track, winning a Military Cross and being mentioned in despatches for acts of gallantry which his battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Cullen, was moved to declare \\"the bravest thing I'd ever seen a man do\\". Catterns served in New Guinea for the rest of the war, eventually attaining the rank of major. Post-war After the war Catterns pursued a career in advertising. He produced a film of the Melbourne Olympic Games; sailed the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race on six occasions; founded Offshore Yachting, the magazine of the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia; and was one of the longest-serving members of the Sydney Maritime Museum. Catterns and his wife lived in suburban Sydney where they raised three children: David, a barrister; Diana, an artist; and Angela, a well-known radio broadcaster and co-presenter of 'Film First' Sunday movie premieres on The World Movies Channel. Basil Catterns died at age 89 of undisclosed causes. Media The Catterns's story was a major thread in the documentary series Kokoda (Kokoda is produced by Pericles Films in association with Featherstone Productions, Screen Australia, Film Victoria, Veterans Affairs and ABC TV) which was originally aired on ABC1 in late April 2010.

Florida East Coast Railway Co., 410 U.S. 224 (1973), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court. Due to a chronic freight car shortage, Congress had enlarged the scope of the Interstate Commerce Commission's authority to prescribe per diem rate charges for the use of one company's freight car by another, thus giving an incentive to each company to use the cars more efficiently or to acquire more freight cars. The Commission in passing the regulation had allowed railroads 60 days to file statements of position on the matter. The Commission had said: \\"that any party requesting oral hearing shall set forth with specificity the need therefore and the evidence to be adduced.\\" Several railroads filed statements requesting oral hearings, but the Commission did not hold further hearings and overruled the requests. Two railroad companies brought an action in the Middle District of Florida to set aside the per diem rates that had been established because they had only been allowed to make written submissions during \\"hearings\\" for the proposed rule and not oral arguments. The District Court found that the Interstate Commerce Act required that the Interstate Commerce Commission act in accordance with Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 556(d), which required that parties would not be \\"prejudiced\\" by an agency's decision to receive all submissions of evidence in written form. The Supreme Court reversed the District Court's decision. Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion, explaining that Section 1(14)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act which had enlarged the Commission's authority to pass regulations \\"after hearing\\" was not a requirement that the ICC allow oral arguments in its rulemaking proceedings and that the hearing requirement had been met. The Court distinguished between administrative rulemaking and administrative adjudications.

During his twenty seasons in the National League, Crawford worked more than 3,100 games and as a home plate umpire was notable for getting in a low crouch and resting his hands on the back of the catcher in front of him. Crawford wore number 2 after the National League adopted numbers for its umpires, which was then transferred to his son Jerry Crawford, who wore it from 1976 until his 2010 retirement. Early life Crawford was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Growing up, he played baseball and football and was involved in boxing, and later played in the minor leagues as a catcher in the Philadelphia Phillies' system. Crawford married Vivian Gallagher on November 2, 1940, and they had three sons and a daughter, residing in Havertown, Pennsylvania. He served in the United States Navy during World War II, and was on the destroyer when its bridge was struck by a Japanese kamikaze on January 6, 1945 during the invasion of Luzon, in which commanding officer George Fleming Davis suffered fatal injuries and was awarded the Medal of Honor. Crawford became a minor league umpire in 1950, working for two months in the Canadian‚ÄìAmerican League before moving to the Eastern League from 1951 to 1953 and the American Association in from 1954 to 1955; his contract was purchased by the National League in November 1955. Baseball career Crawford was the third base umpire for Sandy Koufax's third no-hitter on June 4, 1964. He was the home plate umpire when one of the most violent brawls in baseball history occurred during a game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park on August 22, . The incident occurred between Giants pitcher Juan Marichal and Dodgers catcher John Roseboro in the aftermath of the Watts riots near Roseboro's Los Angeles home and while the Dominican Civil War raged in Marichal's home country so emotions were raw. The Dodgers' Maury Wills led off the game with a bunt single off Giants pitcher Marichal and eventually scored a run. Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills. When Wills came up to bat in the second inning, Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills sending him sprawling to the ground. Willie Mays then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher Sandy Koufax threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation. In the top of the third inning with two outs, Marichal threw a fastball that came close to hitting Ron Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground. Marichal's act angered the Dodgers sitting in the dugout and, Crawford then warned both teams that any further retaliations would not be tolerated. When Marichal came to bat in the third inning, he was expecting Koufax to take further retaliation against him but instead, he was startled when Roseboro's return throw to Koufax after the second pitch either brushed his ear or came close enough for him to feel the breeze off the ball. When Marichal confronted Roseboro about the closeness of his throw, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched. Marichal stated afterwards that he thought Roseboro was about to attack him and raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice over the head with his bat, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face that required 14 stitches. Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams. Crawford attempted to step between the two players in an effort to defuse the situation. When Marichal stumbled, Crawford saw his opportunity and wrapped both of his arms around Marichal and the two men fell to the ground. A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and other peacemakers restored order. Crawford ejected Marichal from the game and afterwards, National League president Warren Giles suspended him for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750 (equivalent to $ in ), and also forbade him from traveling to Dodger Stadium for the final, crucial two-game series of the season. Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident but, eventually settled out of court for $7,500. Crawford was also the umpire during a game between the Cubs and Cardinals on September 22, 1974. Crawford told the Cardinals‚Äô Al Hrabosky to pitch while Chicago‚Äôs manager and two of his players attempted to argue with Crawford. The Cubs in question then entered the batter‚Äôs box in anger and were nearly struck by a pitch, and a brawl commenced. During Crawford's career, he officiated three World Series (1961, 1963, 1969), ejecting Baltimore manager Earl Weaver in Game 4 of the 1969 Series for arguing balls and strikes, the first managerial ejection in World Series competition since 1935, two National League Championship Series (1971, 1974), and All-Star Games in 1959 (first game), 1961 (first game) and 1968; he worked behind the plate for the 1968 All-Star Game. Crawford was relieved of his duties in 1975 for refusing to work the World Series that year, due to a rotational system implemented for selection of World Series umpires, over the traditional assignment by merit. Two of Crawford's sons, Jerry Crawford and Joey Crawford, also became sports officials. Jerry was a National League umpire from 1976 until 2010, and Joey was a National Basketball Association referee from 1977 to 2016. Shag Crawford worked the first game at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium in 1971 and stood with Jerry at home plate when the lineup cards were presented before the final game at the ballpark in 2003.

History Newton High School was established in 1949. The original building was located on Newton Drive, where Sharp Learning Center is now located. At this time, it was the only high school in Newton County. Due to growth in the number of students, Newton County passed a bond referendum and started construction at the present site. The Board of Education began construction in the school year 1972-73 and the school opened to students in August of the 1974-75 school year. The first graduating class from this site was June 1975. For 25 years this school served as this county's only high school. Another bond referendum was passed and Eastside High School opened its doors in August 1994. Enrollment at this time was 2,300 students. Eventually, Newton County passed another bond referendum for a new high school, Alcovy High School, which opened in 2006. It operated on a 4x4 block schedule since 2009, but changed back to the original seven- period schedule for the 2011-2012 school year.

He is widely known as the first and only prime minister of the short-lived Islamic Republic of East Turkestan from November 12, 1933 until the republic's defeat in May 1934. Life Sabit Damolla Abdulbaqi was born in 1883, in county of Atush (Artux) in the Kashgar vilayet, where he received religious education. In the 1920s, he graduated from Xinjiang Academy of Politics and Laws in √úr√ºmqi (later becoming Xinjiang University), that was founded by Governor Yang Zengxin in 1924 and originally performed courses in Russian, Chinese and Uyghur. After completing university, he visited the Middle East, touring Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt; he also visited the Soviet Union, where he continued his studies. In 1932 he returned to Xinjiang through India, where he joined Emir Muhammad Amin Bughra in preparing a rebellion in Khotan district. Sabit Damulla was convinced that the Islamic world was not interested in supporting Uyghur independence, and so he turned to the Great Powers instead. Yang Zengxin had closed the publishing venture in Artush owned by Sabit Damulla. Sabit was a Jadidist. Achievements Between November 12, 1933 and April 6, 1934 he was selected the Prime Minister of the short-lived Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan (TIRET) in Kashgar. While Sabit Damolla Abdulbaki favoured the co-official \\"Republic of Uyghurstan\\" moniker, Muhammad Amin Bughra opposed it, considering that to create a broad anti-Chinese and anti- Tungan front in Xinjiang, all of the Turkic peoples should be called \\"Turks\\", not only Uyghurs. Sabit Damulla was also behind a creation of Independent Government in Khotan on March 16, 1933, which he proclaimed together with Emir Muhammad Amin Bughra. Later this Government expanded its authority to Kashgar and Aksu through the \\"Eastern Turkestan Independence Association\\" and contributed to the proclamation of a republic in the Old City of Kashgar on November 12, 1933. Khoja Niyaz Khaji, the leader of Kumul Rebellion in 1931, was invited by Sabit Damulla to Kashgar to assume presidency of the self- proclaimed Republic. Prime Minister Sabit Damolla (in circle) Death Contemporary sources say that Abdulbaki was captured by Khoja Niyaz near Aksu in late April 1934, then delivered to Governor Sheng Shicai. He was executed reportedly by hanging in June 1934 in Urumqi. Previously, in early April 1934, being in his native village of Artush Sabit Damulla rejected several urgent offers from Ma Zhongying to return to Kashgar and form a military alliance against advancing common enemies: Soviet backed Governor Sheng Shicai and Khoja Niyaz. Later sources allege that he was imprisoned by Sheng in Urumchi, where he traded his translation skills for better conditions in his cell. Fellow Chinese Muslims such as Kuomintang officer Liu Bin-Di provided him with the Quran and other Arabic and Chinese Islamic texts to be translated into Uyghur (The establishment of Islam in China in 650 stemmed from the delivery of a Quran by Caliph Usman to Tang Emperor Gaozong in 650 through Envoy Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas, one of Muhammad's first companions). Liu had been dispatched from Urumchi to pacify the Hi ( Ili) region in 1944, but he was too late. It is unknown if this job was finished, Liu Bin-Di himself was shot dead by rebels in Ghulja in November 1944 during revolt, that led to the establishment of Second East Turkestan Republic on November 12, 1944.

The unit operated for one year, between August 1948 and August 1949, and was raised specifically for the operation, drawing crews from two existing RAAF transport squadrons. It flew more than 2,000 sorties during the airlift, without loss. History In mid-1948, the Soviet Union placed the French-, British- and American sectors of the occupied city of Berlin under blockade following a dispute with the western powers, cutting off the city's land supply routes. As a humanitarian disaster loomed, a large-scale airlift was planned by the western powers to fly in aid to the city‚Äôs population. To support the effort, the Australian Government offered aircraft and aircrews to bolster the contribution of the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force (RAF). Due to the inability of the RAF to fully crew its own Dakotas, the decision was made for the Australian contribution to be limited to aircrew who would utilise British aircraft.Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 30 The Berlin Airlift Squadron was formed at RAAF Richmond in August 1948 from ten Douglas Dakota crews drawn from No. 36 and No. 38 Squadrons.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 29‚Äì30 In late August, the crews travelled to the United Kingdom as passengers in Qantas flying boats.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, pp. 181‚Äì182 The Australian contribution to the airlift, from September 1948, was designated Operation Pelican.Clark, Operation Pelican, front cover After receiving training at RAF Bassingbourn in the UK, the aircrew moved to L√ºbeck in the British Zone of Allied-occupied Germany on 14 and 15 September. The first Australian flight into Berlin was on 15 September 1948, by the unit‚Äôs commanding officer, Squadron Leader Cyril Greenwood. The squadron conducted 2,062 flights in all over the course of the next 11 months, with the last completed on 26 August 1949. To increase the payloads of each sortie, co-pilots were removed from the crews and were eventually sent back to the United Kingdom, to ferry several Bristol Freighter aircraft, which had been recently purchased by the RAAF, to Australia.Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 31 Flying via the wide northern corridor to RAF Gatow, and then later to the partially completed Tegel airport in November and December 1948,Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 30‚Äì31 a total of 6,041 flight hours were tallied, with the squadron carrying 6,964 passengers and delivering of supplies. On arrival in Berlin, the aircraft were unloaded by German workers. On return, the aircraft were sometimes diverted to Schleswig and Hamburg when L√ºbeck was closed. Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 35‚Äì37 Flights were undertaken in all weather, at all hours. In addition to the Berlin Airlift Squadron, the RAAF also contributed crews on rotation to the Avro York-equipped No. 24 (Commonwealth) Squadron RAF. The Berlin Airlift Squadron returned to Australia via the United Kingdom, where its personnel were accommodated at RAF Manston, before returning to Australia aboard an RAF York,Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 37 on 24 October 1949. Weather and interference from Soviet aircraft posed threats to the Berlin Airlift. No fatalities or losses were suffered by the squadron, although one Australian was killed during the airlift while serving on exchange with No. 27 Squadron RAF.

PMMA is the 4-methoxy analog of methamphetamine. Little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of PMMA; because of its structural similarity to PMA, which has known toxicity in humans, it is thought to have considerable potential to cause harmful side effects or death in overdose. In the early 2010s, a number of deaths in users of the drug MDMA were linked to misrepresented tablets and capsules of PMMA. Its effects in humans are reputedly similar to those of PMA, but slightly more empathogenic in nature. It has a reduced tendency to produce severe hyperthermia at low dosages, but at higher dosages side effects and risk of death becomes similar to those of PMA. The synthesis and effects of PMMA were described by American experimental chemist Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL, where it is referred to by the name \\"methyl-MA\\", as the N-methylated form of 4-MA (PMA). Shulgin reported that PMMA produces an increase in blood pressure and in heart rate, at doses above 100 mg, but causes no psychoactive effects at these levels. Recreational use Tablets of PMMA recovered by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration PMMA has been found in tablets and capsules of the MDMA sold as \\"ecstasy\\". A number of deaths have been attributed to tablets sold as ecstasy that contained other substances, such as PMMA's structural analog, PMA. Death can occur when an ecstasy user believes they are consuming recreational doses of MDMA, when they are in fact consuming a lethal dose of another substance with similar effects. PMA is of particular concern because it not only causes a release of serotonin but also acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI); if it is used in combination with MDMA or another MDMA-like substance, serotonin syndrome can result. PMMA can be detected with pill testing kits. =Deaths= In January 2011, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Norway had seen 12 deaths related to PMMA over the course of six months. In March 2011, Dutch media reported that there had been four deaths in the province of Limburg since November 2010. In April 2011, Icelandic media reported the death of a young woman that may have been connected to PMMA. In 2011, four deaths were recorded in Scotland as a result of ecstasy tablets which also contained PMMA. In January 2012, a number of ecstasy-related deaths in Canada in the previous year were linked to PMMA overdoses. In the single year, approximately 45 exposures occurred, resulting in 21 deaths. Cases were centred primarily in Calgary and Vancouver. In September 2012, the deaths of two men in County Cork, Ireland, have been linked to PMMA overdoses. In the same month, the death of a man in Queensland, Australia was attributed to PMMA. In June 2013 a PMMA-related death occurred in the Dutch city of 's-Hertogenbosch. Two months later, In August 2013, another possibly PMMA- related death occurred in the nearby town of Sliedrecht. In January 2015 in the UK four people died, suspected of taking ecstasy containing PMMA. In the same month, in Sweden, another man died from ecstasy laced with PMMA. In May 2015 a young woman died in Dublin, Ireland, after taking what is suspected to be PMMA. In April 2016 four young Argentines and one Uruguayan died during a massive rave called \\"Time Warp\\" in Buenos Aires and five more were hospitalized. PMMA was found in their bodies. Legal status =United States= PMMA is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but could be considered an analog (of PMA), in which case, sales or possession intended for human consumption could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act. Florida PMMA is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida, listed as \\"4-methoxymethamphetamine\\", making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida. =United Kingdom= PMMA is controlled as a Schedule 1, Class A drug in the UK.

They were created in 1949 as a form of socialist ownership of agricultural land by the government. They were primarily formed on the Regained Territories - lands that Poland acquired from Germany after the Second World War - but existed throughout Poland. Some farms took over farms of monasteries, e.g. in Szczyrzyc, see the picture. Relatively inefficient and subsidized by the government, most PGRs went bankrupt quickly after the fall of communism and adoption of a market economy by Poland. The state ran many specialised farms, which bred and trained horses (especially Arabians, e.g. Bask), bred cows, fishes, produced certified seed and potatoes. Some of the farms were state ones before the World War II. Many of the specialised farms still exist, controlled by the Agricultural Property Agency. Farms were created primarily on the basis of the earlier estates. Many of these households were founded on the Regained Territories. Low efficiency of work and extensive social benefits for workers in many cases led to disastrous management with low productivity, causing state deficit. After moving to the market economy under the Act of October 19, 1991 on agricultural property of the Treasury collective farms were liquidated and their assets were taken over by the Agricultural Property Agency of the Treasury (now Agricultural Property Agency), and their workers - 300 to 450 thousand people - joined the ranks of the unemployed. Households that have not been sold or leased were administered by the Agency of the State Treasury and managed by administrators appointed by the Agency. Then sought to sell or lease property holdings and the accompanying holdings, such as apartments, holiday resorts, etc. The social base has also been a sale of land to individual farmers. The weakest part of the land remained undeveloped for several years. The process of selling and leasing land societies and social services continues. Liquidation of state- owned farms has often been restricted, or permanent abandonment of animal husbandry, crop production limitation, changes in farming methods. This led to a drastic reduction of jobs and the resulting wide range of local problems; in many regions, PGR were the only employer, the new owners after restructuring usually significantly reduced the employment. State-owned farms were very often the organizers of social life, and theoretically adequately met all the needs of workers. Their downfall has often caused damage to the structure of the local communities, which were not adapted to the new situation of economic activity. It has also devastated the property - partly as a result of theft, partly because of the lack of elementary security.

The paper is owned and operated by Hearst Communications, a multinational corporate media conglomerate with $4 billion in revenues. The Advocate circulates in Stamford and the nearby southwestern Connecticut towns of Darien and New Canaan. The paper's headquarters moved in 2008 from downtown Stamford, across the street from the Stamford Government Center, to the Riverbend complex in the Springdale section of Stamford. Coverage In addition to the regular focus on local news, sports and business, The Advocate pays special attention to the workings of Metro-North Railroad, since many in southwestern Connecticut commute by train. The Advocate' website was launched in 1999.The Advocate And Greenwich Time: Market Facts In early 2007, the site started featuring message boards. History The Advocate has been called Stamford's oldest continuing business.Russell, Don. \\"The Advocate Has Historic Roots Here: Newspaper Is City's Oldest Employer\\". Opinion column. The Advocate (Stamford, Conn.), page A16, April 11, 2007. =The Intelligencer= The paper's earliest origins come from The Intelligencer, a newspaper originally run out of a small office on the south side of West Park (now Columbus Park in downtown Stamford) in April 1829. William Henry \\"Hen\\" Holly installed a printing press there, but despite some support from the community, he closed the publication after a few months for lack of revenue.\\"Our Back Pages\\". Sidebar. The Advocate (Stamford, Conn.), March 7, 2007. Several town leaders then helped to finance the publication again, this time under the name The Sentinel, which first appeared on February 16, 1830. Stamford was never without a local newspaper of one kind or another since then. The oldest known copy of The Sentinel, dated June 22, 1830, is in Stamford's public library, the Ferguson Library. That issue, marked Volume 1, No. 19, consists of four sheets, 15 by 20 inches each, with six columns to a page. The motto of the newspaper, printed at the top of the front page, was: \\"Pledged to no party's arbitrary way, we follow Truth wher'er she leads the way.\\" The newspaper published very little local news, according to Don Russell, an Advocate columnist who wrote about the early history of the paper. \\"[T]he columns were filled with sermons, poems and what were called literary 'gems' from various sources, and some domestic and foreign news items taken from newspapers in big cities.\\" An early columnist in the newspaper wrote under the pseudonym \\"Aristides the Younger\\" and at one point denounced the Rev. Joel Mann of Greenwich for anti-Masonic tendencies. Some think the columnist was Holly. Holly promoted reading in Stamford in various ways, operating his own circulating library out of his office, with books available to borrowers he deemed responsible. He was also one of the major founders of Stamford's public library, the Ferguson. =Family ownership= In May 1848, Edgar Hoyt and Andrew Smith came into ownership of the newspaper. The partners renamed it The Stamford Advocate. Advertising was banished from the front page. In 1861 printer William Gillespie and his brother, Edward, joined the newspaper staff. Edward would later cover the Civil War from the front lines. Eventually the Gillespie brothers, sons of a Canadian immigrant to Stamford, bought the newspaper and became the first of three generations of Gillespie owners of the publication. In 1892 they made the newspaper a daily. Around the turn of the century the name changed to The Daily Advocate. The name was later changed to The Stamford Advocate. =Atlantic Street offices= Former Advocate building (1894-1980) In 1894, the Advocate moved into a new building at 258 Atlantic Street (across the street from St. John Roman Catholic Church). The facade is in Neo-Italian Renaissance style, and its relatively narrow front widens out considerably in the back, where the newspaper's printing press was located. In 1928 the building was remodeled, and the newspaper remained in that location until 1980. (The building was then occupied by various architectural and design firms and an Internet company. In 2002 it became the home of the Print Research Foundation.)Daley, Sherri. \\"ART; 6,000 American Prints Take Over Stamford's Advocate Building\\". The New York Times, March 17, 2002. Accessed November 12, 2007. In the late 1940s, the 1947 film Boomerang, directed by Elia Kazan was shot almost entirely in Stamford, and partly at the newspaper's offices, then on Atlantic Street. Some members of the editorial staff were shown in the movie.Russell, Don. \\"'Roles' in Movies Are Nothing New for City: Kazan used Stamford in the '40s\\". Opinion column. The Advocate, Stamford (Conn.) edition, page A10, April 25, 2007. =Times-Mirror and Tribune= In 1977, the Gillespie family sold the paper to Times Mirror Company, owner of The Los Angeles Times. In 1978, Anthony Dolan, a staff writer at the time, won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on city corruption. While in college, he had written for the Yale Daily News, and interviewed Stamford resident and Yale alumnus William F. Buckley Jr. for that student newspaper. The two became friends, and when Dolan lost his job with Gannett, Buckley helped get him hired by The Advocate. By 1979, Dolan had become tired of journalism and in 1980 went to work for Ronald Reagan's campaign for president. Dolan went on to become a speechwriter in Reagan's White House.Judis, John B., William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1988, pp. 289, 417 In 1980, the newspaper moved to a new building at the corner of Tresser and Washington Boulevards in downtown Stamford. The building was constructed by Frank Mercede & Sons Inc. under a contract signed by the Advocate's then-publisher Jay Shaw. In June 2000, Tribune Company bought Times Mirror, incorporating The Advocate into the Chicago-based company's holdings. The property at Tresser Blvd was subsequently sold. In May 2003 The Advocate opened an office at 605 West Ave. in Norwalk. The newspaper had started printing separate Norwalk editions in the 1980s, but reporters had worked in the Stamford offices. =Sale to Hearst= In March 2007, Tribune Co. had announced it would sell the two papers to Gannett for US$73 million, but the deal fell through when Gannett refused to honor 35 Advocate newsroom workers' union contract with Local 2110 of United Auto Workers.\\"Hearst Corp. Buys 2 Conn. Dailies, to be Run by MediaNews\\". NEPA Bulletin, page 7, November‚ÄìDecember 2007. The Advocate and its sister paper, the Greenwich Time, were sold to Hearst for US$62.4 million by Tribune Company in a deal that closed November 1, 2007. The sale did not include Tribune-owned land in Stamford and Greenwich, including the papers' printing presses. At the end of 2007, printing plant employees were permanently laid off and the newspaper was printed at the Danbury News-Times plant, owned by MediaNews Group. The Greenwich Time was then printed at the Connecticut Post plant in Bridgeport. On January 6, 2008, the newspaper announced in a front-page article that its Stamford offices were moving from 75 Tresser Boulevard, where the newspaper had been located since 1981, to the Riverbend office complex off Hope Street in the city's Springdale section, with the move expected by the end of the month. The Norwalk office was moving from leased office space at 605 West Avenue, where it had been since the Norwalk edition began, to 542 Westport Avenue, effective immediately.Ginocchio, Mark, \\"Offices of The Advocate, Greenwich Time to move\\", article, The Advocate, January 6, 2007, page 1 On August 8, 2008 the Hearst Corporation acquired the Connecticut Post (Bridgeport, Conn.) and www.ConnPost.com, including seven non-daily newspapers, from MediaNews Group, Inc. and assumed management control of three additional daily newspapers in Fairfield County, Conn., including The Advocate (Stamford), Greenwich Time (Greenwich), and The News-Times (Danbury), which had been managed for Hearst by MediaNews had managed under a management agreement that began in April 2007.

Long was the third son of Sir Thomas Long of Draycot (ca. 1449‚Äì1508), Wiltshire landowner, and his wife, Margery (d. in or after 1508), daughter of Sir George Darrell of Littlecote House in Wiltshire. Career Long was among the retinue of Sir Gilbert Talbot in 1512, who went as deputy to Calais, and by 1515 he was one of the spears of Calais, a post that he seems to have held for the rest of his life. How he came to be appointed to the court is not clear, but Long was listed by the Treasurer of the Chamber as working in the stables in December 1528,Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, of the Reign of Henry VIII. Vol. 5:1531‚Äì32. and certainly by 1533 he was an esquire of the stable. He had come to the attention of Cromwell by this time, who, with the exception in times of war, arranged for him to be non-resident in Calais. In 1532 Cromwell received a letter from Long's brother, Henry, to thank him for his favour to Richard. In 1535 Long was appointed to the privy chamber as Gentleman Usher, possibly through the influence of Cromwell. He quickly rose in prominence, gaining the favour of the King. In 1537 he was knighted, on 15 October in the celebrations following the baptism of Prince Edward, in which he was one of the bearers of the canopy held over the infant in the baptismal procession, and the same day that his kinsman Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset was created earl of Hertford. In 1538 Long was appointed Master of the Buckhounds and Master of the Hawks. By 1539, he was a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, and was present at the reception of Anne of Cleves, also in 1539. He was MP for Southwark the same year. Surviving the fall of his patron Cromwell, Long became a prominent servant of the government throughout the 1540s. He was one of the most senior members of the privy chamber during these years and his intimacy with the King made him a useful agent for secret and covert affairs. Arriving in January 1541 at Calais to put its affairs in order, Long was described by the French ambassador, Charles de Marillac, bishop of Vienne, as 'a person of authority and conduct' (LP Henry VIII, 16.466). On his return he was instructed to arrest Sir John Wallop, a diplomat suspected of colluding with Cardinal Pole. This was a sensitive mission, and its failure was blamed not on Long, but on his kinsman Hertford. Later that year he worked on various commissions and juries dealing with the treason of Catherine Howard. Making use of Long's military experience, the government appointed him governor of Guernsey, Alderney, and Sark in 1541, a post that he held until retirement due to illness in 1545, and in 1542 he was appointed captain of Kingston upon Hull with power to levy forces whenever occasion required, and with a place on the king's council of the north. In a letter written by Henry VIII, he referred to Long as 'our trusty & right well-beloved Councillor, Sir Richard Long, Knt'. In 1542 Long gave the King a gift of a pair of purple satin stockings \\"embrauded all over with pirles of damask gold and damask silver\\",A Complete View of the Dress and Habits of the People of England, from the Establishment of the Saxons in Britain to the Present Time 1796‚Äì99 ‚Äì Joseph Strutt and the following year the King granted Long the manor of Shingay in Cambridgeshire. Family On 10 November 1541 he obtained the marriage settlement of Margaret Donnington, only daughter of John Donnington of Stoke Newington in Middlesex, and widow of Sir Thomas Kitson of Hengrave Hall, Suffolk. They had one son, Henry,. to whom the King stood as godfather in 1544, and three daughters, Jane, Katherine and Mary. His granddaughter Elizabeth married William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh. He received large grants of Abbey lands from Henry VIII, in Essex, Cambridge, Suffolk and elsewhere, and together with his marriage, meant that like his fellow courtiers Welsbourne and Walsh, he was a rich man at his death on 30 September 1546. His widow married John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath, on 11 December 1548. She died on 20 December 1561 at Stoke Newington and was buried at Hengrave on 12 January 1562.

Architecture  Floor Plan Although the pineapples that crown the pillars of the fence tropicalize a Neo-Classical vocabulary, the structure imitates a small Greco-Roman temple with Doric columns topped by a classical pediment. Construction was completed in 1828 in honor of Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, wife of King Fernando VII. The architecture of the Templete was a transition from the 19th-century ‚ÄòCuban baroque,‚Äô as represented by the Havana Cathedral, to the Neoclassical style. The small interior houses three large oil paintings by the French artist Jean Baptiste Vermay (1818-1833), founder of the San Alejandro Arts Academy in Havana. Vermay's paintings depict the first mass, the first council, and the blessing of the Templete on its inauguration.  Tradition  Among the elements in this building that attest to the importance of the chosen site, one of the most relevant is the commemorative ceiba tree which constitutes a sacred symbol in various religions, such as the Yoruba religion, and to which people in Havana come yearly in search of prosperity and well-being. As a tradition, every November 15th people wait for midnight in El Templete to go around the ceiba three times and make a wish and celebrate a new anniversary. A procession of the city's 16th-century maces ‚Äì normally kept in the Museo de la Ciudad ‚Äì makes its way around the Plaza de Armas to the ceiba tree to commemorate the city's founding. Superstitious Habaneros queue up to walk around the sacred ceiba tree three times and make a wish in the belief that the Orisha will honor their wish. In March 2016, ceiba was withdrawn due to deterioration. The process of replacing the emblematic ceiba was an event for residents and visitors alike. Close to the Templete, there is a column which replaces a silk-cotton tree, under which the first mass and the first Council of Havana were celebrated.

Biography Born Anne Hyde Clarke in New York, her godmother was Juliette Gordon Low, later to be founder of the Girl Scouts in the United States. At Low's invitation she visited England, during which trip she met her future husband Arthur Choate, nephew of Joseph Choate, the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain. They married in 1907 and lived in Pleasantville, New York. They had five children. He died in 1962. In 1915, at the request of Juliette Low, she started working with the new troop in Pleasantville. In 1916 she became a national vice president for the Girl Scouts, and in 1920 she became the second president, succeeding Juliette Low. After she finished her term in 1922, she turned to international Scouting, though she remained a vice-president until 1937 and an ex officio member of the board until her death. She chaired the Juliette Low World Friendship Committee from 1927 when it was founded after the death of Juliette Low to 1955 and was closely involved in Our Chalet including becoming chairman. She attended her last international conference in Tokyo in 1966 and died the following year at the age of 80 in her home in New York. Very active even in her old age, she was horseback riding almost daily until breaking her clavicle in a riding accident about four months before her death. She was also interested in historic preservation which she combined with Scouting when she successfully worked to preserve Juliette Low's birthplace in Savannah, Georgia.

Licensed to Council Bluffs, Iowa, United States, the station serves the Omaha metropolitan area. The station is currently owned by NRG Media. Its studios are located at Dodge Street and 50th Avenue in Midtown Omaha, and its transmitter site is located in North Central Omaha at the Omaha master antenna farm on North 72nd Avenue and Crown Point. History KQKQ signed on in 1969 with a progressive rock format as \\"Rockradio KQ98\\". From September 1980 to March 2004, KQKQ was a Top 40/CHR station known as \\"Sweet 98\\", and was the Omaha market's first personality-driven FM music station, putting new pressure on market leader KGOR's automated CHR/MOR operation. \\"Sweet 98\\" signed on the air in September 1980 with Mark Evans and Dick Warner; together, they called themselves \\"The Breakfast Flakes\\". The remainder of the lineup included Gregory \\"Greg Koogler\\" MacArthur in the middays, Bruce \\"Doc Winston\\" Soderholm in the afternoons, Craig \\"Jay Taylor\\" Wendel in the evenings, and \\"Brooklyn Dave\\" holding down overnights. Brooklyn Dave only lasted a few months before being replaced by Rick Jeffrey. Operating on a shoestring budget in its early days, the station made its name through a variety of promotions and gimmicks under the guidance of General Manager and DJ William \\"Billy 'Will' Cunningham\\" Honeylamb and Mark Evans who doubled as Sweet 98 FM's 1st program director and morning DJ. In September 1980, listeners were offered the opportunity to win $50,000 for answering their phones with the now iconic but legendary phrase, \\"I Listen to the new sound of Sweet 98 FM!\\" At approximately the same time, the station opened its \\"Supermouth\\" contest, whereby local teens competed for a year-long stint as a Sweet 98 evening jock, a $1,000-a-month salary, a $1,000 wardrobe, and use of a new Pontiac Firebird, emblazoned with station logos and a giant Supermouth emblem on the hood. According to the station, it received over 5,000 applications, from which it auditioned over 300 in 30-second over-the-phone song intros. After narrowing the field to 20 semi- finalists who were given 15 minutes of live airtime apiece, 10 finalists received 30-minute auditions (again live). On February 14, 1981, after five hours of on-air auditions, Bill Cunningham proclaimed Alan Bone, an 18-year- old UNL student, the station's first Supermouth. In all, the station crowned seven Supermouths, the most successful of whom was \\"Hot Scott\\" O'Hanlon, who eventually dominated evenings for most of the late 80s. Another 1981 promotion involved the station asking listeners to affix Sweet 98 FM's \\"stickificates\\" to their bumpers for a chance to win $98,000. After stringing the promotion out over several months by sending jocks out in a \\"Roving (Buick) Riviera\\" to pull stickificate-bearing cars over and give out small cash prizes and gift certificates, the station told listeners to bring their stickificates (and cars) to the Crossroads Mall parking lot at 72nd and Dodge one early June evening. The result was a traffic jam, chaos, and much publicity for the station proving to Billy, Mark, and all of the Sweet 98 jocks that there is no such thing as bad publicity. In 1982, the station initiated on-air bingo games as a means of increasing listenership, a promotional idea that dragged on for several ratings periods, in one form or another. \\"Big Guy\\" a squeaky voiced character created by Mark. Big Guy was the mascot of Sweet 98 FM's bingo promotions. In the fall of 1982 listeners were tormented for an entire afternoon when Big Guy ostensibly took over the control room and played the Toni Basil song \\"Mickey\\" over and over, while an exasperated Billy pounded on the studio door imploring Big Guy to give him back control of the station. A later bingo promotion culminated in what was billed as the \\"world's largest bingo game\\", wherein roughly 10,000 listeners crowded into Omaha's Civic Auditorium for a long evening of shtick and bingo for thousands in cash and prizes. One memorable moment came when a seemingly meek elderly woman claimed to have a bingo and made her way, gingerly to the stage only to be told that she did not after all have the matching numbers. Upon receiving this news the formerly adorable grandmother unleashed a profanity laced tirade on Billy and the Sweet 98 jocks, much to the delight of the crowd. The Sweet 98 FM studios were originally located in a dilapidated building at 3600 Broadway in Council Bluffs. Formerly an apartment building next to what was rumored to have once been a brothel, the Council Bluffs digs were condemned on several occasions in the early 1980s and razed shortly after the move to downtown Omaha in 1987. So bad was the Council Bluffs facility that when a thunderstorm knocked the power out in 1982 the station operated off the generator of a run-down RV parked in the mud-and-gravel lot behind the building. The downtown Omaha studios were much more plush and prominently located in the famed Old Market at 10th and Farnam. The window front studios featured a hydraulic lift which the jocks could raise and lower with a foot pedal to greet revelers who frequently passed by the while celebrating birthdays, weddings, and graduations and making song dedications. A spaceman jumpsuit hung on the wall of the studio, and it was ostensibly for the Sweet jocks to wear, even though none of the Sweet jocks will admit to ever wearing it.Steve Millburg, \\"KQKQ Revamps Facilities With High-Tech Glitziness,\\" The Omaha World-Herald, November 18, 1986.

It was founded by Austen Fox Riggs in 1913 as the Stockbridge Institute for the Study and Treatment of Psychoneuroses before being renamed in honor of Austen Riggs on July 21, 1919. History =Founding to 1946= A New York City internist who repaired to Stockbridge, MA while suffering from tuberculosis, Austen Fox Riggs developed a treatment regimen that both anticipated the rise of psychosomatic medicine and therapeutic psychology, and forged a new direction for residential care. Riggs was influenced by the mental hygiene movement (also known as the social hygiene movement). He developed his residential model after observing a physician in Bethel, Maine named John George Gehring, who treated patients through strict daily regimens and treatments through suggestion. Opened in 1913 as The Stockbridge Institute for the Study and Treatment of the Psychoneuroses, the Institute incorporated in 1919 as the Austen Riggs Foundation. Riggs grew quickly; it had 100 patients by 1924, with average stays of four to six weeks. A staff of doctors handled no more than 10 patients each, and physicians in training joined regular staff meetings and conferences. A series of \\"green books\\" summed up Riggs's \\"precepts for successful living\\" and an associate from the 1930s said that patients were encouraged to be \\"a valuable member of a united team.\\" Riggs had what a colleague described as a \\"deep and almost Puritanic conviction that feeling must be kept under constant surveillance and control by doing.\\" His hospital had an occupational therapy shop equipped for weaving, carpentry, painting, and other handicrafts, and rooms for games and recreation.The Riggs Story. The Development of the Austen Riggs Center for the Study and Treatment of the Neuroses, by Lawrence S. Kubie, M. D. (New York: Paul B. Hoeber, Inc., 1960). Riggs also had what he called \\"10 commandments\\" of successful living. Though he denounced what he called Freud's \\"mental gymnastics,\\" and criticized the Vienna doctors' emphasis on sexual conflicts as the root of neurosis, Riggs's practices bore commonalities with the emerging field of psychoanalysis. He believed neurotics to be troubled by the \\"residues of past experience,\\" and that they would heal in part by self- knowledge and adaptation to practical realities. Where Freud spoke of defense mechanisms, Riggs once said that a patient \\"cannot be deprived of the protection of his neuroses.\\" Where Freud spoke of coming to grips with the ordinary unhappiness of the world, Riggs spoke of the problem of \\"magnifying suffering by making a personal quarrel with pain.\\" The American Journal of Psychiatry has called Riggs' system \\"a fully integrated conceptual system of ego psychology\\" that preceded Sigmund Freud's attention to the field by ten years.Austen Fox Riggs: His Significance to American Psychiatry of Today, by John A.P. Milett, M.D. Riggs also read Freud in the original German, as well as Pierre Janet and Jean-Martin Charcot in French. Riggs's books included Play: Recreation In a Balanced Life, Intelligent Living and Just Nerves. The New York Times described him as an \\"internationally known psychiatrist\\" who was \\"widely known to the general public for his books.\\"'Dr. Austen F. Riggs, Psychiatrist, Dies', The New York Times, March 6, 1940 =1947‚Äì1967= In 1947, Dr. Robert P. Knight, the former chief of staff of the Menninger Foundation came to Riggs as medical director. A friend of Anna Freud's\\"Friend of Anna Freud's,\\" The New York Times, May 1, 1966 and well known in the burgeoning world of American psychoanalysis, Knight emphasized talk therapy and rehabilitation, and avoided common practices in psychiatric hospitals of the time, including electroshock, insulin coma, and lobotomy. Knight regarded medications as useful to \\"lessen distress, improve the patient's behavior and increase his accessibility to psychotherapy,\\" but believed that ultimately a patient's troubles \\"must be worked out in treatment, if it is ever to be worked out at all.\\" A president of both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychoanalytic Foundation, Knight was an authority on borderline personality disorder, which he said referred to patients who were \\"quite sick but not frankly psychotic.\\"\\"Borderline States,\\" by Robert P. Knight, in Current and Historical Perspectives on the Borderline Patient, edited by Reuben Fine (The Society for Psychoanalytic Training, 1989). Under his direction Austen Riggs began to receive more seriously ill patients, and to explore ways to put into practice Knight's ideas that borderline patients needed a combination of structure and freedom in order to negotiate their own path toward health. Early in Knight's tenure, when, facing some turmoil with a younger patient population, he convened a conference of patients and staff to work out philosophy and procedures of a therapeutic community. By 1948, Knight had brought with him what the scholar Lawrence J. Friedman has called \\"the creative core of Menninger's clinical psychology department and its research staff,\\" including David Rapaport, Roy Schafer, and Merton Gill (who wrote the text Diagnostic Psychological Testing) and Margaret Brenman-Gibson, the first non-physician to receive full clinical and research psychoanalytic training in the United States In 1951, Erik Erikson joined the staff at Riggs, completing a team that, according to an article in the Harvard Gazette, \\"turned the grand experiment of treating very troubled patients in an open therapeutic community into a Golden Age of conceptual and clinical inventiveness.\\" According to Friedman, Erikson \\"compared Riggs to the safe sanitarium in the Alps that Thomas Mann had characterized in The Magic Mountain.\\"Friedman, p. 260 During the Eriksons' residence in Stockbridge, Joan Erikson, an artist and dancer, directed the Riggs' Activities Program, which she expanded to include theater, dance, painting, sculpture, woodwork, gardening, and music. She also founded a formal Montessori kindergarten for local families, in which Riggs' patients could apprentice‚Äîa program that continues today. According to Erikson biographer Daniel Burston, the Activities Program \\"became a unique, engrossing, and deeply healing experience for patients, which stood in stark contrast to the enforced passivity, boredom, and/or utter self-absorption that prevails in many treatment settings.\\" The theater program at Austen Riggs was also influenced by William Gibson, the playwright known for The Miracle Worker. While in Stockbridge, Gibson wrote a novel called The Cobweb, set at a psychiatric hospital, which was turned into a film starring Richard Widmark and Lauren Bacall. Erikson pointed out that the Activities Program played a major role in preventing patients from succumbing to a narrow, negative identity produced by immersion in the \\"patient role.\\"Burston, p. 41 He credited his wife's work with teaching him the \\"curative as well as creative role of work,\\" which he found to be prominent in the life of Martin Luther.Young man Luther: a study in psychoanalysis and history, by Erik H. Erikson, p.8 Erikson also used his experience at Riggs to pursue the ideas he developed in his book Childhood and Society, which proposed a series of eight normative crises in every life, with potential at each stage for healthy growth and integration‚Äîand also pathologic development and mental illness. =1967‚Äì1991= In 1967, after Knight's death, Dr. Otto Allen Will, Jr., formerly of Chestnut Lodge, came to direct Austen Riggs and brought his understanding of early attachment problems and psychotic vulnerability to the treatment program. According to his New York Times obituary, \\"Dr. Will was one of a small number of psychoanalysts who devoted their careers to trying to understand psychotic patients through long, intensive, therapeutic relationships with them.\\" The Times noted that Will wrote in more than 85 papers how psychotic thought states might be changed using only psychotherapy. Will retired in 1978 as medical director at Austen Riggs but continued on the hospital's board until his death.\\"Otto Allen Will Jr., 83, Psychoanalyst, Is Dead\\" The New York Times, November 22, 1993. Dr. Daniel P. Schwartz, the former director of the Yale psychiatric hospital, directed Austen Riggs from 1978‚Äì1991, and oversaw the hospital in an era in which both managed care and biological psychiatry came to dominate the field, and in which many hospitals focusing on long-term psychotherapy ‚Äì including Chestnut Lodge, the McLean Hospital, the Westchester Division of New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Timberlawn, Sheppard Pratt, and Menninger's‚Äîchanged their missions. It was during this time (1985‚Äì1988) that Christopher Bollas, PhD, a leading voice in contemporary psychoanalytic theory,Anthony Elliott, Subject to Ourselves (1996) p. 103. served as director of education at the Austen Riggs Center. =1991‚Äì2011= In 1991, Edward R. Shapiro assumed the role of medical director/CEO of Austen Riggs. An authority on family and organizational systems, Shapiro expanded Riggs' focus on working with family members to facilitate patients' treatment, and increased the number of social workers on staff from one to eight. Shapiro also emphasized Riggs as a resource for \\"treatment resistant\\" individuals, who were unable to be treated successfully elsewhere. Under Shapiro's leadership, Riggs increased its residential capacity and expanded the options for more cost-effective step-down programs. Shapiro retired in June, 2011. =2011‚Äì2015= Donald Rosen, MD was appointed as medical director/CEO in July 2011.After Rosen's departure from the center in March 2013, Dr. James L. Sacksteder assumed the role of medical director/CEO of Austen Riggs. A board-certified psychiatrist, Dr. Sacksteder began his career at the Austen Riggs Center as a Fellow in psychiatry and served the bulk of his time as director of patient care. He served Riggs for four decades culminating as the organization's leader. Dr. Sacksteder wrote over twenty articles and book chapters on the treatment of anorexia nervosa, long-term psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapy of severely disturbed patients, narcissism, object relations theory, and ego psychology. He is co- editor of Attachment in the Therapeutic Process with Daniel P. Schwartz, M.D. and Yoshiharu Akabane, M.D.: (International University Press, 1987). Dr. Sacksteder was a lecturer at Smith College School of Social Work for over twenty years. Sacksteder retired in June, 2015. =2015‚Äì2018= Andrew J. Gerber, MD, PhD, became the medical director/CEO at the Austen Riggs Center In July 2015. Prior to coming to Riggs, he served as the director of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Research Program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, the director of research at the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research and an assistant professor of psychiatry in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center. Dr. Gerber also had a private psychoanalytic practice while in New York. During his tenure at Austen Riggs, Dr. Gerber was instrumental in establishing several strategic initiatives in areas including human development, suicide research and education. =2018‚Äìpresent= Dr. Eric Plakun in his Austen Riggs office in 2016 Eric Plakun, a psychiatrist at the Austen Riggs Center for more than 40 years, was named Medical Director/CEO in November 2018. Plakun previously served as an expert witness in the 2019 Wit v. United Behavioral Health class-action suit. In 2019, the Austen Riggs Center marked the centennial year of its founding.

CSIS was founded on Sept 1, 1971 by a group of Indonesian colleagues who hoped to promote public policy- oriented discussions in Indonesia. Founders of the organization included Harry Tjan Silalahi, Jusuf Wanandi, Hadi Soesastro, and Clara Joewono. It also had strong support from key figures close to the government at the time including generals Ali Moertopo, Soedjono Hoemardani, and Benny Moerdani.Jusuf Wanandi, 2012, Shades of Grey: A Political Memoir of Modern Indonesia, Singapore: Equinox Publishing. It was founded to give advice, ideas and support to government and other stakeholders such as parliament, political parties, businesses and NGOs and to reach out to the regional and international communities and to develop awareness of Indonesian policies and its state of development, while giving feedback to the Indonesian government on domestic and international developments. It is located in Jl. Tanah Abang III/23-27, Jakarta close to the National Museum of Indonesia. History CSIS was conceived in the 1960s as a strategic and security studies think-tank by brothers Jusuf Wanandi and Sofjan Wanandi. It was funded in part by the Chinese Indonesian business community and had the support of the Indonesian administration, including generals Ali Moertopo and Soedjono Hoemardani as well as two of the personal assistants of president Suharto. They turned down an offer to become a presidential think tank in order to stay independent and credible. In its early years, CSIS was not trusted by some parts of the Muslim community in Indonesia because it was perceived to be a Catholic and Chinese- supported institution. In 1988, President Suharto distanced CSIS from his administration as a memo from Jusuf Wanandi which advised the preparation of a new generation of leadership for Indonesia after 20 years of his presidential rule was seen as a call for him to step down. Suharto instructed his ministers to sever ties with CSIS. However, some politicians still maintained links with CSIS. Activities It is actively involved in international collaboration, including hosting the Indonesian National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation (INCPEC) for the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC). CSIS is also a founding institute of the Council for Asia Europe Cooperation (CAEC) . CSIS published widely in both English and Indonesian, including books and monographs of research, The Indonesian Quarterly (established in 1974), Analisis CSIS (established in 1971). It cooperates with the Indonesia project of the Australian National University to print and distribute the Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies (BIES). The institute hosts a topic-based library open to the public with around 50,000 book titles, and many academic journals, as well as a newspaper clipping service from national and regional newspapers. CSIS is one of the founders and a long-standing member committee of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP). Dr Rizal Sukma, former Executive Director of CSIS and current (2018) Indonesian ambassador to the United Kingdom, was instrumental in his advisory capacity to then foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda on the concept of the ASEAN political and security community during Indonesia‚Äôs ASEAN chairmanship in 2003.

After the Communist takeover by Fidel Castro in 1959, Cuba became involved in many major conflicts of the Cold War in Africa and the Middle East, where it supported Marxist governments and fought against Western proxies. Castro's Cuba had some 39,000‚Äì40,000 military personnel abroad by the late 1970s, with the bulk of the forces in Sub-Saharan Africa but with some 1,365 stationed in the Middle East and North Africa. The loss of East European subsidies at the end of the Cold War weakened the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. Colonial period (1511‚Äì1902) =American Revolutionary War= During the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì83), Cuban soldiers, shoulder to shoulder with Mexicans, Spaniards, Puerto Ricans, and Dominicans fought under General G√°lvez' command as far north as present-day Michigan. =Ten Years' War= Depiction of an engagement between Cuban rebels and Spanish Royalists during the Ten Years' War. The Ten Years' War (1868‚Äì78) was the first of three wars that Cuba fought against Spain for its independence. The Ten Years' War began when Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes and his followers of patriots from his sugar mill La Demajagua began an uprising. Dominican exiles, including M√°ximo G√≥mez, Luis Marcano and Modesto D√≠az, joined the new Revolutionary Army and provided its initial training and leadership. With reinforcements and guidance from the Dominicans, the Cuban rebels defeated Spanish detachments, cut railway lines, and gained dominance over vast sections of the eastern portion of the island. On 19 February 1874, G√≥mez and 700 other rebels marched westward from their eastern base and defeated 2,000 Spanish troops at El Naranjo. The Spaniards lost 100 killed and 200 wounded and the rebels a total of 150 killed and wounded. The most significant rebel victory came at the Battle of Las Guasimas, 16‚Äì20 March 1874, when 2,050 rebels, led by Antonio Maceo and G√≥mez, defeated 5,000 Spanish troops with 6 cannons. The five-day battle cost the Spanish 1,037 casualties and the rebels 174 casualties. The Spanish built a fortified line (La Trocha) to prevent G√≥mez to move westward from Oriente province; it consisted of numerous small forts, wire fences and a parallel railroad line. It was the largest Spanish fortification in the New World. G√≥mez began an invasion of Western Cuba in 1875; he burned burned 83 plantations around Sancti Sp√≠ritus within a six-week period and freed their slaves. However, the vast majority of slaves and wealthy sugar producers in the region did not join the revolt. After his most trusted general, the American Henry Reeve, was killed in 1876, the invasion was over. The war ended with the signing of the Pact of Zanj√≥n. The Spanish lost 27,000 troops in battle and another 54,000 dead from disease. The rebels sustained 40,000 dead and the island sustained over $300 million in property damage. =Cuban War of Independence= The Cuban War of Independence (1895‚Äì98) was the last major uprising by Cuban Nationalists against the Spanish Colonial Government. The conflict culminated with American intervention during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Cuban volunteers during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898) was a major war fought by the United States and the Kingdom of Spain in the Spanish territories of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. The war was triggered with the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor. Cuban rebels fought alongside American troops throughout the war on the Cuban island. The war lasted for 10 weeks. From 22‚Äì24 June, the U.S. V Corps under General William R. Shafter landed at Daiquir√≠ and Siboney, east of Santiago, and established an American base of operations. A contingent of Spanish troops, having fought a skirmish with the Americans near Siboney on 23 June, had retired to their lightly entrenched positions at Las Guasimas. An advance guard of U.S. forces under former Confederate General Joseph Wheeler ignored Cuban scouting parties and orders to proceed with caution. They caught up with and engaged the Spanish rearguard of 1,500 soldiers led by General Antero Rub√≠n who effectively ambushed them, in the Battle of Las Guasimas on 24 June. The Americans lost 16 killed and 52 wounded. The Spanish lost 12 dead and 24 wounded. On 1 July, a force of 15,065 American troops in regular infantry and cavalry regiments attacked 1,320 entrenched Spaniards in dangerous Civil War-style frontal assaults at the Battle of El Caney and Battle of San Juan Hill outside of Santiago, which cost the Americans 225 killed in action, 1,384 wounded in action, and 72 missing in action. At all battle sites on 1 July, the Spanish lost 215 killed, 376 wounded, and 200 captured. After the battles of San Juan Hill and El Caney, the American advance halted. Spanish troops successfully defended Fort Canosa, allowing them to stabilize their line and bar the entry to Santiago. The Americans and Cubans forcibly began a siege of the city. During the nights, Cuban troops dug successive series of \\"trenches\\" (raised parapets), toward the Spanish positions. Once completed, these parapets were occupied by U.S. soldiers and a new set of excavations went forward. The Spanish forces surrendered on 17 July. In the Treaty of Paris (1898), Spain renounced its sovereignty over Cuba without naming a receiving country. Cuba then established its own civil government, which was recognized by the United States as the legal government of Cuba upon the announcement of the termination of United States Military Government (USMG) jurisdiction over the island on May 20, 1902. This date is celebrated as Independence day for the Republic of Cuba. Early republic (1902‚Äì1959) =Spanish Civil War= Approximately 1,000 Cubans fought in Spain in the 1936‚Äì39 Spanish Civil War (nearly all of them in the Communist ranks of the International Brigades). =World War II= Cuba entered World War II in December 1941. The Cuban Navy performed convoy escort duties and antisubmarine patrols during the Battle of the Caribbean; despite its small size, the Cuban Navy quickly developed a reputation for being extremely efficient. The most notable success of Cuban forces was the sinking of by a Cuban submarine chaser squadron. Six Cuban merchant vessels were sunk by German submarines in the conflict and 79 Cuban sailors were killed. =1952 coup= Military strongman Fulgencio Batista staged a coup on 10 March 1952, removing Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s from power. Cubans in general were stunned, but remembering the bloodshed of Batista's rule in the 1930s, they were reluctant to fight. Batista created a consultative council from pliable political personalities of all parties who appointed him President months before elections were to be held. Batista‚Äôs past democratic and pro-labor tendencies and the fear of another episode of bloody violence gained him tenuous support from the bankers, and the leader of the major labor confederation. =The Cuban Revolution= Cuban rebel soldiers in the Habana Hilton foyer, January 1959 The Cuban Revolution started as an uprising that resulted in the overthrow of the Fulgencio Batista government on 1 January 1959 by Fidel Castro and other revolutionary elements in the country. The Revolution began on 26 July 1953, when a group of armed guerrillas attacked the Moncada Barracks. From 1956 through the middle of 1958, Castro and his forces staged successful attacks on Batista garrisons in the Sierra Maestra mountains. Che Guevara and Ra√∫l Castro helped to consolidate rebel political control in the mountains through guerrilla fighting, building trust with campesinos, and severely punishing traitors and informers. The irregular and poorly armed rebels harassed the Batista forces in the foot hills and the plains of Oriente Province. Batista's troops were defeated by Castro's fighters at the Battle of La Plata (11‚Äì21 July 1958). Although Batista's army gained a victory at the Battle of Las Mercedes (29 July‚Äì8 August 1958), the army commander allowed the rebels to escape back into the Sierra Maestra mountains. As the rebels emerged from the Sierra Maestra into more populated areas, they seized significant amounts of Dominican-made Crist√≥bal Carbines and hand grenades; these became the rebels' standard weapons. The final blow to Batista's government came during the Battle of Yaguajay (19‚Äì30 December 1958). After suffering a crucial defeat at the Battle of Santa Clara, Batista fled the country and Castro came into power. Post- revolution Cuba (1959‚Äìpresent) = Dominican Republic invasion attempt = Cuban military intervention abroad began on 14 June 1959 with an attempted invasion of the Dominican Republic by a mixed group of Cuban soldiers and Cuban-trained Dominican irregulars. The expeditionary force was massacred just hours after having disembarked. Castro feared a possible attack from the Dominican Republic and was determined to acquire jet aircraft as a preventive measure: Cuba's ability to repel an air attack was very precarious, since the Dominicans possessed 40 jet aircraft whereas Cuba had only one. The Dominican Air Force had the theoretical ability to reach and bomb Havana within 3 hours. =Escambray rebellion= Militant anti-Castro groups, funded by exiles, by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and by Rafael Trujillo's Dominican government, carried out armed attacks and set up guerrilla bases in the Escambray Mountains. This led to a failed rebellion, which lasted longer and involved more soldiers than the Cuban Revolution. Near 1,000 families were forcibly uprooted from the Escambray countryside, leaving the rebels without their habitat to support them; the uprooted men were sent to prisons and forced labor camps throughout Cuba. =Bay of Pigs Invasion= The Bay of Pigs Invasion (known as La Batalla de Gir√≥n in Cuba), was an unsuccessful attempt by a U.S.-trained force of Cuban exiles to invade southern Cuba with support from U.S. armed forces to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro. The plan was launched in April 1961, less than three months after John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency in the United States. The Cuban armed forces, trained and equipped by Eastern Bloc nations, defeated the exile combatants in three days. Bad Cuban-American relations were exacerbated the following year by the Cuban Missile Crisis. =Cuban Missile Crisis= A reconnaissance photo of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles with their maintenance equipment. Their disco acted as a catalyst for the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Cuban Missile Crisis (October Crisis in Cuba) was a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union over nuclear missiles that were deployed in Cuba and Turkey. The Russian missiles were placed both to protect Cuba from further attacks by the United States after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, and in response to the U.S. deploying Thor missiles with nuclear warheads on the Soviet border in Turkey. The situation reached the crisis point when U.S. reconnaissance imagery revealed Soviet nuclear missile installations on the island, and ended fourteen days later when the Americans and Soviets each agreed to dismantle their installations, and the Americans agreed not to invade Cuba again. =Congo Crisis= The Congo Crisis was a period of turmoil in the Congo that began with national independence from Belgium and ended with the seizing of power by Joseph Mobutu. During the Congo Crisis, a Cuban expedition led by Che Guevara trained the Simba rebels to fight against the weak central government of Joseph Kasa-Vubu and the forces of Mobutu Sese Seko. This would be Cuba's first military action in Africa. The rebellion failed, leading the Cuban mission to withdraw. =Sand War= In 1963, Cuba assisted Algeria in the Sand War against Morocco. Cuba sent 300‚Äì400 tank troops and some 40 Russian-built T-34 tanks, which engaged in combat. =Guinea-Bissau War of Independence= Some 40‚Äì50 Cubans fought against Portugal in Guinea-Bissau each year from 1966 until independence in 1974; several Cubans were killed in the field by Portuguese troops. =Bolivia Insurgency= Guevara shortly before his death in Bolivia. During the 1960s, Cuba began to support a Communist insurgency in the country. During the 1960s, the National Liberation Army began a Communist insurgency in Bolivia. The National Liberation Army was established and funded by Cuba and led by Che Guevara. The National Liberation Army was defeated and Che Guevara was captured by the Bolivia government aided by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Bolivian Special Forces were informed of the location of Guevara's guerrilla encampment. On 8 October 1967, the encampment was encircled, and Guevara was captured and later executed by Bolivian forces. =Eritrean War= Cubans trained Eritreans but later, in a political reversal, trained Ethiopian Marxist forces who were fighting against Eritreans. =Yom Kippur War= The Yom Kippur War (1973) was the fifth major conflict between Israel and the neighboring Arab States. Cuba deployed 1,500 troops, including tank and helicopter crews, to support the Arabs during the war. Precise Cuban casualty numbers are unknown.Perez, Cuba, Between Reform and Revolution, p. 377-379 =Cuban intervention in Angola= A Cuban-manned, Soviet-made PT-76 tank in Luanda, 1976 Between 1975 and 1991, the Cuban military provided support for the left wing MPLA movement in a series of civil wars. During these conflicts the MPLA emerged victorious due in part to the substantial aid received from Cuba. The Angolan War of Independence was a struggle for control of Angola between guerilla movements and Portuguese colonial authority. Cuba supplied the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) rebels with weapons and soldiers to fight. The Cuban military would fight alongside the MPLA in major battles. The Angolan Civil War was a 27-year civil war that devastated Angola following the end of Portuguese colonial rule in 1974. The conflict was fought by the MPLA against UNITA and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). MPLA was aided by Cuba and the Soviet Union, and UNITA and FNLA were supported by South Africa, United States and Zaire. It became Africa's longest running conflict. Cuban forces were instrumental in the defeat of South African and Zairian troops. Cuban forces also defeated the FNLA and UNITA armies in conventional warfare and established MPLA control over most of Angola. Comrade Jonas Savimbi, the President of UNITA, writing from the party's mobile headquarters inside Angola on 1 October 1976, stated: Throughout the months of July, August and September, 1976, the Provinces of Huambo, Bie, and Moxico along the Benguela railway, and Huila, Cunene and Cuando-Cubango on the southern border came under repeated ground and air raids by large contingents of Cuban troops supported by Soviet tanks and MiG fighters; hundreds of villages were destroyed. There were also incidents of Cuban troops bursting into churches and forcing congregation members to bow and worship before Soviet assault rifles. Angola paid a huge cost for the conflict: 800,000 dead, 4 million displaced, a rural infrastructure and economy virtually destroyed, the majority of the population impoverished, almost two million facing a famine, and human rights abuses becoming the norm. The horrific scenario includes war crimes, such as deliberately attacking civilians and use of chemical weapons by Cuba against UNITA troops and civilians supporting them. Hundreds of thousands of anti-personnel mines were laid across the country and are still in place, causing thousands of deaths and mutilating 70,000 people. =South African Border War= Location of Cuba (red), Angola (green), and South Africa (blue). Namibia is also in blue, but demarcated from the rest of South Africa, as it had been under South African control since 1915, and South African forces used Namibia as a base to enter Angola. The so-called South African Border War was a conflict that took place in South-West Africa (today the independent nation of Namibia) between the Apartheid-era South African Defence Forces and its allied National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) against the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and the Cuban-backed MPLA. The Cuban army had a major involvement in some of the most important battles, including the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale (1987‚Äì88). Approximately 200,000 people died during the South African Border War, the majority civilians killed within Angola after 1975. Portuguese troops suffered 3,000‚Äì5,000 dead, mostly due to mines, ambushes and accidents. Cuba sustained an estimated 2,000 dead as well as three to four times that number wounded or missing. Regular South African forces may have suffered only 1,000 dead, excluding losses among paramilitary units and other irregular formations. 11,335 SWAPO guerrillas were killed in action. =Ogaden War= The Ogaden War was a conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia between 1977 and 1978. Fighting erupted in the Ogaden region as Somalia attempted to annex it. When the Soviet Union began to support the Ethiopian Derg government instead of the Somali government, other Communist nations followed. In late 1977, the Cuban military deployed 16,000 combat troops along with aircraft to support the Derg government and the USSR military advisors in the region. By March 1978, following months of tank warfare, a combined force of Ethiopian and Cuban troops (led by Russian and Cuban officers) repulsed the enemy. The Somali army, which had taken a severe beating from Cuban artillery and air attacks, was destroyed as a fighting force. Cuban losses were 160 killed, 11 tanks and 3 planes. =Invasion of Grenada= A war memorial to commemorate Cubans killed during the United States invasion of Grenada. A 748-person count of Cuban workers (all but 43 of whom were construction workers) was present in Grenada at the time of the invasion of Grenada by the U.S. in 1983. Cuba was involved in the construction of a civil airport in Saint John, Grenada. Cuban losses during the conflict were 24 killed (only 2 of whom were professional soldiers), 59 wounded, and 606 made prisoners (later repatriated to Cuba). In 2008, the Government of Grenada announced the construction of a monument to honor the Cubans killed during the invasion by Genelle Figuroa. At the time of the announcement the Cuban and Grenadian government are still seeking to locate a suitable site for the monument. =Salvadoran Civil War= The Salvadoran Civil War was fought by the El Salvador government waging a vicious crackdown against various left- wing rebels, as well as committing war crimes against civilians, one example of which being the El Mozote massacre. Cuba supplied the rebels with weapons and advisors. =Nicaraguan Civil War= During the Sandinista revolution and the following Civil War, Cuba gave aid and support to the Sandinista government of Daniel Ortega. The Sandinista government was fighting the American backed rebels (aka) Contras. The conflict ended with the 1990 presidential election where Ortega lost to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.

Accessed Dec.29, 2013.  Biography  Having graduated from the Gymnasium Dionysianum in Rheine in 1965 (which provided him with a solid foundation in Classical Latin and Greek), Wolfgang Kubin studied Protestant theology at the University of M√ºnster from 1966 until 1968. In 1968, he studied Japanology and Classical Chinese at the University of Vienna and from 1969 until 1973, sinology, philosophy, and German literature at the Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. He also engage dagain in Japanese studies during these years. His doctoral dissertation focused on the lyrical works of the Tang dynasty poet Du Mu (803‚Äì852).Wolfgang Kubin, Das lyrische Werk des Du Mu (803‚Äì852), Versuch einer Deutung, Ph.D. thesis. Kubin lectured at the Institute of East Asian Studies of the Free University of Berlin since 1977.See the portrait of Kubin, ‚ÄúEin Star in China‚Äù (A star in China), in: Die Tageszeitung (Berlin), October 15, 2009. Also online: http://www.buchmesse.taz.de/!42318/ He taught 20th century Chinese literature and art, and completed his postdoctoral thesis on the evolution of the concept of nature in Classical Chinese literature.In 1985, Irene Eber noted the conspicuous absence of interest of German sinologists in modern Chinese literature during the 1950s, '60s, and much of the '70s whereas ‚Äú[i]n recent years, there has been a growing interest in both translation and critical analysis, for which Wolfgang Kubin must take the major credit.‚Äù Irene Eber, ‚ÄúThe Reception of Lu Xun in Europe and America: The Politics of Popularization and Scholarship,‚Äù in: Leo Ou-fan Lee (ed.), Lu Xun and His Legacy. Berkeley (University of California Press) 1985, p.246f.- . On October 1, 1985 Kubin became Professor of Chinese (Professor f√ºr Chinesisch (C3)) at the Institute for Oriental and Asian Studies at the University of Bonn; in 1989 he became Professor of Modern Sinology and in August 1995 he succeeded Rolf Trauzettel as Professor of Classical Sinology in Bonn.See: http://www.ostasien-verlag.de/autoren/kubin.html. Wolfgang Kubin became widely known among the general public as a translator of modern Chinese poetry and prose. His best known work is the translation of short stories and essays by Lu Xun.See: Lu Xun. Die Methode, wilde Tiere abzurichten. Erz√§hlungen, Essays, Gedichte. Selected, translated and with an introduction by Wolfgang Kubin. Berlin (Oberbaumverlag) 1979; 2nd edition 1981. . - Concentrating briefly on the story 'Remembrance of the Past' while reporting on the reception of Lu Xun by Western and East Bloc scholars, Irene Eber writes that two Western sinologists, ‚ÄúWilliam Lyell and Wolfgang Kubin [...] paid attention to this story.‚Äù She says that ‚ÄúLyell considers the content more important than the form‚Äù whereas ‚ÄúKubin‚Äù chooses an approach comparable to that of Pr≈Ø≈°ek when he is ‚Äúdirecting attention to traditional subjective and lyrical elements‚Äù in the story and emphasizes ‚Äúthe relative unimportance of plot.‚Äù Still, Kubin does not fail to ‚Äúpoint out Lu Xun's method of juxtaposing contrasting elements: master and servant, the plantain tree and the study‚Äù etc., thus drawing the attention of the reader to a (binary?) structure that reflects contradictions in Chinese society. Irene Eber, ‚ÄúThe Reception of Lu Xun in Europe and America: The Politics of Popularization and Scholarship,‚Äù in: Leo Ou-fan Lee (ed.), Lu Xun and His Legacy. Berkeley (University of California Press) 1985, p.267.- . His History of Chinese Literature in the 20th Century (published in German as Geschichte der chinesischen Literatur im 20. Jahrhundert) is considered as indispensable and a Classic.  Recent media attention In November 2006, Wolfgang Kubin made headlines when he commented on fairly recently published Chinese literature during an interview he gave to the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. He denounced several works in harsh terms, referring to Wei Hui's Shanghai Baby as \\"garbage\\" and Jiang Rong's Wolf Totem as \\"fascist\\". Kubin has expressed his admiration for Lu Xun, and he has said that no contemporary author could compare to him.S. Veg wrote that ‚Äúrecently discussion of the value of Chinese literature was rekindled by an interview with German sinologist Wolfgang Kubin for the Chinese-language service of German broadcaster Deutsche Welle in the fall of 2006, in which Kubin criticised ‚Äì in no uncertain terms ‚Äì excessive Western interest in contemporary Chinese fiction (in particular what he described as commercial fiction such as works by Wei Hui and Mian Mian), to the detriment of other genres such as contemporary poetry and Republican fiction.‚Äù Veg noted ‚Äú[t]he huge impact that this rather brief interview [...] sparked in China [‚Ä¶].‚Äù Sebastian Veg, ‚ÄúEditorial,‚Äù in: China Perspectives, No.2/2010, pp.3ff. - Also online: http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/5265?file=1.

It is somewhat similar, but smaller than the short-toed larks. Taxonomy and systematics The sand lark was originally assigned to the genus Alauda. It was later placed in the genus Calandrella until it was moved back to Alaudala in 2014 although not all authorities have recognized this change yet. The alternate name Asian short- toed lark is usually used to refer to the species of the same name, Alaudala cheleensis. Other alternate names include Ganges sand lark, Indian sand lark and Indian short-toed lark. = Subspecies = Three subspecies are recognized: * Indus sand lark (A. r. adamsi) - (Hume, 1871): Found in southeastern Iran, Pakistan, eastern Afghanistan and northwestern India * A. r. raytal - (Blyth, 1845): Found from north-central India to southern Myanmar * A. r. krishnakumarsinhji - (Vaurie & Dharmakumarsinhji, 1954): Found in west-central India Description Sand Lark Juvenile at Durgapur Barrage, West BenagalThe sand lark is about long. There is considerable geographic variation and three subspecies are recognized. All subspecies are dull brownish grey with faintly streaked upperparts and appears distinctly short- tailed with a fine bill. The bill length varies geographically short and stubby in the western part and long and fine tipped in the eastern part of its range. Subspecies krishnakumarsinhji found around Bhavnagar in Gujarat is greyer above with broad dark streaks on the upper plumage and breast. The lores and supercilium are white as is the area under the eye and the entire underside. The whitish breast has fine streaks in the subspecies other than krishnakumarsinhji and the streaking on the upperparts is faint. The nominate subspecies is found across the Gangetic plains and extends into southern Burma. Subspecies adamsi of West Asia (Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan) and parts of northwest India is paler. The species name raytal is derived from the Hindi name of retal which is derived from r√©th, the word for sand. Distribution and habitat The species is found across the Gangetic plains, the sandy banks of the Indus, Brahmaputra, Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers. It is also found along the Narmada River but is much rarer there. It is found mainly on sandy islands along rivers and nearby fields. They also occur on coastal dunes and dry mud-flats. Behaviour and ecology The sand lark is usually found singly, in pairs or in small loose groups. They forage by making sudden zigzag spurts on the sandy banks near water, feeding on insects as well as seeds. The breeding season is February to May. The song is varied and consists of rattling and tinkling notes high in the air followed by a series of dry rattling and whistled notes while descending lower. The flight includes soaring followed by rapid wing flapping and pauses before parachuting down in a series of steps with glides while the wing and tail are held spread out. In the last stage of the descent it dives vertically before perching on a clod. They may also sing while perched on the ground, often with a slightly raised crest. Calls of other birds are also incorporated into the song. The usual call notes is a clear tinkling chissip. The nest is a deep cup placed on the ground in a patch of vegetation on the sand. The usual clutch consists of three greyish white eggs which are speckled in brown.

Influence of World War II The wartime travel restrictions that had forced Geelong into recess the previous two years were relaxed, and Geelong rejoined the competition. Premiership season In 1944, with Geelong competing again, the VFL competition once again consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus one substitute player, known as the 19th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and-away season of 18 rounds; and, as had been the case in 1926 and 1927, matches 12 to 18 were \\"irregular\\", with 12 to 17 being the \\"home-and-way reverse\\" of matches 1 to 6, and match 18 the \\"home-and-way reverse\\" of match 11. The determination of the 1944 season's fixtures were greatly complicated by the fact that, although the Western Oval and the Junction Oval were now available to the VFL, the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Lake Oval were still appropriated for military use and, because of this, Melbourne was sharing the Punt Road Oval with Richmond as its home ground, and South Melbourne was sharing the Junction Oval with St Kilda as its home ground. Once the 18 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1944 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the Page-McIntyre System. =Round 1= - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date -

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1944 VFL Premiership team was Fitzroy's last premiership, and its last Grand Final appearance. The club would fail to achieve either feat again before merging at the end of 1996. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Fred Fanning of Melbourne with 87 goals. * No Brownlow Medal was awarded in 1944. * Geelong took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1944. * The seconds premiership was won by . Fitzroy 11.12 (78) defeated 9.9 (63) in the Grand Final, played as a stand-alone match on Saturday 23 September at Victoria Park before a crowd of 7,500. Notable events * Geelong resumed its place in the VFL competition. Although the lifting of wartime rail and road transport restrictions removed one impediment to Geelong's immediate return to the VFL competition, as the club's committee had paid the ¬£100 annual affiliation fees to the VFL in 1942 and 1943 out of their own pockets in order to keep Geelong \\"in the game\\", the VFL claimed that Geelong Football Club owed the VFL ¬£1,000 and that it would not consider its application for readmission until the debt was repaid, which was raised amongst the committeemen and supporters. After an extended and heated meeting, with matters such as the extra costs to each of the other eleven teams associated with their travel to Geelong and Geelong's perceived lack of competitiveness due to its depleted playing list (the reality of this concern is attested by the fact that Geelong only won 7 of its 57 games in seasons 1944, 1945, and 1946) influencing the VFL delegates, a majority (but not a unanimous majority) of the delegates voted in favour of Geelong's readmission. * The late arrival of the train from Melbourne delayed the start of Geelong's first 1944 home match for more than an hour. * The VFA and the VFL actively discussed the prospects of merging the two competitions. There was groundswell support for a common set of rules and common control over the game, after the upheaval which had followed the Association legalising throwing the ball and ceasing to recognise the validity of VFL transfer clearances in 1938. However, the issues of representation at board level, Australian National Football Council representation, and a promotion and relegation structure between the VFA and VFL meant that the talks eventually failed. * The Round 13 match between North Melbourne and Richmond is the only match in which a team has scored three goals fewer than its opponent, but scored enough behinds to win the match. In the same round, South Melbourne defeated Geelong by 22 behinds, the largest winning margin between teams which kicked the same number of goals. * Richmond won the minor premiership by the narrowest margin ever, after finishing level on premiership points with Fitzroy, but ahead on percentage by only 0.06%pts - in absolute terms, a single extra point at any time during the season could have changed the outcome. * Fourth place on the ladder was decided directly by the Round 18 match between Carlton and Footscray, who were placed fourth and fifth on the ladder at the start of the round. Scores were level when the final bell went ‚Äì a draw was enough for Carlton to make the finals ‚Äì but Footscray's Harry Hickey had a kick after the siren from 50m which only just travelled the distance, and went through off hands for the winning behind, which saw Footscray reach the finals. * Richmond's centreman Jack Broadstock was reported for having \\"kicked or intended to kick\\" Fitzroy's half-forward flanker Noel Price in the Second Semi-Final, and he was suspended for eight weeks. The Richmond First Eighteen were so incensed at Broadstock's suspension that they decided to forfeit the Preliminary Final against Essendon. It was only after Richmond President Harry Dyke told them that he would field the Second Eighteen rather than forfeit the match that the senior players agreed to play. * Fitzroy won its eighth (and last) premiership at the Junction Oval on a hot, blustery day in which many spectators walked long distances to and from the venue on account of a tram strike.

Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided an issue of Federal statutory hearing rights. Under section 204(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was allowed to make recoupments of erroneous overpayments of old age, survivors' or disability benefits by deducting from future payments. Section 204(b) allowed the Secretary to preclude the recoupment if the disability recipient was without fault and adjustments or recovery would \\"defeat the purposes\\" of the Act or \\"be against equity and good conscience.\\" Under the Department's procedures, after a recipient was notified of the ex parte determination that an overpayment had been made, the recipient could file a written request either seeking reconsideration of that determination or asking the Secretary to waive recovery in accordance with 204(b). The recoupment would start if the agency's decision on the request went against the recipient, and an oral hearing would be granted only if the recipient continued to object to recoupment. A number of beneficiaries challenged the Department's procedure under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution. In an opinion written by Justice Blackmun, the court held that because individual rights were at stake, the procedures did not satisfy the requirements of due process.  See also  * United States v.

The film was produced by actress C. Lakshmi Rajyam and her husband C. Sridhar Rao under the Rajyam Pictures banner. It featured N. T. Rama Rao, Savitri and S. V. Ranga Rao in the lead roles. Relangi, Mukkamala, Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy and Dandamudi Rajagopal play supporting roles among others. Susarla Dakshinamurthi composed the film's soundtrack and background score. M. A. Rahman and S. P. S. Veerappa served as the cinematographer and editor respectively. T. V. S. Sarma was the film's art director. Based on the Virata Parva of the Indian epic Mahabharata, Nartanasala focused on the trials of the Pandavas in the last year of their exile. The Pandavas assumed different identities and lived incognito in Virata Matsya Kingdom. The Kauravas wished to reveal the Pandavas' real identities so that they would repeat another exile of 13 years in a cyclic fashion. The issues faced by the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi at Matsya due to various factors, notably Virata's brother-in-law Kichaka form the rest of the story. The majority of Nartanasala portions were filmed in the sets erected at Vauhini and Bharani studios in Madras (now Chennai). Produced with a budget of 400,000, Nartanasala was released on 11 October 1963 in 26 centres. The film was a commercial success, completing a 100-day run in 19 centres and a 200-day run in two centres. It was also dubbed into Bengali and Odia languages. Nartanasala won the National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film and the Filmfare Award for Best Film ‚Äì Telugu. At the third Afro-Asian Film Festival held at Jakarta in 1964, Nartanasala received two awards: best male actor (Ranga Rao) and best art director (Sarma). For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, CNN-News18 included Nartanasala in its list of \\"The 100 greatest Indian films of all time\\".  Plot  The Pandavas complete 12 years of forest life as a part of their 13-year exile stipulation of a rigged dice game they were defeated in by the Kauravas. As per the rule, in the 13th year, the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi have to assume different identities and live incognito until the upcoming Vijayadashami. In case their real identity is unveiled, they have to repeat their 12-year exile again. That would give a chance to the Kauravas to prohibit the Pandavas from attacking and gaining the reigns of the Kuru Kingdom for a longer period, and possibly forever. The Pandavas choose the Matsya Kingdom ruled by Virata, a kind hearted but weak spirited king. They hope to find employment in the king's palace. Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, recollects a curse which could help him stay incognito for one year. In the past, Arjuna was felicitated by Indra, the king of deities for gaining the divine weapon, Pashupatastra, from Lord Shiva through dedicated devotion. The celestial dancer Urvashi falls in love with Arjuna, but he rejects her advances as he considered her a motherly figure. Feeling insulted, Urvashi cursed him to lose his masculinity and turn into an eunuch. Indra arrived and asked Arjuna to treat this curse as a blessing in disguise as the 13th year is arriving. Taking this into account, Arjuna turns into a transgender dance teacher Brihannala. The remaining assume different identities based on their strengthsYudhishthira as the advisor and dice player Kankubhattu, Bhima as the cook Valala, Nakula as horse groomsman Damagranthi, Sahadeva as cowherd Tantripala. Draupadi meets Virata's wife Sudeshna at a temple. She introduces herself as Sairandhri, an ill-fated woman married to five Gandharvas and requests a job in her palace. Sudeshna agrees and promises that Sairandhri would never be used to perform unethical tasks and jobs. The Pandavas too join Virata's palace in these disguised forms and perform various duties. The Kauravas are in search of the Pandavas and their cousin Krishna learns about this. Arjuna's son Abhimanyu wishes to convey the same to the Pandavas and Krishna reluctantly agrees. Before sending him to Matsya, Krishna warns Abhimanyu not to reveal his real identity. Abhimanyu falls in love with Virata's daughter Uttaraa but does not reveal any details of his. Brihannala, who teaches dance to Uttaraa, learns this and is happy. Uttaraa's brother Uttara Kumara too, wishes to see their alliance turn into a reality and waits for the opportunity. Sudeshna's brother and Matsya's chief army commander Kichaka returns victorious from a conquest. Kichaka sees Sairandhri and is mesmerised with her beauty. He warns Sudeshna of dire consequences if Sairandhri does not willingly submit herself for unison. As Kichaka is the supreme power of Matsya, Virata and Sudeshna do not dare to oppose. Sairandhri warns and pleads to Kichaka several times, which bear no result. One night, Valala disguises himself as a woman and waits in the dance hall. Believing the woman to be Sairandhri, Kichaka enters the hall and is killed by Valala. Valala also kills Kichaka's hundred brothers who attempt to kill Sairandhri by making her perform Sati with Kichaka's corpse. The Kaurava's learn about Kichaka's death due to a woman married to five Gandharvas in mysterious circumstances. They suspect that the Pandavas are hidden in Matsya and launch an attack on the kingdom's cattle. With all the soldiers engaged in war with Kauravas' allies, Virata's palace is almost empty. When Kauravas attack the remaining cattle, Uttara Kumara swears to fight against them. However, after watching their military troops, Uttara Kumara loses his confidence. Brihannala, who is his charioteer, volunteers to fight if Uttara Kumara handles the chariot, to which Uttara Kumara agrees. Before the war, Brihannala asks the chariot to be directed to a shami tree (prosopis cineraria) where the Pandavas' divine weapons are hidden. The 13th year ends on that day and Brihannala regains his form of Arjuna. On realising who Brihannala is, Uttara Kumara is happy to serve him. Arjuna then uses the Sammohanastra weapon, which puts the Kaurava army to sleep. The cattle are rescued and the Pandavas declare that their 13-year exile has been successfully completed. Krishna visits Matsya and the marriage of Uttaraa with Abhimanyu is finalised.  Cast  *N. T. Rama Rao as Arjuna and Brihannala *Savitri as Draupadi and Sairandhri *S. V.

Sridhar Rao under the banner Rajyam Pictures. The film's story was based on Virata Parva, one of the eighteen books of the Indian epic Mahabharata. Rajyam and Rao felt that barring Keechaka Vadham (19161918) and Vijayadasami (1937), no other Indian film dared to explore Virata Parva and found it a unique premise. Also, the belief that reading Virata Parva in Telugu-speaking lands would result in heavy rainfalls made the subject a culturally significant one. Samudrala Raghavacharya wrote Nartanasala script and Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Nartanasala was Kameswara Rao's first mythological film. Susarla Dakshinamurthi composed the film's music; M. A. Rahman and S. P. S. Veerappa served as the cinematographer and editor, respectively. T. V. S. Sarma was the film's art director. Raavi Kondala Rao, one of the assistant directors, wrote the dialogue for the comedy portions on Kameswara Rao's insistence. He also added the character of Vaalatulya (played by Allu Ramalingaiah), which was absent in the original script. Though Kameswara Rao offered to credit Kondala Rao as the first assistant director, the makers altogether left his name out later. = Casting = Rajyam and Rao approached N. T. Rama Rao to play Arjuna role in the film. Rama Rao was happy to play Arjuna, but was hesitant to take up Brihannala part; he felt that even a slight misstep would result in rejection by the audience. Rajyam assured that Sarma's sketches would help Rama Rao look authentic. Sarma designed the look based on eunuch's statues in major temples and opted for Keralite hairstyles. Bengali makeup artist Haripada Chandra was signed to work on Rama Rao's work. After getting approval from his mentor K. V. Reddy on Brihannala's look, Rama Rao agreed to be a part of the film's cast. Savitri and S. V. Ranga Rao were signed to play the other key roles of Draupadi and Kichaka respectively. Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy, Dhulipala Seetarama Sastry, Mukkamala and Relangi played supporting roles. Wrestlers Dandamudi Rajagopal and Nellore Kantharao were signed to play Bhima and Jeemutha Mallu respectively. Kanta Rao made a brief appearance as Krishna and Rajyam played his sister Subhadra. Sobhan Babu and L. Vijayalakshmi were paired to play the couple Abhimanyu and Uttaraa. This was Sobhan Babu's first of two films where he portrayed the character of Abhimanyu, the other being Veerabhimanyu (1965). On Rajyam's insistence, actress Kanchanamala made a cameo appearance. She shared the screen with Suryakantham in the film. It was Kanchanamala's last on-screen appearance. = Filming = The majority of Nartanasala portions were filmed in the sets erected at Vauhini and Bharani studios in Madras (now Chennai). All the musical instruments used in the film were borrowed from the Madras Sangeetha Vidyalaya. The war sequences in the climax portion were filmed at Gudur, a town in Andhra Pradesh; two cameras were simultaneously used to film the scenes. For the Gograhana (retrieving the kidnapped cows) episode, five thousand animals were brought with the help of Gogineni Venkateswara Rao. Nartanasala was produced on a budget of 400,000 with a runtime of 174 minutes. When Raghavacharya fell ill, his son Samudrala Ramanujacharya (popularly known as Samudrala Jr.), wrote the monologue \\"Sandhaana Samayamidi Inkanu Sairandhri Raalede ...\\" (It is time for unison and Sairandhri hasn't turned up yet ...) for Ranga Rao. Since Brihannala was a dance teacher and Vijayalakshmi, who played Uttaraa, was a trained classical dancer, Rama Rao took two-hour long daily lessons from the film's choreographer Vempati Pedha Satyam for a month. Satyam also held a three-day rehearsals for Sobhan Babu with Vijayalakshmi to help him overcome his nervousness. For the scene where Sairandhri was tied to a pole and dragged on a cart, Kameswara Rao employed a body double. When the intended artist did not turn up, another was employed and the scene was filmed. This made Kameswara Rao remark, \\"so now we have a dupe for a dupe \\".  Music  Susarla Dakshinamurthi composed the film's soundtrack and background score. Nartanasala soundtrack, marketed by Saregama, consists of 21 tracks including songs, poems, and collection of selected dialogue from the film. Out of 21 songs produced, only nine are used in the film. Raghavacharya and Sri Sri penned the lyrics for the songs. P. V. Koteswara Rao of Bharani Studios worked on the re-recording and songs. RCA and Western Electric sound systems were used for the same. The song \\"Salalitha Raaga Sudharasa\\" is based on the Kalyani raga of the carnatic music. The makers were initially reluctant with the song's classic nature and insisted to change it. When Dakshinamurthi and Raghavacharya completed work on a new version, Kondala Rao and Satyam requested the makers to retain the previous version. Due to the unavailability of singers Ghantasala and S. Janaki, Dakshinamurthi chose musician M. Balamuralikrishna and Bangalore Latha to provide the vocals. The song \\"Jaya Gana Nayaka\\" is a ragamalika composition and is based on three ragasGambhiranata, Todi, and Punnagavarali. Nartanasala is one of Dakshinamurthi's critically acclaimed works in Telugu cinema. M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu noted that Dakshinamurthi's \\"melodious\\" background score contributed largely to the film's success. \\"Salalitha Raaga Sudharasa\\" gained the status of a chartbuster, while \\"Janani Siva Kamini\\" gained recognition as a prayer song. Other successful songs of Nartanasala were \\"Dariki Raboku\\", \\"Sakhiya Vivarinchave\\", \\"Evarikosam Ee Mandahasam\\", and \\"Naravara O Kuruvara\\".  Release and reception  Nartanasala was released on 11 October 1963 in 26 centres. Navayuga Films acquired the film's distribution rights. Katragadda Narsaiah of Navayuga worked on the film's posters and publicity. The film was commercially successful, managing to have a theatrical run of 100 days in 19 centres and 200 days in Hyderabad and Vijayawada. According to The Hindu, Nartanasala complete theatrical run lasted for 25 weeks. The film's Bengali and Odia dubbed versions were commercially successful on par with the original. Nartanasala was adjudged the second best feature film at the 11th National Film Awards. It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film ‚Äì Telugu. At the 3rd Afro-Asian Film Festival held at Jakarta in 1964, Nartanasala received two awards: best male actor (Ranga Rao) and best art director (Sarma). In its 87th volume released in 1966, the now-defunct magazine The Illustrated Weekly of India noted Kanchanamala's cameo appearance, stating, \\"her delivery was as flawless as in bygone days and the years had not robbed her of charm\\". Reviewing Nartanasala, the University of Iowa stated that the film \\"unfolds in near-operatic style reminiscent of many genres of Indian folk theatre\\". Rama Rao's performance as Brihannala was praised: \\"Rao manages the transition well, swishing about in glittery drag and affecting exaggeratedly feminine mannerisms\\". The reviewer also found Kanta Rao's portrayal of Krishna \\"suitably charming, with an enigmatic style\\". M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu noted that the film provided one of the most fulfilling performances for Savitri as Sairandhri. On its 45th anniversary, Telugu newspaper Sakshi praised the performances of Rama Rao and Ranga Rao as Brihannala and Keechaka respectively; the newspaper termed the former a \\"strange adventure\\" considering the actor's stardom.  Legacy  Nartanasala success inspired filmmakers to explore the theme of a protagonist with a dark past living with a different identity in a place alien to him. The film's success also earned recognition to Padmini Priyadarshini (who played Urvashi in the film) as a dancer in South Indian cinema. In May 2012, Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com mentioned Nartanasala for the letter N in her list, \\"The A to Z of Telugu Cinema\\". In November 2012, The Times of India listed Nartanasala along with other unrelated films such as Missamma (1955), Mayabazar (1957), Gundamma Katha (1962), and Bommarillu (2006) in the list \\"Telugu classics to watch along with family this Deepavali\\". The commentator for The Times praised the songs, the overall treatment and Ranga Rao's portrayal of Kichaka. For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, CNN-News18 included Nartanasala in its list of \\"The 100 greatest Indian films of all time\\". In the Telugu film Bhale Manchi Roju (2015), the old theatre from where the villain (played by P. Sai Kumar) operates is named Nartanasala after this film.  Cancelled remake  Rama Rao's son and actor Nandamuri Balakrishna announced Nartanasala remake in 2004. Apart from directing the remake, Balakrishna played a dual role in the remakethose of Arjuna and Kichaka. Soundarya was signed to play Draupadi with Srihari, Sarath Babu, Uday Kiran and Asin cast in supporting roles. The remake's principal photography commenced on 1 March 2004. The remake was shelved later due to the death of Soundarya in an accident. In an interview with The Times of India in August 2014, Balakrishna said that he could not imagine anyone other than Soundarya for the character and after her death, he called off the film with no intention to revive it.

Premiership season In 1945, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus one substitute player, known as the 19th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and- away season of 20 rounds; matches 12 to 20 were the \\"home-and-way reverse\\" of matches 1 to 9. The determination of the 1945 season's fixtures were greatly complicated by the fact that both the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Lake Oval were appropriated for military use and, because of this, Melbourne shared the Punt Road Oval with Richmond as their home ground, and South Melbourne shared the Junction Oval with St Kilda as their home ground. Once the 20 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1945 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the Page-McIntyre System. =Round 1= - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date -

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1945 VFL Premiership team was Carlton. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Fred Fanning of Melbourne with 67 goals. * No Brownlow Medal was awarded in 1945. * St Kilda took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1945. * The seconds premiership was won by . Footscray 9.16 (70) defeated 9.3 (57) in the Grand Final, played as a stand-alone match on Saturday 22 September at Victoria Park before a crowd of 6,000. Notable events * The home-and-away season was expanded to 20 rounds. * The VFL adopted the \\"downfield free kick\\" rule, such that if a player is fouled after disposing of the ball, the free kick is taken at the spot where the ball lands by the nearest team-mate, not at the spot of the foul. * changed its nickname from Seagulls to Panthers in the 1945 season, after a supporter had presented the club with an oil painting of a panther to be hung in the club rooms. The change never truly caught on, and fell out of common use relatively quickly. * South Melbourne's captain and Brownlow Medal winner Herbie Matthews and South Melbourne forward Keith Smith were dropped from the Round 13 match by their club for refusing to play in the positions they were directed to play in. * After its Round 14 loss to Essendon, Carlton won its next nine consecutive matches (including the Grand Final). * North Melbourne made the finals for the first time since entering the VFL in 1925. Of the three clubs to enter the league in 1925, only Hawthorn had not yet made the Finals, and would not do so until 1957. * The 1945 Second Semi-Final was South Melbourne's last-ever finals win as \\"South Melbourne\\". The club did not play finals again until 1970, and did not win another final until 1996, after it had moved to Sydney ‚Äì a fifty-one-year gap. * Carlton's 1945 premiership win was the first time since the Page-McIntyre System had been adopted in 1931 that a team from fourth place on the home-and-away ladder won the Grand Final. * The Grand Final was held at Princes Park for the last time. It has been held at the MCG every year since, except 1991. * The Grand Final, played in extremely wet, muddy conditions, is remembered as \\"the Bloodbath\\" for its overall continuous violence (on the field and amongst the fans), and its plethora of crude king hits and brawls (many of which were broken up with the assistance of team officials and the police). The Melbourne tabloid newspaper, The Truth, called it \\"the most repugnant spectacle League football has ever known\\", with ten players reported for a total of sixteen offences.
